Even as alcohol and other drug used declines. These numbers are really, really revealing. And I think, educators and parents across the country really need to take a hard look at that. Welcome back to \"Early start.\" I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: There have been some changes with those flavors going forward some maybe we will see numbers slowdown. I'm Dave Briggs. 4:31 Eastern Time on a Monday. We start in the nation's capital where we are less than five days until a partial government shutdown unless President Trump and Congress can reach a deal on funding for a border wall. The White House is demanding $5 billion for the wall, which, remember, Mexico was going to pay for it, Congressional Democrats, rejecting that request. The White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller, taking a hard line on \"Face the Nation\" echoing the president's demand.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN MILLER, SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: We will do whatever is necessary to build the border wall, to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration. This is a very -- if it comes to it, absolutely. This is a fundamental issue. At stake is a question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country. Whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: \"The New York Times\" reports that House Republicans leaders have a more immediate problem. Members, who are retiring or defeated in November, they just don't want to show up to vote anymore. Many have been skipping votes since the midterms and GOP leaders are unsure if they will ever return. Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, says the president just don't have the support to get billions for the wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER: President Trump should understand there are not the votes for the wall. In the House or the Senate, he is not going to get the wall in any form.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: If a partial shutdown happens at the end of the week, the consequences could ripple across the U.S. economy, but of course, nothing concentrates minds in Washington like a holiday. The President is scheduled to leave this week for his Christmas vacation in Florida, 16 days at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>ROMANS: A damning new report due this week, claiming Silicon Valley may have done the bare minimum to help the Senate Russia investigation. The Intelligence Committee commissioned a report from an online Intel Firm. The report claims social media companies could have done a better job providing data about Russian accounts that posed as Americans. \"The Washington Post\" has obtained a separate report prepared for the Intel Committee. That report finds the Russians used every major social media platform to influence voters to elect President Trump and work even harder to support him once he was in office.</p><p>BRIGGS: Meantime, President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani says his client may have been involved in conversations about Trump tower Moscow significantly later than previously known. The President's former personal attorney Michael Cohen had claimed those talks ended in January of 2016, before the primaries. Then when Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the project, he said talks in his latest, June. Now Giuliani said the talks could have gone on even longer through the whole campaign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did Donald Trump know that Michael Cohen was pursuing the Trump tower Moscow into the summer of 2016?</p><p>GUILIANI: According to the answer that he gave, it would have covered all the way up to November of 2016. He said he had conversations with him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: CNN reported last week, the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, is still interested in interviewing the President in person, but Giuliani is having none of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[04:35:03] GUILIANI: Good luck. Good luck. After what they did to Flynn and the way they trapped him into perjury and no sentence for him? 14 days for Papadopoulos, I did better on traffic violations than I did with Papadopoulos.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, when you say, good luck, no interview.</p><p>GUILIANI: They were joke. Over my dead body, but you know, I could be dead.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: For more CNN's Boris Sanchez, is at the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Dave and Christine, Rudy Giuliani in clean up mode this weekend after Michael Cohen was sentence to three years in prison and made some negative comments about the President in public. Giuliani, effectively trying to discredit Michael Cohen and put some distance between the president's former fixer and the White House, Giuliani insisting that the payments that were made to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal were not campaign contributions.</p><p>GUILIANI: It is not a crime. It is not a crime, George. Paying $130,000 to Stormy whatever and paying $100,000 to the other one is not a crime. If there is not a purpose, it is no longer a campaign contribution. It is just a personal purpose. Now think about this, supposed he tried to use his campaign funds to pay off Stormy Daniels that would be totally illegal, if it is not a campaign expense, it can't be campaign contributions.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Though, in the Southern District of New York, Michael Cohen pleads guilty to campaign finance violations for those specific payments. And so there is what Rudy Giuliani is saying and there is what is actually happening in court. We should point out that we may not have heard the last of Michael Cohen. Representative Elijah Cummings, the incoming chairman of the House Oversight Committee has said that he would like to invite Michael Cohen back to Capitol Hill to testify once more, Dave and Christine. (END VIDEO)</p><p>BRIGGS: OK. Boris, thank you for that. A new poll finds most Americans believe President Trump is lying about the Russia investigation. In the NBC Wall Street Journal poll, 62 percent now think that the President is not being honest about Russia, up six points from August.</p><p>And a new CNN good morning register poll has mixed news for the President, from the first in the nation caucus state. 2/3 of Iowa Republican voters say they would definitely vote to reelect Mr. Trump if the general election were held today. But the caucus is to pick the 2020 general election candidate. Only 2.3 of Republican say the state party should welcome challengers to the President.</p><p>ROMANS: The future of Obamacare once again up in the air, a Federal Judge in Texas, striking down the entire Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional. You may remember back in 2012, the Supreme Court did uphold the law declaring individual mandate at its core was a legal tax. But last year, Congress reduced that tax to zero and the judge's now decided zero tax means, zero individual mandates. Ad he argues about it, the whole law falls.</p><p>BRIGGS: Remember the affordable care act provides coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. The state's expand Medicaid for low income adults and allows young people to stay on their parent's policies until the age of 26. President Trump declared that the decision is a great ruling for our country, but even some Republicans are not sold. Maine Senator Susan Collins believes the ruling will be overturned on appeal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN SUSAN COLLINS, (D) MAINE: There's no reason why the individual mandate provision can't be struck down and keep all of the good provisions of the affordable care act.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: A group of states led by California vowing to appeal the decision and another Judge is considering a case brought by Maryland defending Obamacare. So we may get dueling rulings. The Texas judge's decision is not immediately affect coverage enrollment by the way for 2019 ended Saturday.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right, sources tells CNN, Arizona governor Dough Ducey is likely to pick Martha McSally to replace outgoing Senator John Kyl. Kyl plans to step down at the end of the year, moths after being appointed temporarily to fill the seat of the late John McCain. McSally lost her bid for Arizona's other Senate seat during the 2018 elections. Cindy McCain may hold the key here to whether McSally gets her husband sit. McCain had been upset with McSally for not speaking out against President Trump when he criticized her late husband, but Mrs. McCain and McSally (inaudible) Friday. Whoever Ducey picks will serve until 2020. At that time, there will be a special election to fill the remaining two years of Senator McCain's term. ROMANS: All right. A terrible two weeks for stock market investors. Trade war, a fight over government spending, Brexit chaos all making for wild swings in the stock market. And the results is basically down. The DOW dropped 497 points it is 2 percent to end a really bad week. The S&amp;P500 fell to the lowest level since early April. The NASDAQ lost 2.3 percent Friday. This is shaping up folks to be the second worst year for investors in a decade. Three problems, the economic growth in the U.S. The fight on that ongoing U.S.-China trade war, concerns about rising interest rates.</p><p>And, you know, Wall Street basically isn't listening to the president when he is tweeting about these breakthroughs with China, by the way. The president tweeted that a big and very comprehensive deal with China could happen rather soon, but that did not influence investors at all. He has been tweeting so much, you know, play by play, they are starting to ignore him, honestly.</p><p>[04:40:10] This week focuses shifts to the Federal Reserve. The center bank widely expected to hike interest rates on Wednesday. Usually at the end of the year, investors look forward to something called the Santa Claus rally, ho-ho- no, it does not look like this year is going to be one of those years. Only a handful of trading days left in the year.</p><p>BRIGGS: Wow. This is not the outlook you are looking for. The tax cuts were just a short-term sugar rush?</p><p>ROMANS: A year ago this week, the President signed those corporate tax cuts into law. And this was his signature legislative achievement. The DOW is down 3 percent since then.</p><p>BRIGGS: the trouble with using the Dow as your scorecard is when it flips against you.</p><p>All right ahead, new U.S. sanctions on North Korea could block the path to denuclearization forever. Strong new words overnight from Pyongyang. We will have a live report next.</p><p>[04:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRIGGS: North Korea lashing out over the U.S. decision to level sanctions against three of its senior most government officials. In an editorial over the weekend, Pyongyang warns the sanctions pressure could very well blocked the path to denuclearization forever. Will Ripley, live for us in Hong Kong with the latest. Will, you had been to North Korea more than a dozen times, how serious are these sanctions, were they meant to send a message?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The sanctions, Dave, will not have a significant of an impact. They are much more symbolic, because they are targeting three officials who stand next to Kim Jong-un on stage. I have seen these men in Pyongyang at events with Kim Jong-un, naming them is essentially shaming them especially over an issue like human rights that North Korea calls nonexistent despite reports from the U.N. thousands of people in prison in labor camps and punished from expressing views that may differ from those of the government of the ruling workers party of Korea.</p><p>But it is the sanctions pressure that the U.S. continues to put on Kim Jong-un's regime that is really angering to the North Koreans and surprising to them, because they thought since things seem to go so well in Singapore. President Trump, Kim Jong-un had a friendly rapport. They thought the U.S. would start easing sanctions by now. Of course, the U.S. often North Korea would start giving up its nuclear weapons by now. Neither side is getting what they want at the moment.</p><p>But what is striking about the messaging that is out there in state media over the weekend. They are caught saying that the sanctions issued could not only derail denuclearization talks, but could potentially bring back the really unforgettable times of just one year ago when North Korea was launching missiles on a regular basis and conducting nuclear test, and of course we all know how close we potentially came to the United States came potentially to military conflict with North Korea at that time.</p><p>Nobody wants to see a return to that, certainly not the North Koreans and what I think is why their messaging is increasing in strength, hoping that the United States will change his position and give them some of the economic relief that they want, but of course the U.S. is sad. They are not going to do that unless North Korea's transparent about the weapons it possesses and starts to take real steps to get rid of them, Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: Of course Trump administration hasn't ruled out a second Summit in early 2019 with Kim and Trump. Interesting times, Will Ripley, live for us in Hong Kong. Thanks.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, now to a CNN exclusive. Two weeks after the Israeli army got operation Northern Shield off the ground along the border with Lebanon, CNN's is getting a firsthand look at this effort to uncover and disable tunnels built by Hezbollah. There are fears these underground passageways could be used on attacks against civilians. CNN is the first broadcaster anywhere to go inside and our Ina lee is live in Jerusalem with this extraordinary access. Walk us through it.</p><p>IAN LEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Christine, we were taken by the Israeli military literally right next to the border with Lebanon and that's where we saw this huge hole in the ground where Israel had been drilling and we dropped our camera down tens of yards deep underground past thick solid limestone to expose this tunnel. And Israel says they drove in that location, because they wanted to show how these tunnels originate in Lebanon and then cross into Israel. They also are drill down to them so that they are able to later neutralize them, but it wasn't really what they saw that tip them off to these tunnels, but rather what they heard. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>(DRILLING SOUND)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) LEE: And what you're hearing there is drilling through solid rock and Israel was able to hear that they other advanced technology that they say they're using to identify these tunnels so that they can neutralize him. They got about 75 miles of border to search. Well, what they want they say is action from the United Nations. Israel says that this violates U.N. Security Council resolution 1701 that ended the war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah.</p><p>They want action. The U.N. says that they know these tunnels exists, they had been to them, they are there going to take their investigation to the Security Council. It will be up to the Security Council to determine what to do next. Meanwhile, Israel's hunting for more tunnels.</p><p>ROMANS: Fascinating. Our Ian Lee, thank you so much for that access. Wow, all right, Johnsons and Johnson stock plunge Friday after a stunning report from Reuters that it knew about asbestos in baby powder for decades. Some remarkable journalism and a 10 percent declined, CNN Business next.</p><p>[04:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRIGGS: A new report shows vaping among America's teens climbing rapidly this year, a 50 percent in the last 30 days alone. The use of other substances like alcohol and opioids has declined in recent years. The report comes from the University of Michigan Institute for social research, which is vaping was the second most common substance use in 2018. Those numbers up sharply from last year, the director of the National Institute on drug abuse, which funded the reports as vigilance is needed, because vaping could lead teens to other drugs.</p><p>ROMANS: Colorado police now offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the location or safe return of missing woman, Kelsey Barreth. The money is being provided by an anonymous donor. There is -- a 29-year-old mother was last seen on Thanksgiving Day.</p><p>[04:55:03] Investigators are searching her fiance Patrick Phrases home and property. The police chief calls Barreth's disappearance suspicions. Phrases attorney says his client continue to cooperate with law enforcement.</p><p>BRIGGS: A Disney actor has been fired after police say he tried to meet a 13-year-old boy or sex. 48 year-old Stoney Westmoreland, has been drop from his recurring role on the Disney channel show Andy Mack. Court documents say Westmoreland used the dating app to chat with someone he thought was a 13-year-old boy. He said he sent the boy explicit pictures and try to arrange a meeting when Westmoreland arrived at the location. He was arrested. No word yet from Westmoreland or his attorney.</p><p>ROMANS: California has dropped plans to tax text messages, the state hope to act new monthly fees to increase funds for programs that bring connectivity to underserved residents, but the California public utilities commission says a recent FCC ruling prevents the state from imposing the tax. The ruling determines text messages are in information service, not a telecommunications service. The proposed tax faced strong opposition from industry trade groups would call that harmful to consumers.</p><p>BRIGGS: Expressions of love and support pouring in for Saturday Night Live cast member Pete Davidson. New York City police even conducted a wellness check on the comedian after he posted an alarming note on Instagram Saturday. That said, quote I really don't want to be on this earth anymore. The entire Instagram account was later deleted.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETE DAVIDSON, SNL CAST MEMBER: Once again, Mark Ronson and Miley Cyrus.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Relief for his fans when he made a brief appearance late on SNL this weekend. This has been a rough year for the 25-year-old comedian. He went through a painful breakup with the singer Arianna Grande in October then he had to apologize last month for mocking the appearance of Texas congressional candidate Dan Crenshaw, who lost his eye serving in Afghanistan. That is the top of the hour. Let us go check on CNN's business this morning. Global markets are mixed right now you can see Tokyo Shanghai both higher, but Hong Kong down and London and Paris and Frankfurt all closed lower. Friday's economic data released missed expectations from China and has really spread through the market here showing that the trade war is biting the Chinese economy.</p><p>On Wall Street right now, futures are higher after a terrible day Friday.

Only eight days remaining until a possible government shutdown. But get this, the House has adjourned and it isn't coming back into session until Wednesday. It's a mere two days before a shutdown could happen. Now that would mean the earliest that you could put the $5 billion border funding bill on the floor for a boat would be just over 48 hours away from a government shutdown. It's going to be close.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And new tonight, we are learning migrants are crossing parts of the border largely unimpeded. This is happening in parts of Arizona where the Colorado river to a trickle and the barriers for crossing consist of a mere concrete roadblock and railroad ties. National Border Patrol Council President, Brandon Judd is here on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And this also just in, the federal judge who will be handing down the sentencing for <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>National Security Advisor, General Michael Flynn, is ordering <person><nameText>Robert Mueller </nameText></person>to turn over the documents surrounding Flynn's questioning. This request following Flynn's allegations that the FBI pushed him not to have an attorney present when he was being questioned.</p><p>TRISH REGAN PRIMETIME begins right now.</p><p>Good evening, everybody, I'm David Asman in for Trish Regan tonight.</p><p>Our <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>reviving his campaign promise tonight that Mexico will pay for the border wall as the clock continues to tick toward a shutdown on Capitol Hill. The President tweeting out, \"I often stated, one way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the wall. This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico and Canada, the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly and anti-USA NAFTA deal that just by the money we save. Mexico is paying for the wall.\"</p><p>Now the President also calling out Democrats on the issue, take and watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The fact is, they always supported fences and walls and partitions. But you know what, they only don't want to do it because of me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: Republican leaders in the House meanwhile at a stand still tonight over a funding strategy that includes $5 billion for the promise border wall. And the clock is ticking with a shutdown just over a week away.</p><p>Joining me now is New York Congressman <person><nameText>Lee Zeldin.</nameText></person></p><p>Now Congressman, as I mention, the clock is ticking but you and your colleagues are out of town for five days. So how does this get resolve?</p><p><person><nameText>LEE ZELDIN (R</nameText></person>), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN: I don't want to say Congress works well on deadlines. But I will say Congress works better on deadlines. I don't expect that there would be resolution to this between now and the middle to end of next week. However, hopefully once we get into that last 24 to 48-hour window there is definitely a deal to be had. I'm really hoping that when we return next Wednesday that there is a deal to get pass in the House and the Senate to keep the government funded, open and also taking care of border security.</p><p>ASMAN: Now you said both the House and the Senate. Let's just deal with the first -- first thing first, you got to get the House together. Do are you convinced that some Republicans who were reluctant to pass a spending bill that had a lot of pork in it will go along to show their support for the President?</p><p>ZELDIN: So, back in September the House passed and it became law, a funding package, that included a lot of money into the billions for borders. Now -- so you know, when you start counting votes, I mean, the membership is there now. I can't speak for the beginning of January when the Democrats take control of the House. But the support is definitely there now.</p><p>I mean, we have to make sure everyone shows up. There are some members who retired, others who lost their election. Everyone needs to get to D.C. next week to make sure we have the votes. But I'm convince as long as everyone is there we definitely can pass it.</p><p>ASMAN: All right. Now Paul Ryan, of course, only has a few weeks left as Speaker of the House, can he cobble together something special, maybe a different kind of a short spending bill, if you will, something that includes the $5 billion wall in there?</p><p>ZELDIN: Absolutely. Yes, there is no doubt that the votes are there to pass this as long as we get all of our members to D.C. next week to get it done. This is a negotiation. The House won't be able to do it by ourselves.</p><p>So what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>meeting this week with Senator Schumer and Nancy Pelosi that's a really important piece of this because you don't have 60 Republicans in the Senate. So even if we're able to get to 218 votes in the House, we need to be passing something that actually is getting passed in the Senate as well. And that's where <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>comes in and, you know, Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer because we have to get the 60 votes.</p><p>ASMAN: But based on what we saw the other day which we were just looking a video of, I mean, how is it conceivable that Schumer and Pelosi, even if they were humiliated by what the President was saying in that meeting, how could they come together and convince their Senate colleagues to vote for something that would include the border wall?</p><p>ZELDIN: Well, to the clip you played, you know, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is correct. You have members of the House and the Senate who supported more funding for border security in the past.</p><p>ASMAN: Right.</p><p>ZELDIN: And now, their big problem with it is that it would be giving <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>a win. But there is a long history of these representatives in the House and the Senate of supporting this in the past.</p><p>So -- and I think that, you know, border security is not just about the people who will cross illegally, but for any senator out there who is on the fence, the Democratic senator who cares about the heroin and opioid abuse epidemic, if you want to combat human trafficking and sex trafficking, drug trafficking, you better be on board with that. If you want to combat gang violence caused by those who are illegally coming into our country, if you want to protect our border's international security and you care of all these other issues, you have to vote yes.</p><p>ASMAN: So, you know, I assume you're talking about people like Senator Joe Manchin. But there aren't a lot of folks like him on the Democratic side in the Senate, are there?</p><p>ZELDIN: There -- well, Senator Manchin is certainly -- you know, there is only one Joe Manchin over in the Senate for sure. And he is a candidate who you'd say would be likely -- more likely to do the right thing on this issue. You sure would hope.</p><p>But, you know, again, border security, you know, it's one of those issues. If you want to win in 2020, if senator Schumer, you know, who is the minority leader wants to become the majority leader, even if they are making a political decision for themselves, they should understand that the American public want this done.</p><p>ASMAN: right.</p><p>ZELDIN: This isn't a win for <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>This is a win for the United States of America. And that's why they should do it. And many of them represent red states that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>won.</p><p>ASMAN: Senator Schumer himself said it should be done years ago when Democrats were in control of the executive in Congress. I mean, that's the extraordinary thing. During that meeting, the other day in the Oval Office, the Democrats did not couple with one reason why you should not spend $5 billion, over two years by the way, it's not all in one year (ph), over two years for a border wall. There was not one clear explanation as to why it was a bad idea.</p><p>ZELDIN: Yes, absolutely right. And I think the point that they are willing to put a number out there that they will agree to, their understanding that there is a vulnerability with our border that needs to be addressed. So now we're just talking about jockeying and politics --</p><p>ASMAN: Right.</p><p>ZELDIN: -- and trying to prevent the President from getting a win. But their position isn't zero. And they're not explaining why their position is zero. They're actually acknowledging now, finally, once again that there needs to be an investment. Now we are talking about dollars.</p><p>And I think their main problem with $5 billion is because that's what the administration says we need.</p><p>ASMAN: Right.</p><p>ZELDIN: And they just don't want to give <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>the victory.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, national security is at risk. So I wish you well, Congressman. Thank you for being here. Congressman Zeldin, good to see you.</p><p>ZELDIN: Thank you.</p><p>ASMAN: Down at our southern border, meanwhile there are large numbers much migrants who are now crossing by simply wading through the knee-deep Colorado river along Arizona's border and walking into our country. The only thing stopping them from entering a little barb wire and concrete barriers, they're kind of similar to the ones you can see on highways.</p><p>Now this coming as we are learning that nearly 15,000 unaccompanied migrant children who illegally crossed the border are now being housed at government shelters.</p><p>Joining me now is National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd.</p><p>Brandon, this all comes as we're now learning tonight that some 1,700 U.S. troops are being isn't home from the border. How is that going to affect the situation?</p><p>BRANDON JUDD, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL PRESIDENT: Well, what we're looking at is the support that they gave us for the time they did give us. It allowed us to use our resources and build the infrastructure that we needed at that particular time. So we're in a much better place as we start to send the troops home.</p><p>But make no mistake, if we do not get the physical barriers in the places that we need it, we're going to continue to discuss this problem until the cows come home. And we have the opportunity right now to fix this issue once and for all. And I'm betting on <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>ASMAN: Let's talk about those children. Because you know, Democrats will use children for political purposes unless it goes against their purposes. The fact is there are 14,700 kids who came in unaccompanied by an adult whether it was their parents or somebody else who are now in shelters. These shelters I am told are literally bursting. What happens to them?</p><p>JUDD: So, you know, as -- one of the things that's so difficult is I put on a uniform and I go out and I patrol the border. When I take unaccompanied minors into custody it breaks my heart, it breaks our agent's heart because now we have become a humanitarian agency rather than a law enforcement agency.</p><p>But the parents of these children, what they're doing is they are forcing their children to cross the border illegally knowing that ultimately those children are going to be placed in health and human services hands and they're going to be placed in homes inside the United States. And they are using those children as pawns to try to then come over into the United States themselves.</p><p>ASMAN: You know, the organization, and of course the one that sticks out is pueblo sin fronteras, people without borders, that encourage migrants to come across. They must see some of these kids that are the unaccompanied. They must know what these children are going to go through, going into these shelters first of all and then put foster homes, going through months if not years of trial as a result being forced. Does it ever occur to them, do they have any conscience what they are leading these kids into?</p><p>JUDD: They don't. And it's sickening to me, knowing that they know that they are putting these children in the hands of dangerous criminal cartels. These smugglers that care nothing about these children, that abuse these children, that rape these children and at times they murder these children, yet it's -- these policies that Nancy Pelosi, that Chuck Schumer are advocating for that in fact allow these criminal cartels to continue exist, to continue to operate, to continue to make multi-billion dollars off the struggles and the human suffering of these children.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>JUDD: And that is -- it's wrong, it has to stop, and it's sickening.</p><p>ASMAN: And Brandon, bringing you back to the top here, do you have any doubt in your mind, very quickly, that if we had secure barriers, at least something more than barbed wire and concrete barriers that you can hop over, do you have any doubt that if the barriers existed, that we need, that a lot of these parents would not be sending their children unaccompanied to live that kind of existence that they are forced to live now?</p><p>JUDD: I have zero doubt. I patrolled the border. I patrolled the border in this area that we're talking about just right by Yuma. I know that when we have built physical barriers, it has dropped illegal immigration exponentially. And if we continue to build those barriers we will get control of the border.</p><p>ASMAN: Right. It happens all over the world, not just here in the U.S., but all over the world where the barriers exist, it keeps people out. Brandon, thank you very much for being here, appreciate it.</p><p>Coming up, an update to that bombshell story we told you about last time, Michael Flynn claiming the FBI urged him to answer questions without his lawyer present. And now the judge who will sentence General Flynn says Mueller's team has to submit all documents related to this matter by tomorrow. A live report from Washington coming next.</p><p>And one California Democrat says he wishes he could regulate speech. But it doesn't end there. Wait until you hear what specific network the liberal lawmaker wants to regulate. That answer straight ahead.</p><p>ASMAN: And new tonight, we are just hours away from the latest deadline pressing down on the Mueller probe. The judge overseeing the Flynn case is now demanding to see every single special council document related to the Flynn interviews. The judges order coming after a bomb shell filing from Flynn's legal team alleging that the three-star general was pushed by the FBI into foregoing a lawyer being present during the questioning.</p><p>For the latest, I want to go to our own Edward Lawrence for details. Hi, Edward.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey, David.</p><p>Yes, big deal. The federal judge demanding to see the government's documents and memoranda for the interview with former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn. Now those documents may show what Flynn's lawyer alleged that the former FBI Director James Comey sent Peter Strzok and Andrew McCabe into the White House without notifying White House counsel.</p><p>Then the now fired FBI agent pressured Flynn not have his attorney present for the interview. The President upset.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: They took a general that they said didn't lie, and they convince him, he did lie and they make some kind of a deal. And now they are recommending no time. You know why? Because they are embarrassed that they got caught.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: Now, Republicans in Congress say that they have been trying to see these interview documents and the Special Counsel refused to turn them over. Now Representative Andy Biggs from Arizona says the judge may reconsider the case entirely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDY BIGGS (R), ARIZONA CONGRESSMAN: They failed to inform him of his rights. Mr. Comey directed them to go there without notifying the White House. And so you have a whole problem that going on. And it would not surprise me the least if this gets tossed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: Now Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, the legal fees with this case forced him to sell his home. He'll be sentence or is expected to be sentenced on Tuesday.</p><p>David.</p><p>ASMAN: Wow, Edward, thank you very much.</p><p>And here with me now to tell us what all this could mean for Flynn's future, he's being sentenced next Tuesday, Fox News Legal Analyst, Mercedes Colwin, and former FBI Special Agent, John Iannarelli. Good to see you both.</p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Good to see you.</p><p>ASMAN: Mercedes, first to you, this judge, Emmet Sullivan, he -- apparently, he hasn't seen this kind of thing before.</p><p>COLWIN: Right.</p><p>ASMAN: Which surprises me because judges see a lot of stuff in their career.</p><p>COLWIN: Sure.</p><p>ASMAN: Does he believe this is entrapment? And if so, is it possible that Flynn's guilty plea could be reversed?</p><p>COLWIN: Well, it's a great question, because frankly, this is an extraordinary step by a judge, to ask for the document. You don't really see that very often. But obviously the judge believes that there is something to the defense arguments where they say that Flynn has been entrapped. That he was discouraged from having an attorney present. That he was not told the full breadth of what this meeting was actually about.</p><p>So those things are enough for this judge to say, \"I want to see those documents to make my own determination as to whether there's something inappropriate.\"</p><p>ASMAN: John, let's talk about what actually happened during this -- what some people are calling a setup, where the FBI came in, in a very informal manner into the White House. By their own notes, they said that the general was unguarded. I'm quoting here, \"jocular\". I mean he didn't -- I mean really didn't appeared to be an official conversation that was going to be on the record.</p><p>Rush Limbaugh talked about what it all means and what it kind of seem like earlier today. Let's play that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW HOST: In the Bush administration or Obama administration, if the FBI wanted to send agents into the White House, you would have to go through the White House counsel. There'd be discussions and approvals in who would be there. And I thought it's early enough, let's just send the couple guys over there. They're not going to know what's going on. And that's what they did.</p><p>They send a couple of FBI agents including one of the management types, McCabe, and he's strolling around the White House and runs into Flynn. \"Hey Mike, how you doing buddy,\" and they sit down and they start having a chat. Little does Flynn know, it's an official interview.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: Now, John, a lot of what Rush was saying comes from Jim Comey himself who was speaking in New York describing the way things unfolded. That's pretty unusual for the FBI, is it not?</p><p>JOHN IANNARELLI, FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT: It's absolutely unusual. When FBI agents do these interviews, and it happens all the time that we are doing interviews at workplaces et cetera. You sit down with two agents. That way, you can verify what the other person said.</p><p>You let them know that we'd like to interview you regarding these allegations. Essentially, the person being interviewed knows that they can get in trouble if they're not telling the truth.</p><p>ASMAN: Mercedes, the problem is, and this is something Andrew Napolitano's pointed out.</p><p>IANNARELLI: Right.</p><p>ASMAN: Is that the FBI, you can't lie to the FBI, but they can lie to you. So it's conceivable that the FBI was, you know, kind of joking with him.</p><p>IANNARELLI: Right.</p><p>ASMAN: As he said, he thought it was a jocular situation and kind of egging him on to make him believe that this was not an official investigation. That would be on the record, something that he could be prosecuted for.</p><p>COLWIN: And is absolutely appropriate. I mean when I represent a clients in those types of situation, I warn them. I said, \"Look if you -- you have not done anything wrong, but if you say the slightest miscommunication, if you have a miscommunication, if you say the slightest misrepresentation, that is in itself a crime.\" So even though we're coming in innocent, whatever you say during these interviews can be held against you and you could be held criminally liable.</p><p>ASMAN: And John --</p><p>COLWIN: And that's what happen in this case.</p><p>ASMAN: -- let's be obvious about this. This was a very special operation. This was an operation that was involved with that whole group of people from McCabe, Andy McCabe, Comey himself, of course, Peter Strzok, people who were determined to sink the incoming Trump administration.</p><p>IANNARELLI: If you are talking to somebody as important as Michael Flynn, it's planned. Nothing is happened since. There is thought put into the questions going to be asked and how you're going to approach him.</p><p>ASMAN: Is that factoring into what the judge is going to decide Mercedes?</p><p>COLWIN: Sure, I mean at this point he pled guilty already. So we're talking now in just about sentencing whether how lenient will this judge be with sentencing. We know that's being reported that the prosecutors are recommending probation. So I don't know how much more lenient the judge could possible be. My bet just be that probation is been served and then move on. And there will be at some sort of oversight.</p><p>But frankly, there's already been leniency at least being argued by the prosecution.</p><p>ASMAN: John, I have so many friends in the FBI. I don't want to tell you, who are almost in tears about what has happened to the agency. And here is another black eye. I mean just when we thought maybe we could get beyond it, we got rid of a lot of bad apples from the FBI, they're voluntarily or unvoluntarily. But here comes another one, I mean how does the FBI dig itself out of what it's got fallen into?</p><p>IANNARELLI: Thank God, the rank and file of the FBI represent exactly what you described with your friends. They're hard-working individuals. What you're seeing here is highly unusual. Many of these people have moved on. Under Director Wray, I think the FBI's reputation is certainly going to survive.</p><p>ASMAN: Let's hope so.</p><p>COLWIN: Yes.</p><p>ASMAN: Mercedes, John, good stuff. Thank you very much.</p><p>COLWIN: Great to be on.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, one California --</p><p>IANNARELLI: Thank you.</p><p>ASMAN: -- Democrat says, if he had his way he would regulate free speech. Oh, but not just any speech, just things he doesn't agree with, like things we say here in Fox. I'm not kidding folks.</p><p>Sorry Congressman, the First Amendment is here to stay and it is crystal clear about your role. And I'm quoting now from the constitution, \"Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.\" Get it, Congressman?</p><p>And speaking of the Constitution, one liberal website says it is time to get rid of the rule that prohibits anyone under the age of 35 from becoming President. The reason, of course so that this woman, the Democratic darling, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, can run for President in 2020. You can't make this stop off folks. More on the liberal lunacy coming next.</p><p>ASMAN: New reaction tonight after California Democrat, <person><nameText>Ted Lieu, </nameText></person>actually admitting he'd like to cut back on American's First Amendment right to free speech. But the Congressman also saying, he knows he's not aloud to do that. And you got to see this. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>TED LIEU </nameText></person>(D), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN: I would love to be able to regulate the content of speech. The First Amendment prevents me from doing so. And that simply a function of the First Amendment, but I think over a long run it's better that government does not regulate the content of speech.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: But he would love to be able to do that.</p><p>Joining me now is \"Next Revolution\" Host, Former Senior Advisor to U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, Steve Hilton.</p><p>You know, we used to have bragging right, Steve, in this country. We'd kind of sometimes, we point fingers, forgive me, at our British friends and say, \"Well you guys --</p><p>STEVE HILTON, \"THE NEXT REVOLUTION\" HOST: Of course.</p><p>ASMAN: -- don't have what we do. You know, we've got a amendment.\" Now there is this slow march. I never thought I would see a slow march to kind of get rid of the First Amendment, did you?</p><p>HILTON: It's absolutely unbelievable. And that <person><nameText>Ted Lieu </nameText></person>has done all us a favor actually because he just said out loud what we feel has been going on with the left. They have become increasingly sensorius, increasingly puritanical that you have to adhere to a certain set of beliefs and you can only say a certain set of words and phrases.</p><p>And what really makes me laugh about all of this is when you see how they are increasingly behaving. They are exhibiting all the characteristics that they go around lecturing <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and his supporters about. So they go around saying, <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>you know, and he's supporters in sort of bigotry and intolerant and hate filled and undermining Democratic norms. How often do we hear that?</p><p>Well it turns out, they're the people that are doing that. The left are the people who are intolerant. They are the bigots. They are the ones undermining Democratic norms.</p><p>ASMAN: You know, it all started and you and I have talked about it for years. It was -- it all started with the P.C. culture where if you said anything that violates the P.C. rules, the political correct rules of speech or thought, it's hate speech. And therefore, it's not protected by the First Amendment.</p><p>You know, it happened on college campuses. I -- you saw it in coaching more and more own our society. But I'm just wondering if right now they have gone too far. This is a bridge too far. It's going to wake up Americans to exactly how dangerous this whole thing is.</p><p>HILTON: But -- I want to say I'd like that to be the case, but I worried that it isn't because it's now -- it got so far into our culture. You see in businesses, now you see it in the corporate culture. You know everyone, I mean, around here -- I'm speaking to from Silicon Valley. And people -- this is a real quote that someone sent to me.</p><p>Someone who works, someone on the big tech companies who says it reminds him what it's like where you just can't go out, not just in the workplace, but even in social gatherings. You can't say this. You can't say that. It reminds him of Eastern Germany under the Communist with this Darci (ph) who are listening in --</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>HILTON: -- on everything you said and reporting it back.</p><p>ASMAN: That's right.</p><p>HILTON: It's frightening.</p><p>ASMAN: That's right. So what you're saying, and this is frightening. Is that the P.C. culture is going to combine with the tech culture to in -- as a means of enforcing what they are now saying in public forum. And that is a genuine concern.</p><p>But here again, I'm wondering if we caught it in time because we have caught on to the fact, one that you have things like Siri and Alexa listening to everything you say. And two, we're catching on to the fact that Google and the other companies involved with all this are very politically biased.</p><p>HILTON: Well, I hope that's the case. And we need to keep making these arguments so that we bring it to people's attention. The other thing I think is important is the generational aspect.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>HILTON: Because it seems to me that one of the things you see over the years is each generation tries to rebel against the habits and behaviors of the one that's just gone before. I think the generation that's coming on now is really infected with this virus, this political correctness and this closing down of speech virus. But the one that comes after perhaps they could maybe be our saviors and saying, this is gone too far. We cannot behave like this.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes, well.</p><p>HILTON: We cannot live like this.</p><p>ASMAN: I hope those younger ones grow up fast before it's too late.</p><p>Well, speaking of politicians who were facing criticism right now. Prime Minister Theresa May has survived her no confidence vote. But the problem of how to honor the Brexit vote remain. So Steve, how does it get resolved?</p><p>HILTON: Well, it's very difficult. I wish I could give you a clear and simple and positive answer because I campaigned for Brexit. I want to see it go through. Her deal, remember, doesn't actually deliver Brexit. That's why it's gone down like a lead balloon in the U.K. because nobody supports it.</p><p>Even the people who want Brexit look at it and say, \"This really just leaves us still inside the European Union and subject to European Union laws.\" And so, even though she survived her leadership vote within her own party, she does not have a majority in parliament for her agreement with the E.U. She hasn't got the votes to get it through.</p><p>She has just come back from the E.U. begging them for some kind of concession in order to be able to sell it to parliament. And they gave her absolutely nothing. They didn't budge at all.</p><p>ASMAN: It's humiliating.</p><p>HILTON: And so you're left with -- it's humiliating. And this -- and by the way, totally predictable because as I have been saying all along, the E.U. doesn't want to make this process a positive one for the U.K.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>HILTON: It wants to make -- send the message that if you dare leave the E.U., we're going to make it as unpleasant as possible. So I think the only real answer that is positive is to leave without any kind of agreement.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>HILTON: And prepare properly for that to counteract the short terms effects.</p><p>ASMAN: I --</p><p>HILTON: But there's no support for that either.</p><p>ASMAN: -- I think you are on to something very critical here which is that they needed to humiliate somebody like Theresa May who maybe doesn't have a sufficient backbone against their forces because they are afraid they are about to lose their mantel. They have this extraordinary --</p><p>HILTON: Yes.</p><p>ASMAN: -- machine, the European Union, by which all of their bureaucrats, their faceless bureaucrats are empowered over the rest of the people. A non-voting bureaucratic mass is given power and they're afraid they are going to lose it.</p><p>HILTON: That's exactly right because it's being challenged all over the place, all over Europe. I mean Italy is a great example --</p><p>ASMAN: And here by the way, and here is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILTON: -- to this government. Of course. And so, they try to cling on to power and they are trying to scare everyone by saying if you try and leave the E.U. without arranging it with us, it will be a chaos and disaster to the end of the world. Well, there's definitely going to be a bit of short-term disruption.</p><p>But the point I would make is it's within the power of the U.K. government to counteract that with positive steps to boost business. For example, cutting corporation tax, cutting regulation, all those things that work so well here in America.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>HILTON: The U.K. government could do that and attract new investment into the U.K. after living the E.U.</p><p>ASMAN: You know <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>gets a lot of criticism for being in- eloquent, for not being diplomatic enough. But unless you have an absolute steel backbone and refuse to bend, that refuse to budge, these folks are going to try in any way possible to humiliate you and destroy you. I mean it's as simple as that.</p><p>Very quickly, go ahead.</p><p>HILTON: Exactly right. That's exactly right. And you've got to have -- I mean the words I often use having worked inside government to get anything through, you've got to be really demented in pursuing your goals and not be sidetrack by the inevitable inertia from the bureaucratic machine.</p><p>ASMAN: All right, Steve Hilton, great to see you my friend. Thank you very much. You can catch Steve show --</p><p>HILTON: Thank you David.</p><p>ASMAN: -- \"The Next Revolution.\" He's talking about what's going on all over the planet. It's on Fox News every Sunday night at 9:00 p.m. Eastern, it is required watching, believe me.</p><p>Coming up, what the FBI says is our biggest economic and national security threat. The FBI warning, if we don't get a handle on this threat now, we are in for a very rude awakening.</p><p>And speaking of threats, wait until you hear why socialist <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>thinks a couple of multi-billionaires own and control our nation. His words, there are about 30 million small business owners in America. We have a few things to say about that. More coming up straight ahead, stay with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We cannot continue to lose $500 billion here to China. And I had a fantastic meeting with President Xi. This was a four-hour meeting where everything was agreed on.</p><p>Now if we get it down in paper that'll be another story but I think we will. We have great strength. Nobody has ever done what I've done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: That was the President singing praises talking of his negotiations with Chinese President Xi Jinping. As they try this amount of trade deal between the world's two economic power houses this as we are getting reports in today's \"Wall Street Journal\" that Trump closest to aides are warning him against intervening in the Huawei case. But the President is saying this week he would not be against intervening in the case if it help boost trade talks with China.</p><p>Joining me now is the author of the new book \"The 100-year Marathon,\" former Assistant --</p><p>MICHAEL PILLSBURY, HUDSON INSTITUTE CHINESE STRATEGY DIR: Hi.</p><p>ASMNA: -- under Secretary of Defense for Policy Planning in Hudson Institutes Chinese Strategy Director, Michael Pillsbury.</p><p>So, Michael the President is making Chinese --</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes.</p><p>ASMAN: -- trade talks a priority. But should he be handoff in terms of the Huawei case?</p><p>PILLSBURY: Well, I think it's appropriate for the President to review the quality of evidence. This is a criminal case and you know the standard David. This got to beyond the shadow or reasonable doubt.</p><p>So I get the impression that the original request for indictment was not reviewed by the President and his team. There -- they've been quite unified and saying while he was having dinner with President Xi in Buenos Aires he did not know about this arrest. So obviously knowing what the quality of the evidence is could be important. If he releases her and lets her go because the evidence doesn't meet that test. There's no problem with that.</p><p>ASMAN: All right. Well, meanwhile by the way Canada is the one getting the brunt of reaction from the Chinese. There are now two business people in China who've been detained, two Canadian business people who've been detained. I think they're being detained for national security ground. That's pretty serious stuff.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Well, both side are seeking out leverage. As you know the marks first deadline is going to be coming up fairly quickly.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Chinese have a history, David, of last-minute deals, putting maximum leverage on. They could do a lot more, you know. So far they're buying soybeans yesterday. The President was proven to be correct about that.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>PILLSBURY: But I anticipate over the next two or three months, both sides seeking leverage in various, shall we say, creative ways.</p><p>Now this FBI testimony is really quite something that the Department of Justice and FBI are being basically being unleashed to do more law enforcement cases against China. This is another kind of leverage but it's also legally necessary for our country, I think.</p><p>ASMAN: Now, you mentioned soybeans, you know, some people complain it's not a lot of soybeans that they're buying from the U.S., but it's something. Also the tariffs are coming down on cars. There is some --</p><p>PILLSBURY: Right.</p><p>ASMAN: -- movement, I believe some movement on intellectual property as well.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes, that's right. That's right.</p><p>ASMAN: So are we incrementally getting what we want from the Chinese?</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes. Things are moving in the right direction, these are really quite extraordinary steps China has been taking. To say they will criminalize and put really heavy fines and criminal penalties on intellectual property theft, that's a big deal. We can verify that if it charged to happen.</p><p>ASMAN: And you know --</p><p>PILLSBURY: I think what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is looking for is more steps like that by March 1st --</p><p>ASMAN: When --</p><p>PILLSBURY: -- or the tariffs go back on.</p><p>ASMAN: When the President says \"nobody has done this before,\" it sounds like hyperbole but its not. It's the truth. I mean, nobody has really held the Chinese feet to the fire before, whether it's Republican administration or Democrat one, right?</p><p>PILLSBURY: Well, David I have a lot of contacts with the Chinese and they say that. It's not just <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>hyperbole. The Chinese themselves are saying that.</p><p>Now President Obama indicted five Chinese actors.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Put their photos up on line, you know, and said they would -- they should be returned to America. Nothing ever happened.</p><p>ASMAN: Right.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Many presidents have asked nicely for China to stop this misconduct. It doesn't work. So this is a new approach.</p><p>And I think there's bipartisan support for it. As quite delighted to Senator Dianne Feinstein yesterday signed up for the whole new program on law enforcement and technology theft.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, she's got a little history herself and with the Chinese --</p><p>PILLSBURY: Silicon Valley.</p><p>ASMAN: -- espionage for of that driver of her car but that's a whole another issue.</p><p>Michael, great to see you. Thank you for being here.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Thanks David.</p><p>ASMAN: Appreciate it.</p><p>Well, self proclaim socialist <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>blaming all our socioeconomic problems on a few billionaires who he claims are the source of the power and greed in this country and he says they control the country. His bizarre claim in coming next.</p><p>Also one liberal website is calling for a Constitutional amendment so that Democrat superstar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez can run for president in 2020. But get this, even Ocasio-Cortez thinks it's a dumb idea. Details coming next.</p><p>ASMAN: New tonight, Senator <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>socialist and figure head of the all liberal side of the democrat party claiming America's controlled by just a small group of billionaires. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>BERNIE SANDERS </nameText></person>(D), VERMONT SENATOR: We live in a nation owned and controlled by a small number of multi-billionaires whose greed, incredible greed, insatiable greed is having an unbelievably negative impact on the fabric of our entire country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: Owned and controlled.</p><p>Joining me now is \"Fox Nation\" Host Britt McHenry and Democratic Strategist Mustafa Tameez.</p><p>So, Britt, there are 28 million small businesses in the U.S. right now, who I am guessing would like to give <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>a piece of their mind about what really makes America work. And it's not just a handful of billionaires.</p><p>BRITT MCHENRY, \"FOX NATION\" HOST: Absolutely not and we saw, you know, going back to the 2016 election, which I'm sure <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>remembers not so fondly. The populist movement in this country how it propelled <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>who, yes, is a billionaire. But the ideas behind him or what people in the Roosevelt States, those economies that are critical they needed some one in power and in-charge too to help them.</p><p>And he won the white female vote with 52 percent of white females. Are they all the narrative of the white man controlling Wall Street? No. That's absolutely not true. And then add <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>is a part of the one percent too.</p><p>ASMAN: Right.</p><p>MCHENRY: You know, last year was his book royalty alone has over $1 million in salary. So I disagree with him and feel the burn elsewhere.</p><p>ASMAN: Mustafa, you don't really believe that a few billionaires control the nation, that's him saying that.</p><p>MUSTAFA TAMEEZ, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Yes. Well, you know what he's really saying is that, you know, one percent of human beings in the world own half of the world's assets. And that's actually true statement.</p><p>But <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders, </nameText></person>like <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>speaks at a lot of rallies in the hyperbolic ways sometimes thought that way just like <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>And both men are in their 70s, and both men go to these big rallies and both men are really quoting a populist movement, one on the left and one on the right. So that's really the underlying argument here.</p><p>But the bigger thing that we all should focus on is that 70 percent of our GDPs in consumer spending. And so when more people have money --</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>TAMEEZ: -- our economy does better not when less.</p><p>ASMAN: I think when the producers in the economy, whether they're one of the 28 million small businesses or individuals that are just working on their own. When they produce, I think that's far more important than when people consume.</p><p>But Britt, the point is America's really owned by 330 million Americans who have the power and the economic fortitude, many of them to go out, some go up, some go down.</p><p>One of the great things about the Forbes list, you know, the list of the richest people in America. It's not necessary how many new people there but how many people drop off the list. There is social and economic mobility in the U.S. that you don't see in any other country in the world.</p><p>MCHENRY: Absolutely. And I mean, I will agree on that point that this is posturing here. You know, there's still some reports, some speculation that <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>could once again run or be the Democratic Party's nominee, which I could go into that especially if we have another topic. But he's posturing to a crowd.</p><p>And, you know, you go to Middle America, you go to a military community where I was raised. Those are hard-working middle class people. And they're making money every day and they're the millionaire --</p><p>TAMEEZ: Right'right.</p><p>MCHENRY: -- they're voting for people they want.</p><p>ASMAN: Mustafa, I can't help but to think that some of the reason he believes this is because he has been done practically nothing in his whole life except being a politician and he doesn't understand how the market works. You seem to be agreeing when I was saying great thing about this country people can go up and down the economic lather. You seem to understand that, he doesn't.</p><p>TAMEEZ: Well, look, I think that that's been the American tradition, American history, and that's what makes us --</p><p>ASMAN: You don't think it is any more?</p><p>TAMEEZ: -- a nation. But -- well, look, I think it's changing and we have to prevent it from changing. The divide between the rich and poor is the greatest that it's ever been and that's what <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>points out. And that's what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>points out, right? <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>stands at rally --</p><p>ASMAN: Well, that's what President Obama was pointing out and when --</p><p>TAMEEZ: -- movement on the right.</p><p>ASMAN: When he was in control of that divide between the richest and the poorest was growing.</p><p>TAMEEZ: Well, look, I mean the divide is growing even more. The trade deficit is even bigger now between China and the United States.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>TAMEEZ: This year than it's been in the past. I know that there's a lot of rhetoric about it. But look at the end of the day there is a populist movement that's both in the left and both in the right.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>TAMEEZ: And that populist movement it's giving us a signal that the divide between the rich and poor has to get that.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, Britt you've got 10 seconds, would you like to go against this rhetoric from <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>in the next election?</p><p>MCHENRY: Absolutely. You know, give me a couple years, I guess Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez thinks she can already even though she's well under 35. I think both of them are all talk, all theory. I'll stick with working Americans and that will put money in my pocket.</p><p>ASMAN: Absolutely.

I'm Bret Baier.</p><p> President Trump says he would be proud to shut down the government over the  border wall.  The Senate Minority Leader calls the wall threat a temper  tantrum.  The House Minority leader and possibly future Speaker of the  House, Nancy Pelosi says President Trump does not have the votes.</p><p> There are still ten days left for more political fireworks until the  funding runs out for the government, at least partially.  We'll explain  that.</p><p> Correspondent Kevin Corke is at the White House tonight where the  negotiations took place in the Oval Office and importantly on camera.  Good  evening -- Kevin.</p><p> KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening -- Bret.  Quite the  afternoon here.</p><p> What was billed as a chance to work together to avoid a government shutdown  and perhaps secure funding for the border wall quickly devolved into  political mayhem here at the White House this afternoon with the President,  as you pointed out, promising to shut down the government if he doesn't get  funding for the wall.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I am proud to shut down the  government for border security, Chuck.  because the people of this country  don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs  pouring into our country.</p><p> So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down.  I'm not  going to blame you for it.  The last time you shut it down, it didn't work.   I will take the mantle of shutting down.  And I'm going to shut it down for  border security.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  But we believe you  shouldn't shut it down.  </p><p> CORKE:  It was a rare glimpse of the bare-knuckle battles that few outside  Washington get to see.  The President suggesting the Democrats would rather  keep the border open than keep the government open.  And Democrats accusing  him of trying to force a shutdown.  </p><p> TRUMP:  We need border security, the wall is part of border security you  can't have very good border security without the wall.  No.</p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  That is (INAUDIBLE).   That is a political term.  Border security is a way to effectively honor or  responsibility.</p><p> SCHUMER:  And the experts say you can do border security without a wall  which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem.  </p><p> TRUMP:  It totally solves the problem.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> TRUMP:  And it's very important.</p><p> PELOSI:  -- we came at a place to say how do we meet the needs of American  people?  </p><p> CORKE:  Ahead of the meeting, the President made clear his intentions,  repeatedly tweeting about the wall and the border, promising the wall get  built.  </p><p> TRUMP:  I don't mind owning that issue.  I mean Chuck's problem is that,  you know, when we last closed down, that was his idea.  And honestly, he  got killed.  And so he doesn't want to own it. And I said, you know what,  rather than us debating who's owning it, I'll take it.  I'll take it.</p><p> If we close down the country, I will take it because we are closing it down  for border security.  And I think I win that every single time.  </p><p> CORKE:  The latest Marist polls suggest a majority of Republicans prefer he  dig in with 65 percent saying the President shouldn't compromise on the  border wall even if it means a shutdown.  But 56 percent of those surveyed  including 71 percent of Democrats say he should.  </p><p> SCHUMER:  This Trump shutdown, this temper tantrum that he seems to throw,  will not get him his wall and it will hurt a lot of people because he will  cause a shutdown.  He admitted he wanted a shutdown.  It's hard to believe  that he would want that.  </p><p> CORKE:  South Carolina GOP Senator Lindsey Graham is among those urging the  President to stand his ground.  </p><p> SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  I find it pretty hypocritical  for the Democrats to deny the President $5 billion which could be well  spent to help secure a border by having walls in places that make sense.</p><p> If I were the President, I would dig in on this.  And I would also put DACA  on the table and try to solve two problems at once.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CORKE:  Bret -- as you know, the clock is ticking on both the President and  the White House as well as congressional lawmakers.  The government funding  runs out December 21st at 11:59:59 p.m. after which real political and  financial consequences will ensue -- Bret. </p><p> BAIER:  Kevin Corke, live on the north lawn.  Kevin -- thanks.</p><p> A district court judge ordered adult film star Stormy Daniels to pay  President Trump almost $300,000 to cover three quarters of the President's  attorney's fees.  An additional thousand dollars was added in sanctions to  punish Daniels for filing what the judge called a quote, \"meritless  defamation lawsuit\".</p><p> Members of the House Judiciary Committee peppered the head of Google today,  focused on potential bias and data collection.</p><p> Correspondent Gillian Turner reports on the tech giant's time on the hot  seat at today's congressional hearing.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE:  I lead this company without political bias and  work to ensure that the products continue to operate that way.  </p><p> GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Google CEO, Sundar Pichai faced a  grilling in front of the House Judiciary Committee today, his first ever  hearing on Capitol Hill.  Knowing this might be their only face time with  Google's chief for a long time, lawmakers came armed with a gigabyte's  worth of accusations and questions.  </p><p> At the top of Republicans' agenda, anti-conservative bias in the search  engine.</p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  We need to be sure that  any political bias within Google's workforce does not creep into its search  product.  </p><p> REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO:  So I've got really just one question for you --  why?  Why did Google configure its features and pay for rides to the polls  to get out the Latino vote only in key states?  </p><p> TURNER:  Democrats taking an opposing view.  The leading Democrat on the  Committee, Jerrold Nadler said political bias at Google is no big deal.   And one Democrat even accused Google of an anti-liberal bias.  </p><p> REP. STEVE COHEN (D), TENNESSEE:  I put my name in here,  RepSteveCohen@PunchNews.  This weekend I was on MSNBC four times.  And yet  the first thing that comes up is the \"Daily Caller\", not exactly a liberal  and I guess well-known group.  Then Rollcall.  Then Breitbart News.  And I  would like you to look into the overuse of conservative news organizations  to put on liberal people's news on Google.  </p><p> TURNER:  Knowing he would be on the hot seat, Pichai came prepared to  reassure lawmakers and armed with big promises.  He told them \"Google  hasn't ever sold user data to third parties nor will it in the future\".  </p><p> But whether it was enough to allay their concerns over privacy is unclear.</p><p> REP. TED POE (R), TEXAS:  So Google knows that I am moving over there.   It's not a trick question.  You know, you make $100 million a year.  </p><p> REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D), TEXAS:  Would you commit to hearing to Article  12 or the declaration of human rights as it relates to protecting the  privacy of individual e-mails?  </p><p> PICHAI:  We think privacy is an important individual rights.  It's an  important human right.  And we are committed to upholding that.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TURNER:  Pichai also addressed speculation about Project Dragonfly.  That's  Google's super secret project to develop a tailored search engine for China  where the government have always censored online content.  He confirmed  Google spent months working on a prototype and insisted they have no plans  to launch it.  This was the company's first public acknowledgment of  involvement, Bret, in this project.  </p><p> BAIER:  Interesting hearing today.  Gillian -- thank you.</p><p> More on this with the panel.</p><p> While funding for the wall is causing political divisions, as you just saw,  the parties seem to be coming together for criminal justice reform.</p><p> Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel looks at that bill and the  schedule ahead if Congress wants to pass it.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Majority leader  Mitch McConnell says lawmakers will vote on a bipartisan package after  President Trump pressured him to get it done.  </p><p> SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  The Senate will  take up the recently revised criminal justice bill this month.  I intend to  turn to the new text as early as the end of this week.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Pushing for cooperation, McConnell noted senators may need to  work between Christmas and the New Year to complete it.  In the Oval  Office, with the top congressional Democrats, the President expressed his  delight.  </p><p> TRUMP:  We have great Democrat support, great Republican support - so  criminal justice reform something that people have been trying to get how  long, Nancy -- many years.  </p><p> PELOSI:  Exactly.</p><p> TRUMP:  Many, many years. EMANUEL:  The bill would allow judges to reduce sentences for nonviolent  drug crimes and eliminate some mandatory sentences.  It also includes  assistance to help inmate develop skills to cope when they get out of  prison.  </p><p> Democrats note this is the first criminal justice reform in a generation.</p><p> SENATOR DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  I've been at this for five years for  criminal sentencing reform and I think we've reached that magic moment.  </p><p> SENATOR CHRIS COONS (D), DELAWARE:  I'm very excited.  This is a bipartisan  approach to criminal justice and sentencing reform.  I have been honored to  work with a wide range of bipartisan colleagues.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Part of the McConnell's reluctance is the bill has divided the  Senate GOP.  Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton likens it to a  jailbreak.  </p><p> SENATOR TOM COTTON (R), ARKANSAS:  I don't think the Senate should vote to  let carjackers and bank robbers out of prison.  Maybe other senators do.   That's their prerogative but I will have a lots of amendments to offer and  they can make those choices.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  But South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says it is  smart legislation.  </p><p> GRAHAM:  This a great reform package, it allows people who have been  incarcerated for a long time for nonviolent drug offenses to earn their way  out of jail quicker by achieving a skill set that will allow them to stay  out of jail.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> EMANUEL:  Republican Whip John Cornyn says the Senate could pass this  measure in an afternoon with a little cooperation.  Speaker Paul Ryan says  the House will be prepared to act once the Senate gets it done -- Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Mike Emanuel, live on the Hill.  Mike -- thanks.</p><p> Some Republican senators are pushing to break with the White House over the  relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, specifically the Crown  Prince there.  Pushback at least in a symbolic way by the Senate.</p><p> Correspondent Peter Doocy reports from the Capitol Hill.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The U.S. Senate is ready to respond  to a journalist's bloody murder with a resolution, condemning Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> SENATOR BOB CORKER (R), TENNESSEE:  My sense is it will pass and it will  not affect policy.  </p><p> DOOCY:  That's not the point at least not right away.  </p><p> GRAHAM:  I think it's important for the Senate to get on the record that  this was unacceptable and we hold MBS responsible for the murder.  That's a  big deal.  </p><p> DOOCY:  Progressive Democrats are on the same page.  </p><p> SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNI:  Well, I think that we have to act.  </p><p> DOOCY:  Tomorrow's resolution is sponsored by Republican Senator Mike Lee  and Independent Senator Bernie Sanders who writes, \"The time is long  overdue for the United States to stop following the lead of Saudi Arabia, a  brutal regime that recently murdered a dissident journalist and has no  respect for human rights.\"</p><p> That journalist, Jamal Khashoggi is now on the front page of \"Time  Magazine\" after being named one of their people of the year.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is the first time we've ever chosen someone no  longer alive.</p><p> DOOCY:  Now, Khashoggi's old boss at the \"Washington Post\" Fred Ryan  writes, \"We hope this recognition will prompt our nation's leaders to stand  up for America's values and hold accountable those who attempt to silence  journalists who cover our communities or in Jamal's case an oppressive  authoritarian government.  But the White House warns that hopes for peace  in the Middle East could crumble if Congress cracks down too hard.  </p><p> JARED KUSHNER, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISOR:  We're hoping to make sure that there  is justice brought where that should be.  We're focused now on the broader  region which is figuring out how to hopefully bring a deal together between  the Israelis and the Palestinians.  </p><p> DOOCY:  Outgoing foreign relations committee chairman Bob Corker just hopes  whatever happens, happens before he retires.  </p><p> CORKER:  I think that Congress is going to deal with Saudi Arabia.  And I  want to be a part of that even though I'm leaving in a couple of weeks, I  want to be a part of making sure that happens.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DOOCY:  Lawmakers are so eager to act here on the Senate side because the  intelligence implicating certain Saudis in the murder is so strong.  Now,  House leaders want to see that intel.  They will tomorrow morning, and then  they will decide if they want to take further action -- Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Peter Doocy, live on the Capitol Hill.  Peter -- thank you.</p><p> Search and rescue operations have stopped off the coast of Japan.  The U.S.  Military declared the five missing crewmembers dead after their refueling  plane collided with a fighter jet last week.  That brings the death toll of  this accident up to six.  One survivor is in stable condition tonight.</p><p> Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent a message of condolences to  President Trump.  The cause of that crash remains under investigation.</p><p> U.S. prosecutors allege Maria Butina is a Russian spy.  Vladimir Putin says  he never heard of her before her arrest. Today Butina accepted a plea deal  with an agreement to cooperate.  </p><p> Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge has details.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  According  to a legal agreement reviewed by Fox News, Russian national Maria Butina  will plead guilty to acting as an unregistered foreign agent for the  Russian government.  The deal includes a promise to cooperate, quote, \"in  any and all matters the government deems relevant.</p><p> The filing states quote, \"Butina sought to establish unofficial lines of  communications with Americans having power and influence over U.S.  politics, for the benefit of the Russian Federation. </p><p> Prosecutors allege the 29-year-old targeted a gun rights organization  sources say is the National Rifle Association along with an unidentified  American.  Sources say that American is a longtime Republican Party  activist.</p><p> Court papers indicate Butina set up a trip to Moscow for NRA members and  so-called friendship dinners with those she believed quote, \"would have the  ear of the next U.S. presidential administration.\"</p><p> The filing continues, \"She was introduced to influential members of  political party one -- one of whom announced his campaign to run for the  presidency of the United States believe to be Candidate Trump.</p><p> The Butina case is separate from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia  investigation.  Today the Russian President said his spy chiefs know  nothing about Butina quote, \"She risk 15 years in jail.  For what\", Putin  said.  \"I asked all the heads of our intelligence services what is going  on, nobody knows anything about her.\"</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERRIDGE:  And late today a Kremlin aide reported Butina's father says she  would never admit to crime she did not commit.  Butina's lawyer  unsuccessfully argued that she is a foreign student interested in American  politics and better U.S.-Russia relations -- Bret.</p><p> BAIER:  Catherine, meantime there was this status hearing today in the Paul  Manafort case with an interesting development.  What about that?</p><p> HERRIDGE:  Well Bret -- the federal judge wants more information from  special counsel investigators before deciding whether the President's  former campaign chairman violated his plea agreement.  The allegation is  that Paul Manafort lied about his foreign contacts and communication with  the administration.</p><p> The special counsel sentencing memos filed Friday were heavily redacted or  blacked out to protect sensitive information.  But the federal judge had  full access to the evidence and still wants more information.  A tentative  court date has been set for the end of January but it's expected both sides  will continue their private negotiations -- Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Catherine -- thank you.</p><p> HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p> Up next, one local crop is being hit hard by the China tariffs.  We'll have  that. </p><p> And later the French ambassador joins us live to talk about the situation  in his country.</p><p> First, what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering  tonight.</p><p>Fox 35 in Richmond, Virginia where a jury is recommending life in prison  plus 419 years for James Alex Fields, the man convicted of first-degree  murder for driving his car into counter protesters at a white nationalist  rally last year in Charlottesville.  The judge will make the final  sentencing decision in March.</p><p>Fox 41 in Louisville, Kentucky where the statue of the founder of the  \"Louisville Journal\" has been taken down.  The mayor said George Prentiss  used his position as a newspaper editor to push an anti-Catholic and anti- immigrant message that led to a riot in 1855 where at least 22 people were  killed.</p><p> And this is a live look at Chicago from our affiliate, Fox 32.  One of the  big stories there tonight the startling quantity of illegal guns collected  by law enforcement there.  Chicago police say the number of firearms  collected could top 10,000 by the end of the year.  The 2018 tallies  currently over 9,000 or more than one illegal guns seized per hour in  Chicago.</p><p> That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p> We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  This is a Fox News alert.  A Canadian court has just granted bail  to Meng Wanzhou while she awaits an extradition hearing. The judge made the  deal subject to a guarantee of 10 million Canadian dollars -- about $7.5  million along with other conditions.</p><p> China warning Canada of consequences for her recent arrest.  She is an  executive of Huawei, the company under scrutiny and being looked by the  U.S. and other countries.  Tensions were already high after a former  Canadian diplomat had been arrested while visiting Beijing.  Canada's  public safety minister did not draw a direct line between the two arrests  but says the country is deeply concerned and is sparing no effort to look  after his safety.</p><p> Meantime trade negotiations continue with China, there are some hopeful  signs tonight.  According to a source familiar with the conversations,  China is going to roll back its auto tariffs eliminating the 25 percent  surcharge.  The move would bring the rate back down to 15 percent which is  the level it was before the trade war began.</p><p> It was a mixed day on the markets today, the Dow dropped 53, the S&amp;P 500  lost less than one, the Nasdaq gained 11.</p><p> This evening we look at the human toll here in the U.S. of Chinese tariffs.   They are having a huge impact on one major industry in the Pacific  Northwest.</p><p> Correspondent Dan Springer reports from Washington.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  When it comes to the impact of  Chinese tariffs on U.S. farm goods, sweet cherries are the canary in the  gold mine.  Unlike other commodities that can be stored, cherries are  perishable.  They are picked, packed and sold right away.  Wen China's  tariffs hit 50 percent last July right in the middle of the harvest,  exports to China went from the most profitable to the pits.  Growers in  Washington State saw their bumper crop lose $86 million in value overnight.  </p><p> MARK POWERS, NORTHWEST HORTICULTURAL COUNCIL:  They are upset clearly.  I  mean they are patriotic.  They want to do the right thing.  They understand  that there are problems with our trade relationship with China.  </p><p> SPRINGER:  Washington fruit and produce companies saw exports to China  plunged 54 percent, extra painful because China pays top dollar for  American produce.  Growers fear they will lose their best market to Turkey  and South America and never get it back, and worry about where the trade  war is heading.  </p><p> FRANK DAVIS, Washington FRUIT AND PRODUCE COMPANY:  Because we are such a  small share, you really don't like to be used as the pawn.  </p><p> SPRINGER:  Soybeans from the Midwest are a much bigger player accounting  for 60 percent of $20 billion of food exports to China.  A Nebraska Farm  Bureau report released this week says the retaliatory tariffs have cost  state growers $1 billion this year and farmworkers another $200 million in  income.</p><p> Supporters of President Trump say farmers need to keep the big picture in  mind.  </p><p> DOUG ERICKSEN (R), WASHINGTON STATE SENATE:  I think a lot of the farmers  are feeling the pain right now but I think a lot of them also understand  it's important for America overall to have fair trade relationships.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SPRINGER:  Farmers suffering from the trade war with China are getting some  relief in the form of a $12 billion aid package but a growing refrain from  a national campaign titled \"Tariffs for the Heartland\" is they want trade,  not aid -- Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  Dan -- thank you.</p><p> Up next, the French ambassador joins me to talk about the efforts to calm  the violent yellow jacket protests in France.</p><p> First beyond our borders tonight.</p><p> At least four are dead and several injured following a shooting near a  Christmas market in Strasbourg, France.  Police have opened a terrorism  investigation into that attack.  Some of the wounded are in critical  condition tonight.  The suspect has been identified, may have been shot but  he is being actively pursued now by authorities.</p><p> January 20th is the final date to swap over 15,000 prisoners from rival  factions of Yemen's devastating civil war, following talks held in a  Swedish castle.  The International Community of the Red Cross will oversee  that process.  The United Nations declared the country, Yemen as one of the  world's worst humanitarian crises with 22 million of its 29 million people  in some need of aid.</p><p> The bells of Balangiga are back in the Philippines after 117 years.  The  three bells were taken by U.S. troops in 1901 as spoils of war during one  of the bloodiest periods of American occupation of the Philippines.  Two of  the bells had been displayed for decades at a base in Wyoming.  The third  was with the U.S. Army in South Korea.  The U.S. Ambassador called it the  end of a painful chapter in history.</p><p> Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.</p><p> We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  French President Emmanuel Macron hopes tax relief and other fiscal  measures will calm violent nationwide protests there.  The reforms are  expected to cost around 10 billion euros.</p><p> French ambassador to the United States Gerard Araud joins me here on set.   Mr. Ambassador -- thanks for being here.</p><p> GERARD ARAUD, FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES:  Thank you.</p><p> BAIER:  First, this breaking news out of Strasbourg.  There is a death toll  now, the Associated Press has it at four.  A shooting at a Christmas  market.  Suspect wounded -- it says a terrorism investigation.  </p><p> ARAUD:  Well, apparently, you know, I don't have of course news.  It has  been -- it has happened a few hours ago.  The suspect has not been  arrested.  We know who he is, you know.  Apparently he is an Islamist  terrorist.  He is chased.  There are three or maybe four people who have  been killed but at least 12 have been wounded.  We have been facing this  challenge for some time now unfortunately.  </p><p> BAIER:  The threat from radical -- </p><p> ARAUD:  Radical Islam, yes, it's still there.  </p><p> BAIER:  I want to turn to the protests.  It seems  -- and here is the  French president in his address to the nation.  Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator):  I feel the anger.   Give us another chance.  I want to see an immediate and real improvement in  the salaries and this is why I am ordering an end of the year bonus for all  employees without any tax.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  He is increasing minimum wage, (INAUDIBLE) tax cuts for retirees,  other concessions as well and yet it doesn't seem like that's stopping the  protests.  </p><p> ARAUD:  You know, in a sense, the powder keg of the explosion was more or  less what we are seeing in the U.S., in U.K. with Brexit, everywhere.  We  have in France like in this country, we have millions of citizens who feel  they have been left behind by globalization, automation.  It's the lower  middle class, the people living in small cities and are rebelling, and they  have been rebelling also against our government, the government of  President Macron, who has been trying to reform France.  So I think that's  the social background of the crisis.  </p><p> BAIER:  It was interesting to watch politicians and people here in this  country, especially on the left because this started as a climate change  effort, this fuel tax.  Neera Tanden with the Center for American Progress  tweeted \"I don't understand why any progressive is cheering French  protesters who are amassing against a carbon tax.\"  There is a real divide  about how to do that if you want to tackle it, especially if you are coming  from the left side of at least American politics.  </p><p> ARAUD:  In French politics, the protesters are saying we are serious  ourselves about bringing change.  But basically they say, one of them said  something very special.  He said we are concerned about the end of the  world, but we also have to be concerned about the end of the month.  So  really it's full of common sense.  When you are increasing the price of gas  for the people, especially for the people living in the rural areas, it has  consequences on the standard of living.  And I think that's what the French  government didn't take into account, so now I think the president has  decided to face this problem.  </p><p> BAIER:  Right.  So he lists all these concessions, he says I'm sorry.  He  wants to do all of these different things, yet it doesn't seem to be  appeasing the protesters which have cost your country a lot of money in  tourism and shopping and everything else.  </p><p> ARAUD:  France are very good demonstrators, that's a tradition in our  country.  We are going to see.  And, of course, there are always people who  are not satisfied with what the president decided, but I think we are going  to see in the coming days whether these demonstrations are going to be as  strong as they were last week.  </p><p> BAIER:  The relationship between President Trump and President Macron,  largely talked about when the two visiting, it was very warm.  You had the  foreign minister saying, \"I say to Donald Trump, the French president told  him as well, we don't take part in American debates.  Let us live our life  in our country.\"  That message sent I guess after the tweets he sent out  about France?  </p><p> ARAUD:  In the family, you have very good squabbles.  So in the Franco- American relationship, you have bumps.  We have had bumps, you have them.   But fundamentally the relationship between the two countries remain  excellent.  </p><p> BAIER:  And they still talk?  </p><p> ARAUD:  And they still talk.  They talk a lot on the phone, yes.  </p><p> BAIER:  I want to turn to another foreign policy issue, and that is Iran.   They've just tested some long-range ballistic missiles.  France was  actually on the forefront of really cracking down on Iran in the nuclear  agreement.  Where do you see Iran today and what could be happening?  </p><p> ARAUD:  Basically, what we have been telling our American friends is that  we take very seriously with the Iranians are doing in terms of missile  activities, in terms of terrorism, in terms of regional aggression, and  that we are ready to work with the Americans on that.  There is a  negotiation actually between the three main European countries and the U.S.  on this issue.  So we are still ready to work with the Americans, and  really we share 100 percent the concerns of the Americans.  </p><p> BAIER:  Do you think a deal is going be repurposed?  </p><p> ARAUD:  We really -- basically, we do consider the decision of the American  administration to get out of the Iranian deal was a bad decision, but we  hope that we can work together on the other issues I have already referred  to, terrorism, regional activities, and missiles.  And actually there are  negotiations between the Europeans and the Americans on these issues.  </p><p> BAIER:  Mr. Ambassador, we appreciate your time.  </p><p> ARAUD:  Thank you very much.</p><p> BAIER:  Thank you.</p><p> The border wall is dividing President Trump and Congressional Democrats,  and the government potentially partially shuts down in 10 days.  The panel  joins me next to go over where things stand.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  I think we can agree on is we  shouldn't shut the government down over a dispute.  And you want to shut it  down.  You keep talking about it.</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The last time, Chuck, you  shut it down.  </p><p> SCHUMER:  No, no, no.  Twenty times.</p><p> TRUMP:  And then you opened it up very quickly.  I don't want to do what  you did.  </p><p> SCHUMER:  Twenty times.  Twenty times you have called for I will shut down  the government if I don't get my will.  </p><p> TRUMP:  You know what I'll say?  Yes, if we don't get what we want, I will  shut down the government.  </p><p> SCHUMER:  OK, fair enough.  We disagree.  We disagree.  </p><p> TRUMP:  And I am proud -- and I'll tell you what, I am proud to shut down  the government for border security, Chuck.  </p><p> SCHUMER:  This temper tantrum that he seems to throw will not get him his  wall and it will hurt a lot of people because he will cause a shut down.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  We think we left it in a  pretty good place.  We gave him two possibilities.  They said they would  think about it.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Welcome to divided government in 2019, Oval Office meeting between  the Democratic leadership, the president there fighting for the border wall  funding, later at another event said he was fine with that.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I don't mind having the  issue of border security on my side.  If we have to close down the country  over border security, I actually like that in terms of an issue but I don't  want it to be an issue.  I want it to be something that the country needs.   It's not really an issue.  It's something the country needs.  It's common  sense.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  So where are we as a partial government shutdown looms 10 days from  now?  Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The  Washington Times,\" A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics,  and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review,\" Charlie, it was  quite something to see, obviously, just the moment was quite something to  see.  But then the minority leader saying, you know what, get the cameras  out of here, let's talk.  And then the president turning and saying, Nancy,  it's about transparency.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\":  That's one of the things  I'll never understand, a complaint that I'll never understand in this era  of Trump.  I would think that at the very least people who don't like Trump  and don't like the stuff that he says would at least applaud the fact that  he is, shall we say, transparent.  He doesn't mind having the press in  these meetings.  </p><p> But you got two people here in Pelosi and Schumer who have 60, 65 years of  political experience on the guys.  This guy is a complete novice.  And what  we saw in that 15 minutes in the Oval Office was him completely getting  them -- playing rope-a-dope with them so that they are playing 100 percent  his game.  </p><p> He is right, on the issue of border security, Republicans win that fight,  Trump wins that fight.  In fact, it's what got him elected.  But there are  a couple things that Chuck Schumer said in particular that I thought were  fairly amazing.  One is the line about election matter.  I guess elections  matter except 2016 when Trump won.  And then also he says this having just  lost two seats, a pretty historical difficult thing to do.  </p><p> BAIER:  But then kind of blows it off.  North Dakota and Indiana, who cares  about that?</p><p> HURT:  That was the most astonishing thing out of it to me, the idea that  he would say that when the president brings up North Dakota and Indiana  he's in big trouble, completely dismissing two very important entire  regions of the country.  I thought that he will live to regret that remark.  </p><p> BAIER:  A.B., Democrats seemed to be happy with the fact that they had the  president on camera, on tape saying I will own it.  If it shuts down, I  will own it.  But negotiations are continuing.  </p><p> A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, REAL CLEAR POLITICS:  And to Charlie Hurt,  it's a rope-a-dope.  Look, Republicans have dreaded this moment for months,  and they don't want a government shutdown.  Yes, the Democrats did this  last year and they regretted it very quickly.  As the president pointed  out, they opened it right back up.  Government shutdowns are a loser  particularly when you proclaim that you want one and you are the architect  of the shutdown.  You will get blamed.  </p><p> Republicans still have a majority in the Senate and the House.  They don't  want to shut the government down on their watch.  The Democrats like Nancy  Pelosi are saying you guys have the votes, you guys fund the government.   You're right, it's a partial shutdown.  It's only five agencies left, about  20 percent of the discretionary spending, but it still is a political loser  to shut the government down and jump up and down smiling about it.  </p><p> It doesn't matter that border security is not a potent issue.  It is.  The  wall is a popular policy idea among Republicans.  But shutting the  government down is never a good idea, so Republicans like Mitch McConnell  had to come out and clean up and say I don't know what happened with that  contentious meeting, but we don't want to shut the government down.  </p><p> BAIER:  Let's listen to the Senate majority leader.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I understand it was a rather  spirited meeting that we all watched.  But I'd still like to see a smooth  ending here, and I haven't given up hope that's what we'll have.  </p><p> SEN. PATRICK LEAHY, (D) VERMONT:  This is irresponsible.  If you saw it a  comedy show or you saw it on some television program you might think, OK,  this goes over the top.  Well, it does go over the top.  </p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA:  I talked to the president just a  few minutes ago, and I told him you are right to make this request, this  demand.  He seems pretty dug in.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Jonah, there is going to be horse-trading over the next 10 days, a  lot of it.  We could be seeing the beginning dance of what could be a lot  of things that happen on Capitol Hill.  </p><p> JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\":  We could be.  We could  also be looking for faces in clouds.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GOLDBERG:  I think in six months we will look back at this White House  meeting and marvel at the level of decorum and civility.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GOLDBERG:  We'll be nostalgic for this kind of thing.  All this seemed like  with Chuck Schumer and Trump was like -- as a New Yorker I know the types - - two old guys fighting over whose cab it is.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GOLDBERG:  And it's going to get worse.  I agree with some of the things  Charlie said about transparency and all that, but the idea that this was  100 percent Trumps game and rope-a-dope, Republicans on the Hill were  calling it the Schumer shutdown right before this meeting.  They can't call  it Schumer shutdown anymore.  I think at minimum the Democrats, they can  overplay their hand, they get strategy wrong all the time.  But they went  in hoping to get what they got today.  </p><p> BAIER:  Right, but for the base, Charlie, the president, this is probably  his last chance to stand up and say I want this wall funding.  </p><p> HURT:  So obviously it's very good, this is an important issue for the  base.  But if you move away from the word \"wall\" and start talking about  border security, which is kind of the thing that's being debated here,  that's far more widely popular beyond just the Republican base.  That is  where you start eating into a lot of Democratic support.  And when you have  people in the party who are legitimately in favor of sanctuary cities and  legitimately opposed to any kind of border security, that's a winner for  Republicans.  </p><p> I also think we should be careful overstating how damaging a shutdown is.   Obviously, it's very disruptive around here.  But remember the last time  Republicans got blamed for a shutdown, they went on to win historic, in  2012, went on to win historic margins in the House.  So I think that we get  really upset about this sort of thing because it's so unusual, but I don't  think that beyond here it makes quite as big a difference.  </p><p> BAIER:  We'll have many panels to discuss this going forward.  Next up,  Google's CEO takes questions on Capitol Hill.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SUNDAR PICHAI, GOOGLE CEO:  I lead this company without political bias and  work to ensure that our products continue to operate in that way.  To do  otherwise would be against our core principles and our business interests.  </p><p> KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  We need to be sure that any  political bias within Google's workforce does not creep into its search  products.  </p><p> ZOE LOFGREN, (D-CA) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  If you Google the word  \"idiot\" under images, a picture of Donald Trump comes up.  I just did that.  </p><p> TED LIEU, (D-CA) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  If you're getting bad press  articles and bad search results, don't blame Google or Facebook or Twitter.   Consider blaming yourself.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  OK, Google's CEO up on Capitol Hill taking a lot of questions, a  lot of heat.  We're back with the panel.  What do we gain from this?  Is  there anything that comes out of this, Jonah?  </p><p> GOLDBERG:  To be honest, I don't know.  I don't think this was one of  Congress's finest moments.  A lot of them seem like the modern equivalent  of the oldster who doesn't know how to set the clock on the VCR the way  they were talking about some this technology.  Look, 90 percent of web  searches are by Google.  That's an important thing.  That makes looking  into abuse of monopoly power, antitrust stuff a legitimate concern for  Congress.  We are entering into a brave new world with a lot of issues that  we've never really tackled before.  </p><p> So I encourage Congress to look into this.  I don't think worrying about  this pure bias of Google searches things is the best face for this.  There  are more important issues.  But you could also see Google asking for  regulation, which is what these big companies often end up doing because it  locks in their market share.  </p><p> BAIER:  Right.  A.B., there is a serious side to all of this, and that is  something is going to happen eventually on Capitol Hill when it comes to  big tech.  </p><p> STODDARD:  There is a day or a period of reckoning upon them, and they know  that, which is why every hearing that they attend when they get asked about  their opportunities in China and they get to sort of deflect around that,  or they spend most of the entirety of the three hours talking about bias on  their engines is a good day for them, because what they don't want to talk  about his antitrust violations and that kind of bipartisan push, and it is  bipartisan, coming in the future.  </p><p> The Congress has shown itself in these hearing setting where we are all  cringing like this at what the next guy is going to say, and their staffs  are in the background, who should be replacing them at the hearings, by the  way, asking all the questions.  And you can just see the pillars, the  leaders who are giving this testimony are trying to not smile, because they  know if they can run out the clock and not talk about major changes and  just say we can't share our algorithms, but we promise you there's no bias.   Or, it's true, we are trying to improve our privacy protections, that they  can push it off for another year while Congress tries to keep pace with  this furious rate of change.  </p><p> BAIER:  And it's furious.  Here is Bob Goodlatte talking about collecting  data.  This is a big issue here.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. BOB GOODLATTE, (R-VA) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  With  Americans carrying their smartphones all day every day, Google is able to  collect an amount of information about its users that would even make the  NSA blush.  I think it is fair to say that most Americans have no idea the  sheer volume of detailed information that is collected.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  That is a true statement.  We don't know how much data is being  collected.  </p><p> HURT:  But we do know that it's truly terrifying, the amount of  information, the amount of very, very personal information that these  companies are vacuuming up.  And as I think Jonah and A.B. both pointed  out, looking at -- watching hearings like we saw today, it just underscores  the folly of expecting the federal government to somehow protect Americans'  interests in this field.  Honestly, at the end of the day, and I'm deeply  suspicious of all of these companies, especially that phone thing that  tracks you everywhere, but at the end of the day, the answer is don't give  them any of your information.  </p><p> BAIER:  Yes.  He can set his VCR clock.  I think he can.</p><p> GOLDBERG:  I'll take that action.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> BAIER:  You'll take that action?  </p><p> Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge back for a quick  correction now.  Catherine?  </p><p> CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  That's  right.  Earlier this evening, Bret, we reported citing a court filing that  Maria Butina met with a candidate believed to be Donald Trump.  We now  understand that she did meet with a candidate but it was not Trump.   Butina, did, however, ask the president a question at a public event in  2015 and we are happy to clarify it, Bret.  </p><p> BAIER:  All right, Catherine, thank you.</p><p> HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p> BAIER:  We'll follow that story and others.  When we come back, a special  moment in the airport.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  Finally tonight, a really great moment, travelers at the Nashville  airport stopped in their tracks to sing the National Anthem.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (SINGING)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  The moment was captured over the weekend as an American Airlines  flight was taking children who lost their parents in combat to a trip to  Disney World.  So everybody stopped and started singing the National  Anthem.  Airport travelers took notice after an announcement was made as  the kids were boarding.  It was impromptu, and the military was there to  salute the families as well.  That's a great moment.</p><p> Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.  That's it for the SPECIAL  REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The French ambassador will joined me to explain the strategy going forward.</p><p>This is SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p>BAIER: Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.</p><p>President Trump says he would be proud to shut down the government over the border wall. The Senate Minority Leader calls the wall threat a temper tantrum. The House Minority leader and possibly future Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi says President Trump does not have the votes.</p><p>There are still ten days left for more political fireworks until the funding runs out for the government, at least partially. We'll explain that.</p><p>Correspondent Kevin Corke is at the White House tonight where the negotiations took place in the Oval Office and importantly on camera. Good evening -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening -- Bret. Quite the afternoon here.</p><p>What was billed as a chance to work together to avoid a government shutdown and perhaps secure funding for the border wall quickly devolved into political mayhem here at the White House this afternoon with the President, as you pointed out, promising to shut down the government if he doesn't get funding for the wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck. because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.</p><p>So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down, it didn't work. I will take the mantle of shutting down. And I'm going to shut it down for border security.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: But we believe you shouldn't shut it down.</p><p>CORKE: It was a rare glimpse of the bare-knuckle battles that few outside Washington get to see. The President suggesting the Democrats would rather keep the border open than keep the government open. And Democrats accusing him of trying to force a shutdown.</p><p>TRUMP: We need border security, the wall is part of border security you can't have very good border security without the wall. No.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: That is (INAUDIBLE). That is a political term. Border security is a way to effectively honor or responsibility.</p><p>SCHUMER: And the experts say you can do border security without a wall which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem.</p><p>TRUMP: It totally solves the problem.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP: And it's very important.</p><p>PELOSI: -- we came at a place to say how do we meet the needs of American people?</p><p>CORKE: Ahead of the meeting, the President made clear his intentions, repeatedly tweeting about the wall and the border, promising the wall get built.</p><p>TRUMP: I don't mind owning that issue. I mean Chuck's problem is that, you know, when we last closed down, that was his idea. And honestly, he got killed. And so he doesn't want to own it. And I said, you know what, rather than us debating who's owning it, I'll take it. I'll take it.</p><p>If we close down the country, I will take it because we are closing it down for border security. And I think I win that every single time.</p><p>CORKE: The latest Marist polls suggest a majority of Republicans prefer he dig in with 65 percent saying the President shouldn't compromise on the border wall even if it means a shutdown. But 56 percent of those surveyed including 71 percent of Democrats say he should.</p><p>SCHUMER: This Trump shutdown, this temper tantrum that he seems to throw, will not get him his wall and it will hurt a lot of people because he will cause a shutdown. He admitted he wanted a shutdown. It's hard to believe that he would want that.</p><p>CORKE: South Carolina GOP Senator Lindsey Graham is among those urging the President to stand his ground.</p><p>SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: I find it pretty hypocritical for the Democrats to deny the President $5 billion which could be well spent to help secure a border by having walls in places that make sense.</p><p>If I were the President, I would dig in on this. And I would also put DACA on the table and try to solve two problems at once.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE: Bret -- as you know, the clock is ticking on both the President and the White House as well as congressional lawmakers.

Mr. Ambassador -- thanks for being here.</p><p>GERARD ARAUD, FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES: Thank you.</p><p>BAIER: First, this breaking news out of Strasbourg. There is a death toll now, the Associated Press has it at four. A shooting at a Christmas market. Suspect wounded -- it says a terrorism investigation.</p><p>ARAUD: Well, apparently, you know, I don't have of course news. It has been -- it has happened a few hours ago. The suspect has not been arrested. We know who he is, you know. Apparently he is an Islamist terrorist. He is chased. There are three or maybe four people who have been killed but at least 12 have been wounded. We have been facing this challenge for some time now unfortunately.</p><p>BAIER: The threat from radical --</p><p>ARAUD: Radical Islam, yes, it's still there.</p><p>BAIER: I want to turn to the protests. It seems -- and here is the French president in his address to the nation. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): I feel the anger. Give us another chance. I want to see an immediate and real improvement in the salaries and this is why I am ordering an end of the year bonus for all employees without any tax.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: He is increasing minimum wage, (INAUDIBLE) tax cuts for retirees, other concessions as well and yet it doesn't seem like that's stopping the protests.</p><p>ARAUD: You know, in a sense, the powder keg of the explosion was more or less what we are seeing in the U.S., in U.K. with Brexit, everywhere. We have in France like in this country, we have millions of citizens who feel they have been left behind by globalization, automation. It's the lower middle class, the people living in small cities and are rebelling, and they have been rebelling also against our government, the government of President Macron, who has been trying to reform France. So I think that's the social background of the crisis.</p><p>BAIER: It was interesting to watch politicians and people here in this country, especially on the left because this started as a climate change effort, this fuel tax. Neera Tanden with the Center for American Progress tweeted \"I don't understand why any progressive is cheering French protesters who are amassing against a carbon tax.\" There is a real divide about how to do that if you want to tackle it, especially if you are coming from the left side of at least American politics.</p><p>ARAUD: In French politics, the protesters are saying we are serious ourselves about bringing change. But basically they say, one of them said something very special. He said we are concerned about the end of the world, but we also have to be concerned about the end of the month. So really it's full of common sense. When you are increasing the price of gas for the people, especially for the people living in the rural areas, it has consequences on the standard of living. And I think that's what the French government didn't take into account, so now I think the president has decided to face this problem.</p><p>BAIER: Right. So he lists all these concessions, he says I'm sorry. He wants to do all of these different things, yet it doesn't seem to be appeasing the protesters which have cost your country a lot of money in tourism and shopping and everything else.</p><p>ARAUD: France are very good demonstrators, that's a tradition in our country. We are going to see. And, of course, there are always people who are not satisfied with what the president decided, but I think we are going to see in the coming days whether these demonstrations are going to be as strong as they were last week.</p><p>BAIER: The relationship between President Trump and President Macron, largely talked about when the two visiting, it was very warm. You had the foreign minister saying, \"I say to Donald Trump, the French president told him as well, we don't take part in American debates. Let us live our life in our country.\" That message sent I guess after the tweets he sent out about France?</p><p>ARAUD: In the family, you have very good squabbles. So in the Franco- American relationship, you have bumps. We have had bumps, you have them. But fundamentally the relationship between the two countries remain excellent.</p><p>BAIER: And they still talk?</p><p>ARAUD: And they still talk. They talk a lot on the phone, yes.</p><p>BAIER: I want to turn to another foreign policy issue, and that is Iran. They've just tested some long-range ballistic missiles. France was actually on the forefront of really cracking down on Iran in the nuclear agreement. Where do you see Iran today and what could be happening?</p><p>ARAUD: Basically, what we have been telling our American friends is that we take very seriously with the Iranians are doing in terms of missile activities, in terms of terrorism, in terms of regional aggression, and that we are ready to work with the Americans on that. There is a negotiation actually between the three main European countries and the U.S. on this issue. So we are still ready to work with the Americans, and really we share 100 percent the concerns of the Americans.</p><p>BAIER: Do you think a deal is going be repurposed?</p><p>ARAUD: We really -- basically, we do consider the decision of the American administration to get out of the Iranian deal was a bad decision, but we hope that we can work together on the other issues I have already referred to, terrorism, regional activities, and missiles. And actually there are negotiations between the Europeans and the Americans on these issues.</p><p>BAIER: Mr. Ambassador, we appreciate your time.</p><p>ARAUD: Thank you very much.</p><p>BAIER: Thank you.</p><p>The border wall is dividing President Trump and Congressional Democrats, and the government potentially partially shuts down in 10 days. The panel joins me next to go over where things stand.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: I think we can agree on is we shouldn't shut the government down over a dispute. And you want to shut it down. You keep talking about it.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The last time, Chuck, you shut it down.</p><p>SCHUMER: No, no, no. Twenty times.</p><p>TRUMP: And then you opened it up very quickly. I don't want to do what you did.</p><p>SCHUMER: Twenty times. Twenty times you have called for I will shut down the government if I don't get my will.</p><p>TRUMP: You know what I'll say? Yes, if we don't get what we want, I will shut down the government.</p><p>SCHUMER: OK, fair enough. We disagree. We disagree.</p><p>TRUMP: And I am proud -- and I'll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.</p><p>SCHUMER: This temper tantrum that he seems to throw will not get him his wall and it will hurt a lot of people because he will cause a shut down.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We think we left it in a pretty good place. We gave him two possibilities. They said they would think about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Welcome to divided government in 2019, Oval Office meeting between the Democratic leadership, the president there fighting for the border wall funding, later at another event said he was fine with that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't mind having the issue of border security on my side. If we have to close down the country over border security, I actually like that in terms of an issue but I don't want it to be an issue. I want it to be something that the country needs. It's not really an issue. It's something the country needs. It's common sense.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: So where are we as a partial government shutdown looms 10 days from now? Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review,\" Charlie, it was quite something to see, obviously, just the moment was quite something to see. But then the minority leader saying, you know what, get the cameras out of here, let's talk. And then the president turning and saying, Nancy, it's about transparency.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": That's one of the things I'll never understand, a complaint that I'll never understand in this era of Trump. I would think that at the very least people who don't like Trump and don't like the stuff that he says would at least applaud the fact that he is, shall we say, transparent. He doesn't mind having the press in these meetings.</p><p>But you got two people here in Pelosi and Schumer who have 60, 65 years of political experience on the guys. This guy is a complete novice. And what we saw in that 15 minutes in the Oval Office was him completely getting them -- playing rope-a-dope with them so that they are playing 100 percent his game.</p><p>He is right, on the issue of border security, Republicans win that fight, Trump wins that fight. In fact, it's what got him elected. But there are a couple things that Chuck Schumer said in particular that I thought were fairly amazing. One is the line about election matter. I guess elections matter except 2016 when Trump won. And then also he says this having just lost two seats, a pretty historical difficult thing to do.</p><p>BAIER: But then kind of blows it off. North Dakota and Indiana, who cares about that?</p><p>HURT: That was the most astonishing thing out of it to me, the idea that he would say that when the president brings up North Dakota and Indiana he's in big trouble, completely dismissing two very important entire regions of the country. I thought that he will live to regret that remark.</p><p>BAIER: A.B., Democrats seemed to be happy with the fact that they had the president on camera, on tape saying I will own it. If it shuts down, I will own it. But negotiations are continuing.</p><p>A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: And to Charlie Hurt, it's a rope-a-dope. Look, Republicans have dreaded this moment for months, and they don't want a government shutdown. Yes, the Democrats did this last year and they regretted it very quickly. As the president pointed out, they opened it right back up. Government shutdowns are a loser particularly when you proclaim that you want one and you are the architect of the shutdown. You will get blamed.</p><p>Republicans still have a majority in the Senate and the House. They don't want to shut the government down on their watch. The Democrats like Nancy Pelosi are saying you guys have the votes, you guys fund the government. You're right, it's a partial shutdown. It's only five agencies left, about 20 percent of the discretionary spending, but it still is a political loser to shut the government down and jump up and down smiling about it.</p><p>It doesn't matter that border security is not a potent issue. It is. The wall is a popular policy idea among Republicans. But shutting the government down is never a good idea, so Republicans like Mitch McConnell had to come out and clean up and say I don't know what happened with that contentious meeting, but we don't want to shut the government down.</p><p>BAIER: Let's listen to the Senate majority leader.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I understand it was a rather spirited meeting that we all watched. But I'd still like to see a smooth ending here, and I haven't given up hope that's what we'll have.</p><p>SEN. PATRICK LEAHY, (D) VERMONT: This is irresponsible. If you saw it a comedy show or you saw it on some television program you might think, OK, this goes over the top. Well, it does go over the top.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: I talked to the president just a few minutes ago, and I told him you are right to make this request, this demand. He seems pretty dug in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Jonah, there is going to be horse-trading over the next 10 days, a lot of it. We could be seeing the beginning dance of what could be a lot of things that happen on Capitol Hill.</p><p>JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": We could be. We could also be looking for faces in clouds.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GOLDBERG: I think in six months we will look back at this White House meeting and marvel at the level of decorum and civility.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GOLDBERG: We'll be nostalgic for this kind of thing. All this seemed like with Chuck Schumer and Trump was like -- as a New Yorker I know the types - - two old guys fighting over whose cab it is.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GOLDBERG: And it's going to get worse. I agree with some of the things Charlie said about transparency and all that, but the idea that this was 100 percent Trumps game and rope-a-dope, Republicans on the Hill were calling it the Schumer shutdown right before this meeting. They can't call it Schumer shutdown anymore. I think at minimum the Democrats, they can overplay their hand, they get strategy wrong all the time. But they went in hoping to get what they got today.</p><p>BAIER: Right, but for the base, Charlie, the president, this is probably his last chance to stand up and say I want this wall funding.</p><p>HURT: So obviously it's very good, this is an important issue for the base. But if you move away from the word \"wall\" and start talking about border security, which is kind of the thing that's being debated here, that's far more widely popular beyond just the Republican base. That is where you start eating into a lot of Democratic support. And when you have people in the party who are legitimately in favor of sanctuary cities and legitimately opposed to any kind of border security, that's a winner for Republicans.</p><p>I also think we should be careful overstating how damaging a shutdown is. Obviously, it's very disruptive around here. But remember the last time Republicans got blamed for a shutdown, they went on to win historic, in 2012, went on to win historic margins in the House. So I think that we get really upset about this sort of thing because it's so unusual, but I don't think that beyond here it makes quite as big a difference.</p><p>BAIER: We'll have many panels to discuss this going forward. Next up, Google's CEO takes questions on Capitol Hill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, GOOGLE CEO: I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate in that way. To do otherwise would be against our core principles and our business interests.</p><p>KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: We need to be sure that any political bias within Google's workforce does not creep into its search products.</p><p>ZOE LOFGREN, (D-CA) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: If you Google the word \"idiot\" under images, a picture of Donald Trump comes up. I just did that.</p><p>TED LIEU, (D-CA) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: If you're getting bad press articles and bad search results, don't blame Google or Facebook or Twitter. Consider blaming yourself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: OK, Google's CEO up on Capitol Hill taking a lot of questions, a lot of heat. We're back with the panel. What do we gain from this? Is there anything that comes out of this, Jonah?</p><p>GOLDBERG: To be honest, I don't know. I don't think this was one of Congress's finest moments. A lot of them seem like the modern equivalent of the oldster who doesn't know how to set the clock on the VCR the way they were talking about some this technology. Look, 90 percent of web searches are by Google. That's an important thing. That makes looking into abuse of monopoly power, antitrust stuff a legitimate concern for Congress. We are entering into a brave new world with a lot of issues that we've never really tackled before.</p><p>So I encourage Congress to look into this. I don't think worrying about this pure bias of Google searches things is the best face for this. There are more important issues. But you could also see Google asking for regulation, which is what these big companies often end up doing because it locks in their market share.</p><p>BAIER: Right. A.B., there is a serious side to all of this, and that is something is going to happen eventually on Capitol Hill when it comes to big tech.</p><p>STODDARD: There is a day or a period of reckoning upon them, and they know that, which is why every hearing that they attend when they get asked about their opportunities in China and they get to sort of deflect around that, or they spend most of the entirety of the three hours talking about bias on their engines is a good day for them, because what they don't want to talk about his antitrust violations and that kind of bipartisan push, and it is bipartisan, coming in the future.</p><p>The Congress has shown itself in these hearing setting where we are all cringing like this at what the next guy is going to say, and their staffs are in the background, who should be replacing them at the hearings, by the way, asking all the questions. And you can just see the pillars, the leaders who are giving this testimony are trying to not smile, because they know if they can run out the clock and not talk about major changes and just say we can't share our algorithms, but we promise you there's no bias. Or, it's true, we are trying to improve our privacy protections, that they can push it off for another year while Congress tries to keep pace with this furious rate of change.</p><p>BAIER: And it's furious. Here is Bob Goodlatte talking about collecting data. This is a big issue here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE, (R-VA) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: With Americans carrying their smartphones all day every day, Google is able to collect an amount of information about its users that would even make the NSA blush. I think it is fair to say that most Americans have no idea the sheer volume of detailed information that is collected.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: That is a true statement. We don't know how much data is being collected.</p><p>HURT: But we do know that it's truly terrifying, the amount of information, the amount of very, very personal information that these companies are vacuuming up. And as I think Jonah and A.B. both pointed out, looking at -- watching hearings like we saw today, it just underscores the folly of expecting the federal government to somehow protect Americans' interests in this field. Honestly, at the end of the day, and I'm deeply suspicious of all of these companies, especially that phone thing that tracks you everywhere, but at the end of the day, the answer is don't give them any of your information.</p><p>BAIER: Yes. He can set his VCR clock. I think he can.</p><p>GOLDBERG: I'll take that action.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAIER: You'll take that action?</p><p>Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge back for a quick correction now. Catherine?</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Earlier this evening, Bret, we reported citing a court filing that Maria Butina met with a candidate believed to be Donald Trump. We now understand that she did meet with a candidate but it was not Trump. Butina, did, however, ask the president a question at a public event in 2015 and we are happy to clarify it, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: All right, Catherine, thank you.</p><p>HERRIDGE: You're welcome.</p><p>BAIER: We'll follow that story and others. When we come back, a special moment in the airport.</p><p>BAIER: Finally tonight, a really great moment, travelers at the Nashville airport stopped in their tracks to sing the National Anthem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(SINGING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: The moment was captured over the weekend as an American Airlines flight was taking children who lost their parents in combat to a trip to Disney World. So everybody stopped and started singing the National Anthem. Airport travelers took notice after an announcement was made as the kids were boarding. It was impromptu, and the military was there to salute the families as well. That's a great moment.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018121101cb254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY5-DXN1-JB20-G3VC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7222\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 11, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The French ambassador will joined me to explain the strategy  going forward. </p><p>This is SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p>BAIER:  Good evening.  Welcome to Washington.  I'm Bret Baier.</p><p>President Trump says he would be proud to shut down the government over the  border wall.  The Senate Minority Leader calls the wall threat a temper  tantrum.  The House Minority leader and possibly future Speaker of the  House, Nancy Pelosi says President Trump does not have the votes.</p><p>There are still ten days left for more political fireworks until the  funding runs out for the government, at least partially.  We'll explain  that.</p><p>Correspondent Kevin Corke is at the White House tonight where the  negotiations took place in the Oval Office and importantly on camera.  Good  evening -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening -- Bret.  Quite the  afternoon here.</p><p>What was billed as a chance to work together to avoid a government shutdown  and perhaps secure funding for the border wall quickly devolved into  political mayhem here at the White House this afternoon with the President,  as you pointed out, promising to shut down the government if he doesn't get  funding for the wall.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I am proud to shut down the  government for border security, Chuck.  because the people of this country  don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs  pouring into our country.</p><p>So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down.  I'm not  going to blame you for it.  The last time you shut it down, it didn't work.   I will take the mantle of shutting down.  And I'm going to shut it down for  border security.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  But we believe you  shouldn't shut it down.  </p><p>CORKE:  It was a rare glimpse of the bare-knuckle battles that few outside  Washington get to see.  The President suggesting the Democrats would rather  keep the border open than keep the government open.  And Democrats accusing  him of trying to force a shutdown.  </p><p>TRUMP:  We need border security, the wall is part of border security you  can't have very good border security without the wall.  No.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  That is (INAUDIBLE).   That is a political term.  Border security is a way to effectively honor or  responsibility.</p><p>SCHUMER:  And the experts say you can do border security without a wall  which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem.  </p><p>TRUMP:  It totally solves the problem.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP:  And it's very important.</p><p>PELOSI:  -- we came at a place to say how do we meet the needs of American  people?  </p><p>CORKE:  Ahead of the meeting, the President made clear his intentions,  repeatedly tweeting about the wall and the border, promising the wall get  built.  </p><p>TRUMP:  I don't mind owning that issue.  I mean Chuck's problem is that,  you know, when we last closed down, that was his idea.  And honestly, he  got killed.  And so he doesn't want to own it. And I said, you know what,  rather than us debating who's owning it, I'll take it.  I'll take it.</p><p>If we close down the country, I will take it because we are closing it down  for border security.  And I think I win that every single time.  </p><p>CORKE:  The latest Marist polls suggest a majority of Republicans prefer he  dig in with 65 percent saying the President shouldn't compromise on the  border wall even if it means a shutdown.  But 56 percent of those surveyed  including 71 percent of Democrats say he should.  </p><p>SCHUMER:  This Trump shutdown, this temper tantrum that he seems to throw,  will not get him his wall and it will hurt a lot of people because he will  cause a shutdown.  He admitted he wanted a shutdown.  It's hard to believe  that he would want that.  </p><p>CORKE:  South Carolina GOP Senator Lindsey Graham is among those urging the  President to stand his ground.  </p><p>SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  I find it pretty hypocritical  for the Democrats to deny the President $5 billion which could be well  spent to help secure a border by having walls in places that make sense.</p><p>If I were the President, I would dig in on this.

Knowing this might be their only face time with  Google's chief for a long time, lawmakers came armed with a gigabyte's  worth of accusations and questions.  </p><p>At the top of Republicans' agenda, anti-conservative bias in the search  engine.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  We need to be sure that  any political bias within Google's workforce does not creep into its search  product.  </p><p>REP.

Why did Google configure its features and pay for rides to the polls  to get out the Latino vote only in key states?  </p><p>TURNER:  Democrats taking an opposing view.  The leading Democrat on the  Committee, Jerrold Nadler said political bias at Google is no big deal.   And one Democrat even accused Google of an anti-liberal bias.  </p><p>REP.

And I  would like you to look into the overuse of conservative news organizations  to put on liberal people's news on Google.  </p><p>TURNER:  Knowing he would be on the hot seat, Pichai came prepared to  reassure lawmakers and armed with big promises.  He told them \"Google  hasn't ever sold user data to third parties nor will it in the future\".  </p><p>But whether it was enough to allay their concerns over privacy is unclear.</p><p>REP.

It's an  important human right.  And we are committed to upholding that.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TURNER:  Pichai also addressed speculation about Project Dragonfly.  That's  Google's super secret project to develop a tailored search engine for China  where the government have always censored online content.  He confirmed  Google spent months working on a prototype and insisted they have no plans  to launch it.

This is a bipartisan  approach to criminal justice and sentencing reform.  I have been honored to  work with a wide range of bipartisan colleagues.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Part of the McConnell's reluctance is the bill has divided the  Senate GOP.  Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton likens it to a  jailbreak.  </p><p>SENATOR TOM COTTON (R), ARKANSAS:  I don't think the Senate should vote to  let carjackers and bank robbers out of prison.

Mr. Ambassador -- thanks for being here.</p><p>GERARD ARAUD, FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES:  Thank you.</p><p>BAIER:  First, this breaking news out of Strasbourg.  There is a death toll  now, the Associated Press has it at four.  A shooting at a Christmas  market.  Suspect wounded -- it says a terrorism investigation.  </p><p>ARAUD:  Well, apparently, you know, I don't have of course news.  It has  been -- it has happened a few hours ago.  The suspect has not been  arrested.  We know who he is, you know.  Apparently he is an Islamist  terrorist.  He is chased.  There are three or maybe four people who have  been killed but at least 12 have been wounded.  We have been facing this  challenge for some time now unfortunately.  </p><p>BAIER:  The threat from radical -- </p><p>ARAUD:  Radical Islam, yes, it's still there.  </p><p>BAIER:  I want to turn to the protests.  It seems  -- and here is the  French president in his address to the nation.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator):  I feel the anger.   Give us another chance.  I want to see an immediate and real improvement in  the salaries and this is why I am ordering an end of the year bonus for all  employees without any tax.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  He is increasing minimum wage, (INAUDIBLE) tax cuts for retirees,  other concessions as well and yet it doesn't seem like that's stopping the  protests.  </p><p>ARAUD:  You know, in a sense, the powder keg of the explosion was more or  less what we are seeing in the U.S., in U.K. with Brexit, everywhere.  We  have in France like in this country, we have millions of citizens who feel  they have been left behind by globalization, automation.  It's the lower  middle class, the people living in small cities and are rebelling, and they  have been rebelling also against our government, the government of  President Macron, who has been trying to reform France.  So I think that's  the social background of the crisis.  </p><p>BAIER:  It was interesting to watch politicians and people here in this  country, especially on the left because this started as a climate change  effort, this fuel tax.  Neera Tanden with the Center for American Progress  tweeted \"I don't understand why any progressive is cheering French  protesters who are amassing against a carbon tax.\"  There is a real divide  about how to do that if you want to tackle it, especially if you are coming  from the left side of at least American politics.  </p><p>ARAUD:  In French politics, the protesters are saying we are serious  ourselves about bringing change.  But basically they say, one of them said  something very special.  He said we are concerned about the end of the  world, but we also have to be concerned about the end of the month.  So  really it's full of common sense.  When you are increasing the price of gas  for the people, especially for the people living in the rural areas, it has  consequences on the standard of living.  And I think that's what the French  government didn't take into account, so now I think the president has  decided to face this problem.  </p><p>BAIER:  Right.  So he lists all these concessions, he says I'm sorry.  He  wants to do all of these different things, yet it doesn't seem to be  appeasing the protesters which have cost your country a lot of money in  tourism and shopping and everything else.  </p><p>ARAUD:  France are very good demonstrators, that's a tradition in our  country.  We are going to see.  And, of course, there are always people who  are not satisfied with what the president decided, but I think we are going  to see in the coming days whether these demonstrations are going to be as  strong as they were last week.  </p><p>BAIER:  The relationship between President Trump and President Macron,  largely talked about when the two visiting, it was very warm.  You had the  foreign minister saying, \"I say to Donald Trump, the French president told  him as well, we don't take part in American debates.  Let us live our life  in our country.\"  That message sent I guess after the tweets he sent out  about France?  </p><p>ARAUD:  In the family, you have very good squabbles.  So in the Franco- American relationship, you have bumps.  We have had bumps, you have them.   But fundamentally the relationship between the two countries remain  excellent.  </p><p>BAIER:  And they still talk?  </p><p>ARAUD:  And they still talk.  They talk a lot on the phone, yes.  </p><p>BAIER:  I want to turn to another foreign policy issue, and that is Iran.   They've just tested some long-range ballistic missiles.  France was  actually on the forefront of really cracking down on Iran in the nuclear  agreement.  Where do you see Iran today and what could be happening?  </p><p>ARAUD:  Basically, what we have been telling our American friends is that  we take very seriously with the Iranians are doing in terms of missile  activities, in terms of terrorism, in terms of regional aggression, and  that we are ready to work with the Americans on that.  There is a  negotiation actually between the three main European countries and the U.S.  on this issue.  So we are still ready to work with the Americans, and  really we share 100 percent the concerns of the Americans.  </p><p>BAIER:  Do you think a deal is going be repurposed?  </p><p>ARAUD:  We really -- basically, we do consider the decision of the American  administration to get out of the Iranian deal was a bad decision, but we  hope that we can work together on the other issues I have already referred  to, terrorism, regional activities, and missiles.  And actually there are  negotiations between the Europeans and the Americans on these issues.  </p><p>BAIER:  Mr. Ambassador, we appreciate your time.  </p><p>ARAUD:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BAIER:  Thank you.</p><p>The border wall is dividing President Trump and Congressional Democrats,  and the government potentially partially shuts down in 10 days.  The panel  joins me next to go over where things stand.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  I think we can agree on is we  shouldn't shut the government down over a dispute.  And you want to shut it  down.  You keep talking about it.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The last time, Chuck, you  shut it down.  </p><p>SCHUMER:  No, no, no.  Twenty times.</p><p>TRUMP:  And then you opened it up very quickly.  I don't want to do what  you did.  </p><p>SCHUMER:  Twenty times.  Twenty times you have called for I will shut down  the government if I don't get my will.  </p><p>TRUMP:  You know what I'll say?  Yes, if we don't get what we want, I will  shut down the government.  </p><p>SCHUMER:  OK, fair enough.  We disagree.  We disagree.  </p><p>TRUMP:  And I am proud -- and I'll tell you what, I am proud to shut down  the government for border security, Chuck.  </p><p>SCHUMER:  This temper tantrum that he seems to throw will not get him his  wall and it will hurt a lot of people because he will cause a shut down.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  We think we left it in a  pretty good place.  We gave him two possibilities.  They said they would  think about it.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Welcome to divided government in 2019, Oval Office meeting between  the Democratic leadership, the president there fighting for the border wall  funding, later at another event said he was fine with that.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I don't mind having the  issue of border security on my side.  If we have to close down the country  over border security, I actually like that in terms of an issue but I don't  want it to be an issue.  I want it to be something that the country needs.   It's not really an issue.  It's something the country needs.  It's common  sense.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  So where are we as a partial government shutdown looms 10 days from  now?  Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The  Washington Times,\" A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics,  and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review,\" Charlie, it was  quite something to see, obviously, just the moment was quite something to  see.  But then the minority leader saying, you know what, get the cameras  out of here, let's talk.  And then the president turning and saying, Nancy,  it's about transparency.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\":  That's one of the things  I'll never understand, a complaint that I'll never understand in this era  of Trump.  I would think that at the very least people who don't like Trump  and don't like the stuff that he says would at least applaud the fact that  he is, shall we say, transparent.  He doesn't mind having the press in  these meetings.  </p><p>But you got two people here in Pelosi and Schumer who have 60, 65 years of  political experience on the guys.  This guy is a complete novice.  And what  we saw in that 15 minutes in the Oval Office was him completely getting  them -- playing rope-a-dope with them so that they are playing 100 percent  his game.  </p><p>He is right, on the issue of border security, Republicans win that fight,  Trump wins that fight.  In fact, it's what got him elected.  But there are  a couple things that Chuck Schumer said in particular that I thought were  fairly amazing.  One is the line about election matter.  I guess elections  matter except 2016 when Trump won.  And then also he says this having just  lost two seats, a pretty historical difficult thing to do.  </p><p>BAIER:  But then kind of blows it off.  North Dakota and Indiana, who cares  about that?</p><p>HURT:  That was the most astonishing thing out of it to me, the idea that  he would say that when the president brings up North Dakota and Indiana  he's in big trouble, completely dismissing two very important entire  regions of the country.  I thought that he will live to regret that remark.  </p><p>BAIER:  A.B., Democrats seemed to be happy with the fact that they had the  president on camera, on tape saying I will own it.  If it shuts down, I  will own it.  But negotiations are continuing.  </p><p>A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, REAL CLEAR POLITICS:  And to Charlie Hurt,  it's a rope-a-dope.  Look, Republicans have dreaded this moment for months,  and they don't want a government shutdown.  Yes, the Democrats did this  last year and they regretted it very quickly.  As the president pointed  out, they opened it right back up.  Government shutdowns are a loser  particularly when you proclaim that you want one and you are the architect  of the shutdown.  You will get blamed.  </p><p>Republicans still have a majority in the Senate and the House.  They don't  want to shut the government down on their watch.  The Democrats like Nancy  Pelosi are saying you guys have the votes, you guys fund the government.   You're right, it's a partial shutdown.  It's only five agencies left, about  20 percent of the discretionary spending, but it still is a political loser  to shut the government down and jump up and down smiling about it.  </p><p>It doesn't matter that border security is not a potent issue.  It is.  The  wall is a popular policy idea among Republicans.  But shutting the  government down is never a good idea, so Republicans like Mitch McConnell  had to come out and clean up and say I don't know what happened with that  contentious meeting, but we don't want to shut the government down.  </p><p>BAIER:  Let's listen to the Senate majority leader.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I understand it was a rather  spirited meeting that we all watched.  But I'd still like to see a smooth  ending here, and I haven't given up hope that's what we'll have.  </p><p>SEN. PATRICK LEAHY, (D) VERMONT:  This is irresponsible.  If you saw it a  comedy show or you saw it on some television program you might think, OK,  this goes over the top.  Well, it does go over the top.  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA:  I talked to the president just a  few minutes ago, and I told him you are right to make this request, this  demand.  He seems pretty dug in.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Jonah, there is going to be horse-trading over the next 10 days, a  lot of it.  We could be seeing the beginning dance of what could be a lot  of things that happen on Capitol Hill.  </p><p>JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\":  We could be.  We could  also be looking for faces in clouds.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GOLDBERG:  I think in six months we will look back at this White House  meeting and marvel at the level of decorum and civility.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GOLDBERG:  We'll be nostalgic for this kind of thing.  All this seemed like  with Chuck Schumer and Trump was like -- as a New Yorker I know the types - - two old guys fighting over whose cab it is.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GOLDBERG:  And it's going to get worse.  I agree with some of the things  Charlie said about transparency and all that, but the idea that this was  100 percent Trumps game and rope-a-dope, Republicans on the Hill were  calling it the Schumer shutdown right before this meeting.  They can't call  it Schumer shutdown anymore.  I think at minimum the Democrats, they can  overplay their hand, they get strategy wrong all the time.  But they went  in hoping to get what they got today.  </p><p>BAIER:  Right, but for the base, Charlie, the president, this is probably  his last chance to stand up and say I want this wall funding.  </p><p>HURT:  So obviously it's very good, this is an important issue for the  base.  But if you move away from the word \"wall\" and start talking about  border security, which is kind of the thing that's being debated here,  that's far more widely popular beyond just the Republican base.  That is  where you start eating into a lot of Democratic support.  And when you have  people in the party who are legitimately in favor of sanctuary cities and  legitimately opposed to any kind of border security, that's a winner for  Republicans.  </p><p>I also think we should be careful overstating how damaging a shutdown is.   Obviously, it's very disruptive around here.  But remember the last time  Republicans got blamed for a shutdown, they went on to win historic, in  2012, went on to win historic margins in the House.  So I think that we get  really upset about this sort of thing because it's so unusual, but I don't  think that beyond here it makes quite as big a difference.  </p><p>BAIER:  We'll have many panels to discuss this going forward.  Next up,  Google's CEO takes questions on Capitol Hill.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, GOOGLE CEO:  I lead this company without political bias and  work to ensure that our products continue to operate in that way.  To do  otherwise would be against our core principles and our business interests.  </p><p>KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  We need to be sure that any  political bias within Google's workforce does not creep into its search  products.  </p><p>ZOE LOFGREN, (D-CA) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  If you Google the word  \"idiot\" under images, a picture of Donald Trump comes up.  I just did that.  </p><p>TED LIEU, (D-CA) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  If you're getting bad press  articles and bad search results, don't blame Google or Facebook or Twitter.   Consider blaming yourself.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  OK, Google's CEO up on Capitol Hill taking a lot of questions, a  lot of heat.  We're back with the panel.  What do we gain from this?  Is  there anything that comes out of this, Jonah?  </p><p>GOLDBERG:  To be honest, I don't know.  I don't think this was one of  Congress's finest moments.  A lot of them seem like the modern equivalent  of the oldster who doesn't know how to set the clock on the VCR the way  they were talking about some this technology.  Look, 90 percent of web  searches are by Google.  That's an important thing.  That makes looking  into abuse of monopoly power, antitrust stuff a legitimate concern for  Congress.  We are entering into a brave new world with a lot of issues that  we've never really tackled before.  </p><p>So I encourage Congress to look into this.  I don't think worrying about  this pure bias of Google searches things is the best face for this.  There  are more important issues.  But you could also see Google asking for  regulation, which is what these big companies often end up doing because it  locks in their market share.  </p><p>BAIER:  Right.  A.B., there is a serious side to all of this, and that is  something is going to happen eventually on Capitol Hill when it comes to  big tech.  </p><p>STODDARD:  There is a day or a period of reckoning upon them, and they know  that, which is why every hearing that they attend when they get asked about  their opportunities in China and they get to sort of deflect around that,  or they spend most of the entirety of the three hours talking about bias on  their engines is a good day for them, because what they don't want to talk  about his antitrust violations and that kind of bipartisan push, and it is  bipartisan, coming in the future.  </p><p>The Congress has shown itself in these hearing setting where we are all  cringing like this at what the next guy is going to say, and their staffs  are in the background, who should be replacing them at the hearings, by the  way, asking all the questions.  And you can just see the pillars, the  leaders who are giving this testimony are trying to not smile, because they  know if they can run out the clock and not talk about major changes and  just say we can't share our algorithms, but we promise you there's no bias.   Or, it's true, we are trying to improve our privacy protections, that they  can push it off for another year while Congress tries to keep pace with  this furious rate of change.  </p><p>BAIER:  And it's furious.  Here is Bob Goodlatte talking about collecting  data.  This is a big issue here.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE, (R-VA) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  With  Americans carrying their smartphones all day every day, Google is able to  collect an amount of information about its users that would even make the  NSA blush.  I think it is fair to say that most Americans have no idea the  sheer volume of detailed information that is collected.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  That is a true statement.  We don't know how much data is being  collected.  </p><p>HURT:  But we do know that it's truly terrifying, the amount of  information, the amount of very, very personal information that these  companies are vacuuming up.  And as I think Jonah and A.B. both pointed  out, looking at -- watching hearings like we saw today, it just underscores  the folly of expecting the federal government to somehow protect Americans'  interests in this field.  Honestly, at the end of the day, and I'm deeply  suspicious of all of these companies, especially that phone thing that  tracks you everywhere, but at the end of the day, the answer is don't give  them any of your information.  </p><p>BAIER:  Yes.  He can set his VCR clock.  I think he can.</p><p>GOLDBERG:  I'll take that action.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BAIER:  You'll take that action?  </p><p>Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge back for a quick  correction now.  Catherine?  </p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  That's  right.  Earlier this evening, Bret, we reported citing a court filing that  Maria Butina met with a candidate believed to be Donald Trump.  We now  understand that she did meet with a candidate but it was not Trump.   Butina, did, however, ask the president a question at a public event in  2015 and we are happy to clarify it, Bret.  </p><p>BAIER:  All right, Catherine, thank you.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p>BAIER:  We'll follow that story and others.  When we come back, a special  moment in the airport.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  Finally tonight, a really great moment, travelers at the Nashville  airport stopped in their tracks to sing the National Anthem.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(SINGING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  The moment was captured over the weekend as an American Airlines  flight was taking children who lost their parents in combat to a trip to  Disney World.  So everybody stopped and started singing the National  Anthem.  Airport travelers took notice after an announcement was made as  the kids were boarding.  It was impromptu, and the military was there to  salute the families as well.  That's a great moment.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.  That's it for the SPECIAL  REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

He <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/13/earthquake-have-created-boris-johnsons-victory-speech-tory-headquarters/\">calls his Cabinet a One Nation government</url>, given its ambition for higher public service spending, regional infrastructure investment and minimum wage increases. His musings on regulation, free trade and the nanny state often sound liberal, if not libertarian.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To confuse matters more, his proposed state aid laws suggest he's partial to some old-school national collectivist thinking too. Anyone hoping for a principles-based coherent economic agenda during this Parliament will be disappointed.</p><p>One concept the prime minister does appear to intuitively understand though is the importance of economic growth. His desire to \"unleash the potential\" of the country might not be based on theoretical models, like Gordon Brown's penchant for \"post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory\".</p><p>But in acknowledging wealth must be produced before being spent, Johnson understands that growth is the essential precondition for the rising wages, regional levelling-up and better public services promised in today's Queen's Speech.</p><p>A legacy of the Blair and Brown era is that we spend inordinate time in politics debating distributional issues, analysing \"winners and losers\". Rich are pitched against poor, young against old, North against South. Deficit reduction from 2010 necessitated tough spending choices, adding to this zero-sum economic framing in respect of government departments or local government - the idea that one person's gain must be another's loss. </p><p>Yet faster economic growth eases these constraints. It allows \"having your cake and eating it,\" as Boris might say. An economy growing more quickly means stronger public finances, faster wage growth, and people far less occupied with comparing their spoils. Positive sum, not zero sum. </p><p>The central economic problem the UK has faced over the past decade is simply too little growth. Whether it was the cause or simply reflective of a past unsustainable trend, the crisis's aftermath heralded <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/13/earthquake-have-created-boris-johnsons-victory-speech-tory-headquarters/\">a period of dire productivity growth performance</url>.</p><p>GDP per capita is over 20pc below where it would have been had pre-crisis productivity trends continued, with annual growth falling from over 2pc to just over 0.4pc. </p><p>Forecasters initially predicted a productivity bounceback was just around the corner. But tomorrow never came. Conservative chancellors each year therefore stood at the despatch box to announce weak growth forecasts, before proceeding to do little about it. Then came Brexit.</p><p>Uncertainty about trading relations and a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/13/earthquake-have-created-boris-johnsons-victory-speech-tory-headquarters/\">Corbyn premiership has cast a long shadow over investment</url> and location decisions since 2016. Under these and demographic headwinds, we've become so depressingly accustomed to weak growth that its absence barely features in public debate. Which is why Boris's rhetoric is so encouraging.</p><p>The positive stock market reaction to his victory suggests seeing off Corbyn and the declining probability of a \"no-deal\" Brexit will deliver somewhat of an investment fillip, as Boris claimed. We might also see some near-term macroeconomic stimulus, although any investment projects will have muted economic effects given lead times and the likelihood the Bank of England would offset any demand pressure that raised inflation. </p><p>Given the size of his majority though, the prime minister's economic ambitions should extend far beyond delivering a short-term sugar rush. With unemployment low and migration likely to be curtailed, the scope for GDP boosts from simply adding workers is diminishing anyway. Robust productivity growth is therefore crucial to deliver the tax revenues and wage increases needed to make Boris's first term a clear economic success.</p><p>His team know this, and recognise they have a narrow time frame of electoral goodwill to do something about the contentious land-use planning regime, for example. Our byzantine mess of a system constrains economically successful areas from growing, especially through green belts.</p><p>But it also reduces the prospect of certain firms achieving efficient premises scale in industries such as retail, social care and childcare, due to limited space and/or high rents.</p><p>There's obvious pro-investment policy the government could opt for, including letting corporations write off spending on buildings and capital equipment immediately against tax.</p><p>The litmus test of whether Boris is serious about growth will come from how he intends to repay working-class towns he won. The political imperative to be seen to \"help\" may lead to resources thrown at high street, town and hospital regeneration, as tried and failed under New Labour.</p><p>Hare-brained ideas for government schemes to help locals acquire shop space or incentivise them to stay where they were born are already proliferating. This sort of stuff, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/12/13/earthquake-have-created-boris-johnsons-victory-speech-tory-headquarters/\">plus attacks on big tech</url>, is just a form of winner to loser distributional politics Boris should avoid.</p><p>If you tax success to subsidise failure, you'll end up with more failure. It doesn't mean nothing can be done. But new interventions or infrastructure should work with market signals, not against them. Removing bottlenecks to growth or joining areas to thriving markets by better transport infrastructure is what works.</p><p>Given our population density, economic thinkers Stian Westlake and Sam Bowman think the best way to help poor towns' residents is to remove government barriers to moving while improving connectivity between successful city hubs and close-by towns.</p><p>While Boris does not have an economic ideology then, the sheer size of his majority has given him an opportunity to crack thorny structural economic challenges.</p><p>There's a potential future where he is ruthless in eliminating barriers to growth, makes infrastructure decisions to obtain the biggest bang for the buck, broadens our free trading horizons and improves tax incentives to invest.</p><p>In that world, GDP is somewhat higher, public service pressures are that bit more manageable and economic opportunity has broadened into the regions of his new voters. Now, that's a potential worth unleashing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-58827419</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSJ-RM31-F021-61P7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1041\"/><timeReceived>7:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

And Mr. Johnson seems willing to call a general election this fall if Parliament tries to block a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>In Spain: Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, whose Socialist Party victory in April\u2019s elections was seen by E.U. leaders as a vote of confidence against the rising tides of nationalism and populism in the bloc, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/world/europe/spain-socialists-government.html\">failed to form an alliance</url> that would re-elect him in Parliament, moving the country closer to another national election. </p><p>U.S. Senate report outlines Russian election meddling</p><p>Election systems in all 50 U.S. states were targeted by Russia in 2016, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/politics/russian-hack-of-elections-system-was-far-reaching-report-finds.html\">the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded</url>, painting a Russian intelligence effort more far-reaching than the federal government had previously acknowledged.</p><p>But the report \u2014 the first from the committee\u2019s investigation into 2016 election meddling \u2014 was so heavily redacted at the demand of American intelligence agencies that key lessons for 2020 were blacked out. </p><p>While not directly critical of either American intelligence agencies or the states, the report described what amounted to a cascading intelligence failure.</p><p>Details: The findings landed just hours after Senator Mitch McConnell stepped forward to block consideration of a package of election security bills, and a day after the special counsel Robert Mueller warned that Russia was moving again to interfere. </p><p>Other Capitol Hill news: After Mr. Mueller\u2019s testimony, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/politics/impeach-trump-pelosi-nadler.html\">demands for impeachment</url> are growing louder and more divisive. Four more House Democrats came out on Thursday in support of beginning impeachment proceedings against President Trump, but a majority of Democratic caucus members remain skeptical about what they see as a politically perilous push.</p><p>Heat wave blazes across Western Europe</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/world/europe/heatwave-record-temperatures.html\">dangerous heat wave</url> swept across the region on Thursday, with the temperature in Paris soaring to almost 43 degrees Celsius, or nearly 110 degrees Fahrenheit, the hottest in recorded history. Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands all set national records, too. </p><p>Scientists say the hottest summers in Europe in the past 500 years have all come in the last 17 years. Several heat waves have been linked to human-caused climate change, and many more are likely <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/climate/europe-heat-wave.html?searchResultPosition=2&amp;module=inline\">to scorch temperate zones</url> like northern Europe in the future.</p><p>Climate politics: The northern French town of Grande-Synthe has been a vibrant laboratory of pragmatic green policies.

But these issues raise questions about the social media company\u2019s efforts to quash disinformation, and reflect the struggles of big tech firms and governments to counter it. </p><p>New data deal: Tech giants\u2019 corporate wealth is built on harvesting and commercializing the information supplied by online multitudes. As the backlash against Facebook and other tech giants intensifies, a growing collection of people are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/business/calls-mount-to-ease-big-techs-grip-on-your-data.html\">calling for a better bargain</url> on how these companies use their data. </p><p>Side note: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/technology/chris-hughes-facebook-breakup.html\">Facebook\u2019s co-founder, Chris Hughes</url>, and antitrust academics have been meeting with government officials to argue that for nearly a decade, Facebook has been acquiring companies to protect its dominant position in the market for social networks. </p><p>How Turkey purges its intellectuals</p><p>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought to dismantle the country\u2019s academic sector in an attempt to consolidate his grip on power.</p><p>Since 2017, about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/magazine/the-era-of-people-like-you-is-over-how-turkey-purged-its-intellectuals.html\">6,000 academics have been fired</url>.

It appears to be a political statement by Tehran, acting both as a carefully calibrated effort at escalation \u2014 and as a message to Europe.</p><p>ASAP Rocky: The rapper was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/arts/music/asap-rocky-charged-sweden.html\">charged with assault</url> on Thursday and will remain in custody until his trial on Tuesday, Swedish prosecutors said.

They're wasting their time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Mueller mania strikes in the United States as the former Special Counsel prepares to publicly testify.

I'm Christiane Amanpour in London, where today, the United Kingdom got a new prime minister. To know one's surprise, the favorite Boris Johnson was selected by an inner circle of Conservative Party members.</p><p>In his victory speech, he whipped up the crowd with his typical bombast.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNSON: I know some wag has already pointed out that deliver, unite and defeat was not the perfect acronym for an election campaign since unfortunately it spells DUD. But they forgot the final \"E\" my friends, \"E\" for energize. And I say to all the doubters, \"Dude, we are going to energize the country. We are going to get Brexit done.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Unusual language and style for a British prime minister. A populist politician who fronted the leave campaign with what the E.U. referendum with what \"The New York Times\" describes as a loose relationship with truth or principle.</p><p>Johnson won the leadership contest by a margin of more than 40,000 votes, which is a lot considering the selection process was only open to the party membership, some 160,000 people. That's just 0.2 percent of the whole electorate. And tomorrow, Johnson will enter number 10 Downing Street as prime minister. Theresa May exits and the country faces not only an uphill struggle with Brexit but serious tensions with Iran.</p><p>So, let's get straight to what this change at the top means with Michael Fallon. He's the former U.K. defense secretary. He backed Boris Johnson during the campaign. And he's joining me now here in our London studio.</p><p>Welcome to the program.</p><p>MICHAEL FALLON, FORMER BRITISH DEFENSE SECRETARY: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I first want to ask for everybody, actually, who has been saying Boris Johnson bears a distinct resemblance in look and style to Donald Trump. And President Trump today gave a speech in Washington where he called Boris Johnson Britain's Trump. Is that what you've bargained for? You who are a backer want a British Trump?</p><p>FALLON: Well, not necessarily a British Trump but to somebody who is already an ally of the president, has a good relationship with him. I remember the first time I think they met at a NATO summit just after the president had taken office. You know, they made a beeline for each other, they clearly get on well. When Boris was foreign secretary, they worked well together. That's important to us in Britain, to have somebody who works well with your president, whoever your elected president is.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But people have pointed out that he's very much like Trump in that Trump has played the, you know, divisive card. You've got the racist tweets, you've got the anti-immigrant sentiment, you've got the populism that has become sort of de facto in politics today.</p><p>FALLON: Well, I think with respect we've got to be careful about this. Boris for eight years was mayor of London. One of the most ethnically diverse cities around and was very much social liberal in our terms, in our terms of the Conservative Party and was an early adopter of some of the (INAUDIBLE) legislation and so on. So, I don't think he's like your president in that respect.</p><p>But yes, he's populist and yes, he's an optimist. And you heard that in his acceptance speech today. He is very much somebody who sees the best of Britain and thinks we can get through the challenge of Brexit and find a new role for ourselves in the world.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I just want to pick you a little bit on this point and then perhaps you can put it to bed. You know, Boris Johnson has used words like pickaninnies to describe Africans, he's talked about Muslim women in their traditional garb looking like letter boxes. I mean, he's talked about Barack Obama, when he was president, having a historical ancestral dislike of Britain because he was born to a Kenyan father. Put to rest then these fears about Boris Johnson and these kinds of things he says.</p><p>FALLON: Well, I must be careful how I do that because Boris Johnson, of course, was a journalist. And saying that you, I've got to be careful. He was a colorful journalist. He's been using for 20- or 30-years colorful language in his journalism.</p><p>[13:05:00]</p><p>But that article, for example, on the rights of the women to wear the burqa, he was actually standing up for that right, if you read the article.</p><p>He uses colorful phrases. He's apologized all along in this campaign for anybody who might have been offended by his previous journalism. But that's what he is. He was a journalist. That was his stock and trade.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You know, I hate, again, to pick you again because he was a journalist and he got fired for telling some lies about stories and misquoting people. And people have said, again, this is a very, very important time. As I quoted \"The New York Times,\" his relationship with the truth and with principle is somewhat sketchy.</p><p>And, you know, the big emblazoned figure on the (INAUDIBLE) and the campaign was total nonsense. It wasn't a true figure. It isn't happening. What he said about Turks wanting to invade Britain was a nonsense. Very inflammatory.</p><p>So, I guess I'm asking you this not just to pick at him but to know how he's going to unite a country, how he is going to work with people and politicians from Europe and the rest to actually, you know, achieve something that this country needs, and that is a proper Brexit deal and a proper exit.</p><p>FALLON: Well, I'm in the going it get back over all the individual phrases that he used when he was a journalist. And during the referendum campaign, whether we should stay in the European union or not, there were claims and counterclaims made from both sides that probably didn't stand up to excessive scrutiny, if you like.</p><p>But I think the point about Boris Johnson is, he also has solid senior experience in public office. Running the City of London for two consecutive terms, for eight years, being foreign secretary for two years, alongside the defense secretary. We shaped the coalition with the help of our allies, including the United States to fight Daesh ISIS terrorism in the Middle East. He stood up to Russia, if you remember the Salisbury poisonings. This is a man who looked after the British interest when the going got tough.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do you worry, though? I mean, you rightly point out that he was foreign secretary when you were defense secretary. I mean, you've seen all the articles, you've seen the foreign service officers who talked about the day he resigned a year ago as liberation day in the Foreign and Commonwealth officer.</p><p>I mean, they called him unprepared, gaffe prone, unfocussed. Are you concerned about that, given the massive nature, as we've seen over the past three years, of trying to secure a Brexit? Are you concerned about that? How will he do any different than what prime minister May did?</p><p>FALLON: Well, Diplomats, I think, are always concerned about language and words. That's their stock and trade. I think every foreign secretary we've had and who knows, perhaps some of your secretaries of state have tripped up occasionally with the odd slip of the tongue for which they've had to apologize because these things sometimes do matter in international diplomacy.</p><p>But when it came to the really tough decisions and some of the operations that he had to authorize, some of the steps had to be taken to protect us from terrorism, I have no doubt at all that Boris Johnson was then and will be a very serious defender of the British interest. No, he's not the same as Theresa May. Quite clear. She was a very different political animal, if you like, a lot more introverted, very shy, very dutiful but very different, obviously, to Boris Johnson.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, what magic source would he bring to this mix that suddenly makes Europe say, \"Whoa, there's a new prime minister who is saying we're going to be out deal or no deal. We don't want the back stop. We don't want this deal that Theresa May negotiated painstakingly\"? What is he going to do? What is he going to offer? What is different?</p><p>FALLON: The big thing that is different is Boris Johnson is a Brexiteer. He believes in us leaving the European Union. Theresa May didn't. She voted remain. No, nothing -- no -- (INAUDIBLE) I voted remain. But Boris Johnson is a Brexiteer. He believes in this. He thinks there is a future, a strong future for Britain outside the European Union.</p><p>So, he is bringing ambition and optimism and energy to this task. And he's also will be trading on the fact that parliament does not like the present deal that was negotiated by Theresa May. Parliament wants a better deal. It's not just Boris Johnson who wants a better deal. Parliament itself would not accept the inferior deal that Theresa May presented it. So, he's going to go out there and get us a better deal.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, of course, everybody wants to know what will the ingredients of that better deal be and how would he do a better job of getting the Europeans to agree to a better deal than Theresa May? And to that point, I would like to read from what the former party leader and former foreign secretary, William Hague, has written in the \"The Daily Telegraph.\"</p><p>He said, you know, \"You have steadily advocated and improved deal with the E.U. but you've steadily made that pretty much impossible to obtain when you ruled out changes to the Irish backstop last week and insisted that it must be removed altogether.</p><p>[13:10:00]</p><p>You dismayed some of your advisors and delighted others. But the delighted are those who believe that the E.U. will back away completely from the withdrawal agreement that they spent two years negotiating in favor of something that you like and they call that fantasy.\"</p><p>FALLON: Well, already you've seen today the European leaders welcome the election of Boris Johnson as our leader, saying they're ready to sit down and work with him. They want to avoid, by the way, no deal. They want to avoid a disorderly exit.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But Boris says deal or no deal, do or die.</p><p>FALLON: Of course. But he's had to say that to make sure they understand that we're serious about this. But there are neighbors, particularly Ireland and France and Belgium and Netherlands who would be particularly hurt by no deal. They don't want that either. So, everybody will be sitting down to see, \"OK, can we improve this?\" Particularly as Parliament wanted. Better arrangements for Northern Ireland and we don't want to be trapped in something that looks like the existing Customs Union forever.</p><p>So, there are ways in which this language can be improved and that we can get something that will get through parliament. But you can only do that if you really believe in it. And Boris Johnson does believe in it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yeah, I mean, I'm impressed by your faith and in his faith and his optimism.</p><p>FALLON: Sure.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But this is a very difficult --</p><p>FALLON: I don't need to tell you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- I don't need to tell you, negotiation that's been going on for the better part of more than two years. We talked about President Trump and the need to have a strong relationship between the leaders of both countries. Former Labour Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, was in the studio this week. And he was concerned with what appears to be egging on Boris Johnson to take the American view come what may and to, you know, somewhat make Europe second party. Let's just listen to what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORDON BROWN, FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I think Boris Johnson is under a huge amount of pressure from his own Brexiteers, those people who are hardline anti-European. And they would prefer to see an even stronger relationship with the United States even if it's based on effectively taking instructions from President Trump. So, I think he is under a great deal of pressure in that respect.</p><p>But I do feel that he is going have to show that he is also independent, and I think this will be the test of the first few days. For example, you know, when you become prime minister, you have calls. They go in a row. Who do you call first? Who takes the call first? Is it going to be President Donald Trump or is it going to be Angela Merkel? Is it going to Emmanuel Macron?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, he was discussing the first days in office. So, what does Boris Johnson have to do to prove he's not going to \"take instructions\" from the United States? You know, we know he threw Kim Darroch under the bus because President Trump wasn't happy with what Kim Darroch said, that's what the foreign office says, that's what Darroch and his people say, that's what the commentary is. It's a touchy situation now.</p><p>FALLON: Let's just reel back a bit. He already proved that he doesn't have to take instructions from President Trump because of the stance he took on Iran, if you remember, when he was foreign secretary and Americans decided they wanted to withdraw from the nuclear agreement. We didn't go that way. Boris Johnson has defended the European agreement because he believed at the time that actually it was the best way of delaying Iran's nuclear program.</p><p>So, there's already a difference of view between Boris Johnson and Donald Trump and there will be other examples of where, as a good friend and a strong ally, the British prime minister occasionally will disagree with the American president.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do you think he will actively -- as Theresa May advised, actively try to lobby President Trump to get back into the deal or some version of the deal? Would you support that?</p><p>FALLON: Well, I think there's going to be have to be. I think the Americans are already to some form of renegotiation of that particular agreement. I think John Bolton has already made that clear and you've seen what has been happening on the international waterway since we've lost one of our tankers that's been captured.</p><p>So, in the end, somebody is going to have to renegotiate with Iran to bring some sense into this situation, which is fairly dangerous at the moment. But the point I'm making to you is it does not follow that Boris Johnson will automatically do what the president wants. He still believes that it is better to have some form of agreement with Iran over its nuclear program that buys us all a bit of time.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, we introduce you in this segment right now as being amidst a Brexit struggle and bit -- also a crisis, as you just point out in the Gulf. You're the former defense secretary. What does the new government do to get back the tanker, to resolve this situation, presumably diplomatically?</p><p>FALLON: Well, diplomatically, but I think we also have to show you that these were crimes to sell oil to the certain regime, which is what is alleged is a crime. But to take one of our tankers out of Iranian (ph) water is also crime. These are criminal acts and they can't be accepted.</p><p>[13:15:00]</p><p>So, we will have to divorce this from the nuclear program and make it clear to Iran that we'll have to take extra steps now to protect international waterway with a multinational taskforce, which I hope, by the way, will include the American Navy and American support but will also include ships from other European neighbors.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, you see it getting more tense? More of a buildup?</p><p>FALLON: Well, it's getting more tense. Now, everybody wants to de- escalade it. But that shouldn't excuse what Iran has done and we shouldn't allow, you know, our concerns about the Iran's nuclear program or the survival of the agreement to any way excuse what Iran has done or the need to protect our oil and gas supplies through that particular strait.</p><p>AMANPOUR: The Iranian foreign minister reached out to Boris Johnson saying that Iran was not looking for conflict. Is that something that you would - -</p><p>FALLON: Well, it's a strange way not to look for conflict by capturing one of our tankers and refusing to hand it back. So, you know, this is, I'm afraid, a very tense situation at the moment. Obviously, we don't want to escalade it. But equally, we'll have to start properly patrolling this international waterway.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Very interesting times. Thank you very much for weighing in.</p><p>FALLON: Pleasure.</p><p>AMANPOUR: With this new leadership, the new prime minister. And now, we're going to get the view from Europe. So, while Boris Johnson has overwhelming support from the pro-Brexit Conservative Party membership, the European Union is going to be a bit harder, perhaps, to win over.</p><p>The E.U. and Boris Johnson have a storied and troubled relationship. At a press conference, the incoming E.U. Chief, Ursula von der Leyen, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, reached out to the future British prime minister with talk of future challenges.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): I am willing to work closely with him not only on European issues, including the Brexit negotiations, but also on international issues on which we are tightly coordinated specifically with the British and the Germans, could it be the Iran situation or any international security issue.</p><p>URSULA VON DER LEYEN, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT-ELECT: I'm looking forward to have a good working relationship with him. There are many different and difficult issues to tackle together. We have challenging times ahead of us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, what is in store for the future of this relationship? Mairead McGuinness, the vice president of the European Parliament joins us from Brussels.</p><p>Ms. McGuinness, thank you very much indeed for joining our program again.</p><p>MAIREAD MCGUINNESS, VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Good evening.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Good evening. Well, you heard what Boris backer and former defense secretary, Michael Fallon, just said that the E.U. is going to see an energized optimistic Boris Johnson, can do and hopefully you will all be open to some kind of renegotiation or opening where you weren't to Theresa May.</p><p>MCGUINNESS: Well, I think the first part I'll accept. The second part not so. I think it's welcome that there is a new leader in the United Kingdom who talks about energy and all of these strong words, which makes the people feel good. I think leaders need to do that. I think when you come then to the Brussels issues, I think the incoming president of the commission, for a Von der Leyen, is very clear there are challenges ahead of us.</p><p>So, today is a day, really, to wish the new leader of the United Kingdom, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, well because he has a lot on his shoulders. But I think it's over time we'll see what can happen in terms of the relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom and on the difficult issue of Brexit.</p><p>I think it's quite interesting, the language is very sharp and very clear. But on the other hand, sometimes the clearest of language is the most opaque because this idea of getting Brexit done suggests that once and for all, finito (ph), we can do it on a day and move onwards. But, in fact, we all know that that is not the case. That with a withdrawal agreement that is acceptable, we can move on to the implementation and we can get to the new relationship.</p><p>With a no deal Brexit, which is do or die scenario, if you like, in that case, there will still be issues to deal with after there is a departure with no deal. And I hope I'm making sense. So, this is a complicated process. We just have the new leader elected in the United Kingdom, and we have to wait and see what will happen when, I suppose, there are files read and issues to be dealt with both domestic, which are quite, you know, serious, international issues like Iran, and clearly, the relationship with the European Union.</p><p>But, you know, here at the European Parliament, we've been getting on with our work but people are talking about needing to have a good relationship with the prime minister, whoever it is. And I think it's -- one of the key points, and I need to stress this, is that regardless of whose name is over the door and there is a change now from Theresa May to Boris Johnson, the facts and the issues remain the same. The approaches might be different, but we have to still deal with the --</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK.</p><p>MCGUINNESS: -- (INAUDIBLE) that the Prime Minister Theresa May in all good faith, she worked with us on those and indeed, she had to turn corners when she realized that her commitments, for example, to Northern Ireland, to the Good Friday [13:20:00] Agreement could not be dealt with if she kept to her very lines that she announced at the Tory Party --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Right. And I wonder whether you think that --</p><p>MCGUINNESS: The deal on the table reflects her concerns.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I wonder if you think, and I'm going to play a little bit of Boris Johnson's sort of explanation and reach out to the E.U. and to his own party, obviously, whether he may have boxed himself in, as well. So, let's play this for a moment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNSON: We're going to get Brexit done on October 31st, we are going to take advantage of all the opportunities that it will bring in a new spirit of \"can do\" and we are once against going to believe in ourselves and what we could achieve. And like slumbering giant, we are going to rise and ping off the guy ropes of self-doubt and negativity.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, some might call that highfalutin rhetoric. How do you read that, ping off the ropes, achieve Brexit, can do? I mean, he did actually say the other day that if 50 years ago one put people on the moon, then surely one can overcome technical difficulties to monitor the Irish border. Do you see it that way?</p><p>MCGUINNESS: Well, before I address that point, the line that stuck out for me in the clip you played is where Johnson is saying to the British nation, \"We have to believe in ourselves again.\" What troubles me is, when did Britain and the United Kingdom stop believing in themselves? I mean, that's quite a staggering statement from the leader of a country and that he believes that overnight he can change that dynamic. I would talk that the British people who are very proud people and a big nation, have self- belief. I think we all need that as nations and as peoples.</p><p>Then to your question about his analogy with space and the Irish border and mixing these things up, you know, perhaps getting to the moon is simpler than dealing with the complexities of relationships between people that have been strained for decades, where we have built a peace process that is still delicate but working and where we need as people to continue that process and not put obstacles in its way.</p><p>So, I think that the colorful language is great and it makes great headlines. And the one thing I have in common with Boris Johnson is that I too was a journalist. I think, perhaps, the difference is that when I moved and was elected to politics, I dropped all my journalist friends. I don't believe I'm a journalist now. I'm a politician. I have the interests of people at heart. I'm not here to make headlines. If I do that, that's separate from the work I do.</p><p>And I think that perhaps the new prime minister with all the huge responsibilities taking on, he wanted this job, I think, more than anything else. He now has it. And I'm wondering in private and quiet moments if he gets them, will he look in the mirror and say, \"My gosh. I've achieved this, my dream, but I want to make sure it doesn't become a nightmare.\"</p><p>And therefore, we all have to work together on Brexit to make sure that if it's going to happen it does it in a very sensible and coherent way and that it doesn't damage any of us, either the United Kingdom or the European Union.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK.</p><p>MCGUINNESS: And the truth is, it will damage us a little, all of us, but we have to minimize that damage and I hope we can work together and achieve that.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, so, let me ask you this, you said we have to work together in sort of a collegiate way to achieve something that is to all of our benefit. But the former British prime minister, Gordon Brown, told me yesterday that Boris Johnson has \"promised U.K. voters that he will not pay dues to the E.U.\" That is a real problem for the E.U. If we're breaking that agreement, it looks effectively like a declaration of economic war. I mean, that's not a friendly collegial thing to say, as he's, you know, about to try to enter negotiations with you.</p><p>MCGUINNESS: Well, look, lots of things are said in the heat of battle. And I think those amongst us who hear all these things and write them down just reflect quietly on them and then deal with where we're at today. If you take that pace of a hard Brexit and pulling away from commitments that were entered into in good faith, I think that will, if you like, hit back more on the United Kingdom as a nation that is trying to go off on its own and build relationships perhaps with the U.S. and elsewhere.</p><p>And it will need to have a reputation that it respects its agreements. That's very important in global relationships. And the idea of walking away and not paying the bill, I think, wouldn't look particularly well. And I'm not sure that advisers or indeed the prime minister would like it to be presented as that.</p><p>At the end of the day, the European Union of 28 came together voluntarily, including the United Kingdom. You've made a decision now. The U.K.'s made a decision to leave. But we have to do it with respect to each other. We also have to respect the rules of the European Union. We are now going to be a club of 27.</p><p>We don't want to change our rules because one is leaving. But we do want to try and have a very good relationship in the future with this country that would still be close to us physically and otherwise, we hope. But it is not going to be the same as full membership.</p><p>So, my worry about the events today is not so much that we have more negotiations but the timelines are very tight. There will be a [13:25:00] Tory Party conference, I think, on the 29th of September and then, there is to be a D-Day of Brexit again October 31st, and then there is August recess.</p><p>So, in terms of getting down to, you know, dealing with each other, understanding each other, going through the details of the withdrawal agreement, perhaps explaining it more in detail to the prime minister, there isn't a lot of time to do all of that. And I think -- I already met, you know, sectors today from -- example, from the Equine (ph) industry, from Northern Ireland, from the Republic of Ireland, from -- across Europe who are deeply concerned about Brexit happening in a very disorderly way, and they're just one sector, there are others that will be, you know, watching and waiting for all the commentary of today and tomorrow and the next days, trying, if you like, to understand what will happen.</p><p>And here is the rub for all of us, three years ago, when the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, no one would have predicted a change of leader, a lengthy process, U-turns along the way, different red lines, you know, all sorts of things that happened. No one would have predicted that today we would have a third leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister of the United Kingdom.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Right.</p><p>MCGUINNESS: And there is not one of us, an me included, who can predict the next steps --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>MCGUINNESS: -- even if they are only weeks away.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Indeed. These are very tricky times. Thank you for trying to guide us through them. Mairead McGuinness from the European Parliament, Thank you so much indeed.</p><p>Now, Boris Johnson hopes to offset Brexit with an ambitious trade deal with Washington. It is something President Trump, who's long favored Boris Johnson, has repeatedly hinted at. But easier said than done. And it's hardly the top of the president's agenda right now because there are so many other things he's dealing with, what, with a racist route, dragging on with four congresswomen of color and the hugely anticipated public testimony of Robert Mueller before Congress tomorrow.</p><p>Joining me for more on all of this is Senator Pat Toomey, Republican from Pennsylvania. He has been one of the few in his party who isn't afraid to criticize the president. And he's joining us now from Washington.</p><p>Senator Toomey, welcome back to the program.</p><p>SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R-PA): Thanks for having me.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I can just ask you first since I'm just sort of making a connection between our previous guests and yourself over the issue of Brexit but, most particularly, the relationship of Britain going forward with the United States and a possible preferential trade deal.</p><p>Now, we heard President Trump today praise Boris Johnson, calling him Britain's Trump. He said, \"Everybody over in Britain likes me, and that's great, because, you know, Boris is like me.\" But I want to know whether you think it's in the president's purview to carve out, you know, this preferential trade deal the Brexiters and Boris Johnson think they can get.</p><p>TOOMEY: So, unfortunately, your question came through very, very garbled. I hope the technicians can clear that up. It's very difficult for me to understand you. But I think the gist of the question was whether or not it's in President Trump's interest, President Trump's interest, to negotiate a trade agreement with the U.K. I think it is. I think it would be very, very good for the economies of both countries to have a free trade agreement.</p><p>And it is something, as you point, that the president alluded to, I'm not aware of a lot of progress being made on that front, but I have encouraged the administration to pursue exactly that.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I was also asking -- Senator, I'm sorry. I hope -- can you hear me better now?</p><p>TOOMEY: I'm sorry, I cannot understand a thing you're saying.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK. Well, you know what, Senator, we are going to go to a different segment and we're going try to rearrange this and we're going to come back to you. I'm sorry for that, but we will come back to you.</p><p>For the moment, we turn now to Silicon Valley where internal activism is brewing turmoil for big tech. Allegations of sexual harassment, gender inequality and racism sparked a global walk out by 20,000 Google employees last year. Two of its leaders were Claire Stapleton and Meredith Whittaker who worked at the company for over a decade. They said they were sidelined for speaking out. Telling our Alicia Menendez that Google needs to be held to account. Here is their conversation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>ALICIA MENENDEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What drew you to Google and then when did you realize that your expectations of what it would be was different than some of the realities?</p><p>CLAIRE STAPLETON, ORGANIZER, GOOGLE WALKOUT FOR REAL CHANGE: Yes. So, I used to work on a weekly event that happens at Google hosted by the founders, Larry and Sergey, or it used to be. And that is -- it is a cultural hallmark of Google. We talk about what happened during the week, answer questions from employees, it's this incredibly optimistic -- it's a profound cultural experience for people who come to Google. And I used to be at the side of stage every week watching this just think, \"I am at the best company in the world. This is the most progressive workplace, the more forward-thinking. We are changing the world.\"</p><p>And that carried through a lot of the different roles that I had. What really changed it for me was in the fall of last year, there was a huge bombshell story about an executive payout that had been made to a known sexual harasser at Google. It was on the order of $90 million as reported.</p><p>And that was incredibly disappointing. But what it sparked was women telling their stories at the company.</p><p>MENENDEZ: To each other?</p><p>STAPLETON: To each other, yes. Specifically, I was on an anonymous moms list where moms discuss everything that is going on at home and at work.</p><p>And people started sharing their stories of different discrimination experiences they'd had, sexual harassment. Talking about their very profound, very personal reaction to the story that we were reading in the news.</p><p>Because it wasn't really about Andy Rubin and the sort of huge multimillion dollar payout. It was about the injustice and unfairness that a lot of women were experiencing every day.</p><p>And it inspired me to say let's register our dissatisfaction with management. They hadn't addressed it in a way that I felt had urgency and accountability that showed us how this wasn't going to happen again, that showed us how change was going to happen in the organization.</p><p>And together, we set out to walk out. And that next week, we did and that was -- I think it was 40 -- was it 20,000 people?</p><p>WHITTAKER: Twenty thousand people.</p><p>STAPLETON: Twenty-thousand people in 40 offices.</p><p>MENENDEZ: What were the stories or the range of stories you were hearing from other women about the conditions they were facing at work?</p><p>STAPLETON: Yes. I think it was everything from I reported sexual harassment on my team and my manager protected the guy and I ended up having to transfer teams. That was incredibly common. It was almost an architect that came out.</p><p>I heard a lot about people raising their hand and saying something isn't right with the way -- with our diversity and inclusion practices on the team or the way people are talking to each other. It doesn't feel safe to me.</p><p>I heard a lot about opportunity discrimination, that it's a boys' club, that the best projects are given to the manager's friends, the VP's friends. The best opportunities which are cherry picked for the favorites.</p><p>I heard, generally, that people don't have a lot of faith in fairness and opportunity. I think people in general have an expectation of fairness and opportunity in the workplace, particularly Google, which again I had a really rosy and positive view of the workplace for a long time.</p><p>WHITTAKER: You know, it all gets to sort of abuse of power, right, who has power and who doesn't. And ultimately, if someone in a position that didn't have power was harassed or racially discriminated against or discriminated against because of their gender identity, et cetera, it was way, way too often.</p><p>They were ostracized. They were sort of seen as the problem and the people who did have structural power were, you know, ultimately, I think, almost maybe not explicitly encouraged to do it, but if you're not punished for it, if you're sort of -- if you never see any consequences, that is an implicit endorsement for that kind of behavior and those types of power structures.</p><p>And I think this is something we need to get to the heart of, right. Who wins from this type of behavior?</p><p>MENENDEZ: You released a joint letter internally to the company speaking out about the culture of retaliation. Claire, you wrote, \"My manager started ignoring me, my work was given to other people, and I was told to go on medical leave even though I'm not sick.\"</p><p>STAPLETON: Yes.</p><p>MENENDEZ: What happened?</p><p>STAPLETON: So in January, two months after the walk out, I had a conversation with my manager where she laid out what was clearly a demotion. I would be layered, my team would be split in two, and yes, my - -</p><p>MENENDEZ: Did you recognize it as retaliation at the time?</p><p>STAPLETON: I didn't. I mean it crossed my mind because she mentioned the walk out. And then she positioned -- she suggested a new project for me, working on YouTube Kids.</p><p>And I asked her why would I want to work on YouTube Kids? And she said, \"Oh, I thought you would be interested in that because of the walk out.\"</p><p>I said help me connect the dots. What's the connection there? And she said, \"You know, women's issues.\"</p><p>So it was clearly I think top of mind even though it was also just sort of a clumsy communication. What happened in the following few months was I was just trying to have my questions answered. I was so confused after years on this team highly established, a strong performer, always, you know, increasing my scope, expanding my role on the team, all of a sudden it was a huge set back.</p><p>As I asked these questions, the more isolating and strange the situation got. And in fact, the more that I was able to connect my story to the story of so many other women who described retaliation when they had spoken up about something that was happening in their workplace.</p><p>MENENDEZ: The letter concludes, \"If we want to stop discrimination, harassment, and unethical decision making, we need to end retaliation against the people who speak honestly about these problems. What was it you were trying to achieve?</p><p>WHITTAKER: Well, I think we needed to call out one of the primary barriers to ending [13:35:00] racism, misogyny, sexual harassment, and abuse within the workplace.</p><p>Nicole Porter is a legal scholar who wrote an essay in the Stanford Law Review that makes an extremely compelling argument that actually practices of retaliation are one of the, you know, are the first thing we need to tackle when we begin to tackle these sort of Me Too issues, this sort of massive, you know, the ongoing issue of persistent sexual harassment and discrimination within workplaces, you know, in tech and well beyond.</p><p>And that the fear of speaking up, the -- you know, legitimate fear of speaking up, the personal cost, you know, the cost to your career and your livelihood that retaliation, you know, that retaliation creates is a huge problem that means that, you know, I think it's no accident that a lot of the big Me Too stories are stories that are told about incidents that happened years before.</p><p>These aren't people coming out and putting themselves at risk within their workplaces. And what we saw, you know, when Claire and I came forward with our stories, it was a dam broke.</p><p>We have hundreds of stories of people contacting us and this happened to me.</p><p>MENENDEZ: What were your hearing? What were those stories?</p><p>WHITTAKER: Well, you know, all sorts of things but they share some key features. One, you begin to be isolated. You begin to be sort of iced out of conversations.</p><p>You begin to be suddenly people who are warm or friendly turn cold. And so the environment you're in changes suddenly.</p><p>You're taken off projects. You are told that you're not doing well.</p><p>You know, are you too sensitive, too negative? You know, not performing well. All of these things, you know, it kind of formed a persistent structural gaslighting where you're told the day before you were doing well, suddenly you bring a problem to the attention of management and you are the problem.</p><p>MENENDEZ: Right. By identifying the problem, you become the problem. How does that then function for someone who is a contract worker?</p><p>WHITTAKER: Well, I mean, that is -- that functions -- it's sort of a double layer of vulnerability, right. Because Google now has over -- 50 percent of the workers at Google are contract workers.</p><p>These are people who don't have the privileges of full employment. They don't have health insurance. They're often paid, you know, (INAUDIBLE) wages. They don't get to report directly to Google's HR system.</p><p>And the power asymmetry between contract workers and full-time workers is significant. So they are extremely vulnerable to these practices.</p><p>This is in issues of sexual harassment and abuse but issues of racial discrimination, issues of other forms of discrimination that happen persistently to contract workers because if you look at the racial makeup, if you look at the gender make up of Google's workforce, you will see there are very -- I think Google's workforce is four percent black people. The Google's full-time work force.</p><p>And you see in contract workers -- I don't have the numbers off the top of my head. I don't know that they're reported.</p><p>But it is far -- you know, you'll see many more women of color. You'll see many more black people in the contract work force than in the full-time workforce.</p><p>And you see very technically like using this term correctly you see a sort of pattern of structural racism, where those at the bottom are the people who are most vulnerable are also more likely to be people of color and women and the people with the most privileges are much more likely to be, you know, men, white men. Often.</p><p>MENENDEZ: Claire, tell me about your ultimate departure from the company.</p><p>STAPLETON: I think that when we went out with our stories, we knew we risked our jobs because this is how retaliation works.</p><p>I think that we knew that we were speaking out for people that felt like they couldn't risk their jobs. Ultimately, I found out that I was pregnant in the spring and I've been going through such stress and isolation.</p><p>I think that the medical leave antidote in my statement and my story really sums up how crazy making -- sharing your retaliation can be. Because ultimately I was raising a serious retaliation claim to the highest throngs the company. And the only solution that they came back to me with was not let's figure out a way to make sense of this between you and your manager, find you a new team, transfer you somewhere where you can thrive.</p><p>This was you must declare yourself sick and unable to work. And I really sat with that. I really considered that.</p><p>Am I crazy? Am I the sick one? Is the fact that I'm speaking out -- am I as problematic and as crazy as they say, right?</p><p>So I've been bolstered and encouraged by the network of women and men that have formed around the walk out but ultimately for my health and sanity and for my family, it made sense for me to leave.</p><p>MENENDEZ: Meredith, you're still there which is almost more unbelievable.</p><p>WHITTAKER: Yes. I persist I will be there until I can no longer do my job with integrity.</p><p>But I will say it's very difficult. I will also say that because my work is sort of focused outside of Google and has been for many years, it's not an uncommon [13:40:00] arrangement in the tech industry but I cofounded an independent academic research that some call AI now.</p><p>And so I do spend a lot of my time, you know, there and talking with people who are outside of Google about serious research questions related to AI and ethics.</p><p>MENENDEZ: But at some point, you were told to abandon that work.</p><p>WHITTAKER: I was. That was the sort of form that the retaliation took. And there's a term in labor law called constructive discharge.</p><p>And this is when instead of firing you, saying, you know, Meredith, you're out. They just make it impossible for you to stay. So you have to kind of fire yourself, right.</p><p>And this is recognized in labor law because it's not an uncommon practice. But in a sense telling me I have to abandon that work which sort of I have built my reputation, I have built my career, I formed a research institute with Kay Crawford looking at these issues.</p><p>We have long-term grants. We have a staff that is moved from around the world to work with us. Telling me to abandon that and take on what was effectively kind of a project management and administration job that was looking at very different things like balancing the budgets in a given department was a form of fairly significant constructive discharge.</p><p>MENENDEZ: The things that you're saying about Google are very serious. Back in April, the company said this in response.</p><p>\"We've prohibit retaliation in the workplace and publicly share our very clear policy. To make sure that no complaint raised goes unheard at Google, we give employees multiple channels to report concerns including anonymously and investigate all allegations of retaliation.\"</p><p>The company also said they did an investigation and saw no evidence of retaliation. How do you respond?</p><p>STAPLETON: Yes. I mean they said that. I would love to understand that what happened to my role as after not just, you know, four or five years on this team as a, you know, a high performer and, you know, rising star, but 12 years of a solid track record at the company.</p><p>The first time this had ever happened to me where my role had been set back, diminished, where I felt like I could no longer talk to my leadership without fear of further retaliation happened two months after the walkout.</p><p>And that to me seems as clear of day. I don't know -- so many of the stories that came out from the walk out and beyond to the many people that Meredith and I have connected with over the past few months in starting to share our stories have shown that actually Googlers don't have a lot of faith in these systems. They don't have a lot of faith in the investigations that get done in the HR people that they seek for help and the executives that they ask to help step in and figure out situations that don't feel right.</p><p>This isn't just about me and Meredith. We knew that we weren't just the only two stories out there.</p><p>And in fact, when we went out, we were emboldened by knowing we were speaking on behalf of many others.</p><p>MENENDEZ: Why not sue the company?</p><p>WHITTAKER: Let's be clear. These claims are extremely difficult to prove.</p><p>There's some very, very, very bad case law and sort of labor protections that have been whittled away over the years to make it, you know -- it's difficult to prove that suddenly I was gas lit, suddenly my workplace was so hostile I got sick coming in every day.</p><p>We were hearing reports like this, right. And one of the -- I think one of the trickiest and most difficult things about retaliation is that the company never admits that it's retaliating.</p><p>So that statement was written by I'm sure a very competent lawyer. And that's exactly what you would say if you wanted to, you know, shore yourself up against any legal liability.</p><p>But it's simply not true, right. And it's not true in our experience. It's not true in hundreds of people's experience.</p><p>And this gets into this sort of systemic issues with HR. HR is there not to protect workers, right. They aren't your union and I think we do need some kind of collective workers solidarity that can protect us against these things.</p><p>HR is there to prevent the company from being liable for these harms. So the reason you have to watch all those deadening training videos about sexual harassment compliance that have over 30 years shown that they do nothing to affect this problem.</p><p>The reason they have this sort of reporting structure and the reason they're set up the way they are is to protect the company from legal liability. That's what HR does and they actually don't want to help you bring a case.</p><p>MENENDEZ: It's now been months since the walk out. Were there any successes that you can point to?</p><p>WHITTAKE: I mean Google ended forced arbitration not just for sexual harassment but across the board. Now, they did that for full-time employees. It's still unclear how that's going to affect the majority of workers who are contractors.</p><p>Google has also put in place, you know, a promise to increase benefits and give things like health insurance, have a minimum wage for contract workers, which is also contract workers have been organizing since then around, you know, demands for, you know, dignified work and, you know, reasonable benefits.</p><p>Those are the two big kind of bulwarks. And I think one of the other successes that isn't specifically Google meeting the demands is just how much the organizing has grown.</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>And now we have a really, you know, a fabric of organizers within the company who are taking this very seriously and sort of beginning to take ownership for the environment that we work in and beginning to make, you know, clear demands to leadership about what we as workers need.</p><p>STAPLETON: I think what is most shocking is that this is the company that sets out to solve the world's biggest problems and we acknowledge that what we were raising with the walk out is really broad systemic deep issues. However, we've seen no imagination, no ingenuity to tackling these problems.</p><p>The woman that they appointed to really respond to what employees are raising left the company a few months later. So clearly this is not quite being given the resources and urgency, the honesty, the accountability that we're really asking for however lots of wins and we're so pleased to see how the community is growing.</p><p>MENENDEZ: Thank you both so much.</p><p>WHITTAKER: Thank you so much.</p><p>STAPLETON: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So you heard Meredith Whittaker tell Alicia that she'd stay at Google until she could no longer do her job with integrity. Well, since that interview, Whittaker has quit saying \"It is clear that Google is not a place that I can continue this work.\"</p><p>Let's turn back now to Senator Pat Toomey in Washington who has very kindly and graciously waited for us to fix our technical issues. So Senator, welcome back again. I'm sorry about all of that but we have important --</p><p>TOOMEY: Thanks for having me.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Thank you. Important things to discuss and I'm glad you stuck around. About this trade deal between Brexit, Britain, and the United States, there is a major issue here that is very close to the U.S. And that is maintaining freedom and the integrity of the peace agreement between Ireland and Britain and the freedom of that border.</p><p>And I spoke to Nancy Pelosi, leader of the House, just a few months ago about this and she laid out how a trade deal with the United States would be intricately linked with this freedom and the integrity of the Good Friday agreement. Just take a listen, sir.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-NY), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: It's very hard to pass the trade agreement in Congress, very, very hard. And at one -- a U.S.-U.K. trade agreement that would be a reward for weakening the Good Friday Accord is just not a possibility.</p><p>But maybe they can accomplish it without doing that. But I just want to make sure they understood that as a consolation for leaving the E.U., they're not getting the U.S.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Senator, do you agree with that? That there can be no rewarding of Brexit Britain if Northern Ireland and Ireland and the peace agreement is put at risk?</p><p>TOOMEY: Well, I don't think of it in terms of rewarding England for -- or the U.K. for Brexit. But I do agree that American lawmakers will take a very, very careful look at the status of that border.</p><p>Obviously, we all remember all too painfully how tragic and how difficult that history was and how remarkably successful the Good Friday agreement has been. So this, of course, is very much on the minds of the Irish and the Brits and it's one of the challenges in negotiating a deal with Brexit.</p><p>It would certainly be one of the challenges that we would have. But I wouldn't preclude the possibility that we could work out an acceptable solution.</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right. Well, let's turn back now to what is really taking up all the oxygen or at least long term I think in Washington and that is tomorrow's planned public testimony of the former Special Counsel Robert Mueller.</p><p>Just tell me where you stand on this. Are you glad he's coming to testify?</p><p>Do you think there are any questions that are still need to be answered? Where do you stand on this?</p><p>TOOMEY: Well, so, first of all, there's a lot more interest in this among the media than there is among my constituents and probably among many senators. You know, I don't think we're going to learn very much.</p><p>Bob Mueller has said that his report speaks for itself. He had to be subpoenaed in order to come.</p><p>I think he's probably going to stick pretty closely to his report and our Democratic colleagues are going to try to make a big to do over a obstruction investigation of an investigation that was not obstructed into a crime for which there is no evidence there was a crime committed.</p><p>So I'm not terribly curious about it. We'll see what happens.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So I just want to ask you how you reconcile yourself with this from the Mueller report. I mean, we've heard it over and again but it still bears repeating.</p><p>Mueller's report said, \"If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.\" Well, they didn't state. Does that not give you some cause for whatever, discomfort?</p><p>TOOMEY: No. Not really because they went through the litany of the behaviors that some people find objectionable and [13:55:00] I don't think they rise to the level of obstruction of justice.</p><p>I think it's very clear. Bob Mueller finished his report. He finished his investigation unimpeded.</p><p>He had dozens of lawyers, hundreds of witnesses, all the time in the world, a huge budget, and nobody stopped them. He finished.</p><p>So his report is what it is. It strikes me pretty clear there was no obstruction of his investigation. And as I say, it's pretty clear there was no underlying crime committed, as well. So that's why I think this is mostly politically motivated.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So regarding the idea -- because I think you do all agree that Russia has played a nefarious role in your democratic process and you've said the special counsel's findings are a stark reminder that Russia's goal is to undermine the trust of the American people in the democratic process.</p><p>Are you confident that this administration is doing all it can to stop that kind of interference of behavior?</p><p>TOOMEY: I think, actually, there's been a lot of good progress made on that front. Yes, I totally believe that the Russians would love to disrupt America's political process, our elections. They want to discredit our model.</p><p>That's the real ultimate motivation for Putin, in my view, discredit it and weaken our institutions. If you look at the 2018 elections, I think it's pretty clear they didn't have much success, if any, and I think we have created a more robust process.</p><p>So I do feel good about where we are. I'm sure they'll continue to try to be disruptive but we're aware of that now and better able to defend against it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So can I ask you as one of the rare sitting senators in the Republican Party who do distance themselves from the president on issues where it matters to you. You've talked out against the racist tweets, against the women of color in Congress, you've also talked out against using emergency funds for the border wall.</p><p>And you know, this is going to be addressed by the Supreme Court next week. What do you think of the case to stop those funds being used for, you know, the border wall? Do you support that?</p><p>TOOMEY: So I think the president has the funds at his disposal. The funds that he needs to perfectly legal fashion to add to the border wall that he wants to build.</p><p>And by the way, that the border patrol says we need, as you may know, we have several hundred miles of existing physical barriers including walls. And our border patrol folks say that we need several hundred miles more, not the entire 1900 miles by any means but additional physical barriers that I think every one of the last at least half dozen or so presidents have added to.</p><p>I think the president is right to wish to enhance that physical security. My position on this has always been that you should simply use the funds that Congress has authorized for that purpose.</p><p>And it is enough to accomplish what he had said he wanted to accomplish. That's the way the president ought to do it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So Senator, the latest Gallop poll shows some 90 percent of the Republican Party obviously supports President Trump. In other words, basically the party has become the party of Trump.</p><p>You've got dissenting senators who've either resigned or left politics or doing other such things. Do you ever feel any pressure to tamp down your criticism on issues?</p><p>TOOMEY: I don't. The way I look at it is I was elected separately from President Trump.</p><p>He's the president of the United States. I'm a senator from Pennsylvania.</p><p>And if I think that the president is advocating a policy that is not good for Pennsylvania or for our country, I think I have a responsibility to stand up and articulate an opposing point of view.</p><p>I've done that on trade very consistently. And I will continue to do that.</p><p>I think, you know, the president has put together a coalition. He has a support -- very broad support among Republicans. You're absolutely right about that.</p><p>But there's a lot of Republicans that are still asking questions about some of the individual policies. I think people look at the overall economic thrust and we have the best economy of my adult lifetime.</p><p>Literally, the best economy in 50 years. And I think that clearly is attributable to the president working with Republicans in Congress on rolling back excessive regulation, reforming our tax code.</p><p>It's been terrific. And I think a lot of Republicans across Pennsylvania anyway say, hey, the results have been really good.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Senator Toomey, thank you so much for joining us tonight. Thanks a lot.</p><p>Now, that is it for us. Remember, you can always listen to our podcast and see us online at amanpour.com. And you can follow me on Instagram and Twitter.</p><p>Thanks for watching and goodbye from London.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019072301cbk28</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-7031-DXH2-627R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9607\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 23, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

France, Italy and Spain are preparing to loosen coronavirus restrictions, with other countries watching closely to see how some of the first and hardest-hit countries in Europe might safely emerge from their crippling lockdowns. Streets across Spain resounded with the sounds of children shouting and the rattle of their bicycles on Sunday as millions were allowed to play outside for the first time in six weeks as the nationwide coronavirus lockdown was relaxed further. &lt;Specs: Economy; Government; Diseases; COVID-19; Giuseppe Conte; Human Rights Commission; Murtaja Qureiris; House of Saud; Wahhabi; Newcastle United; WWE; Huanan Seafood Market; Johns Hopkins University; Google; Apple; Tyson Foods; Smithfield; Remdesivir; SARS; University of Nebraska</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HALA GORANI, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome, everybody. I'm Hala Gorani. It is the start of a new week around the world. We will bring you the very latest from around the world on the coronavirus pandemic. This is the moment of maximum risk. The warning from Boris Johnson after his return to 10 Downing Street today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, two of Europe's longest running lock downs aren't finally easing up. Spain and Italy are getting back on the streets, albeit slowly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And restaurants open up and at least one American state where doctors are warning it is way too soon. We have a live report.</p><p>And from Norway to New Zealand, countries are at different stages in the fight against COVID-19 but no one is completely out of danger.</p><p>Welcome everybody. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson is finally back on the job after a sick leave and having been sick with COVID-19 for several weeks. And Boris Johnson returned to work this morning at 10 Downing Street ready to tackle, he says the deadly pandemic and while some countries across Europe have decided to ease their coronavirus restrictions. Boris Johnson warns the U.K. isn't there yet.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: And I asked you to contain your impatience because I believe we are coming now to the end of the first phase of this conflict and in spite of all the suffering, we have so nearly succeeded.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Well, there is a promise to reach 100,000 tests. The health secretary of the United Kingdom is saying that this could happen by Thursday. One scientist at least says it will be at least another two to three weeks. And you're seeing there some of those test sites that have been erected in parking lots around the country. Our Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward joins me now live from 10 Downing Street.</p><p>So, Boris Johnson is saying be patient. And I found it striking that -- but first of all, he looked pretty well. And the tone was he was trying to sort of convey, you know, confidence, the idea that the government now has a plan is in -- and is on track.</p><p>CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think absolutely. That's what he wanted to convey. And certainly people were reassured by his appearance, as you said he appeared to be in good health. And later on, we saw Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary leaving 10 Downing Street behind me. We asked how the Prime Minister was, he said he was on good form. He's also been called that -- described as being raring to go.</p><p>So all of these things will be reassuring to the British public, Hala. I think he also though, wanted to nip in the bud any speculation that the U.K. is getting ready to lift the lock down in some way, shape, or form. And there has been a mounting chorus of pressure on the government, not just from the British public but also from certain influential conservatives who would like to see the economy getting back up and running.</p><p>Who would like to see a sort of gradual lifting of that lockdown, or who at the very least would like to see it articulated in terms of what the future plan might be, what a lifting of the lockdown might look like. Boris Johnson basically saying, hold on a second. We're doing really well. We're close to defeating this. But we're not here that -- we're not yet -- there yet. And actually, we're at a moment of what he called maximum risk, saying that essentially, these restrictions need to stay in place in order to prevent a second wave of infection.</p><p>That is the real fear here for the U.K. So, no word yet if the public was waiting to hear some inkling of how long this will go on for certainly the Prime Minister wasn't giving it away, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: And in terms of the lockdown, so obviously, the Prime Minister is saying, be patient, this is a time of -- this is the time to be careful, don't lift restrictions too soon. But I wonder with so much forward warning, I mean, the U.K. was ahead of Italy and Spain by many weeks. How did the country end up -- still end up with over 20,000 deaths?</p><p>WARD: This is the question that people are asking themselves and, you know, lots of people have different theories on this but certainly one of the key components when you look at why the U.K. has done so badly, relatively speaking, compared to Germany, for example, or Denmark, for example, even proportional to the size of the population.</p><p>[10:05:14]</p><p>WARD: The key that you hear over and over again from experts is the lack of testing. The United Kingdom has consistently failed to meet its own targets with regards to doing sort of mass testing on people for the coronavirus. And of course, we're coming up as you mentioned, in your introduction to this very important milestone when the government says at the end of the month on Thursday, they should be at capacity to test 100,000 people a day.</p><p>Well, just to give you a sense of perspective, Hala, in terms of how far off the U.K. still is from that. As of Saturday, less than 30,000 people were being tested a day. That is a huge discrepancy and it remains unclear how the government is going to try to sort of narrow the gap. Right now the government is saying, well, even though less than 30,000 people were tested, the capacity is there to test for more.</p><p>Well, capacity is just one part of the equation, Hala. If you don't have the actual facilities, whereby those people can get the testing, then of course, it's essentially null and void. So there will be a lot of pressure, a lot of people waiting to see, will the government actually start to test 100,000 people a day by Thursday. Right now, it looks like it will be pretty tough for them to make that deadline.</p><p>GORANI: All right. Thanks very much. Clarissa Ward is at 10 Downing Street. 100,000 a day they're not there. And by the way, some people, the frontline health care professionals might need to be tested more than once obviously, if they go back to work. One week from today, and we spoke about Italy which is one of the hardest hit countries in the world. One week from today. Italy will start lifting it's nearly two-month lockdown across the country.</p><p>The Prime Minister's plan comes though with a warning to be careful where there could be a second wave of infections and the country will have to start all over again. Our Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman joins me now live from Rome. So what will life look like in about a week then in Italy?</p><p>BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's a very good question. Because this phase two, this very gradual reopening of the country, keeping in mind, of course, that the lockdown began on the 12th of March is going to be very slow and very deliberate. So next Monday, what we're going to see is construction will begin again, manufacturing will begin again, things like fashion production will resume.</p><p>But they're going to be watching very carefully the numbers if there is a research of the virus, if the numbers start to spike again, then there may be a change of plans. However, if the numbers are stable, if the current decline in the numbers continues two weeks after next Monday, things like museums and libraries and stores selling non-essential goods will be allowed to reopen. However, there are going to be a variety of guidelines to guarantee that not too many people go into these museums, libraries, and other stores.</p><p>And perhaps if things continue to improve in terms of the outbreak on the first of June, bars and restaurants may reopen but also under very strict guidelines. Now what's important about next week's reopening of construction and manufacturing is that this involves people who cannot work from home. So they will be able to work and earn a living once again.</p><p>But the Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte did say during this live press conference, if you love Italy, keep your distance. Hala?</p><p>GORANI: Yes. And I'm sure people are nervous. I'm sure people will -- without being asked to keep their distance from other people. No need to unnecessarily brush up against anyone you don't know in the street or anything like that.</p><p>Mafia bosses I understand, some Italian Mafia bosses have been released from prison and placed under house arrest because of the COVID emergency. What is that about?</p><p>WEDEMAN: Well, in order to reduce the crowding in prisons in Italy, 6500 prisoners have been led out. Those who have just 18 months or less left to their sentences, and among them were three bosses of the Sicilian, the Neapolitan and the -- and another mafia boss have been led out. And there have been some very loud protests from Italian politicians at this because these three particular mafia bosses were being kept in isolation.</p><p>[10:10:02]</p><p>WEDEMAN: Barred from any sort of communication with the outside world. Well now they're at home. They have access to all sorts of communication. So this has caused a good deal of consternation, but nonetheless, they are trying to reduce the crowding in the prisons. But this comes at a rather high price. Hala?</p><p>GORANI: All right. Ben Wedeman, thanks very much. Reporting live from Rome. So from Italy, we take you to Spain and children are probably breathing a huge collective sigh of relief because they'll be allowed to finally run free after months endure. And I think the relief will be felt not only by the kids but also by their parents across the country. Our Scott McLean is on the ground.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is the moment that Alejandra Granados' family has been dreaming of. It's the kids' first time outside in six weeks.</p><p>For families like theirs, lockdown has meant trapped inside a thousand square feet. Alejandra and her husband had been working from home, juggling their six and three-year-old sons, Alex and Andres and regretting their decision to buy an apartment and not a house. We spoke a few days before the kids were allowed out.</p><p>ALEJANDRA GRANADOS, MOTHER OF TWO BOYS IN LOCKDOWN: You feel sad because you feel trapped. You're at home.</p><p>MCLEAN: In Spain, adults have had some excuses to leave their homes. To walk the dog, go to the store, or in some cases, work. Kids have had no excuse to go out at all.</p><p>GRANADOS: Psychological, yes, I think it's a big impact for me and my family. We are always fighting and yelling at each other and sometimes at night, I cry before going to bed because I feel a lot of frustrating myself.</p><p>Come on Alex, burpees.</p><p>MCLEAN: Stuck inside, the kids have had few outlets to burn off their energy.</p><p>GRANADOS: Sometimes I notice that Alex doesn't want to talk at all. He just goes to his room and he's just staring out the window. And I think the coronavirus is, after all, showing us something that we haven't seen before. But we are frightened.</p><p>MCLEAN: On Tuesday, the government promised kids some freedom. But the trip to the store with their parents was not with what a restless public had in mind. Facing widespread backlash, the health minister agreed to allow kids under 14 to play outside for an hour a day. It doesn't seem like much. But after six weeks inside, it's a sign this national nightmare might soon be over.</p><p>GRANADOS: It feels great. It feels like you get a lot of space around you. Freedom.</p><p>MCLEAN: Scott McLean, CNN, Madrid.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI: All right. Scott McLean reporting there. Now Germany has relaxed some of its restrictions on people across the country, but some states are asking residents to wear face masks all the time and for everyone to wear face masks as well which to some people could be confusing because I remember at the beginning of this pandemic, lots of doctors and scientists said no, you know, ordinary people who are not medical professionals don't always know how to use the face mask.</p><p>It could be counterproductive to wear one. Fred Pleitgen is coming to us live from Berlin with more on this recommendation and how politicians are justifying it. Fred?</p><p>FRED PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Hala. Look, you're absolutely right. It is a different situation pretty much every German state. It's one of the things about Germany's Federal system. If you look at for instance, where I am right now in Berlin, people are required to wear masks on public transport but at the same time, the City of Berlin which is also a State in Germany is not enforcing that.</p><p>So if you look at the trains are going past behind me to keep sort of track of it. I would say on most trains, maybe 60 percent of the people are wearing masks, most of the others are actually not. And then inside stores here in Berlin, people don't have to wear face masks at all. But if you leave the city, travel about half an hour, I was in Potsdam which is in a different state here in Germany, you do have to wear face masks inside stores.</p><p>And it's sort of a bit of a patchwork of things. And at the same time, as you said, you have that issue of where these people are going to get these face masks from. Now Germany received the delivery of about 10 million face masks by a plane earlier today from China, they say they have another 15 million coming. But they also say when they speak about face masks in public places, it doesn't necessarily mean that you need something like a surgical mask, like I'm wearing right now.</p><p>They say people can also make their own face masks themselves. They say even a scarf, if it covers people's mouth and nose is enough for the authorities to then not find people which happens in some states as well. The Germany calls -- the Germans call is everyday mask, and they said that's something that people can also wear. So the government per se is not providing these face masks, but they also said anything that people can do to cover their mouth and nose is something that they say for them is already very helpful.</p><p>And well, we've been speaking to people throughout the course of the day in some of these stores and most people say they aren't quite happy with these new measures.</p><p>[10:15:01]</p><p>PLEITGEN: They say that it gives them sort of a sense of safety and security when they go into confined spaces, like stores and of course like trains as well, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: All right. Fred Pleitgen live in Berlin. Thanks very much. Well, we continue our world tour here of the very latest on the pandemic. And we leave Germany and we take you to Norway which is also gradually returning to normal as other Nordic countries after six weeks of studying from home. Students aged six to 10 are back in school, class sizes have been reduced to 15 maximum.</p><p>And most kids seem happy about going back but a Facebook group called my child should not be a guinea pig for COVID-19 has gained 30,000 followers. Sporting and cultural events are still banned in Norway. So people are still nervous about -- some people are still nervous about sending their kids to school.</p><p>As far as New Zealand is concerned, New Zealand says it has completely eliminated coronavirus from its borders announcing only a few new confirmed cases within the community and one new death as it begins to ease restrictions. Some stores and schools can open as the country moves from level four to level three restrictions. But Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says to expect new cases as life returns to normal.</p><p>CNN's Ivan Watson is joining us today in -- from Hong Kong. So, Ivan is this down to -- I mean, obviously, it's a much smaller population than other countries, but it's down to pretty decisive action early on in the pandemic it seems.</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: If you look at New Zealand as a case study, it does seem to indicate that this could have been very much a contributing factor to keeping the infection numbers down, Hala. As of a little bit more than two hours ago, New Zealand has gone from alert level four which was focused on eliminating the coronavirus to alert level three which is now classified as restricting the authorities.</p><p>Conceding that they've had some success but that it's far too early to celebrate. Take a listen to what the New Zealand Prime Minister had to say a few hours ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACINDA ARDERN, PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND: There is no widespread undertake to community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle but we must remain vigilant if we do keep it that way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATSON: So what is New Zealand doing now? After four weeks of this pretty serious lockdown, as the Prime Minister put it, it is opening up the economy, anticipating some 400,000 Kiwis will go back to work. If you can work from home though, you are urge not to go to work. It is supposed to be contactless work. So if you have a retail store or a restaurant, you're just supposed to deliver things or give things at the door with no contact at all.</p><p>Children up to the age of 10 can go back to school as of today. And people are allowed to have some form of exercise but they're urged to do this all locally. Gatherings. And this was an interesting point, the Prime Minister says that the economy is being opened up partially. But social life is not being reopened. So, gatherings of up to 10 people are allowed for weddings and funerals, for example, but not for parties.</p><p>And it does seem like New Zealand's approach to this has attracted a lot of support from the population. One poll says that some 87 percent of those surveyed support how the government has dealt with this crisis. And that national pride is actually jumped from the beginning of the month from 47 percent to 62 percent. That said, Jacinda Arden says it's too early to open up New Zealand's shores and borders to the outside world, even to Australia and other Pacific nations. Hala?</p><p>GORANI: All right. I'm sure some politicians around the world see those numbers and are quite envious. Thanks very much, Ivan Watson live in Hong Kong. A lot more ahead on the program. And some business owners are welcoming customers but they're doing so with a sense of trepidation. And now not everybody is happy about those developments, especially in some U.S. states.</p><p>Plus, the coronavirus outbreak is under control in the city where it first began but if Wuhan, China really getting back to normal? We'll have that as well.</p><p>[10:21:45]</p><p>GORANI: Welcome back. Away from the coronavirus pandemic there are rumors that continue to circulate about the health of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. There are big questions about it. Kim missed paying respects to his grandfather on a 15th, the founder of North Korea. It is the most important date in the calendar for that country and that is what is causing so much speculation about his condition.</p><p>A former high-level North Korean diplomat turned defector says it will be very hard to get information on the matter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THAE YONG-HO, FORMER NORTH KOREAN DIPLOMAT: The only people who can confirm his real condition might be Kim Jong-un's wife or his sister or his close, you know, the aides, those rumors of where he is now, whether he has any surgery. I don't think, you know, that is really based on the facts.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: All right. I make it this way you will but North Korean state media says that Kim Jong-un sent a letter dated Thursday to South Africa's president. I'm not sure what that confirms or not but this is an apparent effort from at least state media in North Korea to indicate that Kim Jong- un continues to carry on with his duties.</p><p>Now, Saudi Arabia's Human Rights Commission says that a royal decree has been issued ending the death penalty for minors in the kingdom. Officials in Riyadh have faced massive criticism from the international community for using capital punishment on minors or on individuals who are minors when the alleged crime was committed. Just last year, CNN reported on the high profile case of Murtaja Qureiris seen here riding his bike with other kids shouting the people demand human rights.</p><p>Saudi prosecutors say it was a crime and thought the death penalty but after international backlash, he was given prison time instead. Remember he's definitely a minor and was a child. He is just one case that puts a face to the policy of sentencing minors to death. Sam Kiley is following this announcement. So, is this part of an effort, a continuing effort by the kingdom to soften their image, Sam?</p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think you're absolutely right there, Hala. It is not only about image, but it's also about kind of solving the conundrum of how do you modernize without liberalizing to the extent that you risk the future of your own regime. In this case, the regime of the -- or the kingdom of the House of Saud. One of the principal elements of opposition in that country is not liberals.</p><p>It is Wahhabi's hardline people who believe that all in any of these sorts of reforms, a pact with the devil. So the Crown Prince there is trying to balance that level of pressure to maintain these ultraconservative rules and regulations and laws against his vision, what he calls for 2030 for a highly modernized country and which is why you often produce these very inconsistent behaviors.</p><p>[10:25:06]</p><p>KILEY: So for example, they have decided to abolish flogging when flogging is optional, and the non-Sharia law when it's an optional punishment that could be meted out by a judge that has just been decreed, but because they follow Sharia law flogging under Sharia law will continue as indeed will the death penalty quite widely, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: Yes. And, of course, as you mentioned, it is a tightrope that Mohammed bin Salman is walking but in this case it's one step forward, but you still have, you know, female driving rights activists in prison. So it's one step forward and sometimes two steps back here.</p><p>KILEY: Yes. I mean, Saudi was dealt itself, a catastrophic blow with the murder of Mr. Khashoggi just over a year ago. At a time when the Saudis had been campaigning very heavily led by the Crown Prince to give this impression of modernity. Llately they've been trying to purchase Newcastle United, they've invited female wrestlers from the WWE franchise to come and wrestle one another.</p><p>They -- so lifted degree of visa restrictions, social media campaigning has been going on very aggressively. But as you say, then they have these strategic snafu as effectively. So for example, in terms of their international standing, deeply undermining themselves with the Trump administration up until now deep, very passionate supporters even during effectively the Khashoggi debacle with a RAO, with Russia that produced a surge in oil production from Saudi Arabia and the collapse in the price of oil even prior to the collapse. Of course that has been reinforced by the COVID lockdown, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: Right. Thank you very much. Sam Kiley reporting from Abu Dhabi. Lebanon is beginning to lift some of its coronavirus restrictions but it had so many economic issues, so much anger in the streets. You'll remember all these demonstrations over the last several months that this coronavirus situation has just added one more layer of anxiety and frustration. New protests in the country over bleak economic conditions have broken out in recent days.</p><p>People are saying that the restrictions and closures have made a very bad situation even worse. Take a look at some of what's coming out of Lebanon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALI HAIDAR, LEBANESE ACTIVIST (through translator): We are here to say that amid the coronavirus crisis, the state left us with two choices. We either die from hunger or die from the disease. So since it is death anyway, let us die while at least taking a stand.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Well, the virus response measures will not be lifted across Lebanon in three phases over the course of several weeks. So it won't be an immediate from one day to the next thing. Coming up on the program. Now Wuhan says it's down to zero coronavirus cases. But the fear lingers on more than two weeks after the lockdown was lifted. Our David Culver sends us a report after the break. We'll be right back.</p><p>[10:30:48]</p><p>GORANI: Well, the City of Wuhan in China where this pandemic started was the first to go into total lockdown. Now things there are starting to return to normal but it's not really business as usual. David Culver is on the ground in Wuhan and sent us this report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's Tuesday, April 21st. And after what I guess is about 2-1/2 months.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>CULVER: We are leaving Shanghai.</p><p>Our journey back to the original epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak required weeks of planning. While, within China, some cities are easing travel restrictions, new hotspots can suddenly surface and so too new lockdowns, which could trap us mid-travel for an unknown amount of time, but all layered up. And we felt this was the moment to return.</p><p>And this is our ticket here, might be reversed, but you can see it. Take a picture as you can see it, our destination set for Wuhan. This is going to be about a four-hour train ride.</p><p>We've noticed it's relatively full so far. I'd say at least maybe half full, which is pretty significant given next to no one was traveling for several weeks. Let's get on board here.</p><p>On board, the train attendants collect our passports. They try to place CNN Photo Journalist Justin Robertson's accent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Where are you from?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm from London.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: England?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: England, yes.</p><p>CULVER: It is not just friendly conversation, because they want to be sure that we've been in the country for at least two weeks so that we're not potentially importing the virus from other areas. The threat to China now thought to be external.</p><p>Arriving in Wuhan, I'm quickly reminded of the last time we were here, almost three months to the day. We had spent just 29 hours on the ground when we abruptly learned that Wuhan was going on lockdown. CNN shared that scramble out of Wuhan with you.</p><p>A rush check-in sparked by a 3:00 A.M. phone call.</p><p>Our rush right now is to check out, get out.</p><p>We headed to the train station as soon as we got word.</p><p>As we arrived, crowds already lined up for tickets stretching out the door.</p><p>4:15 in the morning here, and the only way to buy tickets at this hour is in person.</p><p>From there, was off to a Beijing hotel, quarantining before the rest of the world realized you'd soon be doing the same, 14 days in a hotel room to make sure we had not contracted the virus. We continued our live reporting from quarantine, then we relocated to Shanghai. And here we were three months later headed back to Wuhan.</p><p>The lockdown was over but the hesitation remains. As we interviewed an American who has lived in Wuhan since 2009, we also experienced the increased skepticism towards foreigners like us and the growing distress of western media. A crowd of police questioning us.</p><p>What did he say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where are you from?</p><p>CULVER: You speak English. I'm from -- I'm from the U.S. but I live in Beijing.</p><p>It was not our only interaction with authorities when we returned to what some Chinese scientists believed to be the source of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market and started recording, police stepped out of a nearby tent to ask us why we were there.</p><p>Okay. What did he say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just be quick.</p><p>CULVER: Perhaps the most sensitive spot on our visit, this funeral home and crematorium. Normally, you do not find police posted outside. But last month, Chinese media published a report claiming more urns were distributed than reported coronavirus deaths, calling into question the official figures. We wanted to investigate. But even as we were across the street, police quickly approached us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Show him who we are.</p><p>CULVER: We just attempted to go to one of the funeral homes in hopes of seeing some of the grieving families and hearing from them, their perspective of what transpired over the course of the lockdown and losing their loved ones. As we were there, the police didn't like that we were there. They happened to be positioned right outside. Held us there for a little bit, didn't let us leave. And, finally, after a few minutes, we were able to continue on our way.</p><p>Given that many medical experts believe the virus transmitted from wildlife to humans, we wanted to go to another wet market to see what they were selling.</p><p>[10:35:05]</p><p>CULVER: It's pretty much fine markets, scenes like this all across China. This is actually a normal one. You've got a bag full of toads, some fish on the chopping block over there.</p><p>No wildlife here but some snakes, lots of frozen poultry, along with an array of fresh vegetables and spices all under the same roof.</p><p>Scenes like this appear to show the city of 11-plus million residents coming back to life, folks enjoying a game of badminton or just soaking in the stillness knowing that after weeks sealed inside your home, this is a luxury.</p><p>And while many of the businesses here remain closed, the ones that have reopened are changing up the way they operate, keeping customers outside, bringing the products to them. Hotels, like ours, spraying down everyone who walks inside with disinfectant. The elevators are marked with a safe social distance. They provide a tissue to keep your bare fingers from touching the buttons. All of this as the testing has become streamlined here.</p><p>Before we left, we had to get ours done too, an easy appointment to make, a quick throat swab, $35.00 fee to expedite the results, and 24 hours later, we were handed the paperwork showing we were negative. And with that, we could then safely depart.</p><p>A far less rush checkout this time leaving Wuhan compared to three months ago. We're getting in the car and headed to the train, we're headed to Shanghai.</p><p>On the train back, police carefully examining our passports and test results, allowing us to return to Shanghai without having to do another quarantine. Once again, leaving behind Wuhan as it slowly awakens in this post-lockdown era. The people left a bit shell-shocked, navigating this uncertain moment with a cautious optimism.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CULVER: And a story now finds us back here and Shanghai. A lot of folks will ask what life is now like in Wuhan given that they technically read opened on April 8th. The reality is they're still far from open. Many businesses still remain closed by our guests. More than half based on what we saw driving through many of the commercial streets. A lot of the folks are still hesitant, uncertain about what they believe might come assuming that could be a second wave. David Culver, CNN Shanghai.</p><p>GORANI: Well, that is China. In the United States to the delight of some to the disbelief of others some U.S. states are allowing non-essential businesses like tattoo parlors and massage centers, some restaurants to reopen. Martin Savidge is in Atlanta and I believe you're in front of a waffle house, Martin. What's it been like this morning?</p><p>MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Hala. Well, it's been slow. It's been very slow. The restaurant has been open for takeout throughout the whole coronavirus period but today as you know in Georgia it's the first day that restaurants were allowed to offer dine in once more. Since they opened at 6:00 a.m. only three people have taken advantage of that. The rest of those who have gone in about a dozen more have decided they're carrying out. Thank you very much.</p><p>It's a slow start, but it's a beginning. And Georgia no longer is the only state that is making these small steps.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVIDGE: This morning, restaurants and theaters are allowed to resume business in the state of Georgia, joining salons, tattoo parlors and gyms already able to operate. Some local leaders fear Governor Brian Kemp is encouraging workers to return far too soon.</p><p>KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS, MAYOR OF ATLANTA: I hope that the governor is right and I'm wrong, because if he is wrong, more people will die. And this notion that we can somehow deal with more people who are sick is ludicrous. Because we don't have a cure.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Georgia is one of at least a dozen states where some businesses are starting to reopen, including Colorado, where services such as curbside delivery at retail stores and elective surgeries are allowed to resume today.</p><p>The governor says he's still encouraging residents to avoid unnecessary trips.</p><p>GOV. JARDEN POLIS (D-O): We're all worried about a potential for a second spike, whether it's in the fall, along with flu season, in September, October.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Nationwide, people are starting to lose patience staying indoors. Weather tempting many in Orange County, California, to flock to the beach this weekend as a heat wave hit. Now the Newport Beach City Council will consider closing their shores for the next three weekends.</p><p>Florida's governor faced some scrutiny for being one of the first to allow local leaders to reopen beaches. But he says he's in no rush to fully reopen the rest of society.</p><p>GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): I'm less concerned about a specific date than I am about getting it right.</p><p>SAVIDGE: The White House's coronavirus task force coordinator says social distancing is likely needed through the summer, until there are major advances in testing.</p><p>DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASKFORCE COORDINATOR: We have to realize that we have to have a breakthrough innovation in testing. And I know corporations and diagnostics are working on that now. We have to have a breakthrough.</p><p>[10:40:05]</p><p>SAVIDGE: With the President dialing back on his daily briefings, CNN has learned the White House is planning more economy-focused events that could include round tables with CEOs and workers to highlight efforts to spur an economic recovery.</p><p>Aides believe Trump is better positioned to drive an economic message rather than a health one.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVIDGE: Waffle house is a chain of restaurants. Before coronavirus they employed 40,000 people. Today that number is 12,000. Just one example of how coronavirus is the devastating economic impact on the lives of so many people. Hala?</p><p>GORANI: All right. And those are -- many of them, people who were living in some cases paycheck to paycheck. So a really difficult time for them and so many others. Thanks very much. Martin Savidge in Atlanta.</p><p>Now health officials have repeatedly said since the beginning of this pandemic that something called contact tracing is essential to containing the spread of the virus. That means coming --0 counting and tracing back all the people that someone infected had contact with. Sarah Sidner has more on what this means and how easy that would be to implement.</p><p>AMY DRISCOLL, SURVIVED CORONAVIRUS: This was painful.</p><p>SARA SIDNER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Amy Driscoll says coronavirus had her in a vice grip that wouldn't let go for weeks.</p><p>DRISCOLL: Every breath, every movement, every, you know, raising your arms, rolling over in bed, every single thing is painful.</p><p>SIDNER: Less than two hours after arriving home from the hospital, her phone rang. It was the county health department, asking lots of questions.</p><p>DRISCOLL: Who have I seen in the last two weeks, where was I in the last two weeks, who was I in contact with, where do I work.</p><p>SIDNER: The Health Department was doing what is called contact tracing.</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY ): You have to trace every person who comes up positive. Trace means investigate. Investigate all those prior contacts.</p><p>SIDNER: Driscoll traced her steps. She'd gone to work. Her boss and staff had to be contacted. She went to a restaurant for lunch. She went to her hair salon. They had to be contacted.</p><p>She went to a Cleveland Cavaliers game. All her family members who sat with her were contacted. This kind of contact tracing is happening across the country and the world. And those suffering through the deadly COVID-19 outbreak in New York to those connected to the first major U.S. outbreak in Washington State, to California, the first place where a statewide stay-at- home order was announced.</p><p>Experts say without contract tracing and enough testing, America and the world cannot reopen safely.</p><p>JOSHUA MICHAUD, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR GLOBAL HEALTH POLICY, KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION: We're going to be at risk of resurgence of this disease, not just in the fall, but going into next year.</p><p>SIDNER: So you're saying without contact tracing, a massive amount -- without testing a massive amount, we could find ourselves right back where we started?</p><p>MICHAUD: I think we could find ourselves very much at risk of another resurgence.</p><p>SIDNER: But the U.S. does not have enough people to do the tracing. State health officials estimate there are about 2,000 people doing this work now, but Johns Hopkins University warns we need at least 100,000.</p><p>For now, contact tracing is only as good as your memory. This is hard. I mean, before stay-at-home orders, can you remember all the people you had close contact with over a two-week period, say, at the coffee shop? Or at the grocery store? Or at a restaurant? Or at your child's school?</p><p>And that's where big tech like Google and Apple are jumping in. They will soon have an app you can voluntarily download built with health departments so they can see detailed location data from your cellphone. But the public may be skittish about it due to privacy concerns. Still, contact tracing requires serious legwork. L.A.'s mayor is pushing for Federal help.</p><p>MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI (D-LA): We're probably going to need hundreds of thousands of people who would be put to work. It should be funded by the Feds by enacted locally.</p><p>SIDNER: As for Driscoll, her contacts have been found. The Health Department tells her that none have symptoms so far. But testing is still a problem.</p><p>DRISCOLL: I've had no additional testing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI: And that was Sarah Sidner reporting. The United States is bracing for some major food supply disruptions because the coronavirus pandemic has affected meat production facilities across the country. The concern is so great that Tyson Foods took out a full page ad in the New York Times and Washington Post. Its top executive warns the food supply chain is breaking and he's calling for urgent measures.</p><p>Dianne Gallagher joins me now live with that story. So how is the food supply chain being impacted negatively by this pandemic?</p><p>DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So, Hala, first and foremost, the food supply chain is vulnerable right now but it's not necessarily in crisis unless you're a farmer or a worker inside that plant.</p><p>[10:45:09]</p><p>GALLAGHER: And what we're seeing across the country right now are more than a dozen plants that have shut down because of coronavirus outbreaks in their employees. We're talking hundreds at one plant more than 1000 cases connected to just one single plant in South Dakota. And so they're shutting these facilities down because their workers are getting sick. That puts a kink in the food chain supply because the farmers have nowhere to send their livestock.</p><p>So farmers right now are dealing with the financial repercussions of this and in some more extreme cases, they're beginning to consider euthanizing the animals that they have on hand because they have nowhere to send them and no more room to keep them at their facility. So we're looking at a significant problem on the front and middle end of the food chain. Now when it comes to the grocery stores and that warning from the Tyson Foods Board Chairman.</p><p>As well as the Smithfield CEO, the company that runs that plant in South Dakota said we are perilously close to the edge of our meat supply in the United States. We've talked to experts who say that it's far more likely that Americans are going to see less of a variety at the grocery store, potentially see a reduction in the amount of pork that's available, or maybe specific cuts of meat.</p><p>More bone in chicken instead of chicken breasts. But it's not a matter of less meat per se, but less variety in meat, the same brands that are used to buying. And so people may have to make different choices, but they're not going to not have meat right now. There is concern though, of course, Hala, on whether or not they're going to be able to keep those farmers financially sound afterward.</p><p>And of course, those workers keeping their health safe which is first and foremost, most important.</p><p>GORANI: Exactly. It is the most important. A little less variety, if that's the only issue for a lot of people. I think they can weather that. But you know, everybody just needs to stay healthy. Thank you so much, Dianne Gallagher joining us live from Atlanta.</p><p>When we come back, a potential treatment for COVID-19 might be -- might be right under our noses. We'll be right back.</p><p>GORANI: Well, could it be that the A, treatment for COVID-19 was right under our noses, right in our medicine chests all along? Researchers are exploring a particular drug that is found over the counter and most pharmacies. Our Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen is here with that. What drug are we talking about here, Elizabeth?</p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hala, the drug is called famotidine. It's sold as the drug (INAUDIBLE) the United States and has different names all over the world and astute American doctor treating coronavirus patients in China made an observation about patients who were taking this drug. It was an astute observation that is now led to a large clinical trial in New York City.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COHEN: Could it be that a medicine on drugstore shelves might help in the fight against coronavirus? Doctors are trying to figure that out. Researchers in New York City are studying the active ingredient in Pepcid, called famotidine. It's because of something doctors observed in China.</p><p>DR. KEVIN TRACEY, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH: Patients who were sick with COVID but were taking Famotidine had a -- had a better outcome.</p><p>COHEN: Now doctors at Northwell Health are trying it out in a clinical trial.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You do the hard work.</p><p>COHEN: So far they've enrolled 187 patients and expect preliminary results in a few weeks.</p><p>TRACEY: There are many examples in the history of medicine where a drug that was designed for one purpose turns out to have an effect in another disease.</p><p>[10:55:01]</p><p>COHEN: But Dr. Tracey warns, don't rush out to buy heartburn medicine. The patients in the study are in the hospital, getting mega-doses intravenously, and it's not clear that it will work.</p><p>While the Northwell doctors work on Famotidine, Dr. Anthony Fauci Saturday had some hopeful words for another drug, Remdesivir, for animals with coronavirus.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE: It was clinical benefit just reported a couple of weeks ago of SARS coronavirus 2 in rhesus macaques.</p><p>COHEN: And the doctor at the University of Nebraska saying results on a major Remdesivir study in humans could be available in a week or two.</p><p>Also over the weekend, the governor of Florida held a press conference, where a doctor said 12 patients had done well on convalescent plasma. Antibodies from someone who's recovered from coronavirus are given to someone who's currently infected.</p><p>DR. SUNIL DESAI, PRESIDENT, ORLANDO HEALTH MEDICAL GROUP: And when we give it to that patient, we essentially are boosting their immune system to help fight this infection. This is going to be a huge game changer in our arm of (INAUDIBLE) to fight COVID-19.</p><p>COHEN: But doctors warn having 12 patients who recovered doesn't necessarily mean very much, since most COVID-19 patients do recover. A larger study with a comparison group would be necessary. Only the best science to get treatments that really work for COVID patients and their families, desperate for answers.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COHEN: Now we don't know if this --</p><p>GORANI: Elizabeth --</p><p>COHEN: Go ahead, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: Sorry. I just wanted to -- because to ask you I guess the question on everyone's mind is, should I just go ahead and take pepsin just in case?</p><p>COHEN: Right, of course, I'm sure I know that's what everyone's thinking. And so the doctors could not emphasize enough that people should not do that for several reasons. One, you know, we don't know if it works. That's why we're doing a clinical trial. This could turn out to be nothing that is possible. Secondly, if you go out and buy these drugs, people with heartburn might not be able to get the medicines that they need.</p><p>We saw that happened with Hydroxychloroquine. And thirdly, the people in this study, they're not taking tablets, they are taking intravenously and they're taking mega doses. So no matter what you do, you're not going to be able to get up to what the people in this study are doing.</p><p>GORANI: Al lright, got it. Thanks very much. Elizabeth Cohen for that. That's going to do it for me. I will see you same time, same place tomorrow. Do stay with CNN. We have a lot more ahead after a quick break.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020042701cbk29</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSF-K4X1-DXH2-6327-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7468\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

It has provided connectivity, entertainment and understanding in the face of an unknown and rapidly evolving enemy. It has been a reliable companion in a world that has become eerily unfamiliar.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Perhaps that sentiment is a little sensational, but investors agree. During a virus pandemic that shakes economic security, consumer demand and global supply chains, cash-rich data experts are the types of company we want to own. The S&amp;P technology index has climbed 15 per cent in 2020, driving a surprising recovery in the wider S&amp;P 500, of which the tech sector makes up a third of the market by value. In the year to date, 20 of the 93 companies in the S&amp;P 500 technology index (not including Amazon, which is listed as a consumer goods company) have reported share price growth of more than 20 per cent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And tech demand remains high. Much of the world is still working from home. Compulsory masks are encouraging people to keep shopping online. Film delays have postponed the allure of the cinema. If there was ever any doubt that tech would have a defining role in the world's future, coronavirus has quashed it.</p><p>The outlook for technology companies has surely never been so appealing. But there is a counter argument to that sunny assumption, one that has begun to rear its head during earnings reporting season as the big tech companies discuss the outlook. Netflix (US:NFLX), Microsoft (US:MSFT) and Twitter (US:TWTR) are among a growing number of companies whose share prices have stumbled after management tempered expectations for the third quarter and beyond. For all of them, the problem is the same: if three months of global lockdown is the pinnacle of demand for tech services, what comes next?</p><p>                     Timing matters                   </p><p>In the past few months, many tech companies' shares have been pushed to all-time highs as investors envisage continued demand for their products and services. While the sheer weight of large companies in the sector means they have been the driving force of the recovery in the S&amp;P 500 - Microsoft's 26 per cent share price rise in the year to date has added $400bn of value to the index - smaller companies have been in equally high demand. Nvidia (US:NVDA), PayPal (US:PYPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (US:AMD) have led the sector's growth this year, their share prices all up more than 50 per cent.</p><p>It's true that soaring demand for many of these companies' products and services in the past few months goes some way to justifying demand for the shares. And Covid-19 has undoubtedly highlighted and in some cases exacerbated the world's reliance on technology. But it remains to be seen if the demand of the past few months would never have happened without the pandemic, or whether it would have merely materialised anyway over a longer period of time. In other words, has Covid-19 generated new opportunities or simply squeezed tech growth into a much smaller time frame?</p><p>That's an important question in the context of company expectations. At the time of writing, the companies in the S&amp;P 500 technology index have an average price/earnings (PE) ratio of 30 times. This time last year, the average PE ratio came in at 27.6. That means investors now have higher expectations of the companies in the tech sector than they did a year ago, before the coronavirus sparked mass disruption.</p><p>                     Where has growth been borrowed?                   </p><p>To justify the higher expectations, companies must be capable of delivering long-term growth. Before the pandemic took hold, the world was already turning increasingly to cloud computing, remote working and virtual entertainment and tech company valuations and long term growth forecasts reflected that. Coronavirus has accelerated this transition, but doesn't seem to have provided new opportunities beyond those that were already in motion.</p><p>Indeed, earnings expectations are the lowest they have been for a long time. On average, tech stocks are expected to report annual earnings growth of 28 per cent in the current financial year and just 22 per cent EPS growth in the following year. That compares with average EPS growth forecasts of 44 per cent this time last year when the sector - trading on an average of 27 times forecast earnings - was already being described as overheated.</p><p>Comment from company management is starting to confirm these concerns. In April, Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, said: \"We've seen two years' worth of digital transformation in just two months.\" More recently, Netflix's chief executive, Reid Hastings, has admitted the, \"strong first half performance likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year\". In the third quarter of 2020, the streaming giant expects to welcome just 2.5m new viewers to its platform, down from 6.8m in the third quarter of 2019. </p><p>Microsoft: how far can cloud computing go?                   </p><p>Microsoft's shareholders have become used to the company's cloud computing business, Azure, reporting growth in the high double digits. The fact that it reported revenue growth of less than 50 per cent in the three months to June therefore came as a surprise, especially considering the number of businesses that have relied on digital services in the past three months.</p><p>Still, the 17 per cent growth from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud business segment, which includes the Azure public cloud and Windows Server, should hardly be scorned, especially as the division now is the single biggest revenue contributor. Commercial cloud business surpassed $50bn for the first time in the company's fiscal fourth quarter. But investors were disappointed that Azure revenue growth dropped from 59 per cent in the three months to March to 47 per cent in the three months to June. With many of the world's digital services now hosted in the cloud and Amazon (US:AMZN), Alphabet (US:GOOGL) and IBM (US:IBM) all delivering their own big cloud services, investors seem concerned that competition and capacity might mean Microsoft's Azure will soon run out of room for further growth.</p><p>But Microsoft has a large advantage over its rivals: it generates significant cash from its other businesses which can be invested straight back into cloud technology development. It has also retained control of the computer operating system market. Most of the world uses Windows to power their computers - indeed, Windows revenue rose 9 per cent in the fourth quarter, despite the fact that it is a 35 year old product - meaning Microsoft has a huge customer base to upsell its cloud technology to.</p><p>Growth is likely to continue to slow as the global cloud market becomes more mature - most organisations that were yet to upgrade to the cloud were forced to do so during the coronavirus pandemic - but that doesn't mean opportunities have faltered entirely.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"432\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col2\">Three Months Ended June 30</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">2020</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2019</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue ($m)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">38,033</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">33,717</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Operating profit ($m)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">13,407</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">12,405</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Profit before taxes ($m)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">13,422</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">12,596</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Earnings per Share ($)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.48</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.72</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net cash from operations ($m)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">18,673</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">16,108</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash, end of period ($m)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">13,576</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">11,356</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>                                          Peak Netflix?                     The second quarter isn't traditionally impressive for Netflix - summer is rolling around in its biggest markets, meaning management tends not to splurge on content and normally fails to entice mountains of new users. In 2018, Netflix gained just 5m new subscribers in the second quarter (out of a total annual increase of 29m) and in the same period of 2019 it saw a decline in its US subscriber base for the first time. Covid-19 has put paid to that trend. Netflix added 10m new subscribers during the second quarter to June, exceeding analysts' forecasts, as life under lockdown spurred enthusiasm for at-home viewing. In fact, the 'pull forward effect' may even have come before the second quarter. New subscriber numbers were markedly higher in the three months to March 2020 when most countries began to enter lockdown. For example, in Asia-Pacific - the region that battled coronavirus and dealt with lockdown earlier than other geographies - the highest growth in net adds came in the first quarter, when new subscribers nearly doubled year on year . The same is true of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region where the company added almost 7m new users in the first quarter, but only 2.6m in the second. These numbers perhaps offer a gloomy clue as to what is yet to come in the US and Canada, the company's leading market. <table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"488\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col2\">Three Months Ended June 30</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">2020</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2019</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenues ($m)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4,923</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">6,148</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Operating income ($m)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,357</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">706</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Income before income taxes ($'000)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,035</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">500</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Earnings per share ($)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.63</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.62</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net cash from (used in) operations ($m)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,041</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-543</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash, end of period ($m)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">7,180</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5,028</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>A spanner in the worksMeanwhile, big tech companies are facing regulatory scrutiny. This week, Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's boss Tim Cook and Alphabet's recently appointed chief executive Sundar Pichai faced questioning as part of the House of Representatives' year-long inquiry into competition in the technology industry.The consensus among regulators, academics and an increasing number of consumers is that the giant tech companies have grown so large they act to stifle competition across multiple industries. These companies have submitted thousands of internal documents as part of the probe, which Congress' antitrust sub-committee has perused for many months. The four leaders - appearing together in front of the House for the first time - are likely to face wide-ranging questions relating to anti-competitive business practice.Mr Zuckerberg - a dab hand at House hearings having spent much of 2018 answering questions about Facebook's (US:FB) role in the Cambridge Analytica data mining scandal - is facing complaints about his company's strategy to eliminate potential rivals through acquisition. Facebook bought both Instagram and WhatsApp before they grew large enough to be considered threats.Mr Bezos - appearing in front of congress for the first time - will be forced to explain why Amazon hasn't abused its power over the third-party merchants that sell goods on its site. Mr Cook - an expert at deflecting scrutiny - has similar complaints levied against his company's App and iTunes stores, which give preference to Apple's (US:AAPL) own products and charge high commission to third parties.Mr Pichai is likely to face the most intense line of questioning. Google alone has had to submit more than 100,000 documents to various state departments researching anticompetitive practices and has been accused of prioritising its own advertisements in its search tool. The company is also facing a separate antitrust probe from the US Department of Justice - the same body that forced tighter regulation of Microsoft in the 1990s.But the antitrust debate is being muddied by other issues. While the purpose of this week's questioning was supposed to be anti-competitive practice, all four executives faced different lines of questioning. Facebook has been accused of failing to monitor hate speech on its platform. Republican representatives questioned Amazon's anti-Trump rhetoric. Google is facing criticism for the way it handles data. Apple's tax payments are under scrutiny.More significantly, the antitrust probe is about informing future bills (rather than prosecuting based on past action) and with a US election coming up, the big tech companies can be pretty certain that no big decisions about new policy are going to be made any time soon. It's also worth noting that regulation doesn't necessarily lead to poor performance. The DoJ's interference at Microsoft may have tempered growth prospects for a few years, but failed to hinder long-term growth.That said, investors should certainly take note of the breadth of regulators on the warpath. Proposals are for a complete overhaul of current antitrust laws, which make it difficult for law enforcers to target companies simply for being too big. The support of the DoJ and Federal Trade Commission certainly gives more weight to the House of Representatives' questioning. In terms of the long-term investment case - which companies that carry PE ratios of more than 40 times certainly need to deliver on - new laws could have an impact on how much money they can earn in the future.Big tech faces extensive regulation <table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"216\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Company</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Regulator</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Issue</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">FB, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Federal Trade Commission</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Acquisitions - how many acquisitions were too small to be reported at the time?</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">AMZN, FB, GOOGL, AAPL</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">House Judiciary Committee</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Antitrust - have other companies been badly impacted by monopoly power</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Google</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">US Department of Justice</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Antitrust</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Google</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">State departments, led by Texas Attorney General</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Cross over between search and ads business</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Google</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EU regulators</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Search manipulationAdvertising contractsGoogle ShoppingAndroid platform</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Google</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">German regulators</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Data storage from voice assistant</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">YouTube</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Videos targeting children</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Facebook</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Federal Trade Commission</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Cambridge Analytica data miningAntitrust</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Facebook</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Eastern District of New York</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Data sharing</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Facebook</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Nine attorney generals</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Endangering consumer data</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Facebook</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EU regulators</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Libra currency proposal</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Amazon</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EU regulators</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Antitrust</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Apple</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Supreme Court</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Antitrust relating to the iOS app store</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Apple</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EU regulators</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Antitrust relating to the iOS app store</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>                     Beyond the FANMAGs                   </p><p>High valuations and regulatory concerns make up most of the criticism levied at the investment case of the US tech giants. An optimist's rebuttal? These companies' quality warrants high valuations.</p><p>It's true that the stocks that have driven most of the S&amp;P 500's growth this year are phenomenally high-quality companies. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Apple and Google (collectively, the FANMAGs) have achieved annualised three-year revenue growth of 22 per cent, average profit margins of 35 per cent and a return on capital employed well over 20 per cent. These companies - most notably Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet - have exposure to major trends that are likely to shape the way we live in the coming years.</p><p>But not all tech stocks come with this quality or long-term growth potential. According to data collected by private investment bank Verdad, 500 of the roughly 3,000 US stocks with a market capitalisation of more than $100m are both more expensive than the FANMAG stocks and have lower-quality financials. Verdad says that these so-called 'Bubble 500' companies trade at approximately 14 times forecast sales, but make no profits.</p><p>True, the 500 companies only contribute 7 per cent of the value of the S&amp;P 500 - the six FANMAGs alone make up more of the index - but that doesn't mean their prescence on the stock market isn't significant. Verdad points out that investors in the S&amp;P 500 are often paying over the odds for lower-quality companies. Despite the fact that some of these companies are operating in very exciting areas of the market (Tesla, for example), it is hard to justify such lofty valuations - most of the FANMAGs have never traded at more than 10 times revenue. </p><p>More importantly, it is worth considering the fact that the lofty valuations of these companies are being propped up by the strength of just a handful of tech giants. Therefore, what is the outlook for the bulk of the companies on the market (by number, rather than value) if the biggest companies begin to disappoint? Bursting the bubble of big tech could spark a spiral of decline that impacts the investment case of all the companies that have risen during a golden digital era. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-64841836</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-R701-F021-6225-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2604\"/><timeReceived>5:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

It has been a reliable companion in a world that has become eerily unfamiliar.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Perhaps that sentiment is a little sensational, but investors agree. During a virus pandemic that shakes economic security, consumer demand and global supply chains, cash-rich data experts are the types of company we want to own. The S&amp;P technology index has climbed 15 per cent in 2020, driving a surprising recovery in the wider S&amp;P 500, of which the tech sector makes up a third of the market by value. In the year to date, 20 of the 93 companies in the S&amp;P 500 technology index (not including Amazon, which is listed as a consumer goods company) have reported share price growth of more than 20 per cent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And tech demand remains high. Much of the world is still working from home. Compulsory face masks are encouraging people to keep shopping online. Film delays have postponed the allure of the cinema. If there was ever any doubt that tech would have a defining role in the world's future, coronavirus has quashed it.</p><p>The outlook for technology companies has surely never been so appealing. But there is a counter argument to that sunny assumption, one that has started to rear its head during earnings reporting season as the big tech companies discuss the outlook. Netflix (US:NFLX), Microsoft (US:MSFT) and Twitter (US:TWTR) are among a growing number of companies whose share prices have stumbled after management tempered expectations for the third quarter and beyond. For all of them, the problem is the same: if three months of global lockdown is the pinnacle of demand for tech services, what comes next? Timing matters In the past few months, many tech companies' shares have been pushed to all-time highs as investors envisage continued demand for their products and services. While the sheer weight of large companies in the sector means they have been the driving force of the recovery in the S&amp;P 500 - Microsoft's 26 per cent share price rise in the year to date has added $400bn of value to the index - smaller companies have been in equally high demand. Nvidia (US:NVDA), PayPal (US:PYPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (US:AMD) have led the sector's growth this year, their share prices all up more than 50 per cent.</p><p>It's true that soaring demand for many of these companies' products and services in the past few months goes some way to justifying demand for the shares. And Covid-19 has undoubtedly highlighted, and in some cases exacerbated, the world's reliance on technology. But it remains to be seen if the demand of the past few months would never have happened without the pandemic, or whether it would have materialised anyway over a longer period of time. In other words, has Covid-19 generated new opportunities or simply squeezed tech growth into a much smaller time frame? That's an important question in the context of company expectations. At the time of writing, the companies in the S&amp;P 500 technology index have an average price/earnings (PE) ratio of 30 times. This time last year, the average PE ratio came in at 27.6. That means investors now have higher expectations of the companies in the tech sector than they did a year ago, before the coronavirus sparked mass disruption.</p><p>Where has growth been borrowed? To justify the higher expectations, companies must be capable of delivering long-term growth. Before the pandemic took hold, the world was already turning increasingly to cloud computing, remote working and virtual entertainment and tech company valuations and long-term growth forecasts reflected that. Coronavirus has accelerated this transition, but doesn't seem to have provided new opportunities beyond those that were already in motion.</p><p>Indeed, earnings expectations are the lowest they have been for a long time. On average, tech stocks are expected to report annual earnings growth of 28 per cent in the current financial year and just 22 per cent earnings per share (EPS) growth in the following year. That compares with average EPS growth forecasts of 44 per cent this time last year when the sector - trading on an average of 27 times forecast earnings - was already being described as overheated.</p><p>Comment from company management is starting to confirm these concerns. In April, Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, said: \"We've seen two years' worth of digital transformation in just two 'What comes next for investment in the tech sector?' is a question Mary McDougall put to Ben Rogoff, technology director at the hugely popular Polar Capital Technology Trust. His response: \"I feel like the growth trajectory for those companies is very strong. The challenge is always - and it really is a challenge for a growth investor - to try and assess how much of that is already captured in the valuation.\"</p><p>Look out for the podcast online to find out which tech companies Ben thinks are worth the price and to hear his thoughts on the regulatory outlook for the sector companies as we head towards a hugely polarised presidential election.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/podcasts\">www.investorschronicle.co.uk/podcasts</url>/ months.\" More recently, Netflix's chief executive, Reid Hastings, has admitted the \"strong first half performance Netflix's first likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year\". In the third quarter of 2020, the streaming giant expects to welcome just 2.5m new viewers to its platform, down from 6.8m in the third quarter of 2019.</p><p>A spanner in the works Meanwhile, big tech companies are facing regulatory scrutiny. This week, Amazon's founder, JeffBezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's boss Tim Cook and Alphabet's recently appointed chief executive Sundar Pichai faced questioning as part of the House of Representatives' year-long inquiry into competition in the technology industry.</p><p>The consensus among regulators, academics and an increasing number of consumers is that the giant tech companies have grown so large they act to stifle competition across multiple ple industries. These companies have submitted thousands of internal documents as part of the probe, which Congress's antitrust subcommittee has perused for many months. The four leaders - appearing together in front of the House for the first time - are likely to face wide-ranging questions relating to anti-competitive first business practice.</p><p>Facebook's (US:FB) Mr Zuckerberg - a dab hand at House hearings having spent much of 2018 answering questions about role in the Cambridge Analytica data mining scandal - is facing complaints about his company's strategy to eliminate potential rivals through acquisition. Facebook bought both Instagram and WhatsApp before they grew large enough to be considered threats.</p><p>Mr Bezos - appearing in front of congress for the first time - will be forced to explain why Amazon deflecting first hasn't abused its power over the third-party merchants that sell goods on its site. Mr Cook - an expert at deflecting scrutiny - has similar complaints levied against his company's App and iTunes stores, which give preference to Apple's (US:AAPL) own products and charge high commission to third parties.</p><p>Mr Pichai is likely to face the most intense line of questioning. Google alone has had to submit more than 100,000 documents to various state departments researching anticompetitive practices and has been accused of prioritising its own advertisements in its search tool. The company is also facing a separate antitrust probe from the US Department of Justice - the same body that forced tighter regulation of Microsoft in the 1990s.</p><p>But the antitrust debate is being muddied by other issues. While the purpose of this week's questioning was supposed to be anti-competitive practice, all four executives faced different lines of questioning. Facebook has been accused of failing to monitor hate speech on its platform. Republican representatives questioned Amazon's anti-Trump rhetoric. Google is facing criticism for the way it handles data. Apple's tax payments are under scrutiny.</p><p>different significantly, More significantly, the antitrust probe is about informing future bills (rather than prosecuting based on past action) and with a US election coming up, the big tech companies can be pretty certain that no big decisions about new policy are going to be made any time soon. It's also worth noting that regulation doesn't necessarily lead to poor performance. The DoJ's interference at Microsoft may have tempered growth prospects Microsoft: how far can cloud computing go? Microsoft's shareholders have become used to the company's cloud computing business, Azure, reporting growth in the high double digits. The fact that it reported revenue growth of less than 50 per cent in the three months to June therefore came as a surprise, especially considering the number of businesses that have relied on digital services in the past three months.</p><p>Still, the 17 per cent growth from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud business segment, which includes the Azure public cloud and Windows Server, should hardly be scorned, especially as the division now is the single biggest revenue contributor. Commercial cloud business surpassed $50bn for the first time in the company's fiscal fourth quarter. But investors were disappointed that Azure revenue growth dropped from 59 per cent in the three months to March to 47 per cent in the three months to June. With many of the world's digital services now hosted in the cloud and Amazon (US:AMZN), Alphabet (US:GOOGL) and IBM (US:IBM) all delivering their own big cloud services, investors seem concerned that competition and capacity might mean Microsoft's Azure will soon run out of room for further growth.</p><p>But Microsoft has a large advantage over its rivals: it generates significant cash from its other businesses, which is invested straight back into cloud technology development. It has also retained control of the computer operating system market. Most of the world uses Windows to power their computers - indeed, Windows revenue rose 9 per cent in the fourth quarter, despite the fact that it is a 35-year-old product - meaning Microsoft has a huge customer base to upsell its cloud technology to.</p><p>Growth is likely to continue to slow as the global cloud market becomes more mature - most organisations that were yet to upgrade to the cloud were forced to do so during the coronavirus pandemic - but that doesn't mean opportunities have faltered entirely.</p><p>for a few years, but failed to hinder long-term growth.</p><p>That said, investors should certainly take note of the difficult breadth of regulators on the warpath. Proposals are for a complete overhaul of current antitrust laws, which make it difficult for law enforcers to target companies simply for being too big. The support of the DoJ and Federal Trade Commission certainly gives more weight to the House of Representatives' questioning. In terms of the long-term investment case - which companies that carry PE ratios of more than 40 times certainly need to deliver on - new laws could have an impact on how much money they can earn in the future.</p><p>Beyond the FANMAGs High valuations and regulatory concerns make up most of the criticism levied at the investment case of the US tech giants. An optimist's rebuttal? These companies' quality warrants high valuations.</p><p>It's true that the stocks that have driven most of the S&amp;P 500's growth this year are phenomenally high-quality companies. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Apple and Google (collectively, the FANMAGs) have achieved annualised three-year revenue growth of 22 per cent, average profit margins of 35 per cent and a return on capital employed well over 20 per cent. These companies - most notably Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet - have exposure to major trends that are likely to shape the way we live in the coming years.</p><p>But not all tech stocks come with this quality or long-term growth potential. According to data collected by private investment bank Verdad, 500 of the roughly 3,000 US stocks with a market capitalisation of more than $100m are both more expensive than the FANMAG stocks and have lower-quality financials. Verdad says that these so-called 'Bubble 500' companies trade at approximately 14 times forecast sales, but make no profits.</p><p>True, the 500 companies only contribute 7 per cent of the value of the S&amp;P 500 - the six FANMAGs alone make up more of the index - but that doesn't mean their presence on the stock market isn't significant. Verdad points out that investors in the S&amp;P 500 are often paying over the odds for lower-quality companies. Despite the fact that some of these companies are operating in very exciting areas of the market (Tesla (US:TSLA), for example), it is hard to justify such lofty valuations - most of the FANMAGs have never traded at more than 10 times revenue.</p><p>More importantly, it is worth considering the fact that the lofty valuations of these companies are being propped up by the strength of just a handful of tech giants. Therefore, what is the outlook for the bulk of the companies on the market (by number, rather than value) if the biggest companies begin to disappoint? Bursting the bubble of big tech could spark a spiral of decline that impacts the investment case of all the companies that have risen during a golden digital era.</p><p>Peak Netflix? Netflix? The second quarter isn't traditionally impressive for Netflix - summer is NetflixNetflix rolling around in its biggest markets, meaning management tends not to splurge on content and normally fails to entice mountains of new users. In 2018, Netflix gained just 5m new subscribers in the second quarter (out of a total annual increase of 29m) and in the same period of 2019 it saw a decline in its US subscriber base for the first time. Covid-19 has put paid to that trend. Netflix added 10m new subscribers during the second quarter first Netflix to June, exceeding analysts' forecasts, as life under lockdown spurred enthusiasm for at-home viewing.</p><p>In fact, the 'pull forward effect' may even have come before the second quarter. New subscriber numbers were markedly higher in the three months to March 2020 when most countries began to enter lockdown. For example, in Asia-Pacific - the region that battled coronavirus and dealt with lockdown earlier than other geographies - the highest growth in net adds came in the first quarter, when new subscribers Pacific first nearly doubled year on year. The same is true of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region where the company added almost 7m new users in the first quar-first quarter, but only 2.6m in the second. These numbers perhaps offer a gloomy clue as to what is yet to come in the US and Canada, the company's leading market.</p><p/><p>'If three months of global lockdown is the pinnacle of demand for tech services, what comes next?'</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-161977525</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GF-PRP1-JCBW-N3WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

I fully expect that the usual people will claim that I am writing this because I always support Google -- which would be an interesting point if true -- but of course it is not. I regularly[1] criticize[2] Google[3] for a variety[4] sketchy[5] practices[6]. However, what this story is really about is why the Boston Globe would publish, without fact checking, a bunch of complete and utter nonsense. The Boston Globe recently put together an entire issue about \"Big Tech\" and what to do about it. </p><p>I'd link to it, but for some reason when I click on it, the Boston Globe is now telling me it no longer exists -- which, maybe, suggests that the Boston Globe should do a little more \"tech\" work itself. However, a few folks sent in this fun interview with noted Google/Facebook hater Jonathan Taplin[7]. Now, we've had our run-ins with Taplin in the past -- almost always to correct a whole bunch of factual errors[8] that he makes in attacking internet companies. And, it appears that we need to do this again. Of course, you would think that the Boston Globe might have done this for us, seeing as they're a \"newspaper\" and all. Rather than just printing the words verbatim of someone who is going to say things that are both false and ridiculous, why not fact check your own damn interview? Instead, it appears that the Globe decided \"let's find someone to say mean things about Google\" and turned up Taplin... and then no one at the esteemed Globe decided \"gee, maybe we should check to see if he actually knows what he's talking about or if he's full of shit.\" Instead, they just ran the interview, and people who read it without knowing that Taplin is laughably wrong won't find out about it unless they come here. But... let's dig in.What would smart regulation look like? You start with fairly rigorous privacy regulations where you have the ability to opt out of data collection from Google. Then you look at something like a modification of the part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which is what is known as safe harbor. Google and Facebook and Twitter operate under a very unique set of legal regimes that no other company gets to benefit from, which is that no one can sue them for doing anything wrong.Ability to opt-out of data collection -- fair enough. To some extent that's already possible if you know what you're doing, but it would be good if Google/Facebook made that easier. Honestly, that's not going to actually have much of an impact really. I still think the real solution to the dominance of Google/Facebook is to enable more competition that can provide better services that can help limit the power of those guys. But Taplin's suggestion really seems to be going in the other direction, seeking to lock in their power, while complaining about them. The \"modification\" of the DMCA, for example, would almost certainly lock in Google and Facebook and make it nearly impossible for competitors to step up. Also, the DMCA is not \"known as safe harbor.\" The DMCA -- a law that was almost universally pushed by the record labels -- is a law that updated copyright law in a number of ways, including giving copyright holders the power to censor on the internet, without any due process or judicial review of whether or not infringement had taken place. There is a small part of it, within Section 512, that includes a very limited safe harbor, that says that while actual infringers are still liable for infringement, the internet platforms they use are not liable if they follow a bunch of rules, including removing the content expeditiously and kicking people off their platform for repeat infringement. The idea that \"Google and Facebook and Twitter operate under a very unique set of legal regimes that no other company gets to benefit from\" is complete and utter nonsense, and the Boston Globe's Alex Kingsbury should have pushed back on it. The Copyright Office's database of DMCA registered agents includes nearly 9,000 companies[9] (including ours!), because the DMCA's 512 safe harbors apply to any internet platform who registers. Google, Facebook and Twitter don't get special treatment. Furthermore, as a new report recently showed[10], taking away such safe harbors would do more to entrench the power of Google, Facebook and Twitter since all three companies can deal with such liability, while lots of smaller companies and upstarts cannot. It boggles the mind that the Boston Globe let Taplin say something so obviously false without challenging him. And, we haven't even gotten to the second half of that sentence, which is the bizarre and simply false claim that the DMCA's Section 512 means that \"no one can sue them for doing anything wrong.\" Again, this is just factually incorrect, and a good journalist would challenge someone for making such a blatantly false claim. The DMCA's 512 does not, in any way, stop anyone from suing anyone \"for doing anything wrong.\" That's ridiculous. The DMCA's 512 says that a copyright holder will be barred from suing a platform for copyright infringement if a user (not the platform) infringes on copyright and when notified of that alleged infringement, the platform expeditiously removes that content. In addition to that, thanks to various court rulings, the DMCA's safe harbors are limited in other ways, including that the platforms cannot encourage their use for infringement and they must have implemented repeat infringer policies. No where in any of that does it say that platforms can't be sued for doing anything wrong. If the platform does something wrong, they absolutely can be sued. It's simply a fantasy interpretation of the DMCA to pretend otherwise. Why didn't the Boston Globe point out these errors? I have no idea, but they let the interview and its nonsense continue.In other words, they have complete liability protection from being sued for any of the content that is on their services. That is totally unique. Obviously newspapers doesn't get that protection. And of course also [tech giants] have other advantages over all other corporations; all of the labor that users put in is basically free. Most of us work an hour a day for Google or Facebook improving their services, and we don't get anything for that other than just services.Again, they do not have \"complete liability protection from being sued for any content that is on their services.\" Anything they post themselves, they are still liable for. Anything that that users post on their platform that the sites don't comply with the rules of Section 512, they can be liable for. All DMCA 512 is saying is that they can be liable for a small sliver of content if they fail to follow the rules set out in the law that was pushed for heavily by the recording industry. Next up, the claim that \"obviously newspapers don't get that protection\" is preposterous. Of course they do. A quick search of the Copyright Office database shows registrations by tons of newspaper companies, including the Chicago Tribune, the Daily News, USA Today, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the LA Times, the Baltimore Sun, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Albany Times Union, the NY Times, the Times Herald, the Times Picayune, the Washington Times, the Post Standard, the Palm Beach Post, the Cincinnati Post, the Kentucky Post, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the NY Post, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the Washington Post, Ann Arbor News, the Albany Business News, Reno News ...view, the Dayton Daily News, Springfiled News Sun, the Des Moines Register, the Cincinnati Enquirer, the Branson News Leader, the Bergen News, the Pennysaver News, the News-Times, the New Canaan News, Orange County News, San Antonio News-Express, the National Law Journal, the Williamsburg Journal Tribune, the Wall Street Journal, the Jacksonville Journal-Courier, the Lafayette Journal-Courier, the Oregon Statesman Journal, the Daily Journal and on and on and on. Literally I just got tired of writing down names. There are a lot more. Notably missing? As far as I can tell, the Boston Globe has not registered a DMCA agent. Odd that. But, back to the point: yes, newspapers get the same damn protection. There is nothing special about Google, Facebook and Twitter. And by now Taplin must know this. So should the Boston Globe. Ah, but perhaps -- you'll argue -- he means that the paper versions don't get the same protection, while the internet sites do. And, you'd still be wrong. All the DMCA 512 says is that you don't get to put liability on a third party who had no say in the content posted. With your normal print newspaper that's not an issue because a newspaper is not a user-generated content thing. It has an editor who is choosing what's in there. That's not true of online websites. And that's why we need a safe harbor like the DMCA's, otherwise people stupidly blame a platform for actions of their users. And let's not forget -- because this is important -- anything a website does to directly encourage infringement would take away those safe harbors, a la the Grokster ruling in the Supreme Court, which said you lose those safe harbors if you're inducing infringing. In other words, basically every claim made by Taplin here is wrong. Why does the Boston Globe challenge none of them? What kind of interview is this? And we're just on the first question. Let's move on.What would eliminating the 'safe harbor' provision in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act mean? YouTube wouldn't be able to post 44,000 ISIS videos and sell ads for them.Wait, what? Once again, there's so much wrong in just this one sentence that it's almost criminal that the Boston Globe's reporter doesn't say something. Let's start with this one first: changing copyright law to get rid of a safe harbor will stop YouTube from posting ISIS videos? What about copyright law has any impact on ISIS videos one way or the other? Absolutely nothing. Even assuming that ISIS is somehow violating someone's copyright in their videos (which, seems unlikely?) what does that have to do with anything? Second, YouTube is not posting any ISIS videos. YouTube is not posting any videos. Users of YouTube are posting videos. That's the whole point of the safe harbors. That it's users doing the uploading and not the platform. And the point of the DMCA safe harbor is to clarify the common sense point that you don't blame the tool for the user's actions. You don't blame Ford because someone drove a Ford as a getaway car in a bank robbery. You don't blame AT...hen someone calls in a bomb threat. Third, YouTube has banned ISIS videos (and any terrorist propaganda videos) going back a decade[11]. Literally back to 2008. That's when YouTube stopped allowing videos from terrorist organizations. How could Taplin not know this? How could the Boston Globe not know this. Over the years, YouTube has even built new algorithms designed to automatically spot \"extremist\" content[12] and block it (how well that works is another question). Indeed, YouTube is so aggressive in taking down such videos that it's been known to also take down the videos[13] of humanitarian groups documenting war crimes by terrorists. Finally, YouTube has long refused to put ads on anything deemed controversial content. Also, it won't put ads[14] on videos of channels without lots and lots of followers. So basically in this one short sentence -- 14 words long -- has four major factual errors in it. Wow. And he's not done yet.Or they wouldn't be able to put up any musician's work, whether they wanted it on the service or not, without having to bear some consequences. That would really change things.Again, YouTube is not the one putting up works. Users of YouTube are. And if and when those people upload a video -- that is not covered by fair use or other user rights -- and it is infringing, then the copyright holder has every right under the DMCA that Taplin misstates earlier to force the video down. And if YouTube doesn't take it down, then they face all the consequences of being an infringer. So what would \"really change\" if we removed the DMCA's safe harbors? Well, YouTube has already negotiated licenses with basically every record label and publisher at this point. So, basically nothing would change on YouTube. But, you know, for every other platform, they'd be screwed. So, Taplin's plan to \"break up\" Google... is to lock the company in as the only platform. Great. And this leaves aside the fact (whether we like it or not) that under YouTube's ContentID system which allows copyright holders to \"monetize\" infringing works has actually opened up a (somewhat strange) new revenue stream for artists, who are now actually profiting greatly from letting people use their works without going through the hassle of negotiating a full license.I also think it would change the whole fake news conversation completely, because, once Facebook or YouTube or Google had to take responsibility for what's on their services, they would have to be a lot more careful to monitor what goes on there.Again... what? What in the \"whole fake news conversation\" has anything to do with copyright? This is just utter nonsense. Second, if platforms are suddenly \"responsible\" for what's on their service, then... Taplin is saying that the very companies he hates, that he thinks are the ruination of culture and society, should be the final arbiters of what speech is okay online. Is that really what he wants? He wants Google and Facebook and YouTube -- three platforms he's spent years attacking -- determining if his own speech is fake news? Really? Because, let's face it, as much as I hate the term, this interview is quintessential fake news. Nearly every sentence Taplin says includes some false statement -- often multiple false statements. And the Boston Globe published it. Should the Boston Globe now be liable for Taplin's deranged understanding of the law? Should we be able to sue the Boston Globe because it published utter nonsense uttered by Jonathan Taplin? Because that's what he's arguing for. Oh, but, I forgot, according to Taplin, the Boston Globe -- as a newspaper -- has no such safe harbor, so it's already fair game. Sue away, people...Wouldn't that approach subject these services to death by a thousand copyright-infringement lawsuits? It would depend on how it was put into practice. When someone tries to upload pornography to YouTube, an artificial intelligence agent sees a bare breast and shunts it into a separate queue. Then a human looks at it and says, 'Well, is this National Geographic, or is this porn?' If it's National Geographic it probably gets on the service, and if it's porn it goes in the trash. So, it's not like they're not doing this already. It's just they've chosen to filter porn off of Facebook and Google and YouTube but they haven't chosen to filter ISIS, hate speech, copyrighted material, fake news, that kind of stuff. This is just a business decision on their part. They know every piece of content that's being uploaded because they used the ID to decide who gets the advertising. So they could do all of this very easily. It's just they don't want to do it.First off, finally, the Boston Globe reporter pushes back slightly. Not by correcting any of the many, many false claims that Taplin has made so far, but in highlighting a broader point: that Taplin's solution is completely idiotic and unworkable, because we already see the abuse that the DMCA takedown process gets. But... Taplin goes into spin mode and suggests there's some magic way that this system wouldn't be abused for censorship (even though the existing system is). Then he explains his fantasy-land explanation of how YouTube moderation actually works. He's wrong. This is not how it works. Most content is never viewed by a human. But let's delve in deeper again. Taplin and some of his friends like to point to the automated filtering of porn. But porn is something that is much easier to teach a computer to spot. A naked breast is something you can teach a computer to spot pretty well. Fake news is not. Hate speech is not. Separately, notice that Taplin never ever mentions ContentID in this entire interview? Even though that does the very thing he seems to insist that YouTube refuses to do? ContentID does exactly what he claims this porn filter is doing. But he pretends it doesn't exist and hasn't existed for years. And the Boston Globe just lets it slide. Also, again, Taplin insists that YouTube and Facebook \"haven't chosen to filter ISIS\" even though both companies have done so for years. How does Taplin not know this? How does the Boston Globe reporter not know this? How does the Boston Globe think that its ignorant reporter should interview this ignorant person? Why did they then decide to publish any of this? Does the Boston Globe employ fact checkers at all? The mind boggles. Meanwhile, we really shouldn't let it slide that Taplin -- when asked specifically about copyright infringement -- seems to argue that if copyright law was changed, it would somehow magically lead Google to stop ISIS videos, hate speech and fake news among other things. None of those things has anything to do with copyright law. Shouldn't he know this? Shouldn't the Boston Globe? As for the second paragraph, it's also utter nonsense. YouTube \"knows every piece of content that's being uploaded because they used the ID to decide who gets the advertising.\" What does that even mean. What is \"the ID\"? And, even in the cases where YouTube does decide to place ads on videos (again, which is greatly restricted, and is not for all content), the fact that Google's algorithms can try to insert relevant ads does not mean that Google \"knows\" what's in the content. It just means that an algorithm does some matching. And, sure, Taplin might point out that if they can do that, why can't they also do it for copyright and ISIS and the answer is that THEY DO. That's the whole fucking point. Again, why is the Boston Globe publishing utter nonsense?Is Google trying to forestall this kind of regulation? Ultimately YouTube is already moving towards being a service that pays content providers. They announced last month that they're going to put up a YouTube music channel. And that will look much more like Spotify than it looks like YouTube. In other words, they will license content from providers, they will charge $10 a month for the service, and you will then get curated lists of music. From the point of view of the artists and the record company, it'll be a lot better than the system that exists now \u2014 where essentially YouTube says to you, your content is going to be on YouTube whether you want it to or not, so check this box if you want us to give you a little bit of the advertising.YouTube has been paying content providers for years. I mean, it's been years since the company announced that in one year alone, it had paid musicians, labels and publishers over a billion dollars[15]. And Taplin claims they're \"moving\" to such a model? Is he stuck in 2005? And, they already license content from providers. The $10/month thing again, is not new (it's been available for years), but that's a separate service, which is not the same as regular YouTube. And it has nothing to do with any of this. If the DMCA changed, then... that wouldn't have any impact at all on any of this. Still, let's recap the logic here: So YouTube offering a music service, which it set up to compete with Spotify and Apple Music, and which has nothing to do with the regular YouTube platform, will somehow \"forestall\" taking away the DMCA's safe harbors? How exactly does that work? I mean, wouldn't the logic work the other way? The whole interview is completely laughable. Taplin repeatedly makes claims that don't pass the laugh test for anyone with even the slightest knowledge of the space. And nowhere does the Boston Globe address the multiple outright factual errors. Sure, I can maybe (maybe?) understand not pushing back on Taplin in the moment of the interview. But why let this go to print without having someone (anyone?!?) with even the slightest understanding of the law or how YouTube actually works, check to see if Taplin's claims were based in reality? Is that really so hard? Apparently it is for the Boston Globe and its \"deputy editor\" Alex Kingsbury.Permalink[16] | Comments[17] | Email This Story[18] [ 1]: <url

I want to thank everybody for coming to our Investor Conference today and welcome everyone, and also those people listening in on the webcast. I know this has been a pretty tough week this week and we appreciate you guys tearing yourselves away from your Bloomberg screens to come here. Believe me, had we known six months ago what we know today, we probably wouldn't have picked today and maybe not even this month.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I just want to briefly go through the agenda. We have a series of management presentations to go through, these include a discussion with our President, Doug Linde, and several of our Regional Managers who will talk about our strategy and some of our portfolio. I'm going to provide an update on the capital markets. I assure you this will be a scintillating topic, especially if you like horror flicks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're going to have a session on our development that will be lead by Mike Walsh and Mitch Norville. Over lunch Ray Ritchey and our crack team of leasing pros are going to talk about the market and this afternoon we're going to have property tours that include a tour and discussion about Russia Wharf, which is located right next door.</p><p>And also we're going to go out to the suburbs and see our CityPoint development. We should be finished around 4:30 and back here. For logistics, on your name tags you will see a table assignment for lunch and also a tour assignment because there are two separate tours.</p><p>I also want to thank a few people who worked tirelessly on putting this conference together. Hopefully you've had a chance to meet or at least speak with Arista Joyner who is our new Investor Relations Manager. Arista joined us this spring from the Midwest and she really worked hard putting this whole thing together and organized the entire event. I also want to recognize [Manny Carvello], [Lisa Teralictus], [Rachel Doyle], [Laura Markasie], [Andy Simpson], all of whom were a huge part of this.</p><p>I do want to refer you to the Safe Harbor, which is our forward-looking statement disclosure. Unlike on an airplane, I don't have to read you the safety instructions but you do have to read it, so I appreciate that. We're going to start things off this morning with some words from Mort Zuckerman. So I'd like to invite Mort up.</p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, BOSTON PROPERTIES: It's not going to be easy to capture the mood of the day, but I thought I would share a story with you about this fellow who came home to his wife a couple of days ago and he said, \"Look sweetheart, I don't know how to tell you this. I thought I was investing our funds safely.</p><p>We had our entire net worth invested in AIG and Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all we thought very, very good investments and they've been virtually wiped out. I just feel terrible about it and I just felt I had to share that with you.\" And she said, \"Listen don't worry, these things happen. I love you, I'll always love you. I'll miss you, but I will always love you.\"</p><p>As a friend of mine put it recently, he said, \"My net worth is now down to a level I never thought it would get up to.\" And in a sense, that does capture a lot of what has happened. A lot of people have lost a lot of money but there has been so much wealth accumulated over the last decade or so that we still have the sort of fire power and fuel to get through this period and rekindle the economy.</p><p>I'm going to just try and indicate some of the basic trends, at least as we see it, and to some extent how it will affect the business that we are in. We obviously all see a lot of the same statistics, the thing that really began to unravel the bubble that, I guess in retrospect, we were all living in. I mean it was what happened to housing.</p><p>I must say this is something which I have watched for quite a long time, not because it's in our particular area of real estate development but quite simply because it is such a critical industry in this country. It is probably one of the largest employers of labor of any industry and we were building 1.6 million to 1.8 million units and those prices were going up.</p><p>Just to put that in perspective, the average increase in housing prices from the year 1945 to the 2000 was 3% a year. And somewhere around 2000, 2001 and 2002 house prices really took off and they grew at a compounded rate between 2002 and 2006 of almost 15% a year. Now it got to a level where those housing prices were quite simply unsustainable by all but a very small portion of the market, if you assume somebody was able to devote even a relatively higher rate of their, or proportion of their income, to cover a home with a 30 year conventional mortgage rate.</p><p>And the market simply stalled and once it stalled it began to slide. I wrote an editorial in US News way back when and looked at those numbers and wrote about it and basically said, \"Before you buy a house just be very, very, very cautious.\" And nobody expected, I think, the kind of decline that we had and nobody quite knows how big the decline is.</p><p>The estimate is to date, if you look at the Case-Schiller Index, for example, which measures one kind of housing, there's another government formula which measures mostly FHA and similarly financed housing which has declined less. But the Case-Schiller Index, which measures new family homes in 20 markets, is off roughly 20% in the last year.</p><p>And frankly, those don't really reflect the true decline in the housing values because these are nominal prices. These do not include sales incentives. And those sales incentives, if you were to believe David Rosenberg of Merrill Lynch, run over $50,000 a unit. So the housing prices, in fact, have declined even more than that.</p><p>And what's more, there is a whole change in the attitude of the buyers who are now really looking at these housing prices and saying \"Why buy now, they're going down. I'll have a better deal six months from now or a year from now, particularly in a time of relative economic uncertainty.\"</p><p>So housing prices in, my judgment, are going to decline and nobody knows where the bottom is. And I do believe that anybody who tells you that they know either doesn't know or has a specific interest in telling you where the bottom is.</p><p>I was listening to Marty Feldstein, the former Chairman of the Economic Advisors and the Principal Economic Advisor for Reagan, who's now at Harvard. And he estimated not only that there are 10 million mortgages today that exceed the value of homes, but that 50% of those mortgages, roughly 5 million homes, the mortgages exceed the value of the homes by 20%.</p><p>Now if you have another 20% decline in housing, you're going to have 5 million homes that homeowners are going to have mortgages that exceed the value of their homes by 40% and probably another 5 million that will exceed by 20% and the rest of them under that. And nobody knows what those people are going to do.</p><p>But it is going to look to me, and I'm sure to many of you, as if it would be in their self interest to either walk from the homes or basically find a way to sit down with the mortgage lender and say, \"Hey, you want the house, you can have it. But unless you write down that mortgage to a level that I can afford, I'm out of here. I'll either rent or I'll find another home, or you can foreclose on the home and then I'll come back in and I'll buy it for even less because the value of foreclosed homes decelerates much more rapidly than any other kind of home.\"</p><p>So there's going to be something that's going to happen. And we don't know just what it is because this has not happened in the lifetime of anybody sitting in this room today. This is really an unprecedented experience. We really had not had major league drops, year-over-year, in housing since the late 1930s. So we don't know what's going to happen. We don't know what people are going to do.</p><p>At some point I suppose, if they get to be discouraged enough, they may very well walk from a lot of these homes. And then you will have a lot of foreclosed homes that are going to be thrown on the markets fairly quickly. Because of course as we know, when you have a lot of mortgages that have been bundled and pooled and sold off as securitized mortgage-backed paper, you have servicers who are going to have to find some way to deal with all of these. It's not going to be easy to renegotiate home mortgages under these circumstances.</p><p>And therefore, just as we over shot in terms of appreciation of home values, you may over shoot in terms of declines. And that's going to have just a hugely damaging effect. I don't know if this is an exact number, but the estimate has been that at the peak of the value of homes, which was the largest single asset on the balance sheet of the average American household, was $22.4 trillion.</p><p>You lose say roughly 30% of that, you're talking about a gigantic decline in the perceived wealth of the American family. And there is, of course as we know, some translation of a decline in wealth to consumer spending, certainly to consumer sentiment. So you're looking at a consumer who is going to be very nervous about his or her major asset, is going to see the stock market having declined, another source of wealth mostly for the top quintile, top 20% who are the major owners of stocks. And what effect is that going to have on consumer spending?</p><p>And the point of all of this in once sense is to say, look, the problems may have started in the housing world, but that housing bubble, once it burst, immediately jumped into the world of finance and burst the bubble in the financial world. You now have double bubble in the housing and the financial world that are sort of interacting with each other, with no known bottom at this stage of the game. It is just an unprecedented time and we are looking at one of the most difficult economic times as we look forward to the next couple years and any one of us, I think, has experienced.</p><p>So that's sort of the back drop of one part of it. It's not the only part of it. What of course has happened is it may have started in subprime homes and Alt-A homes, in part because of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which had somewhere between a third and a half of these home mortgages in the first half dozen years of this century or this decade, pushed by politicians who wanted to expand home ownership and exceeded to, by management of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and in many ways was a disgrace.</p><p>And it was a disgrace in political terms because particularly the Democrats, I have to say, back in the latter part of the last century and the beginning part of this century who dominated this issue, they set up a huge political operation, one of the most lethal political operations, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that in terms of rewarding friends and punishing enemies.</p><p>And every time some group, and a number of them did, Larry Summers, even John McCain, who really tried to get Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under control, they were just $1 trillion to $2 trillion in terms of total mortgages a decade ago and now they're somewhere around $5.5 trillion in terms of both mortgage paper that they own and mortgaged securities that they have guaranteed.</p><p>They now make up probably 75% of all of the mortgage financing in the country and maybe even more. And they had an absolutely lethal political operation. And one of those companies that operated, as we know, in the gray area between being implicitly private -- publicly supported in terms of their financing, but they had a lot of stock. It gets worse than that. They had roughly $65 of debt for every dollar of equity. At least that was in terms of the equity which they represented that they had.</p><p>Now it turns out that the total equity of the two company's numbers, say within the last six months, was about $81 billion, $83 billion. But when they were finally taken over and the government auditors went in, they found out that of this $81 billion or $83 billion, $64 billion of it were what they call tax assets. What are tax assets? These are tax loss carry-forwards that could have sheltered income.</p><p>Now no other American corporation keeps that on their balance sheets but they did. And it was 75% of their perceived net worth. This of course assumes that they would have had earnings, which they had not had for quite a number of quarters preceding the government review of it and their projection, needless to say, are for substantial losses. And by the way, they had other tax shelter or tax losses that they could have used.</p><p>In addition to that, they changed the time period during which a home was delinquent to sort of write down that mortgage. It used to be 90 days. If it was delinquent for 90 days in terms of home mortgage payments, they began to write down that mortgage. They changed that period from 90 days to two years. Furthermore, they had some securities which were -- absolutely should have been mark-to-market and were not.</p><p>Now why did they not do all of this? Of course they did it because they knew that if they did expose this it would indicate how far below even their own regulatory capital requirements were. So you are going to see, I believe, literally some criminal indictments coming out of all that.</p><p>But that was one of the major compressors of air in the housing bubble, because they put so much money into this subprime and Alt-A mortgages, which is where the crisis has occurred. Something like 46% of the subprime loans are in delinquency or in default and we have not hit the bottom of that.</p><p>Now in the financial world, of course you all I'm sure are as familiar with it as anybody, but this began to have a compounding effect on the financial world. Because the financial world in large part depends on confidence. Credit is a word that derives from the Latin crederi, which means to believe. And people stopped believing and progressively more and more people stopped believing in these financial assets held by any number of financial firms.</p><p>And it turns out of course that the financial firms, particularly the major investment banks, had just escalated their leverage. In the year 2004 the SEC changed the regulations in terms of leverage. It was basically capped out at 12-to-1, certain of the assets had discounts, 6% for the secured assets and 15% for the equity assets.</p><p>And many of the discounts on the assets were waived and they were allowed to more than double the ratio of leverage to debt to equity. And the next thing you knew, within a fairly short period of time, leverage went up to 30, 35-to-1. Lehman had a 30-to-1 debt to equity ratio, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>But the interesting thing about the debt to equity is that, for a lot of these investment banking firms and for many other firms, particularly in the shadow banking world which I'll get to in a moment, you had the opportunity to use short-term debt to make long-term investments. And then money was around in plentiful supply at very low rates for quite a period of time. And the irrational exuberance, a phrase which was used in a different context, really affected the shadow-banking world.</p><p>What was the shadow-banking world? Well back in the 1930s probably 90%-plus of all of the financing in this country was done through the conventional commercial banking world. Today it's less than 30%. But a shadow-banking world has emerged, hedge funds, investment banking firms, conduits, SIVs, money markets, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>And what happened was that this 70% plus was basically unregulated, particularly after what happened in 2004 when the SEC lifted the regulations. And then there was the loss of confidence in the viability of the balance sheets of these companies, as housing prices plummeted taking down the home mortgage values, which in turn took down the mortgage securities, which then affected the credit default swaps and the credit default swaps and the credit default swaps, you really had a situation of really compounding confusion and a lack of confidence in what the real net worth of these companies were and a gradual and then accelerating freeze up of the financial system.</p><p>In terms of the lack of understanding of what was happening within these financial institutions, I'm going to cite two things. One was this trader Societe Generale who managed to get involved in $74 billion of trade in a company whose net worth did not even exceed the $74 billion. It was supposed to be one of the most sophisticated banks in Europe and it was just a great scandal.</p><p>And when they finally found about it at the right level of management, they lost $7.2 billion. They decided to dissolve all those trades in a very short period of time, I presume, because they didn't like the way it would look if they still had their trades on. But this compounded the losses from an estimated $1.72 to $7.2 billion, a decision which I will never understand.</p><p>But be that as it may, that gave a lot of people a feeling of do we really know what's going on in these various financial institutions in terms of the sophistication of the trading and the sophistication of the instruments that were being traded, the futures and the straddles et cetera, et cetera. A lot of the senior management of these institutions would say, \"You know there are some rocket scientists in our shop who really understand it.\" But a lot of them didn't understand it.</p><p>And the other one I have to say was, when it was made public that Citigroup had $80 billion in an SIV, which was a part of the \"Shadow-banking\" system, was not on their books, they have a negative pledge. Basically they were borrowing short to invest long and making that spread, adding it to their earnings.</p><p>But it was a separate company, it was not on their books, because Citigroup itself had a negative pledge and they did not provide the financing. But they said if they couldn't get the financing then Citigroup would step in. Well they had to step in and then you began to have a compounding of the sense of a lack of confidence.</p><p>And what has happened now, particularly after, in my judgment, the Fed and the Treasury made a huge error in not helping Lehman Brothers continue, because that left, I just saw the statistics yesterday again, they had roughly $150 billion in unsecured paper out there. And $120 million of it apparently has now been a complete loss.</p><p>Some of it was held by, it was Fannie and Freddie paper, by some of these money market funds, I think it's called reserve, which was a $60-odd billion dollar money market fund. And the buck was broken. The dollar that people invested they were no longer able to get back. They still haven't been able to repay the people who determined to withdraw. They withdrew or wanted to withdraw $58 billion out of the $60-odd billion, $62 billion, $63 billion fund within a matter of a few days and they haven't been able to liquidate their positions.</p><p>And the reason why they were in this place is that they weren't investing in all these safe things, they were competing for money so they wanted to give a slightly higher yield. They took a little bit more risk and it blew up in their face. So we are in a situation now where the financial world is going through great upheaval.</p><p>Of the five major investment banks, three of them basically have disappeared. Lehman Brothers of course, Bear Stearns in a different way and Merrill Lynch within a forced marriage with the Banc of America. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became bank holding companies.</p><p>I believe that the principal reason for it was that they each had $100 billion or more in repos coming due within, on an average basis, I believe for Morgan Stanley around 40 to 50 days and for Goldman Sachs slightly longer. But the ability to roll over those funds was really in question and the Fed will be able to help them liquidate some of their paper and make sure that they didn't get into a liquidity crunch, because those banks to a greater or lesser degree are still fairly solid.</p><p>So there we are in this extraordinary double bubble of financial crunch and housing crunch and we are not at the bottom. And nobody knows where the bottom is. I have to say that what happened and what is happening now is there is still a credit crunch. The Fed's come up with this program of $700 billion.</p><p>I don't exactly know and I've never heard anybody justify where the number of $700 billion came from. The idea of course is that they're going to buy these toxic securities from a lot of the financial firms, create some kind of a market in it and that will presumably improve the financial condition of these major financial institutions and diminish the risk that within a matter of 48 hours or 72 hours one of them could fall through the trap door.</p><p>What I don't believe it will do will be to dramatically affect what is currently clearly a credit squeeze. You know in the mortgage world there has been such a dramatic change in the confidence of lenders that they're doing the following. They're reducing the loan-to-value ratio significantly. They're insisting that the borrowers actually have a serious credit score and that they verify and validate the income and the net worth that they assert.</p><p>You will know that something like 46%, according to Credit Suisse, of all the subprime and Alt-A loans were no-docs or low-docs loans, that is no documents or low documentation. And they did a survey of these people and it turned out that virtually all of them acknowledged that they had lied about their net worth or their income or both. But the number that really stupefied me was that 60% said they exaggerated their income by 50% or more.</p><p>And now you find out of course that these people cannot afford to carry these homes. What everybody was banking on was housing prices going up, which they were at a dramatic rate. Everybody thought, \"Gees, why don't I buy a home, my buddy down the street, Joe Jerk, bought three units and in a matter of 18 months he made 40% on his money. I'm a hell of a lot smarter than Joe Jerk, so I'll buy three units or two units or what have you.\"</p><p>It turned out that 25% of the homes that were bought were bought on spec. Now only 4% declared that they were buying them for investment purposes. And the reason for that, if you declared that you were going to be an occupant of the home, you got a higher mortgage and a lower rate. And this has all now turned out to be more or less fictional and everybody is now trying to unravel all of the excessive confidence and exuberance about where home values were going.</p><p>The same thing though I believe is true in the financial world, the conventional financial world, the banks and the other institutions that generally provide finance for business. I think that the terms for lending are going to change dramatically. Whatever happens in the housing world, the very transformation of the terms that are being proposed is going to dramatically shrink the housing market. And whatever happens in the business world, the terms that are now going to be proposed are going to shrink the availability of finance to the business world through to the conventional banking or financial system.</p><p>Now again, nobody knows what the consequences of that may be, but it isn't going to be good. I think we're going to be in a fairly lengthy period of a declining economy. A very good economist at Harvard, Ken Rogoff, studied 18 recessions in the industrialized world, the Western style economies. There were six of them where the recession started in their version of Wall Street, in the financial world, moved into their version of Main Street and then had the dreaded adverse feedback loop back into the financial world.</p><p>Those recessions were deeper and lasted longer. On average I might add, they lasted three years. We had that same kind of experience in this country. We had what started in the financial world with the bursting of the bubble in housing that affected the bubble in the financing world, is going to move into the real economy to a greater degree by far, I think, than what we have experienced to date.</p><p>And then you will have that, again, adverse feedback loop back into the financial world, given everything that's going to go on. It's going to affect consumer card -- credit card paper, it's going to affect auto loans obviously, auto loans are plunging. It's going to affect many other different kinds of financing and nobody knows what this mix is going to produce.</p><p>And the $700 billion \"bailout,\" rescue plan, whatever you want to call it, if it passes today because it's going to be voted on today, will in my judgment not dramatically reduce the credit squeeze, it will somewhat, but it will at least give people in the world of finance, and particularly amongst counterparties et cetera, et cetera, that the bottom will not fall out of a major firm in a matter of 48 hours. The trap door will not open up and some firm will disappear.</p><p>We are also seeing, by the way, the same thing now extending into the financial system in Europe where in many of the countries now the central banks are trying to make sure that their financial institutions don't disappear. And they're taking all sorts of steps. But it does mean too that international trade is going to go down.</p><p>Now this is not, and I want to make this clear, it's not going to be anything like the Great Depression of the 1930s. Why? In 1929 the Federal Government made up 3% of GDP, today it makes up 21% of GDP. In 1929 the relationship of the two major virtually decoupled and stable industries in this country, namely education and health, were about one tenth what they are today.</p><p>They're well over 20% today, nobody knows the exact numbers, and they were much, much less then and not really basically a ward of the Federal and State government. And international trade is a much healthier part of the economy today than it was way back then when trade virtually collapsed.</p><p>As for monetary policy, the money supply back in the last 1920s early 1930s was by law a function of the amount of gold that we had in our vault. And a lot of European countries had, for various reasons, in agreements the ability to exchange their currency for the gold, which they did. The gold supply went down and the money supply had to shrink. This was not the time to shrink the money supply.</p><p>And finally of course, the understanding of macroeconomics emerged in the 1930s, which is when Keynes did his major work. And Keynes once famously said, \"You know, in the long run we'll all be dead.\" Wrong. I've always disagreed with him. In the long run we'll all survive and flourish, in the short run we can be dead. And this is, I think, a part of the problem that we're now trying to deal with, which is how we comfortably get through where we are today.</p><p>So I don't think it's going to be anything like the Great Depression, but it's going to be a tough period. I think it's going to be the worst recession and the longest recession we've had since the end of World War II. Now I hope this doesn't sound immodest, but I think that in fairness to you I'm going to give you as good a description of what Boston Properties did under these circumstances.</p><p>I must say to you that, even when we took on some of the policies and executed them that I'm about to describe, we did not fully foresee what in fact we've now been through. In fact, I don't know of anybody who foresaw that we would have a credit squeeze and a credit freeze that I think a week ago Wednesday caused Goldman Sachs to have to pay 20% for overnight money on that Wednesday night. And Citigroup in Europe was paying 25% and everybody else was in that range.</p><p>But we, frankly, looked at value and we thought that a number of the values in the commercial real estate market, we didn't know if they were at the top. In fact when we started to sell some of these assets, one of my colleagues said, \"Why are we selling, prices are still going up.\"</p><p>And I said, \"Well yes if the prices weren't going up we wouldn't be able to sell.\" But at these prices we were sellers. And we sold about $4.3 billion worth of real estate at prices that we could not get today because the financing is unavailable. And because of the perception of values is unavailable we were able to sell some properties at a cap rate of under 4% and none of them went much above 4.5%. And we raised an awful lot of money and we did some refinancing and we're in extraordinary financial shape.</p><p>And we decided, frankly, even after all of that, that we would try and access the credit markets when the money was available, not when we needed it. And so about five or six weeks ago, I think, we raised $740-odd million in the market, it was a convertible issue. That's no longer available because of the elimination of short selling. And we did it I think at a 5 3/8% rate, which looks absolutely miraculous today.</p><p>But it put us into extraordinary financial condition to do things. One of the things that we were able to do was to buy some buildings that were available, including what we believed to be two of the best buildings in New York, namely the General Motors Building and 540 Madison Avenue, which are two of the most highly regarded buildings in New York for the best kinds of office tenants, at a price which was 20% to 25% below what it had been the previous year.</p><p>So we made these purchases because we thought they were extremely good values in terms of a price per pound. That is, we could not have replicated those buildings if we had been able to get those sites, and we were not able to get sites like that because Manhattan is truly a supply-constrained market.</p><p>There are literally only two new buildings coming on stream in the next four years in Midtown New York and they're on the west side of New York, not on the east side of New York. Virtually nothing is available on the east side of New York in terms of new construction. There's a lot of space downtown, much of which I believe will never even get out of the ground for a number of years, but in Midtown New York there's virtually nothing.</p><p>So we thought we had the opportunity to buy these buildings at an extremely attractive price, which is what we stated after we bought it. We bought two other buildings which were just a shade below the two buildings that I just mentioned, but they were all in very good shape. We had virtually no space rolling over for two to three years in any of these buildings.</p><p>And a lot of the buildings, particularly the General Motors Building, had average rents that were dramatically below the market. So we thought every time these leases rolled over, we sold the building at a 3.76% cap rate, that wasn't as good as the General Motors Building, and we bought the General Motors Building at a 5% cap rate.</p><p>And in the General Motors Building not only were we way under the cost to duplicate that building, those sites simply aren't available, but both the retail space and the office space was dramatically below the market, probably 50% at that point of where the market was. So every time the space rolled over we only had 15% rolling over, so the first three or four years we thought we could pick up some appreciation. And in terms of leasing that, that is being borne out.</p><p>So we ended up in this place where we really are not dependent on any financing, not even for construction financing, if we choose not pursue it. We undoubtedly will to the extent that it is available, because we want to have some dry powder since we think there will be opportunities that will come up over the next couple years and we'd like to be positioned to take advantage of that.</p><p>But having said that, there is no doubt but that we are looking at a much more difficult period going forward than we have seen in the past. Now we have tried to anticipate this and have really throughout the entire career of Boston Properties, which now to my amazement goes back almost 40 years when Ed Linde and I started the company.</p><p>And what our sort of basic philosophy was, which is really quite simple and for us really quite obvious and you will hear a lot more about this here, is we try to stay, a, and most importantly, in supply-constrained markets. One of the guys on our Board was a guy by the name of Bill Daley. Bill Daley was a Secretary of Commerce, head of the Democratic party and now a major player in JPMorgan Chase. He took Jamie Dimon's position in the bank in Chicago and needless to say is also a brother of the Mayor of Chicago.</p><p>And the Mayor of Chicago, whom I happen to know just slightly, would call me, \"My brother thinks your company is really a great company, why don't you come and develop in Chicago?\" Now it's not easy to figure out a way to deflect that, but I found the perfect response I have to say. I said, \"You know Mayor, I said, the reason why we can't go to Chicago is that it's too well managed.\"</p><p>He said, \"What do you mean by that?\" I said, \"Because when you get an increase in demand, you get an increase in supply. We like to be in markets where you can't get an increase in supply and therefore you get an increase in rent. So that if we are building a building in a market, we want to know over time that we're going to do better in terms of the increase in the rents than the rate of increase in the consumer price index.\" And that sort of placated him.</p><p>But that in fact does really convey our view. And in that markets that we are in, Boston which has an absolutely insane approval process, Cambridge which has very little land, virtually no land to develop. We've been involved in Cambridge Center since 1980. It took us almost 20 years to complete that whole development, we won that in a competition way back then.</p><p>And we have tried to build the best buildings in the best suburban markets in the Cambridge and Boston area where we own Prudential Center and where in [the back] day virtually there's very, very little ability to add space to that market, which is where the -- that market in Boston is shifting to a degree to that. Not that it's all moving there, but that's going to be sort of the Midtown of Boston.</p><p>And we're in San Francisco and Washington. And the Washington area is constrained not only because of the lack of sites but because of the fact that there is height limit. And so you have to get a site where you can get enough size and fortunately we have the most talented real estate person in the Washington market, Ray Ritchey, who has been with Boston Properties I think 29 years now and is an absolutely wonderful man.</p><p>I happen to have met the Mayor of Washington just yesterday. We were not talking about real estate, we were talking about the educational system in New York City, I'm going to be the Vice Chairman of the Fund for Public Schools and he wanted to talk about that. I mentioned that we do a little bit of work in Washington in real estate and he said, \"Well I've never met you,\" which he had not.</p><p>And I said, \"Well you may have met my colleague, Ray Ritchey.\" Ray Ritchey, my goodness. He was so complimentary about Ray, so I know and have known for a long time that we are fortunate to have the best man in the Washington market running all of our operations there. And we tried to really in a sense establish really good independent operations in each of our markets. And by and large I think it's worked out fairly well.</p><p>Anyways, somebody once described where we are today in the following way. This man was driving a car in Paris and he was going around the Arc de Triomphe, he had a tremendously important market -- meeting, rather, that he had to go to and he couldn't find a place to leave his car. And he said, \"God, I'll do whatever you want. If you can just find me a parking space now, I will do whatever you want.\" And he was going around and a car pulls out and he's got the perfect parking. He pulls in and he says, \"God, he says, don't worry, I don't need you any more.\"</p><p>You see the guy didn't understand the business model. So where we are today is where everybody's going to have to look at their business models and see what works. And it's going to change. We think we are uniquely positioned amongst our confreres in the REIT world to adjust to the new markets.</p><p>We by and large had always a very, very conservatively financed company. We are even more conservatively financed today than we ever have been. We are, we believe, in the right markets which are supply-constrained buildings at the top of those markets, or buying to the top of the markets. The best properties we believe had always done better in good times and really done relatively much better in what we euphemistically called challenging times.</p><p>So that's sort of been the, at least as we see it, the environment in which we are working and how we have prepared for our self and how we are positioned to go forward. We have a development right next door here in Russia Wharf, which is 82% pre-leased. We have another development in New York which is also going to be substantially pre-leased. We've already signed one of the tenants, we're close to another. And wherever we are developing we are, as I said, the buildings are at the top end of the market and there are always good tenants for those kinds of buildings.</p><p>So this is roughly what I have been privileged to talk to you about. And I have to say that I've had an absolutely spectacular time working in the real estate world and working in Boston Properties and working with my colleagues for now 40 years and I look forward to another 40 years. Thank you all very, very much. I'd be happy to answer questions. Nobody has to ask the first question, but if anybody wants to ask a second question? Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN: Well I don't think we're going to have a real inflation for at least a short period of time. We are clearly going to flood the economy with money through deficit. Next year our deficit is going to go somewhere above $1 trillion, if you in any way account properly for the $700 billion, which I'm just assuming for the sake of conversation this is going to occur today, in the shorter run, and the shorter run is going to be two, three, for years.</p><p>But after that I think we're going to have major inflationary pressures, simply because we're going to be flooding our economy with money. And ultimately that's not the only reason why we have inflation, but that is going to produce inflation in this country.</p><p>What is interesting is the relative strength of the dollar. That I think is raises a very interesting phenomenon because you would think, with the kind of deficits that we are running, that it might weaken the dollar. Yet still, if you look at what's happening in Europe where they don't have a central economy or they have a group of diverse economies, people still I think look to the United States, even under these circumstances, as a better place for money.</p><p>And if you look and see how we are doing relative say to China and to Russia, Russia's stock market crashed to about 60%, 65%, it's still down over 51% in the last matter of six months. And they don't even know what they're doing, they're flooding their system with money, all this oil money that has come in. Now they had a $500 billion bank roll at that point, I'll bet you 80% of that is gone just trying to sustain their economic system and their financial growth.</p><p>China has also had a tremendous crash in their market. So I think a lot of people recognize in a sense the resilience and diversification and strength of the American economy. And in this sense I think we're going to do better, because the one thing that you have to worry about is a run on the dollar. And that I don't think is going to happen and I think we again see the implicit strength of the American economy.</p><p>Still, I think in the short run I cannot imagine that we are going to see -- with a weakening economy, the main driver of inflation is salaries and wages, that is not going to happen in any serious way at all. So I just don't see that we're going to have inflation in the next couple years, other than very modest inflation.</p><p>But I think longer term we're going to build the environment for an inflationary up tick and I think within five years we're going to be worried much more about inflation than anything else. Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: You've painted a pretty dour view of the economy. I was just wondering if you can think about a bull case and what probability you would put to that. And is there any way that we're not going to see a severe recession and a deep long recession the way you've painted it?</p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN: You know I have to say that I think, as we say and there is a phrase in the Middle East, it is written, I do not believe there's any way that we can stop the decline in housing prices. Housing prices are still 60% above where they were at the end of that year 2000, even after this decline. And this I might say is just unsustainable, especially today. So I don't think that there is any way of avoiding a continued drop in housing, [then] it's going to have all of its obvious consequences.</p><p>And I would also say I don't think that, even if we pass this $700 billion bill, that we are going to immediately revive the level of confidence that has to exist in the financial world. I think that whether it's mortgage lending or commercial lending, whoever is a lender today is going to be a lot more cautious. Confidence, once it breaks, does not rebuild itself and remake itself within a matter of days, weeks or months. It's just going to take enough time for people to come back and develop some greater degree of confidence in the future.</p><p>That is why I just do not see our way out of it. I don't think, as I said, we're going to have anything close to a depression, I don't think anybody knows how serious this can be. It is a rather pessimistic view of the economy. In fact, I distinguish between an optimist and a pessimist today by saying that an optimist feels this is the best of all possible worlds and a pessimist fears he may be right. Go ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mort, you mentioned obviously the acquisitions you've done and buying at discounts to theoretically what they would have traded a year ago. Can you just speculate on what you think the downside potential for commercial real estate values, specifically CBD Office might be? And as well, you've also talked on conference calls about increasing leverage for opportunistic transactions, but do you see that probably as something you might pull back on as well in this environment?</p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN: Well look, I do think that there is a general - an increasing degree of pessimism about the market for commercial real estate. People think that companies are simply cutting back on their employment, particularly in the financial industry. The financial industry in 1980 had about 10% of corporate profits in America, last year it was close to 40%. A lot of employment went up correspondingly, a lot of that's going to shrink. And people think this is going to affect the demand for office space and I would agree.</p><p>But again, you have to differentiate and distinguish, just as if you're in New York City, I can tell you Manhattan is not just a part of the New York economy. Manhattan is a part of the global economy, 60-odd percent of the sales at Apple are to foreigners. Apple is this wonderful amazing store in the General Motors Building where their sales are continuing to go up very dramatically. It's just an astounding retail performance and it's become a destination point on the basis of just that store.</p><p>But it does speak to the fact that particularly the highest quality residential areas in New York, areas along Park Avenue, Fifth Avenue, Central Park West, Central Park South, all those with views are still doing very well. And frankly, it's also true of the office space. The best office buildings are still doing well.</p><p>Now do I think this will continue? By and large yes because, as I was trying to say before with that story, you know people and companies' fortunes may have gone down, but they still never believe that would still be doing as well as they are doing. So there are still going to be those companies that are growing.</p><p>We see it now. We're had a tenant, a law firm that unraveled in one of our buildings, 120,000 square feet. The rent was $65 a foot and because we did the lease 10 years ago and it was a 20-year lease and the rent today is going to be -- the building space is all built up, we have a security deposit for here and we're going to be able to sublease that space, or re-lease that space.</p><p>We have a situation in the -- actually the New York Times got this story absolutely wrong, surprise, surprise. I believe, I haven't seen the paper today, they said they'd put in a correction. But they described a lease that we were about to do and we are involved still in those negotiations for 300,000 square feet in Citigroup Center. And they said the tenant had to agreed to stay where they were and they were extending the five-year lease.</p><p>I wasn't even in New York at the time, I was in Boston, I get a frantic call from their senior partner who said it's not true, it's 100% false. Besides, it wasn't our space it was sublease space. But setting that aside, there are tenants around and there are tenants who are growing.</p><p>And this is again one of the advantages of being in the prime buildings because a lot of these tenants want to be in the prime buildings. They want to be on the east side of New York rather than on the west side of New York. And I don't mean to diminish the west side, I'm just saying it's a different quality of real estate.</p><p>I will tell you that the EOP deal that Blackstone went ahead with actually started because I called the Blackstone people. Ed and I have been talking about this for a while and we've been watching EOP. And I said, \"You know this is a deal we ought to do together.\"</p><p>Well Blackstone being Blackstone, they studied it and they said, \"Yes it's a very good deal, we'd like to do it by our self, but we'd like you to buy the New York real estate.\" And they offered it to us under those terms, I think it was about a 4.3 or 4.25 cap rate. And while we liked the New York assets, they were not the kind of assets that we would normally buy. For us it was a play to buy the company. We turned it down, we said \"no thank you.\" And [Harry Mackwell] bought it at a 3.1% cap rate.</p><p>Now it just knocked me over there was that kind of bubble. But what has happened, it is really the prime real estate that has continued to do relatively well. So do I think it's going to be as easy to lease space with the same kind of rate of appreciation? No, I don't.</p><p>But a lot of our buildings, we have the longest average lease term, I think it's about seven years and nine months, or six months, deliberately, because we are perfectly happy to predict what we think is going to be the market in two or three years, which is the nature of the development business. But if you're looking out 10 years, it's much difficult to predict, we'd rather have the longer-term leases.</p><p>And we are substantially full. I think we had a 99.52% occupancy rate the last time I looked at it. It may be slightly lower now. But I do think that we are -- it's going to be a tougher market environment for sure. Companies are going to be more conscious of the rents they are paying. But still I think we're in the right place, the right markets and the right buildings. And those will still, I think, do relatively well. There was a question back there, did I miss somebody?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: To the extent you're comfortable and maybe after the rest of questions on the economy, can you provide some thoughts on the upcoming election and also the Middle East?</p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN: Well if the election had been held two weeks ago I believe John McCain would have won. The incredible credit freeze and the attempt on the part of the Administration to scare the American people into proving their particular version of bailing out the world of finance by saying, \"Oh it's going to affect your credit at the -- you know the President yesterday had 20 small business men in, well they couldn't get their financing for their inventory or they couldn't get financing for their expansion or they couldn't get,\" --</p><p>The news that is emanating is that we are in a very, very serious economic time and it is affecting the entire attitude of the American public. It was always going to be the most important issue, the number one issue, but it is even more intensely shared and widely shared and widely believed to be by far the number one issue. Nobody's talking about Iraq, nobody's talking about very much else other than what's going on in the Congress and with this program.</p><p>And if you listen to them, the President goes there, I must say one of the worst speeches I've heard him give and, believe me, that's a real standard to break. But he spoke with complete lack of affect but he also said, you know we are on a verge of a tremendous possible decline. We must do something about it, it's going to affect everybody. And they want to get popular support.</p><p>There's huge popular antagonism to this bill. Huge. It is overwhelming. The calls that came into Washington are 300 to one against it because it was presented as a bailout. And it's a bailout of whom? It's presented as a bailout of the world of finance. Wall Street is the euphemism for the world of finance.</p><p>And the country sees and has seen Wall Street be so prosperous and do so well with getting salaries that were almost unimaginable, and bonuses. The bonuses for Wall Street community in the year 2006 were a mere $62 billion, that's [with the bonuses]. So when you have this as a political back drop, it's a real issue to say to somebody who has to sell his home, you have to sell it at market. But then he finds out that the government's going to buy in the Wall Street toxic paper at something above \"market.\"</p><p>And that's what's going to happen because it's the only way to bail out the financial system. It may not be my preferred way of doing this in providing liquidity to the financial system, but it's the one we're going to have to live with. And we have to do something rather than nothing and I think therefore, at this point, we'll get through.</p><p>Although what the Senate did to this bill I have to tell you was just a disgrace. They added on I don't know how many, I think for raw manufacturers I think they got $190 million tax break. And there was another one I saw this morning that was just astounding.</p><p>So I do think that there is nothing that's going to happen between now and election day that is going to take this off the front pages. And therefore, on that issue, the country is going to say throw the bums out. You blame the party in power. And whatever you want to say about how much John McCain separated himself from the Bush Administration, which was quite considerably, it was very critical of it but that's irrelevant.</p><p>And even though Sarah Palin I think did extremely well last night in at least holding her own against Joe Biden, so all these concerns about her will be disappearing as they inevitably do for the Vice President in a national campaign. Unless something happens in those two debates that we can't foresee, or unless there is some major international event that will change what the subject is, I just don't see Obama losing. I think he will win and he may win fairly big. Five points or six points would be a very big victory for him.</p><p>Now as far as the Middle East is concerned, the Middle East is a very, very tough place to anticipate anything getting done. And if anything, conditions have gotten worse. But I will say this. Without going into it in any great detail since I happen to be personally involved in it, there is a great fear in the Middle East among the Sunni Arab countries, of Iran, they are obsessed with Iran. They put great pressure on the United States, on its President when he went there, on its Secretary of State when he went there, to do something about Iran.</p><p>Now in that sense there is a recognition that the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians is a side show. So that may create the environment in which progress will be made in that area. Certainly there is, legitimately, a sense that we have transformed the conditions on the ground in military terms, in security terms and today even in political terms in Iraq.</p><p>And that I think, if we stay in there for a long enough period of time, and it's not going to be 16 months, that would be a disaster in my judgment since we would throw away what we need, I will tell you something which I'm going to use in an editorial next week off the record.</p><p>When Obama was in Iraq on this tour [De'l Resond], that he made, every Sunni tribal leader signed a petition and said, please do not leave in the time period that you have espoused, because we need more time in order to make sure that we and the Shia community, because the Shia dominate the government, can find a way to work together. And if you do that, all the relationships that we are now trying to build will break down and we'll be back into a sectarian war.</p><p>Now it doesn't mean he's changing his position, as you heard Joe Biden say, because once these politicians take a stand they feel they cannot reverse themselves without being accused of being weak and flip flopping. That's the thing that worries me about a political campaign, that things are stated that are not necessarily in our national interest, but they are in the political interest of this or that candidate.</p><p>So that is the most worrisome thing. I don't think that there will be any kind of military attack on Iran, that I don't believe will happen. And they just had another resolution without any additional sanctions that was passed in the United Nations, so it's meaningless. But there would be intensive efforts on the part of at least the Western countries to intensify the effect of sanctions on Iran. And they will be joined by a lot of partners who will not be visible on the scenes because of the concerns that they all have about Iran.</p><p>So in one sense, there will be I think a very different balance in the whole area of the Middle East, including Afghanistan, all the way from Afghanistan to the Mediterranean than we've had before. And it will work in the favor of the United States. One last question I think. Yes, over here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Can you talk a little bit about your view on short-term and long-term interest rates from here and how that affects commercial real estate valuations?</p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN: Well firstly short-term funds of any significant size is virtually unavailable today. So anybody with cash is going to have an opportunity to do very well in terms of the purchase of real estate if they can finance it. You can't put together, even with the building where you have the building 85% pre-leased, you can't put together easily a $500 million construction loan or a $700 million construction loan, which we could have done a year ago with one telephone call.</p><p>So that is going to be a serious impediment to new construction, new development and to purchases. The financing of real estate is going to change dramatically, there's going to be a lot more in the way of equity financing that is going to be necessary.</p><p>And in that sense, the buyers will have the advantage of the market going forward. Which means in one sense purchase prices for buildings will go down. They're already gone down, as I said, 20%, 25%. They may go down another 10% or 15%. This is true, as I say of more conventional, real -- that is more commodity space, the highest level buildings have always sold at a premium and they're virtually unavailable.</p><p>Now longer term, of course, you have another issue because the -- not, two things will happen. One is the interest rates will go up for longer term financing maybe by 150 basis points. The ratio of the debt to the total purchase price will go down. Equity yields will be seen to have to go up.</p><p>And therefore on one level for a while, I think Cap rates will go up, not down. And I cannot tell you by how much, because literally nobody knows how serious this is. One of the things that is a counter veiling aspect here is that if the economy gets to be really weak, the Feds are going to do whatever they can to change the whole interest rate environment. And there may be some opportunities that come out of that.</p><p>I do believe in the short run that's going to be the case, but the private market is still very, very, very cautious. I think that's going to take a long time to rebuild the kind of confidence that is going to be necessary to do anything close to the financing that we've have been -- I don't think the financing we've had for the last several years is going to be available.</p><p>But even in more conventional times that financing is still going to be held back except for very, very limited number of situations and borrowers. I would like to think that we would be in the latter category, but that is all under the heading of TK, or to come. I think I'm probably taking too much of your time this morning, but I thank you all very much for the chance to speak with you.</p><p>DOUG LINDE, PRESIDENT, BOSTON PROPERTIES: We're going to quickly jump into our next presentation which is, you get to hear me for a little while. And three of my colleagues here, Bryan Koop, Bob Pester, and Robert Selsam, and we're going to attempt to put a little bit more flesh around some of the bones that Mort described.</p><p>And my goal when you leave here today is for you to at least gain a little bit more of an appreciation for what Boston Properties looks like from an asset perspective, from a value creation perspective and how, I hope, you will be able to differentiate, and the market will be able to differentiate the cash flows and the opportunities, and the assets and the types of activities that Boston Properties acts in each and every day to increase shareholder value.</p><p>The predicament that we are looking at today is probably one that has been seen for many, many generations. And I am described by my father as a child of the depression, because I am a nervous nelly. And I worry a lot about lots of different things. I tend to worry more than most of the people that surround me. But I think my nervousness to some degree permeates our organization. But I think that's a good thing.</p><p>And there was saying that was told me by a gentleman named Bill McCall who's sort of the elder statesman of the Boston real estate market. When I moved back to Boston from Seattle back in 1993 after the last really bad cycle, and he used to describe it as follows, he said, \"Those whom the gods fail always first felt infallible.\"</p><p>And I can tell you and can assure you that we at Boston Properties do not feel infallible. We are concerned with what's going on. We think about what we are doing on a day-to-day basis. And we try in every molecule of our mind to put ourselves in a position that we can take advantage of and protect ourselves in situations such as we're in today.</p><p>We have had a pretty boring, consistent, straightforward strategy for years and years and years. And that strategy has been as Mort described, we are in the top core tile, top 10 percent, top one percent of the types of assets that are owned in the commercial real estate office sector.</p><p>We have what, you'll the word, and you'll see the pictures that demonstrate it later, iconic office properties. I think it's ultimately the descriptive word that you should take away from today in terms of the types of buildings that we own, the types of buildings we purchase, and the types of buildings that we are going to develop.</p><p>We believe in value creation. And value creation comes in lots of different ways, shapes and forms, but primarily it comes in looking for opportunities either in lease structure, in land, and environment and trying to change something about those typical opportunities over a period of time, to increase cash flow.</p><p>We have a group of management partners, friends, associates, who really think about our business in a very micro form. Not a macro form. You listen to Mort and you sort of hear him, heard him describe a few of the transactions that we're working on in New York City. I can tell you that Ray and Bob, and Mike, and Bryan, and the rest of us all think about the concerns and the opportunities and the risks that we encounter on a day-to-day basis, as well as the acquisitions and the development.</p><p>Today we worry about leasing. I worry about the leasing that we have going on today, the leasing that we have going in 2009, and the leasing that we have going in 2011. And by the way, we can all tell you about each one of those various pieces of the space, and each one of those buildings that we're concerned with and the ones where we think we have opportunity, and the ones where we have some risk.</p><p>But it's that type of a focus approach that brings from our management team the kind of value and the kind of thinking, and the kind of critical decision-making that we think really puts us in a position to make decisions and to act in an environment like today in a very constructive manner.</p><p>We have this regional focus which means we can understand because of the types of markets we're in the kinds of opportunities and the kinds of issues that we have in a very micro basis. We're not in 12 different markets. We're not in 14 different submarkets in 12 different markets. We're basically in four markets plus Princeton.</p><p>And our activities and thoughts are about those markets. We're not spending our time worrying about, geese are there opportunities in India? Are there opportunities in London? Are there opportunities in Southeast Asia? We're worried about the 500,000 square feet of space that's rolling over in 2009 in Reston, Virginia that leased to the National Geotechnical Agency and whether or not they're going to renew tomorrow.</p><p>That's the kind of things that your management team, that you shareholders are looking to us to deliver and those are the kinds of things that we're working on a day-to-day basis. I sort of put this tongue-in-cheek slide up there about new markets. We get asked the question each and every time we have a conference call where we sit in, in every presentation so, where are you looking to expand, where are you going to go next?</p><p>As Mort described there are certain markets that we really, really like for specific reasons primarily because of the supply constraints and there is enough opportunity in the markets that we're in that we feel very comfortable and confident saying for now we're going stick to our knitting and we're going to stay where we are.</p><p>We believe in creating shareholder value. And shareholder value is something that we think about every single day. It's the portfolio, it's the leasing strategy, it's the capital strategy and it all comes together to put us in a position where we can feel comfortable with the cash flows that we are providing on a day-to-day basis each and every day.</p><p>First, it's about occupancy, and it's -- but occupancy doesn't just come from doing lots of leasing. It comes from the types of buildings that we lease. We have long term leases as Mort described. Our average lease length is over seven years. We have Class A office buildings. And we have strong tenants.</p><p>In good markets, as Mort described, we do very well. In bad markets on a relative basis, we do better. But it's really the tenants and the types of tenants that look to our buildings that is the backbone of that income stream.</p><p>Clearly we are a company that has an awful lot of exposure to financial services in the form of the financial services companies themselves, as well as the law firms, and the advisors, and the accountants that sort of make up the financial services economy.</p><p>If you look at that law firm piece of the pie, we have about 200 different law firms in our Portfolio, 53% of them are in their top -- the American Law Review's top 50 firms from a revenue perspective, 83% of them are in the top 200.</p><p>So it's a very diverse portfolio. The largest one is about $30 million. As Mort described we are no immune to the issues associated with what's going on today, and we've had a law firm dissolving. The law firm is Heller Ehrman. They lease 130,000 square feet. The space is in 7 Times Square or Times Square Tower. And as Mort described they're paying $64 a square foot. We actually think there's an opportunity there.</p><p>We happen to have an LC and we think we're going to be in a position where we're going to be able to lease that space at a rent well in excess of $64 a square foot, basically on an as-is basis because the space is very well configured. And in all likelihood that law firm's going to leave its furniture, its fixtures, its computers, its telephones, and just sort of walk away. And we have a, actually a valuable asset.</p><p>If you look at the financial services side, the two largest tenants are Lehman Brothers and we all know that Lehman Brothers is having its issues right now. And as we put out a press release, Lehman Brothers is a tenant in about 450,000 square feet of space at 399 Park Avenue.</p><p>We can't tell you whether Lehman Brothers is going to accept or reject that lease. We can tell you that the entities that are in there are PIM, their Private Investment Management Group, as well as some of the Neuberger and Berman entities. And it appears that 399 is part of their plan going forward, but we don't know yet.</p><p>The largest tenant in that financial services entity is Citigroup. They have about $63 million of revenue. Lehman Brothers was the second largest at $43 million. I think the next largest tenant is less than $15 million. So it really jumps down. And there are about 100 tenants in that financial services pot of that portfolio right there.</p><p>So we really do feel good about absorbing the oops and the issues associated with what is going to happen in New York City and potentially happens in other markets. As Mort described, we sort of move from the financial situation into \"the real economy,\" and we struggle from an economic perspective over the next few years.</p><p>Finally, what we drive for is shareholder return. And over the past few years we think we've demonstrated day-in and day-out that Boston Properties' strategy of being in the highest quality buildings, having long term leases, having well financed and a highly liquid balance sheet, and having the kinds of markets where when things go well you have some dramatic opportunities for appreciation, has put us in good stead. And as you can see, we've done relatively well, relatively speaking.</p><p>It's also about growth. Or not necessarily growing as at a rapid rate as you might like during a tough time. But being able to sustain and maintain your income stream to support debt service, to maintain your balance sheet, to keep your capital appetite available. And since we've been a public company we've had a pretty consistent average rate of growth in our funds from operation.</p><p>Now, I am the first to admit that funds from operation is probably, as we move forward, not the most important metric for a real estate investment trust, particularly for Boston Properties, to be looking at. As Mike will talk later, we have the FASB 141 issue, we have this APB 14-a, and it's all going to start to skew our FFO.</p><p>But by-and-large, if you look at that period between 2002 and 2005, which is when we were coming out of the last major downturn in the real estate markets, we had a pretty consistent funds from operation. We didn't grow, but we didn't shrink.</p><p>And we expect, as we look forward between 2009 and 2010, and 2011, we're going to see some growth. It may not be the kind of growth that we saw between 2006 and 2008, but we're going to see growth and we're going to be able to maintain the same relative position that we have today.</p><p>The locations that we choose are pretty important. And we think hard about the kinds of places we want to be in. As I said before, it's about iconic buildings. It's about architecture, it's about design, it's about a long term perspective on our real estate.</p><p>And as I move through these slides, these are pictures of our buildings and while they all are very attractive and they demonstrate a little bit of a differentiation between the kinds of buildings that we own and that we operate, and that we manage, and maybe what you perceive as sort of the market. When Bryan, and Bob, and Robert speak in a few minutes what they're going to do is they're going to explain to you what we do and what opportunities we have with these kinds of assets to generate enhanced return, enhanced cash flow, and enhanced value on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>It's not just the fact that they are, \"iconic,\" or \"trophy,\" it's what those kinds of buildings and what the tenants want, and what the tenants will allow us to provide to them, give us as an opportunity to create shareholder value, that this is all about.</p><p>It's also about where these buildings are. We've always said that real estate is a very local business. It's a business about street corner. It's a business about the north side or the south side, depending upon where the sun is coming through. All of those things really matter. And our buildings, as you can see from these maps are clustered in specific areas in specific cities. And they're not just buildings on a map.</p><p>Here's our Boston assets, look at those clusters. We're in two basic areas. We control the environment and the markets in Cambridge Center, and we control the environment in the Back Bay in the Prudential Center marketplace.</p><p>Out in the suburbs, we're in Waltham and we slew, move a little bit further bit further north into Lexington, but you don't see us out on the Route 495 corridor, you don't see us out in the Route 3 corridor. We are primarily in very specific locations for very specific reasons. And it's largely based upon what we understand about the demographics of those markets, the importance of transportation, the critical nature of amenities, and what we can develop and translate into value.</p><p>In San Francisco, it's all above being north of market and it's about Embarcadero Center. In Washington, DC it's about where you locate in the East End and where you locate in the CBD. If you're in Northern Virginia, you're in Reston. You're not on the Dulles Road, you're in commodity office buildings, you in a very specific area.</p><p>And what is it about these areas? What is it about these buildings? You're going to listen to our regional folks talk in a few minutes. You're going to hear about the 24-hour location, the critical nature of driving tenants to want to retain their employees. We're in the business of serving customers. Our customers are tenants. And their goal in life is not just to own real estate so that they can operate their business. Their goal is to retain and demand the best employees. And how do we put them in the best position to do that?</p><p>It's putting them in 24-hour locations. It's giving them the best architecture. It's giving them the most flexibility in terms of what they can and can't do with their space. And it's providing them with an environment where they can grow.</p><p>We believe in the long term. We invest, we invest, we invest. And even in a down time we believe in putting capital into our assets so that we can put ourselves in a position to maintain long term value. That is what this company is all about. It's long term value.</p><p>We don't make decisions that are going to potentially bite us in the short term. We believe in long-term valuation. There's a reason why Boston Properties lease term is over seven years. It's because we don't time the market.</p><p>Our perspective is if you going to be in the market, you meet the market where you have to, you don't look for cycles, you don't try and time things, and you put yourself in a position where you are more disciplined about credit, more disciplined about the types of assets that you buy and when you when them.</p><p>But you put yourself in a position where your strategy, high quality assets, long term leases, long term liabilities in the form of our balance sheet, and the kinds of tenants that are going to be growing through good and bad cycles, put themselves in a position where they can be productive and where you can work your way through challenging situations. And with that, I think I'm going to turn things over to Mr. Koop.</p><p>BRYAN KOOP, SVP, REGIONAL MANAGER - BOSTON OFFICE, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Good morning. I'm going to talk about the Prudential Center this morning for Boston. And the best way to understand how we continue to develop the Prudential Center, how we operate the Prudential Center, how we market, how we interface with our tenants is really to understand our most productive relationships with our clients.</p><p>And with our customers they're aggressive and strategic users of their real estate. They do three things that may not seem profound to you, but I assure you that our competitors do not review this and they do not understand how their customers in their office buildings are using real estate.</p><p>Our best and most productive relationships are with customers that use our trophy assets, our real estate to recruit, bring in new associates into their firm all the time. They use it to retain their top talent that they've spent a lot time in recruiting, and then training and mentoring.</p><p>And then also, they use it as a top line, not a bottom line. They use it to grow their businesses and, call it, grow their brand. And we'll run through just a couple examples of that, but it's really important to understand that all of this goes into our messaging to the marketplace and how we're differentiating our product, our trophy assets.</p><p>Go to the next slide. Accenture is just a great example of a company that uses our trophy real estate to recruit new associates. Every year there's a new class of associates coming into Accenture as their consultants that they're going to be training.</p><p>In Boston the Accenture office was located in Wellesley, at the Wellesley Office Park. And they had been for probably close to 20 years. The Wellesley Office Park is a fine office park. It's older in its product nature. It has a good suburban location. But they were up for renewal. And they were really struggling with what to do.</p><p>Our leasing team found an opportunity to get in front of them in a personal way, and I'll you a story about personal marketing and how important it is in terms of how we market our assets in a few minutes. But our team was able to get in front of them and really understand what it was that they were looking for.</p><p>They were, their biggest challenge was recruiting. Young people just didn't find it fun going out to Wellesley. They didn't want to live out there. They wanted to live in the city. Boston has a fantastic environment for a young person. We see that in the young people aspiring to come to our schools here. And then, when they live, here to stay here afterwards.</p><p>So the urban environment that Doug mentioned is highly attractive to the young people. They really did not find it, once they came to Accenture, really particularly buzzing after being out on the road for two weeks to then have to go back to their regional headquarters and spend time out in suburbs again. So we appealed to them in terms of what the Prudential Center offered them. It offered them the ability to really create a great environment for their associates.</p><p>And the next slide really shows a picture of that. They used in their recruiting, this is a picture of the Back Bay with the Prudential Center in the background. But you can see how they use it to recruit new associates.</p><p>All right, let's go to the next slide. Bain Capital an existing tenant, one of our first tenants at 111 Huntington. They use our real estate to retain their associates. Walking through Bain is really a unique experience. You walk through there and you realize that this firm is recruiting and then keeping top talent from around the world. You see nationalities from around the world in their organization. This is an organization that is so focused on how their people work at the Prudential Center, like no tenant we've ever seen before.</p><p>We have in-depth discussions about security. We have in-depth discussions about the type of restaurants we're going to be bringing in. You see on the screen here on the right, this was a feature of our security in Boston Magazine. We're extremely proud of this, because after 911, we were able to tap into this in some of the relationships that Mort has in Israel, and we brought a team over to really teach us about the way security is going to be done on an international basis.</p><p>Bain absolutely loved this. They used this with their people in their in their orientation. It's a big part of how they keep their people. But it's also about the fact that these young people that are working there may be working overnight. They do 24-hour shifts all the time if they're in the middle of an acquisition. And they really need to use some of these amenities that you see here. This is just one of our workout facilities at the Prudential Center. We also have a health club with an outdoor-indoor pool. Bain uses this with their people.</p><p>The next slide, shows our growth with Bain. We're very pleased and very proud of our relationship with them. We've grown them over 110% since inception. And they're a firm that they continue, even this week, to talk about their future growth. Their most recent discussion with us is about the fact that they see this as an opportunity for them, and you saw them active this week in their acquisition. When they acquire a company, they get actively involved in the management which means that they're going to have more people at this location.</p><p>Next, Ropes. Ropes &amp; Gray is a international firm based in Boston. The story I wanted to tell you about personal marketing is that Dave Provost came to us when Ropes was in the marketplace and we had just found that Gillette would not be staying at the Prudential Center. The Ropes RP, Request for Proposals, came out and Dave Provost came to our leadership and said \"I'm going to tell [Tom Hines], the broker, that we are not going to submit a proposal unless we get to spend time with them in person, and not just a small period of time. We need to understand their needs.\"</p><p>Well Tom, who's a good friend of mine, and Doug, and also Ed, went through the roof. But it was the smartest decision we ever made. He did allow us to meet with them in person. And one [probe] by Dave Provost that just set it off was, we're sitting at their office space in the reception area, to start off with looking over the Boston Harbor. And Dave said, \"This is just an incredible view here, and I'd just like to know what about this facility is not working?\"</p><p>Oh my gosh, they vomited information to us. And for the next half-hour we feverishly wrote down notes. But the main headline was growth. They were concerned that they could not grow their company at that existing location for a host of reasons. But the point was we put our marketing material and our proposal together based on how the Prudential Center can help this firm grow.</p><p>Go to the next slide. Now you can't see it from the back, but the point of this slide is that the Prudential Tower has a wonderful footprint for a company that wants to be able to switch and swap departments. Let's say the Mergers and Acquisitions department is shrinking, but Litigation is growing. The ability to switch and swap is something you can do at the Prudential Tower.</p><p>And the term that we got from them was, \"Partner -- no partner discrimination.\" Partners could be traded on floors, whereas at their existing location you couldn't do that. Each floor was different. Each floor was a different shape. Somebody was going to get the short end of the stick, but not at the Prudential Center. Growth was important. They also wanted to put their firm back together. They were all over the building. They wanted them in a consistent spot.</p><p>Next slide please. Now, the timing was perfect. We had been thinking about reinvesting in the Prudential Tower lobby. Over a period of time, this lobby had become dated. It was a little bit older in its look. And while some of the things were redeeming, it had some art deco features. It was heavy in its nature.</p><p>And one of the requirements that Ropes had was they said, \"If you're going to redo the lobby we want to become involved.\" But their message was we want this lobby to tell the story of our firm and tell the story of how we're an international firm with an international icon like the Prudential Tower. How can that work for us? And we went together and we came up with really a great solution. This is a rendering that some of you may have seen yesterday the new lobby which we're quite proud of.</p><p>Next slide please. A little about our retail that supports the Prudential Center, again it's back to how do we support our tenant, the office tenant. That's really the focus for us here.</p><p>Well, we're very pleased that we were named the Retail Cash Cow by Women's World Daily which is the premier retail cause publication that determines what the trends are. We were ranked number three out of -- we were within the top five shopping centers in the United States retail format. We're in the same breath as Ala Moana, the Grove, Tyson's Corner. We've taken our retail format from $600 a square foot approximately when we acquired the Prudential Center, to over $1,000 a square foot this past year. But again, it's how our office tenants use this space.</p><p>I'm always told that by many of our clients in the office buildings nobody every wants to have me come visit them. Everybody wants to come to the Prudential Center because of our amenities.</p><p>A few short points about our strategy, we are not a retail REIT. That's not our main business. We're an office REIT. But in many ways our team believes that that may be an advantage in that we're not straddled with a bunch of luggage. We're able to do some unique things at the Prudential Center.</p><p>Our goal is quite simply to be the number one destination in New England. All our promotions are geared towards driving traffic. We believe that if we do our part, which is simply to drive traffic through those arcades, that the retailers, it's up to them to do the job from there.</p><p>A couple things that to note in terms of our tactical strategy on a day-to-day basis, we treat our arcades like city streets. The word mall is not a part of the vocabulary of our marketing team. It is a city street. And with that a city street is the randomness of the city street.</p><p>We believe that the format that the conventional malls use which is restricted, it's, the jewelry store's got to be next to this person and that person, is not where the consumer's going. The consumer wants the randomness of the urban city street. We believe we're an extension of that, we're open 24-hours a day.</p><p>The other is we are, we believe in local chauvinism. We love those local users that are unique. A big part of our population that's coming through the Prudential Center are tourists. They don't want to see what they see in every mall in America. They want to see something different.</p><p>Easy example, when we entered, Sbarro, a great pizza place, was in our food court. But they're in every food court in America. We had to have Pizzeria Regina, of course the best pizza in Boston. And we were one their first units outside of the North End. That's what the tourist like, but that's also what our office users like.</p><p>Our other bit that we like to focus on new to market. The Prudential Center is a wonderful opportunity for a retailer to launch their brand, not only in the region, but in the US. A great example, we were able to convince Lacoste when they came in and re-launched the brand from their great run in the '60s and '70s that this was the spot. We were one of their first three stores. We have expanded them twice now and I believe they're over $1,600 a square foot. There's many other example of that as well.</p><p>Okay. Some of the other features that we think support this recruit, retain, and grow revenues for our customers is the fact that we are connected to 2.5 miles of arcades, weather protected. Boston does not have great weather. That's just a fact. We in fact have more rain than the city of Seattle. Well, on a rainy day sales go up at the Prudential Center. But it's also great for our office users. They never have to go outside.</p><p>One of my friends who's also one our tenants came to me proudly at the end of spring and said, \"I did it. I went through an entire winter without ever wearing a winter coat, because I'm at the Prudential Center.\" He left his garage, he got his car, pulled in our parking garage, and then he never needed to leave. And all his restaurant appointments were enclosed. It's a big advantage for us. And we think it's going to become bigger because if you focus on sustainability and green which we're going talk about later, it's all about walk-ability. And that what the Prudential Center provides the customer.</p><p>There is a unique website if you ever want to check it out call walk.com. If you put in a coordinate or address it'll give you a score on terms of the walk-ability of a location. We think that's pretty interesting. The Prudential Center was off the charts. We got 100.</p><p>Next, our parking, a real secret weapon for us, we are the largest parking garage north of New York City, over 4,000 spots. We have our own direct ramp off the Massachusetts Turnpike which is really important to those western suburbs where they key executives are living.</p><p>It's also the first place that a customer starts their day in Boston and ends their day. It's very typical for the average consumer to come in from the suburbs and say, \"I'm starting at the Pru, I know I can park there, it's safe, it's clean.\" They'll keep their car there throughout the day and then return to the Prudential Center.</p><p>But this parking, we show on the right the reserve spot, if you can't see it in the back, incredibly valuable to a decision-maker making a decision on where they're going to go for office space. Most executives downtown probably are not parking below their office building, and not in a reserved spot. We have seen over and over again how precious these spots are to these executives.</p><p>So we use all these things to support us. And we'll go to our next slide. Maybe there's one after this. Yes, there we go. This is Prudential Center today. We are 97% leased, 99% committed. Our biggest challenge for our leasing team and property management today is really working on growth and how we continue to keep our tenants within this portfolio.</p><p>Now having three buildings really gives us a good advantage in that. And it's not unusual, I think we've had over five or six relocations just over the last twelve months. The next slide shows about our future for growth. Oops, let's go back one.</p><p>There we go. 888 Boylston, a new tower, our last piece of real estate to develop at the Prudential Center, and we are in the midst of permitting that right now. This project will be a approximately over 450,000 square feet. We have 90,000 square feet of retail. Now we're still in the permitting process so I use the word approximately because it was originally permitted as a smaller building but we have good hopes that we are going to be able to obtain that.</p><p>We think this in incredible, important for us on several points. One, is it activates the Boylston side street and we think this product is really right in line with where the customer is going and what they like to see, that unique building that they can call their own and be a big fish in a building like this. And then the other is we really do need a growth belt to take care of our remaining existing tenants.</p><p>So in closing, on the Prudential Center it really goes back to focusing on how we work with our customers, our most productive relationships. And they are clearly using the Prudential Center and our trophy assets to recruit, retain and grow their companies.</p><p>ROBERT PESTER, SVP, REGIONAL MANAGER - SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Good morning, Bryan. Thank you for that fine presentation. The only difference between Embarcadero Center and Prudential Center is we don't have anything enclosed because we have great weather.</p><p>Good morning, my name's Bob Pester, I'm the Regional Manager in San Francisco. I'm going to talk for a few minutes about our acquisition of Embarcadero Center and what we've done to reposition that property.</p><p>A Clift Notes version, we purchased the property approximately 10 years ago in November 1998. At the time of its development, there were six buildings originally. It was developed between 1968 and 1990. And there were two hotels. In 1998, we acquired the six buildings and over the process of the last couple of years we've sold two of them for fairly handsome profits, I might add.</p><p>Next slide, please. How does this -- next. As of last month we are 93.5% occupied. We have 3 million square feet of office space. We have approximately 300,000 square feet of retail space. One of the major things we looked we at when we bought the center is the conversion of retail space to office space.</p><p>If you've been to the center before, there's three levels of retail. There's the ground floor level which is really the main entrance into the office buildings because the office buildings are located on lobby level. And we analyzed and looked at how we converted some of this functionally obsolescence retail to office space. Some of that space was vacant as long as 18 years. So over the course of 1999, 2000, 2001, we converted approximately 40,000 square feet of retail space that had not been occupied to office space. In fact, we're still doing that. I'll mention that in a second.</p><p>One of the beauties about Embarcadero Center is its location. Unfortunately for 90% of the buildings in San Francisco, Embarcadero Center forms a wall through the city. As you can see there's the four buildings along the waterfront. So unless you're higher than approximately 30, 35 stories in most of the North Financial district, you don't have views of the San Francisco Bay.</p><p>And what really sells in San Francisco and really makes a difference as far as the rents you're going to get, is north waterfront views. I like to make the comment that in San Francisco at Embarcadero Center not only can we see the boat, the people in the boat, and the name on the boat, but you can see what the people are doing inside the boat. We're, as in most buildings in San Francisco, you might get a glimpse of the water and a glimpse of the boat.</p><p>Just to give you an idea as far as the rent differentials, for waterfront view in San Francisco, let's say an [EC4], height of the market, we're probably getting $90, $95 a square foot for a building that's three or four blocks away from the Bay that may have some water views, it could be as much as a 15% to 20% differential.</p><p>Here's an example of some of the views. All these shots were shot out of Embarcadero Center. One of the other things that we did as far as major renovations when we bought the property is we went on a program to reinvent all the common area corridors. Many of the buildings had not been redone in 25, 30 years so over the course of a four-year period, we basically rebuilt all of the common area corridors in the complex.</p><p>One of the big selling features, similar to Prudential Center is all the amenities we have. We are the only shopping center in the financial district. And once you get outside of Union Square which is more of the carriage trade, there really is no place to shop. So we have the Gap. We've got the Williams Sonoma, we've got the Banana Republic. And it really is a destination location for a perspective during lunchtime, the shoppers that come into the Center. We also have a health club and 2,200 parking spaces.</p><p>This will give you an example of a few of things we did that we put a conference center in, in 2000. This conference center was a space that had been vacant for 18 years. We rebuilt it out. It's leased out to the tenants and also offered as an amenity to the tenants as part of their operating expenses. The center has a significant public art component to it. In fact we actually have an art guide that shows the 17 works of art throughout the center.</p><p>Now, one of the things we looked at when we bought the center is how to make it more welcoming and open when you walk in. Again, as I mentioned, you walk at street level into the buildings. And this top photo here shows how you -- when we first purchased the property it was sort of a dark, heavy feel when you walked into the buildings. We created that. We tore out all this mass, created a nice glass canopy coming in and livened up the retail with these window cuts that you see.</p><p>We also did major renovations in Sacramento Alley, which was a very dark, ugly area into the complex, and created new entry portal into Justin Herman Plaza which is just opposite the Ferry Building. That's the shot you see up there in the right-hand corner.</p><p>The former owners were very strict. The project was designed by John Portman. He was very strict that all the storefronts had to look the same. He really loved concrete. In fact, he loved it too much in the case of Embarcadero Center. So what we did, is we, once we purchased the property we allowed retailers to come in and create their own sense of identity and it actually enlivened the retail areas.</p><p>You can see here where we allowed different storefronts. The shot to your left also shows where second floor lobby level retail had no identity, no signage, no visibility basically from the street. And that lobby level space in the Promenade level has always been the most difficult to lease, so we created a program of doing window cuts which you see here in lower right-hand photo of putting retail windows in all of the lobby level spaces. That's probably allowed us to lease about 40,000 square feet of space through the years. That is again, was basically functionally obsolescent.</p><p>Then on the Promenade level which is the top third level of the retail complex. Again some of the most difficult retail space we had. We went into a program of converting all this over to office space. In fact, we just finished the last where we leased 12,000 square feet to a law firm that we signed a deal with last year, O'Melveny &amp; Myers, who's going occupy 185,000 feet.</p><p>So we're converting two former restaurant spaces into office space. And that will basically complete the successful transformation on all that Promenade level which was retail at one point, mostly vacant retail into office space. We did the same thing with Bingham McCutchen.</p><p>Just to, in closing, I know that Bryan mentioned some of the relationships that he has with tenants. And I think it's very important when you look at Boston Properties that in the case of New York, where have O'Melveny &amp; Meyers as a tenant and we also have them in San Francisco, O'Melveny actually was in a different building in San Francisco, a building that we sold a couple of years ago. Their lease was coming up for renewal in a year, and they came to us and asked about moving back into Embarcadero Center and the main reason that they wanted to do it was because of the relationship that they had with Boston Properties both in San Francisco and New York.</p><p>As David Cartwright said who's their Head of Real Estate, he finds us the most, the most responsible, the most reasonable landlord that's he's ever dealt with. And I think if you look at our tenant roster, I know that Bryan mentioned a couple of tenants like Ropes and Gray, again, a tenant that we have at Embarcadero Center, a deal that we did just a couple of years ago based on the relationship. I think as you look through our portfolio both in Washington, DC, San Francisco, New York, Boston, you'll see many of those similar relationships based on the fact that tenants want to do business with Boston Properties. Robert?</p><p>ROBERT SELSAM, SVP, REGIONAL MANAGER - NEW YORK OFFICE, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Good morning, I'm obviously Robert Selsam, Regional Manager in New York. I want to start by telling you a little bit about what we're doing at Citigroup Center. We bought the building in April of 2001. And we saw that the building had not reached its full potential in the New York market.</p><p>Why do I say that? Well when it was designed in the 1970s by Citibank using legendary architect, Hugh Stubbins, they conceived it as a big mixing bowl, where the public and office tenants, retail shoppers, and people from the neighborhood would all just wander throughout the complex using 10 different entrances on two different levels.</p><p>And the result was that there was no office lobby to speak of. It was on two levels because of double-decker elevators. And it was so porous that there was just simply no defined office lobby and everything was all mixed together.</p><p>So since we bought the building we've been trying to figure out how to sort all this out, which was not easy for a couple of reasons. Many of the public spaces received bonuses from the City of New York when the building was built and they were sacrosanct and we couldn't take anything away that had been made public.</p><p>And the second thing that made it so difficult was the composition of the building was so well done that all the pieces fit together absolutely perfectly in a giant jigsaw puzzle that included St. Peter's Church on the corner of 54th and Lexington. As you see here that was part of the overall plan and its part of the condominium.</p><p>But in the foreground you'll see a bridge leading into the building that for most of the last seven years, since we bought the building, has not been used. And therein was the opportunity that we saw to create a new office lobby.</p><p>So we went back to the original Stubbins firm because who better to tinker with what's considered somewhat of a masterpiece than the original architect? And with their help we have come up with a plan which you can see here to make a new office lobby out of the underutilized north end of the elevator banks on the upper and lower level with a new -- well this is the upper level, this is the lower level.</p><p>And separating these lobbies from the retail by walling off the corridors that connect to the retail to the east and walling off the elevator lobbies to the south, we're creating a secure and distinct office lobby out of space that was just underutilized before. And that's what it will look like on that bridge, a 35 foot high glass structure.</p><p>Now all visitors to the building will have to use this entrance because that's where the security and the check in will be. But the tenants in the building can use any of the entrances they use today and have the additional benefit of this as an extra entrance.</p><p>Here's the view looking from Lexington Avenue. You'll note that it says 601 Lexington on it. And that's because when we cut the ribbon on this new lobby late next spring, we're going to rebrand the tower as 601 Lexington Avenue. It just doesn't make sense to have be called Citigroup Center anymore.</p><p>And frankly we're tired of the fact that every time Citibank has a problem all of the TV cameras come and photograph the Citigroup Center sign on the front of our building. So we think that this new lobby and this new rebranding will really let Citigroup Center take its place where it should be as one of the very top buildings in New York, recognized throughout the world.</p><p>Next I want to talk about the GM Building which we're very excited to have as our flagship for the New York office. As most of you probably know, the GM Building is the trophy of trophy properties. It's simply the best, the mostly coveted building in New York City and it commands the highest available rents in the marketplace. Rents that even today exceed $200 and up at the top of the building.</p><p>Let's start with the land that it sits on because it is a unique piece of property or dirt if you will. It's directly across from the Plaza Hotel, recently completely renovated into five-star hotel and luxury apartments. and it is cattycornered to Central Park, the preeminent edge of Midtown Manhattan. And it's at the juncture of the residential district on Fifth Avenue and the hotel and residential district on Central Park South. And this is directly across from Central Park. And the site occupies the entire block which is unique in Midtown to only a few buildings that actually go avenue to avenue, street to street.</p><p>Now, looking at the building itself, its marble clad columns rise 50 stories straight up in the air out of a beautifully designed public plaza. Designed and redesigned public plaza that as Mort mentioned, is home to the Apple Store and now famous and tourist attracting Apple Cube which is a remarkable piece of architecture. There is a stair and an elevator in there that goes down to the lower level.</p><p>As you can see a little bit better here, and there's not a piece of structural steel in it. It is all made of glass. And this store which has become probably the most successful by revenue, store of any of its kind, anything like it in the world has now become the northern anchor of Fifth Avenue retail district. And that is something that we intend to capitalize on, because the, much of the other retail space in the building have leases that expire between 2010 and 2012. And we will be taking advantage of the traffic that is now being brought to the front of the building.</p><p>Now going into the building itself, the lobby is stark and white and monumental. And it speaks of power and elegance and it tells you a lot about the kind of tenants who are in the building. In fact, it's a lobby where the likes of Carl Ichan and Sandy Weill and [Teddy Forceman] and Ron Barron and William Lauder can run into each other on a daily basis.</p><p>The footprint of the GM Building is as you see a rectangle with a bustle. And what I want to mention is that every floor is the same which allows great flexibility for large tenants. These floors work well for large tenants, but importantly they also work very well on a divided basis. And many of the tenants are on divided floors.</p><p>What's so unique is that every floor right down to the third floor has fabulous Central Park views from what would be your upper left-hand corner. So there is no floor that doesn't have gorgeous views of Central Park and certainly as you get near the top, the views are breathtaking.</p><p>And we have two tenants that occupy about 0.75 million square feet, long term leases that are probably at about half of market rents so there is nowhere to go but up in the long term. And in the meantime, we will continue to do what we always do which is proactively find opportunities to increase rents and enhance value which we will be doing. Thank you.</p><p>DOUG LINDE: So just to sort of get back to summarize where we are and why we're talking about these assets, they're different. These are not generic office buildings. They are spectacular pieces of architecture. They're very unusual locations, but most importantly, when we grab these assets either through an acquisition or through development, we do things to those buildings and we do them on a perpetual basis.</p><p>This team up here, these regions which as you'll see later have development, construction management, leasing, legal, property management constantly thinking about ways to enhance these buildings, do things to these buildings to improve their image, their positioning. But most importantly their attractiveness to the types of tenants that we have in our portfolio today so that we can keep these buildings full.</p><p>And we can put these buildings in a position where they can demand premium rents through the tough times and when we have those opportunities where the cycles are working in our favor, get tremendous opportunities for rental rate expansion and growth which is what we just came through and where we've seen the opportunities.</p><p>These are not buildings that you can look at as cash flows and compare them to the cash flows of any other private company nor any other public company, be it a New York City REIT or a suburban REIT or a national REIT. They're different. This portfolio and the assets that we have in this portfolio are fundamentally different types of real estate.</p><p>And not only are they the kind of pieces of real estate that we put this kind of capital into and that we constantly are trying to reinvigorate, but they also retain their value in a way that's very different because of their location and because of their architecture and because of their design and because of the loving care that we give them.</p><p>The world that we are in today, I think, is one where people are sort of pushing themselves away from thinking about replacement costs. People are thinking about well what's the right cap rate. How much leverage are you going to be able to put on this building? And those are really fair, appropriate ways to think about the valuation of real estate.</p><p>But there is going to be a point in time when the cities that we're in, and the economy that we're in starts to grow again. And when there is growth, there will be the requirement for new construction. And these are the places, Midtown Manhattan, Back Bay of Boston, Reston, Virginia, Waltham Massachusetts, North of Market Street in San Francisco, where you're going -- the CBD of Washington, DC, where you're going to want to be located, and where you're going want to have assets.</p><p>And we are in this for the long haul. We are not a company that is looking to make a quick exit. We're not a company that is looking to be a trader of real estate. We're a long term owner-operator of real estate. And when those buildings start to get built again, we can assure you that the value associated with that new construction will be significantly more in terms of what it costs than what our basis is in these buildings. And therefore, illustrate the value creation and upside, and again, the opportunity for enhanced rental rate appreciation and growth over the long term in those buildings.</p><p>So as you think about New York City today and you think about the fact that there are lots of financial service companies that are in fact struggling. And that there is no question that rental rates at the General Motors Building are less today than they would have been had we not gone through the serious situation that we're going through today, that Mort talked about for the first hour of this conference.</p><p>There's no question that rents are lower. But that doesn't mean that the long term value of this building is any less or more valuable than it was when we purchased it five and one-half months ago. The issue is, is how do you position yourself for the downtime? And it happens to be that we have one available floor today at the General Motors Building and we'll have two available floors at the end of 2010, and between now and then nothing. That's it.</p><p>And if you look at the rest of our portfolio, our rollover is less than seven percent in 2009. And it's just about seven percent in 2010. So you're talking about the next two and one-quarter years, about 14% of our portfolio having some rollover exposure. And there are many of those transactions that we're actually working on right now.</p><p>And we speak after lunch about the leasing markets, we'll talk about what's going on with some of those spaces, where we're going to be renewing tenants at rents that are significantly higher than the contractual rents.</p><p>So there is, in fact, going to be appreciation and rental rate growth. So as I said before, we are going to see increasing funds from operation, be it the less perfect matrix that we're using today in our cash flow over time as we move forward.</p><p>So with that, I will open it up for questions and then we'll take a break. Any questions for any of the folks up here? There being none, we'll take a 10 minute break and then we'll come back and Mike will talk about our capital situation. Thanks.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well welcome back. I just want to quickly revisit what Doug, Bryan, Bob and Robert were saying about the asset characteristics that our assets have. They described a lot of characteristics of our assets and they really make intuitive sense if you're a tenant and what you are looking for, and our tenants are really our most important judge.</p><p>And the proof that our strategy really comes from the actual performance of our assets. And it's -- as you see the yields on this chart here, this is the current annualized, unleveraged cash net operating income divided by our total basis in these assets. That includes the original acquisition costs, all capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions that we put into these assets.</p><p>And as you can see, these properties are generating yields that are dramatically higher than what current market acquisition yields are. And more importantly, they've shown tremendous growth since we acquired these assets. These yields have grown anywhere from 150 to over 500 basis points from the yields that they showed when we first acquired the assets.</p><p>The projected 2009 cash yield, as Mort indicated earlier, is 5%. And we expect given the below-market nature, substantially below-market nature, of the leases in that building, that the unleveraged yields that it will show in the future will be well in excess of the yields that are on this chart. It may take 10 to 15 years to get there, to get all the leases to roll over, but over the long term, we expect to see tremendous performance from that asset.</p><p>Even given the current uncertainty in New York City and in the general economy, we believe in the long-term success of Midtown Manhattan. And especially in the sub-markets, like the Park Avenue sub-market and the Plaza District, where the limitation on supply is just really, really significant. I mean, it's just impossibly high barriers to entry when you cannot find land to develop in these markets.</p><p>Unfortunately, this really is not a joke today. This is reality. I want to spend a few minutes talking about our capital structure, our access to capital and the status of the capital markets today.</p><p>The long-term mentality that we employ with our assets also extends to how we capitalize ourselves. We believe in a stable balance sheet with long term, fixed rate debt. Our assets primarily contain long-term leases, as you've heard today already, and we purposely match those with similar lease terms capital. In fact, our average debt maturity is 8.5 years, which is actually longer than our average lease tenure, which is just over seven years.</p><p>We use very little floating rate debt. Our only floating rate debt is typically our construction loan activity and whatever outstandings we may have under our line of credit. Again, we believe in matching fixed rate assets with fixed rate debt.</p><p>Including our recent convertible debt offering, we have outstanding debt of $6.4 billion today. This equates to a moderate leverage ratio of 33%. This conservative leverage position provides us with options to access all types of capital, whether it be debt or equity, to finance new opportunities.</p><p>The type of capital that we employ is really dependent on the scale of the opportunities that we see. We look at our leverage and our fixed coverage capacity in making these determinations. And we continue to be underleveraged and we are well above the fixed charge requirements that we look to operate at today.</p><p>Just to look at our loan maturity profile, as you can see, it's very well laddered. And we actively manage these maturities. One example of this is when we did our recent convertible debt or exchangeable debt offering, we selected a 5.5 year term instead of what is typical in the marketplace for that product, which is a five-year term. It probably costs us a few extra basis points to go out just another six months, but to us it moved the maturity of that debt out into 2014.</p><p>And if you look at the chart, you can see the green bar is our convertible debt offering that we did. So we have very, very few maturities in that period. We didn't really want it to be maturing in 2013, where some of our other unsecured bonds that we did several years ago are maturing. So we actively chose to push that out.</p><p>Given the very, very difficult credit climate today, I'm happy to say that our near-term exposure to loans maturing is minimal. With the pay off our $275 million mortgage loan on Embarcadero Center, that we paid off in September, we only have one loan expiring this year, which is a $16 million loan on a suburban asset in Boston. I don't care what is going on in the world, I think that we can handle the $16 million loan maturity.</p><p>In 2009, we have $270 million of loans expiring. The largest of which is a $200 million loan on our South of Market development project in Reston, Virginia. And that loan has two years of extensions available to it and it's priced at LIBOR plus 100, which is a very, very attractive rate in today's environment. So if you pull that loan out, we have very, very few expiries next year as well.</p><p>If you look at 2010 and 2011, it starts to grow a little bit. In 2010, we have $500 million. In 2011, we have $615 million of mortgage debt expiring. In 2010, we also have our line of credit, which is shown on there. And our line of credit, which is $1 billion, has a one-year extension available to it through August of 2011.</p><p>The mortgage maturities in these two years are mostly smaller facilities. They have an average size of $75 million and all of these properties have extremely low leverage. In fact, based upon the current conservative underwriting standards that most life insurance companies are employing today, we believe we can raise over $900 million of additional proceeds through the refinance of these assets. The current weighted average interest rate on these loans is roughly 7%.</p><p>When we went public in 1997, in our first five years as a public company, we were wed to the secured debt markets. We had our unsecured line of credit available to us, but that was the only unsecured debt we have. And as you can see on this pie on the left-hand side, we all secured mortgages.</p><p>In 2002, we recognized this risk and we made the decision to become a publicly rated company so we could access the investment grade bond market. This transition has enabled us to expand our access to capital and we're now a mature issuer in multiple markets. We have the convertible debt market, we have the unsecured investment grade unsecured bond market, we have the permanent mortgage debt market, with CMBS and life insurance companies and pension funds and foreign banks. And we have the commercial bank market, which provides a short term, both unsecured and secured debt to us.</p><p>If you look back at this decision, and especially given today's environment, and we are just thrilled with the flexibility that this access has brought us. We're committed to maintaining our investment grade ratings and our current ratings are A- from Standard &amp; Poor's, BAA2 from Moody's and BBB from Fitch.</p><p>We have been consistently active in all of the markets. We've raised $16 billion of debt since our IPO in 1997 and $21 billion of total capital. It's incredibly important for us to consistently access the markets and maintain solid relationships with our investors. And we've been very proactive with this practice and treat our investors like they're our partners.</p><p>Even in the CMBS market, with causing the life insurance company lenders to be completely non-competitive in the market, we actively worked with these relationships so we could have them for the long haul. I can't tell you how many times that a banker called me or a life insurance banker called me and they said, \"You know, I just got a call from an old client of mine, he hasn't called me for over five years and now he wants something.\"</p><p>Just like anything else, these lenders are going to work on the deal, where they're comfortable with the relationships that they're dealing with and where they -- the likelihood for actually closing a loan is the highest.</p><p>In addition to the access to the debt and public equity markets, we have the ability to raise private equity as well. We can do this through joint venture equity, like we did with the GM building transaction and the other New York City acquisitions that we did. And we can also do this through issuance of operating partnership units. And we have used operating partnership units to our advantage in the past, because investors are very attracted to two things.</p><p>One, they're attracted to the fact that they can get a deferral of their tax. Because they can exchange their interest in real property into interest in Boston Properties. But secondly, they're very comfortable investing in our currency. And as Doug showed on his chart, our performance has been fantastic over the years and these investors have benefited.</p><p>This has led to follow-on opportunities with them and doing multiple deals with the same partners. A good example of this is our entree to the land acquisition at 250 West 55th Street. It was somebody who had formally done a transaction with it, 875 Third Avenue.</p><p>These kind of relationships are really, really borne out when you enter a market like today. Even during the credit crisis, we have been successful in accessing the markets and we have raised over $2.2 billion of capital since August of 2007.</p><p>This includes over $300 million of construction and bridge loans from the bank market, we increased our line of credit from $600 million to $1 billion, we raised $750 million in the convertible debt market and we raised over $700 million of private equity associated with the acquisitions in New York.</p><p>We're currently working on several additional transactions that I wan to go through. Our financing of 4 Embarcadero Center. This mortgage loan, which is in the amount of $375 million, continues to progress. The length of time that it has taken is pretty significant, but we have signed a commitment letter and we've put up a hard deposit for this.</p><p>We're now completing loan documents and we plan to close this transaction in the fourth quarter. The fact that we've been talking about this transaction, I think, for the last two quarters is really a demonstration of how arduous the process is to go get a secured mortgage today.</p><p>We have multiple lenders competing for this opportunity because as Bob pointed out, this is a fantastic asset. We're looking for a conservative leverage position. But once we chose a lender, the process to actually get to a commitment letter and negotiating the terms of that commitment letter has taken many, many months. Many more months than it would have taken 12 months ago, because of the current environment.</p><p>We're also in the market for a construction loan on our Russia Wharf project. Russia Wharf is a very attractive opportunity to the bank market for a couple of reasons. One is the fantastic location and the design of the building is great. But probably the most important thing is the market acceptance that is already shown.</p><p>The office space is already 82% pre-leased to Wellington Management Company. And that is one of the most important things that construction lenders are looking for today. Market acceptance, pre-leasing. We've received a good response from our relationship lenders for this opportunity and we are assessing term sheets that contain more than sufficient capacity to fund the remaining costs in the project.</p><p>Going forward, over the next 12 months or so, we expect to continue to access the market. We're going to enter the market with a couple of more construction loans, including our 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue project in Washington DC as well as potentially raising another $250 million to $500 million of permanent debt capital, or long-term debt capital.</p><p>All of these potential financings do not assume that we do new acquisition activity and are really designed to build additional dry powder for those opportunities, so we can be opportunistic when we see attractive investments.</p><p>I just want to quickly go through the terms of our recent exchangeable debt offering. In August, about six weeks ago, we raised $747 million in this market. And the purpose was to restock our liquidity after the acquisition of the GM Building and the other buildings in New York that occurred in June and in August.</p><p>The execution of this financing went exceedingly well. The -- we had a target capital raise of $500 million and because of the strong market demand that we saw, we were able to up size it to almost $750 million.</p><p>We really felt the convert market offered the most efficient price capital at the time. The loan period's a coupon of three and five-eighths, we purchased a capped call, which increased our exchange rate from 20% above the price at the time, which was 100 and -- which was 20% above, it was $118 a share to $137 a share. And the all in effective interest rate of the loan, which includes the discount, any fees and the cost of the capped call, is 5.36%. We see this as very attractively priced capital for 5.5 years.</p><p>I do want to note that a modification to accounting regulations, going into effect in 2009, will affect this convert as well as our other converts and requires us to report GAAP interest expense above the 5.36%. This one of several non-cash FFO measures that will be impacting our financial statements going forward, and as Doug mentioned, the impact of many of the GAAP rules are rendering FFO pretty irrelevant for companies like ours. In addition to the APB 14-1 rule that affects convertible debt, that's going to require us to book non-cash interest expense of somewhere between $0.20 and $0.22 in 2009, we also have FAS 141, or fair value lease accounting, which is impactful with our New York City transactions.</p><p>If you look at the GM Building and the other three New York City buildings, that's going to add $0.64 to $0.65 to our FFO in 2009. In addition, we have non-cash G&amp;A. That includes stock compensation and the amortization of our outperformance plan. The expense related to that in 2008 is about $0.16 of non-cash expense.</p><p>Our goal, with respect to all of these non-cash items and some of the accounting issues that we have to deal with, is to try to be completely transparent to our investors. So in our supplemental package, in our calls, we're going to provide to you all of the adjustments that you need so that you can get to what is the more meaningful cash earnings of the company.</p><p>If I'm this banker, all I can say is at least it's not a closure. Unfortunately, there's going to be many, many mergers and bank closures as a result of the crisis that is going on. So what is the real impact to the market? Clearly the capacity of credit in the market is down. You heard Mort talk about it quite a bit. There's fewer and fewer lenders that are open for business every week.</p><p>We have historically seen the result of these bank mergers on credit capacity. And unfortunately, it is consistently the fact that one plus one equals one. One plus one does not equal two. So even when things normalize, it's likely that capacity is going to be a little bit lower.</p><p>With financing needs currently outstripping the supply of capital, lenders are being incredibly cautious, moving very, very slowly and they're extremely selective. All are looking for high-quality assets, mature Tier 1 markets, stable leasing profiles and good credit. Any red flag in a deal can blow up a deal. And there's just no room for storied transactions in today's environment.</p><p>Leverage requirements have dropped precipitously, with lenders seeking 50% to 60% loans and strong in-place cash flow and pricing has gone through the roof. There's very, very little room for price negotiations today and spreads on all types of credits has moved up 150 basis points to north of 300 basis points from where it was before.</p><p>All of this is bad news for borrowers. But there is a silver lining here. Those companies that have access to capital and conservative balance sheets will be able to take advantage of the deleveraging that is going to occur in many of these portfolios. In these markets, sponsorship and credibility are paramount and companies like Boston Properties will be able to use this to competitive advantage going forward.</p><p>So the million dollar question is who has the capital. Who is lending today? Well I can tell you that the phone is ringing off the hook at the banks and the life insurance companies. They are the only outlets. They know they're the only outlets. And they're not immune to problems of their own. The domestic banks have traditionally been the source for short-term financing, construction loans and even permanent capital for middle market real estate. And they are capital constrained today.</p><p>Many have well-documented exposures to sub-prime assets and other credit issues that are affecting their willingness to lend. Our direct experience with this market is that stronger banks continue to lend for their good, existing relationships. And only for their good existing relationships. However, pricings is up and hold levels are down.</p><p>You used to see banks willing to put out $100 million, $125 million on a transaction without batting an eye. Many of them are $40 million or $50 million today. Pricing for a construction loan is now in the 250 to 300 basis point range over LIBOR. This is up from 100 to 150 basis points and fees are 1% to 2% for a three-year commitment.</p><p>Foreign banks have been very active, particularly the German banks. They've been doing both short term and long term floating rate financing. And many borrowers have used them for long-term mortgages, where they will provide seven- to 10-year floating rate deals and they get swapped to fixed.</p><p>Pricing has been competitive in the 200 basis point area over LIBOR for term loans, but it's definitely showing signs of strain. The foreign banks are also very focused on select sponsors, top-tier markets and asset quality.</p><p>As has been evidenced by some of the difficulties in many of the European banks that have just been coming up this week, the capital flowing from these institutions is probably going to slow. The life insurance companies are really the steady Eddies of the market. They have a totally different funding source, and that source is very stable.</p><p>They have been consistent in lending $40 billion to $50 billion annually to the real estate market over the years. And they did not get caught up in the fever that happened over the last couple of years. They simply maintained their underwriting discipline and put out as much money as they needed to and no more.</p><p>I expect they will continue to do so, but they're not interested in filling the breach that is left by CMBS. They only want to rebuild the quality of their portfolios that were degradated slightly because the CMBS market took so much of the market share of the highest quality assets that the insurance companies were forced to down tier over the last few years. So now those companies are really looking to up tier into higher quality assets.</p><p>They're aware of their position, as the long-term lender of choice today, and they've pushed pricing up and their underwriting standards have come in. Pricing over treasuries is currently 275 to 350 basis points and they have minimum floors on all-in rates that range anywhere from 6% to 6.5% today. The other thing that the life insurance companies are doing today is they're driving the leverage parameters for the entire market.</p><p>The bank market typically looks to the life insurance company market as their takeout. So as the life insurance company lenders reduce their leverage, all of the banks are reducing how much they want to lend against assets as well. Leverage parameters, as I said, are definitely sub-60%.</p><p>Life insurance companies are also concerned about overall debt coverage capacity that each property has, so their willingness to accept secondary financing or mezzanine financing on their loans is really limited.</p><p>Moving on to the convert market, the convertible debt market has been a very active market and a great market for all of the REITs over the past few years. You can see it by some of the transactions that we have done over the last couple of years.</p><p>The majority of these investors are hedge funds, however. And the market has recently been shaken up over the whole short sale restrictions that have come in that limited their ability to maintain their hedges or set up their hedges on their assets.</p><p>Even those companies that don't have short sale restrictions on them, there's just a concern that they will have short sale restrictions on them. This has caused the entire convertible market to start trading very, very poorly and it's very dislocated. And it's brought the new issue market to a halt.</p><p>Today, only six weeks after we did our $747 million deal, we cannot even get a bid from the convert market. The investment grade bond market is open, but it continues to be totally inactive to issuers and it's really due to historically wide credit spreads. Borrowing spreads in this market have been volatile and they're currently 400 basis points plus for companies like ours.</p><p>This -- on a 10-year basis, relates to a borrowing cost of 7.75% or more. To date, most issuers, including ourselves have been able to raise capital elsewhere and they've avoided increasing the borrowing cost by accessing this market. Due to the overall inhospitability of the debt markets, we've definitely seen companies start to access equity markets.</p><p>Just in the past few weeks, there's been, I think, 14 deals and its raised almost $2 billion in the REIT market. But the retail market driving this demand and institutional buyers being more cautious, the size of these transactions and your ability to access this market in size is somewhat questionable. And also you've got so much stock price volatility out there that it's a significant factor.</p><p>I wanted to talk for a little bit about the CMBS market. You look at that market from 2005 to 2007 and the market originated over $600 billion of loans, which was roughly 40% of all new mortgage loans that were originated. If you just look at 2007, that market share actually grew to in excess of 50% of all new mortgage loans that were originated. As is well documented, the market crashed in late 2007, and spreads widened dramatically and everybody got stuck with their positions. This situation continues today, with BBB spreads north of 2,400 basis points.</p><p>These spreads are crazy and they demonstrate the total lack of confidence that investors currently have in the CMBS market. Its resulted in the market being shut down for all of 2008, as you can see on the chart, only $12 billion of loans in 2008, and there's really no sign of this market returning.</p><p>I believe that there's definitely a place for this market. It's probably going to come back and it's going to look like it did in the early 2000s, but the timing for that market coming back is more likely many years from now. Multiple years from now.</p><p>And the loans on the books, the CMBS loans on the books, however, remain. And the CMBS market equates to 25% of all commercial mortgages today. If you think about it, CMBS, the mortgage REITs, the finance companies and many of the banks are out of the market today. It's likely that less than 50% of the market on this pie actually exists today in the market.</p><p>It's pretty well documented that similar to the sub-prime residential market, the commercial mortgage underwriting standards in the last few years deteriorated to a place where a rational investor would not have invested. This not only included an increase in interest-only loans from being the exception to being more than 90% of new CMBS loans that were originated, but it was also in the analysis of cash flow. And the techniques that people use to size loans.</p><p>There was a lot of use of future rental bumps and averaging leases to come up with loan sizes, ultra low, going in, loan coverages, sometimes below one times, and the institution of escrows that would cover the deficit cash flow of these properties for multiple years. Equity requirements were also drastically reduced to sometimes less than 5%.</p><p>Today's more conservative underwriting has a huge impact on loan sizing and is going to drive further deleveraging over the next few years. This slide represents an actual February 2007 loan and it -- on the right-hand side, the September 2008 underwriting that we are experiencing today.</p><p>Despite the reduction in treasury rates by 75 basis points, credit spreads have gone out 175 basis points. So borrowing costs are up. The loan-to-value ratios have come in. And more importantly, debt service coverage requirements, in place debt service coverage requirements, have gone from 1.1 times or sometimes below to at least 1.25 times and including an amortization schedule of either 25 or 30 years.</p><p>If you just look at this analysis, and you try to size a loan to $20 million of cash flow, you get a 35% reduction in proceeds levels for the same asset. I have to say that it's very unlikely that we will ever return to the kind of underwriting standards that we saw in 2006 and 2007.</p><p>Looking at the future debt maturity pipeline in the CMBS market, there are more than $50 billion of CMBS debt maturities in 2010 through 2012 that were originated as five-year floaters. These are only the loans that were originated as five-year floaters. And they were originated in the 2005 to 2007 period. So these are really the, I guess, the poster children of weak underwriting. If we assume that all of these were underwritten at maximum proceeds level, it could required $17.5 billion of equity to refinance these assets.</p><p>In addition to these loans, there's an additional $80 billion of other CMBS loans that expired during this time frame, for a total of $130 billion expiring during this period. This compares to roughly $30 billion of maturities in 2008 and 2009. And again, it's only the CMBS market.</p><p>So to date, when you look at the reduction in credit capacity, the real effect is it's slowed down transactions. There hasn't been that much refinancing requirements that have been affected, but as these debt maturities come due, it's going to force the action. And as you can see, the problem can really start to snowball on owners needing to refinance. So looking forward to 2010, I would say it certainly promises to offer some interesting opportunities for those companies that are well capitalized, like we are.</p><p>So what does this credit mess mean for us? And what are we doing? Our goal is to ensure that we have ready access to all of the capital markets. No one could have predicted the dislocation that has occurred, but one thing is very, very clear. Access to a wide variety of capital is crucial for success today.</p><p>Liquidity is precious. We're focused on maintaining our liquidity in terms of cash on the balance sheet, availability under committed lines of credit and balance sheet capacity. We're confident with our ability to fund our future development needs and -- over the next couple of years. And we're also going to tap the market consistently to continue to build that liquidity. This includes some of the transactions I've talked about, including Embarcadero Center and some of the construction loans that we plan to do.</p><p>Lastly, we will continue to foster and grow our relationships with our capital partners. Our performance over the past 30 years with these partners has enabled us to build a reputation of a company that backs up words with performance. This credibility is irreplaceable when you are asking -- looking to seek a piece of that shrinking pie of capacity.</p><p>Overall, I think you can see we feel pretty good about the capital markets. It's pretty tough out there. But honestly, in this type of tough market, there is a clear distinction between the people that can get credit and the people that can't get credit.</p><p>There's a clear distinction in the pricing and the access to capital. And we believe that this is going to have -- this is going to give us a competitive advantage over the next two years. If anybody has any questions or anything, I'd be happy to respond. [Michael]?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: That's a good question, Michael. I mean, it's really things that are on the margin. We are accustomed to driving the process of what the terms of those loans are. And certainly as -- over the last five or seven years, we came up with a standard loan document that we would be willing to accept and that we negotiated with these lenders. And specifically with the lenders that we're doing this transaction with.</p><p>And the times have changed a little bit and they're trying to change the rules. Now it's not on the interest rate or the loan proceeds or anything, but it's related for how much it costs to transfer the asset if you want to transfer the asset. Things that are on the margin like that.</p><p>Amortization terms. We used to be able to drive interest-only periods for significantly longer. And today you can't. I mean, you really have to agree to a 25- or a 30-year amortization schedule. Typically a 30-year amortization schedule for loans -- for properties of the quality of ours.</p><p>So it's really items that are on the margins that we were accustomed to being able to negotiate. And one of the reasons it took so long is not that we've continued to try to negotiate some of those terms, it's just it took forever for the institutions to go back and get an answer from their teams. Because they were focused on other things.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, I had a question on the CMBS loan maturities. I seem to recall that that is an aggregate amount and that's not broken down by product type. There is a difference between how many office maturities there will be versus retail versus residential.</p><p>Have you -- I can see the data. Have you actually found that this is something that, on the office side, that sellers are interested or at least those that own those are starting to talk to you right now for the 2010?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure what the breakdown of the CMBS expiries are between the different product types.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's about 25% to 30% of more expirations are office?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: About 25% to 35% of the expirations are office product.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: So just interested, you mentioned that these are opportunities, as these products come due, or have maturities. There's no talk yet or you haven't talked with some of these folks as opportunities a year, two years out. Because if I'm -- that's something coming due in 2010, I'm not going to wait until 2010.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, I think the question is, is they may not try to wait until 2010 to refinance that debt, but it's an issue of whether they can actually raise the capital needed to refinance that debt. If there is -- if they're kind of upside down with respect to the current leverage position.</p><p>And where they're going to get that equity to refinance that asset. And it's going to force people to sell those assets and potentially create additional opportunities in the marketplace for companies to have the capital to buy in that market. So if there's a significant amount of office product that is coming available, we're going to be in a position where we can take advantage of that. Because we have the multiple access to capital.</p><p>Many of the private companies that bought these assets during 2005 and 2006 and 2007 only have access to the secured debt markets. And we have access to many other markets, including the equity markets, so that we are in a position, if we see opportunities that are attractive, to take advantage of them. And that's what we plan to do.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you for that. As a follow-up, did you know any of the specific assets that are collateralized by some of these 2010 maturities?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I really don't know specific assets. I don't really want to comment on specific assets, to be honest with you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay. There is obviously, when you look at the 2008 expirations, obviously the [Maclo] transaction was the one that stuck out in February, which represented an opportunity. But if I look at this chart, and I look at the opportunities that will be coming, in 2010, 2011 and 2012, it would appear to me that there would be more opportunities coming at a time when the economic landscape is a little more -- is more sour than it is today. So just trying to match that with how patient your capital is when you look out at these investment opportunities to 2010 and 2012.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I think Doug wants to answer that.</p><p>DOUG LINDE: Yes, the short answer is we do know where a number of the other well renowned opportunities are. It's no secret that Broadway Partners has interesting assets that have maturities in 2009. Hancock, we understand, has got a maturity pretty soon. There are also a book of loans that Lehman Brothers underwrote, many of which are underwater from a debt service perspective. So those maturity dates have come much sooner.</p><p>I would say that we are going to patient and we are probably going to be less aggressive in an environment where the TED spread is 400 basis points, than we would be if AT&amp;T and General Electric could actually issue commercial paper, where there wasn't another bank potentially being assumed by somebody else, every other week, and that the current environment is not one where you want to necessarily use up your liquidity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mike, could you talk about where required returns have gone for private equity for your joint venture capital?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I think Doug might be the best person to answer that question as well.</p><p>DOUG LINDE: Just say that again?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: For private capital or joint venture equity, where have required returns gone?</p><p>DOUG LINDE: I actually happened to have a conversation with our -- one of our partners on Monday. And here's sort of the example they gave me. And you can take this for what it's worth.</p><p>They said, \"Well, clearly you set a bar with the General Motors Building. So we're not going to look at anything that doesn't have a current return that is in -- lower than what you guys are projected to get in the first year or so at the General Motors Building.\"</p><p>By -- what we do as sovereign wealth funds is we look around the world. And if you look around the world, there are dislocations that are occurring in other marketplaces that are significantly more attractive right now than what we are seeing from a transactional perspective in the United States.</p><p>So as an example, we were talking about two transactions in London, one of them was the Norman Foster Building in the center of the city that just was acquired in a, I think, a 6/7 or a 6/8 cap rate, and then the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Building in Canary Wharf, where the debt's coming due, the borrower put $200 million or GBP200 million of equity in, the equity's gone. They can't service the debt. The building is going to be sold, probably, again by HSHB and expectations are it's going to go for 6.5% or 7.5% going in return.</p><p>So at the moment, I would say that the relative value, dollars per square foot, replacement costs sort of thinking for at least some of the sovereign wealth funds, has been replaced by a current return, opportunistic view of the world that looks at things and says, things are probably going to get worse before they get better. So we're going to be patient as well.</p><p>It doesn't mean for the right transaction they wouldn't do something. In fact, we were actually talking about a building in Washington DC that they were interested in pursuing and we -- whether or not we would be willing to partner with them, which had a yield that was similar to what we were -- I was just describing.</p><p>But they are -- I would say they are certainly, based upon what has occurred with their investments in the US investments in particular for the financial services companies, are certainly not as aggressively looking to deploy capital as they might have been a year ago.</p><p>But they are -- they have clearly got a commitment to diversify their asset bases and put money into real estate and putting money into real estate in the United States over the next period of time. I don't know if that next period of time is six months or 12 months or 18 months.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great. I think I will turn the program over to Mike Walsh, who's going to talk a little bit about development.</p><p>MIKE WALSH, SVP - FINANCE, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Hello everyone. In our next segment, the panelists up here will walk through development, our history, some of the current projects that we have underway, the impact of those projects on NOI. Mitch Norville, our Chief Operating Officer, will go through our development process. And in addition, we'll talk about, in the various markets, where we see replacements costs.</p><p>And then we'll hear from our on-the-ground experts. And I think we're sitting a little out of order for the presentation, but [Rob Silpey] will go through 250 West 55th Street. He's our on-the-ground expert and Head of Development in New York City. Peter Johnson, who is our Regional Manager in Washington DC will walk through Reston Town Center. And Mike Cantalupa, who's the Head of Development here in Boston will walk through our green initiatives.</p><p>Development has always been, as you heard Mort, as you heard Doug, if you grab any member of management, it's always been part of Boston Properties' growth strategy. As you can see from the slide, since our IPO, we've developed about $2.9 billion worth of products.</p><p>And those are first class, iconic, trophy, you can pick the adjectives, but they are the best buildings in those markets. They're building such as 111 Huntington Avenue here in Boston. The two towers in Times Square, 5 Times Square and Times Square Tower. 901 New York Avenue in Washington DC. And 2.5 million square feet in Reston Town Center.</p><p>And what we found over the 38 years that we've been developers is that development projects will yield a much greater return on our invested equity than comparably located and designed acquisitions. And in addition, they're typically state-of-the-art, and we know ours are, are state-of-the-art assets, which require less investment as far as near-term capital over the first five to 10 years of their existence.</p><p>And of the 10.7 million square feet that we've developed since our IPO, we still own about 8.6 million square feet. And today, those projects are yielding 11.5% on a cash-on-cash basis and I think that just proves our statement.</p><p>One additional item that I noticed when we were looking at this is that in Midtown Manhattan, we developed two office towers, 5 Times Square and Times Square Tower for a total project cost of $1.19 billion. Well, in the spring of 2000 -- actually February of 2007, we sold 5 Times Square for $1.28 billion, so at the end of the day, I understand that we own Times Square Tower basically at no cost.</p><p>Our current development pipeline consists of about 10 projects, with a total cost, as I mentioned, of $2.44 billion. And of the $2.44 billion, we either have funded with equity, funded with debt or funded with existing construction facility commitments, about $1.1 billion of that.</p><p>We'll fund the remaining $1.3 billion with a combination of construction financing, Mike talked about Russia Wharf and 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue, where we'll be in the market for construction financing. Secured financing on existing unencumbered assets, remember that we sold $4.3 billion of assets over the last several years and we've unencumbered our balance sheet over that time frame. And with our $1 billion line of credit.</p><p>And before I go into a few of these projects, and you're going to meet with some of the project managers later on today, I just want to talk about what we include in project costs because I think we're a little bit different.</p><p>We include typical hard costs, soft costs, tenant improvement, leasing commission. We also include operating costs during the lease-up phase of the project and real estate taxes. But during the entire phase, the entire development process, we include a real return on our equity. I think that differentiates us a little bit.</p><p>77 CityPoint, you'll actually in -- on the bus tours today, we'll head out to our CityPoint development and you'll meet [Rich Monopoly], who's the project manager. This project has the distinction of being the first lead pre-certified project in Waltham, Massachusetts. So we're excited about that. It's 100% leased. The first tenants took occupancy earlier this year and in December, it will be 100% occupied.</p><p>South of Market, there's two phases, and I'll hold off on that and let Peter explain a little bit more. Annapolis Junction is a 50% joint venture that we have with a local developer. It's a highly secured facility. It's basically plug-and-play for government contractors, who, because of the BRAC requirements, will be forced to move off the base, which is Fort Meade, directly adjacent, and move into this space.</p><p>You'll see -- notice the high per unit cost and I can tell you that the rents are commensurate with that. We just received our accreditation from the government agencies this week, so we expect to be leasing that up in the near future.</p><p>Wisconsin Place is a 1.1 million square foot mixed use development in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Our part in this project is to be the development manager. I think since 2005 we've been development manager for the infrastructure, which the garage where atop will sit an office product, which we're a two-thirds owner in. It's 55% preleased and we're in active discussions for the remainder of that space.</p><p>701 Carnegie Center is a build-to-suit for Princeton University down in our Carnegie Center project. 250 West 55th Avenue is our latest office tower in New York City. It's 22% leased to the law firm of [Gibbs and Dunn] and, as Mort said, we're in active discussions with tenants for the remainder of the space and Rob Silpey will go into more details on that in a few minutes.</p><p>Russia Wharf, or 280 Congress Street, which is directly adjacent to us, is 815,000 square foot mixed use project where we're pleased to say that we've leased 82% of the office space to Wellington Management, which will help us in our financing.</p><p>Wellington's taking the ninth floor, which is the first floor of office space, and floors 14 to 31. So we'll have 100,000 square feet on floors 10 through 13 with fantastic views in all directions.</p><p>There is a residential component to this as well, a little over 200,000 square feet. And we'll develop the core and shell and look to either sell or partner with a residential developer. And Jeff Lowenberg, our project manager, will be meeting many of you across the way after lunch, where we have a great view of the site and several boards. And Jeff will go through the project in more detail. And last, but certainly not least, is 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue. Or as my good friend, Ray Ritchey says, the best damn site in Washington DC.</p><p>This project is about 430,000 square feet of office, 72,000 square feet of retail and 330,000 square feet of residential. And similar to Russia Wharf, we'll develop the core and shell of the residential component and look to either partner or sell the residential. The project's not scheduled for delivery until 2011 to 2012 and we're already in active discussions with triple net rents in the $55 to $65 range.</p><p>I want to take a moment and take our development pipeline into perspective because $2.44 billion in this environment seems rather large. Back in 2001, we had $1.9 billion underway and we were a company to about a total market cap of $8.2 billion, so that represents about 23%. Today the $2.44 billion, based on our company's size, is only 12%. So as a percentage of the company, it's not as large an endeavor. And, by the way, that 65% that's in the -- on this slide for 2001 included a tenant by the name of Arthur Anderson.</p><p>After Arthur Anderson had their issues, that space was given back to us. It went back down to 53% and we were left with a 1.2 million square foot tower in Midtown Manhattan, entirely unencumbered by leases, being delivered into a difficult economic environment.</p><p>Well I think there's lessons to be learned there. We believed in the real estate that well designed, well located, well managed product will do well even in bad times. And our leasing team, within six months of completion of the project, we were 85% leased and shortly thereafter we approached 95% to 100%. And our returns in this project were basically in line with our underwriting.</p><p>As Doug and Mike have said on various earnings calls, we expect to yield about a 7.5% to 8% cash-on-cash yield on our CBD projects and somewhere between 8% and 11%. And you could throw all of that into a spreadsheet, you come up with an average of about 8% cash-on-cash return for our development projects.</p><p>If you take that with $2.4 billion and subtract out cost of debt of about 6.5%, that means that in -- by the completion of this, we'll deliver about $36 million of cash NOI to the bottom line. Add in about 100 basis points for straight-line rent and add $60 million of incremental FFO generated just from 12% of our portfolio.</p><p>In addition to the project underway, we either have on our balance sheet or under control about 12 million square feet of additional development. Now going back to the slide that we started with, with the $2.44 billion, 75% of those projects came from the shadow development pipeline. So it's incredibly important that we have, on our balance sheet or under control, land which is the raw material to help us grow.</p><p>And these future sites are such as 10 and 20 CityPoint, and we'll talk more about that when we go out to Waltham today, Weston Corporate Center out in Weston, Massachusetts, projects such as 888 Wilson Street, which Bryan Koop spoke about.</p><p>So while we don't expect to go forward on these projects on a speculative basis, we feel that we're well positioned to complete the projects that we have underway, to lease those projects and to actively look for new projects with the land base that we have, which will fuel Boston Properties' future growth. With that, I turn it over to Mitch.</p><p>MITCH NORVILLE, EVP, COO, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. I've been asked to do a couple of things. One, we're going to share some cost information, there goes my mike, I'm going to change the slide. There you go. Too far. We're going to share a little bit of cost information on our projects with you and talk a little bit about that and probably leave most of the discussion for the end of the period, if you have any questions.</p><p>And I'm going to talk a little bit about our development process, kind of our disciplined approach, and tie it into a few comments that Doug and Mort made earlier today. So could we go to the construction costs slide, at the risk that we've gone too far. No, you've got to go backwards. There you go. Or I guess we're missing that slide.</p><p>No, it was the first slide. All right. You have it in your book. So let's talk about construction costs. Essentially what we've done is we've created a chart, which we can't seem to find on the slide show, that's okay. I've got a copy here. And you guys have it in front of you, hopefully.</p><p>But what we've tried to do is give you an idea of what our construction cost basis is in each of our regions by the various product types that we develop. And we're actively either in pre-development or actually in development in the moment. As you look through the chart, you'll see CBD costs, revenue costs and so on.</p><p>We've kind of broken out hard and soft costs, which what we're calling base construction costs, from the TIs and leasing commissions, which kind of vary by region and by transaction type as well. Please note that these costs do not include land or parking costs. And land and parking are just too big of variables to kind of stick into a chart like this and have any real meaning.</p><p>Just for instance, on parking, in a suburban project, we typically have, the kind we're doing, high rise suburban projects. We typically have structured parking. The cost of a suburban parking space can vary anywhere from 12,000, 15,000 a space to 25,000 a space, depending on the site constraints, the size of the parking facility and the method of construction. So we didn't think that giving you any information, based on how we're doing our various projects, would actually give you a number that had any real basis.</p><p>Again, this is a snapshot. It's kind of based on what we have in progress and what we have planned to go forward in the next two or three years. Again, I'd like to leave discussion for this to the end, so I'm going leave this here.</p><p>We're going to move on to the next slide, which I'll try again. Yes. Here we go. We're backing up. And we're going to talk a little bit about our disciplined approach and process to development. Essentially development is a series of stages or activities that I'm going to run through here in a second, but I want to tie into a couple of things I said earlier before we get started.</p><p>Mort mentioned earlier on that a few years back, we decided to become sellers of real estate. At about the same time, we really ramped up our development pipeline and unfortunately for us, we were actively already in predevelopment in lots of projects and something we had done at the last downturn to keep things going. Because if you're not in pre-development, if you're not actually out there doing some of the stuff we're going to talk about now, you can't just turn the switch on, become developers. You kind of have to be in this process year in and year out.</p><p>And because we're in the process year in and year out, you have to have a very disciplined approach. You have to be able to use your underwriting abilities, so that even when the market is doing what it's doing right now, kind of turning in the other direction a little bit. And like it did with, as Mike just mentioned, at Anderson in New York, that you can still be successful. That you can still be a successful developer.</p><p>We've never -- Doug said earlier, we've never timed the market from a standpoint of we're just trying to work in the hot times and not produce in the slow times. So again, as that as a backdrop, let's kind of move into the various stages of the process.</p><p>Obviously the first stage of development is kind of conceptualization of what we're trying to do. And in this period, we're managing against risk and we're trying to manage against, at this particular phase, all development risk. So everything you've heard earlier about financing, design and stuff we're going to talk about, and basically the only thing we can rely on during the conceptual phase is our experience.</p><p>And I think as you go through the case studies you're going to hear behind me, you're going to see that we have a very deep, a very experienced development team, which allows us to have some faith and courage at this stage of the game to either go out and buy property or to actually start a development when there's spec conditions.</p><p>So moving on to the next phase, it's kind of entitlements. And the risk we're kind of managing against in entitlements are zoning risks. And that's density and use as well as site plans, permits and approvals. And all these risks tie into our ability to actually pick a building size, pick a building type, be able to do something we think is going to be successful in the market and convince jurisdictions that we're doing the right thing.</p><p>How do we manage these risks? Well basically it's our knowledge of the process, it's our relationships with the various authorities that we've built over time. These relationships with authorities don't happen over night. It takes many projects, making our commitments to authorities and delivering on our commitments that allows us to move projects through this process, the entitlement process, and have something we can actually go forward with and be successful with.</p><p>Kind of the next phase is design. And in design, we're managing -- obviously we're managing through a cost basis. So we want to make sure that we draw something that meets the market, has the quality we're looking for, can be delivered in a time basis we're trying to deliver it in, but at the same time, is at a cost we think meets the market and what we can do on the rent side.</p><p>Again, how do we manage design? We have a very established process, a very team approach to design, which involves all aspects of our company. We have our leasing guys involved, our property management people involved, we have our construction people involved. We just -- we don't have development cowboys out there running around, designing buildings and turning it over to our other groups and saying, \"Hey, make this a success.\"</p><p>We approach it from a very team involved approach and also we have very established relationships with our consultants, which allows us to get sometimes that extra oomph on our projects, whether it be a time commitment or a little better design. We know the people to pick. We know the best design people at a particular firm.</p><p>We know the best people to hire from a project perspective that are going to deliver drawings to us that are 100% correct. So we can buy them at a better price. Again, being in the marketplace, knowing those people and knowing those consultants gives us a bit of an advantage that we try to take advantage of as we go through the design process.</p><p>Obviously overlapping with the design is the construction process. Again, it costs quality and time. And how do you manage against those risks? Again, our contracting process varies from project to project. On a large New York project, we're probably going to do a GMP. We're going to involve the contractor from day one, he's going to be a part of our team. He's going to provide us information. We're going to get volume from a general contractor and from the sub-markets as we design our buildings and so that we've got to build our building where we're going to hit our budgets.</p><p>On a stand alone suburban building, like Princeton, let's take the Princeton Building at Carnegie Center, we can design that building into a shorter time frame. Our construction process is more defined. We're probably going to go out to bid. And we're going to bid to GCs. And we think we can get the best price.</p><p>We're going to work with two or three GCs we're very comfortable with and we're going to try to get the best price. So what I'm trying to get through is that we're going to match the contracting process to the project. And we're going to do it based upon our knowledge of what's going on in the market, are there any constraints that we have to work around on the contracting side and how do we get the best price and the best quality.</p><p>Again, it -- our construction process is, again, a team involvement. And that kind of runs through the whole process here for us on the development side and that it's not just our construction guys, our project manager guys are very involved.</p><p>Again, our property management guys are very involved, to make sure that we design and build the project that works for us from a cost standpoint, from an operating standpoint, and kind of meets the leasing market from a layout standpoint and from a does it have the kind of -- we call it the gee whiz factor. Does it catch a client's attention? Does it have the -- is the money spent in a way that we create value from a tenant's perspective so that their front door creates the image?</p><p>You heard Bryan talk a little earlier about the lobby at the Pru Center. Does it convey the right image for the kinds of tenants we want to bring in? Those are all things that are built into the development process as well as how we manage our existing assets.</p><p>Finally, on the construction side, we have established contractor relationships. Again, it allows us to pick the best people that work for those contractors to do our projects. It allows us to develop relationships with those people from project to project. So each project [isn't] a different activity for us. It's not another learning curve that we know people, they know how we work, they know how we want to get things done, we're able to, lots of times, save time and save money because of those relationships.</p><p>Okay. Leasing. Again, you're going to hear our leasing team talk a little bit about demand and supply kinds of things and terms. And leasing people are very important to our development process. Obviously pre-leasing, you heard a lot about pre-leasing earlier today. I think Mike just told you we're about 50% pre-leased with the stuff we have under active development today and that's been a tenure of our company for 30, 40 years.</p><p>We've never been a company that didn't stress pre-leasing. Even in good times, we stress pre-leasing. We don't just go out and build buildings because the market's better. We still stress pre-leasing. That's how you manage when the market turns and if things don't go your way necessarily.</p><p>And the leasing team is a huge part of that process. That's their job. In setting terms, again, we look to our leasing guys to help us set the terms, to create flexibility in our development projects so that we're managing the downside. You don't have to manage the upside. The upside's going to come too. You have to manage the downside.</p><p>So are we getting into development projects where based on the terms we're going out and the terms do deteriorate on us a little bit, are we still going to have a pretty good development at the end of the day? Not a catastrophe kind of thing.</p><p>Again, if you're building, as Doug said, iconic assets that people want to be in, even when the things turn down, terms get worse, vacancy grows, people are going to be in your assets. People still have to renew leases, they have to move, businesses still have to operate. So as long as we're in the marketplace at the right place, with our developments, we can still be overall successful.</p><p>Again, on the leasing side, we use pre-leasing return thresholds to make sure we have -- we manage our downside and we use our broker relationships to make sure we get in front of tenants that might not consider us. They might not consider us. They might think we're too expensive. They might think we're in the wrong part of town. The essential is a great idea of hey, have you guys really thought about what you can do if you come to one of our buildings? And we use those relationships to get in front of tenants to promote our developments as well.</p><p>Okay, financing, Mike just spent a long time talking about financing so I'm not going to beat this one. Just simply say that, again, our ability to get capital, our ability to control cost is a huge, huge, huge, especially in these kind of times, advantage for us in our development pipeline.</p><p>It also helps in our ability to make commitments to tenants. If you think about a tenant, and we're negotiating with tenants, in New York and Washington who are basically looking at buildings that have just started, you know we're 10, 20, 30 feet down in the ground and these tenants are looking at us and saying, \"Geez, can Boston Properties complete, can they finish?</p><p>Are we willing to, to put our marbles in their basket and count on them to get to where we need to be?\" Again, we're -- our financing, our ability to get money when we need to get money is a big part of that process to us, being successful again, on the development side.</p><p>Finally, just closing out the process discussion, from a risk point-of-view, is we spent a lot in our developments from the very beginning making sure that we design in and we build in ways to control cost, both from a staffing standpoint and our operating cost standpoint on our projects. Again, it's a team effort, it starts with our property managers, it plays to our leasing guys as well and also our construction and development guys.</p><p>So that's what we manage in the development process. I want to just, next slide I'm going to talk about, is a quick -- Peter's going to spend a lot more time talking about this, as he does the top of the market case study, is how we structure ourselves regionally to have this team approach that I just talked about. You'll see here kind of a wheel we use in presentations that shows the project management at the center of the wheel.</p><p>And it's the project manager's job to make sure that the expertise we need from the various departments whether it's leasing, construction, legal, corporate services, so on, that those guys are involved in the project when they need to be, that he brings to their attention, when we need their input, when they should be involved and how they should participate.</p><p>Because they have their own things their doing on a daily basis., hey aren't involved with the 10 or 15 or 20 development projects we have going on. So it's the project manager's responsibility to make sure that information flows and that it's shared amongst the various groups.</p><p>With that I'm going to turn it over to the next three guys who are actually, I think, going to tie in to some of these risk factors and talk about our development process in 3K space. Rob, it's up to you.</p><p>ROBERT SELSAM: Okay, great. Thanks, Mitch, it's a -- thank you, thank you.. Some of you are familiar with our latest development in New York City, 250 West 55th Street. I would like to speak for a few minutes about the predevelopment period of the property's development cycle on that project, but before I do I thought I'd give you a little bit of background and overview of the project.</p><p>250 West 55th Street is designed in the tradition of great modernist architecture. It offers 24,000 square foot floor plates, efficient layout, 10-foot high, clear finished ceiling heights and have been pre-certified LEED Gold by the US Green Building Council. It is currently under construction and is scheduled for completion in early 2011.</p><p>Located on 8th Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets, 250 West 55th gives us the opportunity to capitalize on an emerging office district on Midtown's west side. Anchored on the north by Time Warner Center and 59th Street and on the south by the new headquarters for the New York Times at 41st Street, there is a great deal of development underway on 8th Avenue today and much more planned for the future.</p><p>This is a view of the corner of 55th and 8th looking south down 8th Avenue and to the east across 55th Street. This is the development site as it stood not too long ago. Since this picture was taken all of the buildings you see there in the foreground have been demolished.</p><p>The predevelopment story on 55th Street is actually interesting. And it demonstrates the many challenges that we face as developers in New York City, not only in identifying opportunities for assemblage and development but, also, the multidisciplinary expertise that is required to plan and to zone and to design and to permit a large scale commercial development in New York City.</p><p>The 55th Street assemblage included 12 lots that together total a footprint of approximately 46,000 feet. With disparate ownership of those lots, the challenge was to tie up the entire site which required negotiating, separately but simultaneously, deals with three different owners.</p><p>The opportunity here was to create value by successfully controlling the entire site as the 46,000 square foot whole was clearly more valuable than the sum of its parts. It's also interesting to note, on this slide, that the site is actually situated across five separate zoning districts which required some very careful analysis with regard to the maximum floor area that could be built on the site and the bulk and massing of the building that we would ultimately design.</p><p>In addition, on 55th Street, the assemblage included the acquisition of theatre development rights. Theatre development rights are excess or unused air rights that are owned by listed theatres in Manhattan Theatre Subdistrict.</p><p>We were able to acquire 157,000 square feet of these unused air rights and transfer them from theaters on 44th Street within the Theatre Subdistrict up to our site on 55th Street. This allowed us to build a bigger building but also, very importantly, allowed us to average down our land costs and improve the economics of the deal. It's important to note that, in order to do this, this did require the approval of City Planning which we'll talk about on a subsequent slide.</p><p>We originally became involved in 250 West 55th Street as a joint venture with a local developer and we were planning an 80 story tower with luxury condominiums above a four or five star hotel. But as is often the case, in the development business, in 2006 we were seeing some changes in the market.</p><p>What we were seeing was a strengthening office market and what some of us believed to be the beginning of a weakening residential market which led us to reevaluate what was the highest and best use for the development of this site. With this in mind we made the decision to proceed with an office building which we all knew would be successful as the footprint of this site and the location of this site was really excellent for office development.</p><p>It's generally perceived that New York City is a difficult place to do business and certainly it is a difficult place to develop. What is not understood with regard to zoning is that there's actually a very well developed zoning resolution in the City of New York which provides as a right development on each site in New York. The key, however, is knowing how to evaluate the zoning of any given site and effectively navigate the review and approval process with New York City's Department of City Planning, should approvals be required.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, in this case, approvals were required to allow us to utilize the Theatre development rights that we wanted to transfer from the theatres on 44th Street up to our site on 55th Street. This required approval of three separate actions by City Planning. One was approval by certification of a portion of the Theatre development rights.</p><p>As it turns out there were really two different types of Theatre development rights on this site. There was certification Theatre development rights and authorization development rights, each of which required the approval of City Planning.</p><p>The third action that required approval of City Planning was the transfer floor area from one zoning district to another. As you recall, from a previous slide, there are five zoning districts on the site and we wanted to be able to build our building a certain place on the site which required us to transfer certain air rights that were generated in one district, in another district.</p><p>During the review process it is to be expected that City Planning will express certain opinions on certain design related matters. And in this case what they chose to focus on was pedestrian circulation and street wall.</p><p>Pedestrian circulation is pretty much what it sounds like. What City Planning was interested in doing was making it easier for the pedestrian traffic to walk around the block. In this case what that really amounted to was setting the building back from the property line.</p><p>On the slide here, the dotted line that you see around the site is actually the property line and you can see that the building is actually set back both on 55th Street and on 8th Avenue, the effect being widening the sidewalk and making it easier for people to walk around.</p><p>With regard to street wall, what you see on this slide was the original design of the building which provided for a podium which was 50 feet high. City Planning believed that a higher street wall was appropriate here, to put it into context with its view of the commercial district that was emerging here.</p><p>Of course that is subject to some debate and opinion but when you're negotiating with City Planning you usually need to give them what they want or some of what they want. At the end of the day, after a negotiation, we ended up with a 57-foot-high street wall on the podium, they had wanted 65 feet.</p><p>The essence of what we do better, we believe, than anyone else is really building design. And that not only means what you see from the outside but what's happening on the inside. And we took a very careful approach to designing this building inside out. We know the planning dimensions of many of our tenants. We know the dimensions of partner offices, associate offices, cubicles, corridors and with that in mind were able to design a floor which would optimize the efficiency of the planning for our tenants.</p><p>What you see here is dimensions 43 feet, three inches, 35 feet, four inches are really not random numbers. These were all lease spans and dimensions that were created knowing the building blocks of how our tenants would be planning the space. What you see on this slide is a very typical plan for a law firm. And as I said, we really did go to great lengths to optimize the efficiency of this floor.</p><p>This brings us to vacant possession and demolition. And what I'd like to focus on here, on this slide, is Lot 103 which you see here in a dark grey shaded area. As you know, when we acquired the site, there were buildings on the site and Lot 103 was a small residential building with five residential tenants. So one of our challenges was to get vacant possession of their apartments, i.e. buy them out of their leases. The residential tenants in New York City are afforded great rights and it is sometimes difficult, very difficult, to get residential tenants to move.</p><p>So we embarked on an effort to negotiate a buyout with each and every one of thee tenants. Not knowing whether or not we would be successful. The reason that I mention that is the area shaded in red on this slide is actually the fore plate of our tower.</p><p>And when we were designing and planning the building, not knowing whether or not we would be able to add Lot 103 to the footprint of the tower, it required that we design a building that could proceed without actually getting vacant possession of all the apartments in Lot 103.</p><p>I'm happy to report that we were actually successful in buying out all the tenants and Lot 103 has since been demolished and has been incorporated into the footprint of the building. But not the footprint of the tower, the footprint of the podium, the tower is as shown on this slide. And with that I would like to hand the show over to Peter.</p><p>PETER JOHNSTON, SVP, REGIONAL MANAGER, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Thanks Rob. Good morning, still, I believe. What I'm going to do is lead you through a very quick case study of Reston Town Center. And really focus principally on our team approach to development and how we apply in executing a development deal.</p><p>And really the issue is, if you look at this, you can see One and Two Freedom Square, in the center, the upper part of the photograph, is how do you get from that to this? And this photo is only about five or six months old.</p><p>And so in thinking about that process and how the team approach is applied at Boston Properties and I'll just give you a few quick facts and figures on this, won't spend a lot of time on it, but it's two, 10-story developments, one six story. And one of the important things, this was the largest speculative development being conducted in the region.</p><p>And we haven't really been able to ascertain whether there's been a larger spec development really ever executed in the Washington region ever. But given the dynamics of this market, given the quality of what we've seen happen in the town center already, we were comfortable proceeding with it, 67 of office, 83.5 of retail.</p><p>The design commenced in December of '04, we commenced construction in February of '06, delivered it in February of this year. The original project budget, that you see there, $113 million, and our current lease up of 83.6 and 86% of the retail.</p><p>And while clearly, if you're familiar with the Dulles Toll Route core, and we describe the difference in how this is really an anomaly in the market unto itself, while traffic in that area has slowed, we continue to enjoy traffic through this complex to round out the leasing of the project. It's really for the very reasons that Doug enumerated, which is that this is not the typical office development, it's a special place and the market recognizes that.</p><p>So everyone understands, based on past history and this morning's discussion, that were about really developing and owning the best real estate. But what I want to spend a few minutes on is, what the key to this is, our organizational structure. And that structure is specifically designed, and it's really been in place for the history of the company, to support that strategic goal with regard to development.</p><p>And the foundation of that is this slide here which is an amplification of what Mitch showed during his presentation. And one thing I'd like you to focus on as you look at this is I've taken out of this particular slide the external focus, because I wanted to focus on the internal and the team approach piece as it relates to the Boston Properties.</p><p>In our region, for this development, and it was a large one, three buildings, 650,000 feet, there are 17 people on that slide. The two names you see in the lower left, under Corporate Services, Mike LaBelle and Janet Breen running Risk Management are from the corporate office but that everybody else on there is located in Washington, be they the department heads, he actual operational folks who are executing the development so that the level of involvement and the care and feeding of these projects runs throughout the organization.</p><p>And with that I want to talk about these bullet items. You've heard about the deep bench, but that slide if you think about that wheel, really is how do we translate that into differentiating Boston Properties in our execution of the project?</p><p>The first bullet here, team approach to leveraging with functional expertise, its going department--by-department-by-department so when we develop the leasing plan it's talking to Ray, 'it's talking to [Jon Kaylor], it's bringing the staff member there who's going to be doing it to help develop that plan, all throughout the organization by discipline. So we're getting the benefit of that information, maximizing their involvement.</p><p>By way of example, design, when we do iterations of these drawings, Rob talked about the care and how we look at what we put a footprint together from conceptual design to schematic to DD those drawing set on the table at each iteration. And everybody from Ray to myself on through the project team comes by with a different colored pen and marks those drawing comments up. At the end of that process we all sit in a room together and we vet that to come up with the best possible building that we can.</p><p>Team staffing by department heads and regional management. Myself and the department head sits down, whose going to execute this development, who's the right person? We use that process to also cross train our people. In our region, in particular, but even in some of our others, we're in suburban Maryland, we're in Northern Virginia and we're in DC.</p><p>Well the guy who does the development deal in DC he may work next on one in Virginia because we want that cross pollination. We want to understand the types of entitlements, that Rob described, that we have to go through as well in our region so that we can apply that and have a better rounded team for the future developments we have to execute.</p><p>Active communication within the team dynamic, as you'd expect there's normal meetings and whether it be one-on-one casually throughout the office, but the regular team meetings that we have, but it's other things that go on as well. When do a lease transaction Jon, one of his staff is working on that development, Frank Hyre who runs Northern Virginia, he comes in.</p><p>We want to talk about the credit of that tenant we go to Boston to Mike LaBelle's group and they do an underwriting who that is. So as were putting that income in place it's an in depth analysis. Where's the income coming from, what's the stability of that firm?</p><p>Other elements of other communication within it is our proprietary IS applications, that allow management, and that's the people working in the projects, myself as the Regional Manager, all the way up to Doug to Mike to Mitch through our development database to see in real time what's going on with that project, when leases get executed, when we get approvals, et cetera.</p><p>The budget and schedule buy-in, and I really take the two last bullets on this slide together, but the team members when we -- you think of that wheel and the project managers going out and going and getting that. What's the leasing plan, testing the assumptions as it relates to the income that we're going to put in place on that budget?</p><p>Or the design schedule and working with our architectural team and all of those features, each individual who provides that input, they're responsible for that, they own it, it's theirs. While the project manager is responsible for the overall and seeing, as Mitch said, that we're pulling those parts and pieces and making sure those various people are executing it, everybody owns what they provide to this going on.</p><p>And it allows us, all the way up to the chain, so that when that original budget and schedule is produced it's got the operational folks who are going to execute its input, it's got regional management's input and its got the senior executive's management input as well.</p><p>So to apply this I'm going to use one example of the literally dozens that go through a given development deal. And it was a skin system analysis that we had to go through while we were developing this project.</p><p>And I hope this will help illustrate how our team approach adds value to this process and helps mitigate some of the development risks inherent in our business. When you build a building obviously various components, there's the excavations, there's the structure, there's the mechanical systems, there's a skin.</p><p>Well, part of the challenge in Reston, if you thought back to that slide, we had built two taller buildings, 16 and 18 stories, and the zoning envelope here only allowed us to build to 10 stories. Well, if you think about the evolution of a town like a Reston, and that urban environment we're creating within the suburban envelope, you wouldn't normally just build the tallest buildings first and then build a shorter building.</p><p>So that and the evolution of the architectural forms that had taken place in Phase I which was done by [RTK] (inaudible) working with SmithGroup was, how do you take what had been more midrise, let's say brick buildings, and show something to fill that hole as it would have evolved to the taller buildings I just described.</p><p>And it occurred to us that brick was the perfect material for that. And we wanted -- we thought that the right form to show the buildings in an evolution from that prior mercantile type design that had been done, potentially being viewed as older warehouses that, maybe had been renovated, clearly brick was the right material.</p><p>But that presented problems for us. If you -- you might recall when we were doing this it was back in the '04 timeframe, well we had unprecedented residential construction going on in our market at that time. So what does that do? It puts tremendous pressure on the schedule for obtaining brick and masons and also on the cost because all the oxygen's been sucked up, where do you go and find it?</p><p>And the other thing is when you build a brick building its, in terms of water proofing details, a lot of what gets done in our market and around, it's not curtain wall, which you can kind of tell where the leaks are coming from or precast, which is very easy to assemble and control that process of manufacturing.</p><p>Brick is done typically with cavity wall construction it's much harder for quality control. And the other element of these buildings was knowing we wanted to show a renovated look to these buildings we had curtain wall elements and how do those things intersect.</p><p>So we had to deal with these issues and in going forward we really had a couple of iterations of design we went through before we came to the conclusion, through the architects' strong suggestion, that we look into doing brick on precast as a solution to this. The challenge for us was, we'd seen a few of these buildings done, and they weren't very attractive. They'd been historically done on garages just as adding a veneer to try and make them look different.</p><p>So the challenge for the architectural team was, could we do this, given the pedestrian urban scale of the Town Center, where you could walk right up to these buildings and really experience them, and a lot of it is about the street activity and the amenity base we created there.</p><p>So we challenged our project construction and property management team, the A&amp;E team and the prospective general and subcontractors, who might be actually executing this, to go out, to survey existing projects and come up with alternate design schemes that we might be able to find acceptable in terms of quality. And achieve the best balance for the esthetic, the cost and the constructability we were looking for.</p><p>In fact sent the team, the architect, the contractors and our folks down to, I think as far away as Florida, looking at various buildings. The solution was brick on precast that we ended up with. And you can see a panel here of how we actually assembled this, coming out of the yard where it's laid up, the brick goes into a mold. The concrete is poured behind it. You can see the interval sill right there and the finish quality is exceptional.</p><p>It provided the desired appearance in the finished product. We were able not only to meet the schedule but we solved the problem with dealing with the masons and the available brick. These aren't full size brick, you can see the actual center dimension to this, so the availability of the product was there. And the quality control was there because this is being done in the yard it's not being done as you're scaffolding the building.</p><p>And as far as the budget was concerned by building the three buildings at one time you got an economy of scale you otherwise would not, when you saw that larger picture of the whole complex the amount of these panels that we were buying helping to drop our cost down.</p><p>And then, as importantly, as I mentioned earlier, simplifying the water proofing details. If you think about this view here in this panel you really take when you erect it on the structure of the building two of these panels is butting up against one another and a caulk joint going in there. So in terms of waterproofing details it's about the simplest you could possibly have. It's readily maintainable, it's traceable if something happens. And over time as you go to manage the building you end up with a product that you can go in over its life cycle and replace when necessary.</p><p>And, we think, clearly given the success of the complex and the leasing it's been enormously successful and was a really good, I think, illustration of what the team approach provided. And that happens literally dozens and dozens of time throughout the development of one of these buildings. And with that I'll turn it over to Mike.</p><p>MIKE CANTALUPA, SVP - DEVELOPMENT, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Thanks Peter. I'll actually say good afternoon because I think we just slid past noon time. I've been asked to talk a little bit about our approach to green building. Some may see this as the biggest social movement of our times and whether you believe that or not, clearly with both Presidential candidates supporting additional greenhouse gas regulations and with green building policies and programs across the country now in 31 States, 159 municipalities and 12 Federal agencies, this is a movement that's here to stay.</p><p>So we thought it important to give you our thoughts on the green movement and how our strategy has developed over the last few years. I'll wrap up with a few points on our 77 4th Avenue building that Mike talked about.</p><p>I think you'll agree that, with the presentations here, we tend to be very thoughtful about our business. And so as we sat back and analyzed this particular issue we really thought about it in three ways. What exactly is the impact of real estate on the environment, i.e. what's the problem? What does our customer want as a result? And what are the benefits of being green? How can we package that?</p><p>This slide shows that we are large consumers and significant producers. As you can see we're big consumers of energy and electricity and water and from an output standpoint and carbon dioxide and waste. So in concluding here, and there are actually been very -- several studies that showed us, real estate has actually a larger impact on the environment than the automobile industry.</p><p>So from a customer standpoint let me hit you with a few reference points. There's a project out there called the Carbon Disclosure Project. This year 321 of the S&amp;P 500 actually responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project so that's pretty interesting in and of itself.</p><p>But 102 of those respondents have established greenhouse gas policies. About 40% of them view building green as very important and 43% of them see green activities and green building specifically as a part of their company's growth strategy. So that's kind of interesting. And then finally and most importantly 63% of CEOs view green building as a market differentiator.</p><p>From our day-to-day experience, more recently, we're seeing a lot more in RFPs. As little as four years ago this was not even on the radar screen. We built a building in Cambridge for the Rhode Institute did not even come up as a topic of discussion in responding to the RFP and concluding the deal.</p><p>But with the Wellington deal with the building, you'll see later on this afternoon, that was an absolute requirement. We had to deliver a building of Silver or better. And we're working on a number of major requirements right now which absolute requirement so, conclusion on this point, it's important to our customer so therefore it's important to us.</p><p>The way we look at this from a benefit perspective. We think of it as a tremendous opportunity for us to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. And then potentially to differentiate us in a way that really meets what the customers need is and actually market it and sell it. Let me talk a little bit about what that means. From a straight numbers perspective, if we build the buildings right, these are the kinds of impacts that we can have on the building in terms of energy reduction, carbon dioxide reduction and so forth.</p><p>But there's a bit of a softer side to this which is really people benefits. And the studies are getting better, I think, on this day-to-day but essentially with things like increases in natural light, greater temperature control, pumping higher volumes of fresher air into the building. There are a variety of studies out there that suggest that productivity gains happen anywhere from 2% to 18%.</p><p>Probably the most famous study out there is the Lockheed Martin study which reduced absenteeism by 15%. But there are lesser known studies out there. There's actually a study that, I believe, was sponsored by [Cosar].</p><p>A law firm called Oakley Thompson that's in Melbourne, Australia, they moved from a green -- a non green space to a green space within the same building, they found a 9% increase in their secretary typing speed and a 7% increase in their law firm billing ratio. So that's real money, obviously, now maybe there was better views in the space and they were generally happier but there was obviously green space.</p><p>Let me hit you with another number. A 1% productivity gain for an employee that makes $60,000 and has about $15,000 in additional benefits, so clearly nobody in this room was a part of that study, an average of 200 square foot of occupancy, that's about $3.75 a square foot in value to a tenant.</p><p>And, as you'll see in some of the studies that I'll show you later on, that really is more than some of the premiums that are actually even associated with building green. So as a result of this we're really incorporating this into our sales presentations and turning what, I think, some other firms may view as a liability, because of added regulation, into a marketing benefit.</p><p>Let me just give you a little bit of building green 101. There's several major standards out there. In the US there's LEED, there's a thing called Green Globe, there's a number of regional standards. In the medical industry there's a thing called Green Guide for Health Care and Europe has a number of green as well.</p><p>We're -- in the US what we're using is LEED, so Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. It's administered by the US Green Building Council and we like to view them as say the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for the industry. They have 17,000 member organizations and to date, as of May actually, they have certified about 190 million square feet of space.</p><p>This is the measuring system that they use. There's a variety of categories, many categories, more categories than are shown on this slide. For single family residentials, schools, retail, health care and so forth. These are the four categories that impact Boston Properties.</p><p>So there's LEED New Construction. And that's really a special circumstance, I think, it's really one we know not only who the tenant is but their design is progressing together with the base building design. We have on opportunity to certify it in the same process. More often than not we're doing what is called LEED core shell.</p><p>So the base building design is advancing in advance of the tenant design. That's exactly what's happening at Russia Wharf. And then the tenant design comes along and they develop their own standards if they want to develop to the same standards as we are for the building. They develop their own program. We're also using LEED Existing Building and I'll talk a little bit about that as it relates to our ongoing operations..</p><p>My understanding is there's a scorecard in your packet. This is a LEED core shell scorecard and essentially what happens is a scorecard for every project you're ranked based on sustainable sites and water efficiency, energy consumption and the like. And based on some of your site characteristics, which doesn't necessarily cost you money, and how much you want to invest in the project. You can achieve anywhere from certifiable level on up to more exotic levels, up to Gold and Platinum.</p><p>So we've thought about this as it relates to three areas of our business, new development, our existing buildings and our corporate operations, so leading by example. And I think generally what we've concluded is that we've been building and operating green for years and we haven't been -- we haven't called it that. Our base building spec is actually at very high level, so the premiums to go or actually even get the buildings certified are really not that much. And we've always been above operating efficiency.</p><p>From a new development standpoint generally speaking we're targeting LEED Silver or better for our buildings and the better is really on a case-by-case basis. So depending on the site characteristics we may decide to reach a little bit farther. As I've said, I think this is consistent with our long-term strategy of how we invest in our properties even on just a straight development side before green.</p><p>We never really thought about -- in the perspective of it's not that much more expensive to put great quality stones in your building and lobby and great mechanical systems because they pay themselves back over long haul. And the same kind of thing, I think, is consistent with our green approach. And as I said, we think our buildings, general building standard, specifications is at a very high level anyway. And the way we generally measure that is it's approximately at about a Silver.</p><p>So as it relates to the markets that we're in we're, as we told -- as we've said over the years, in high barrier to entry markets. We believe those markets are getting more and more challenging over time. We're finding that regulators are looking to limit the environmental impact as they redevelop their city. And as a result of that we also happen to be in some of the most progressive green building markets.</p><p>So the way that all comes together is we really believe that we have a core competency for executing complex development. So this green building, some may say, is an added complexity but we really believe that it moves into our wheel house and our skill set as a development team. And that other developers actually may view this as a burden we really don't. We're embracing it and promoting it.</p><p>I'm going to just give you a couple of data points here. This is a study that was put out by US GBC a few years ago and it is trying to identify the average green cost premium associated with their various categories of Silver, certified Silver on up to Gold and Platinum. And what I've done here is taken the numbers and applied them to a typical suburban office building in greater Boston.</p><p>And what -- identified what the estimated cost increases to develop on a hard cost basis and then translate that into a return premium. As you can see, I think, certainly at the lower levels the premium is very modest to develop green and then depending on how exotic we want to get we can move into the higher levels.</p><p>Bit of a case study for you. 77 CityPoint is a building that we just completed in January of this year. It was built on spec. As Mike said it was the first pre-certified Silver building on the marketplace but it was also the first speculative green office building on the marketplace. Prior to that point a lot of the building that had been certified under the US GB system had all been built either by a user or for a user.</p><p>This building actually went on spec and from our perspective the response is overwhelming. The building opened up 100% lease and at the time we were competing with two other speculative buildings that had much slower leasing prospects. And we think this was directly attributable to the success of the building.</p><p>Just a couple of numbers on this and this ties back to the point earlier of how our premium to build green is actually less than the competitions. So if you look at this cost premium, about $1.34 a square foot, not that much more than our base building cost but a 12% -- $0.12 a square foot rental premium we believe, to achieve the returns that we would have otherwise retained if we just developed on our base building spec. I think that compares to something on the order of a quarter that was in the prior slide.</p><p>So just to wrap up here on the new development program this is our, lets call it our current development program and the various LEED ratings that we're trying to achieve. I actually think that we haven't actually got a certified -- a certification yet. A lot of these are in process, 77 4th Avenue is just about ready to be completed. There's a fairly lengthy review and approval process that's associated with actually getting your certification from US GBC.</p><p>Just shifting gears here a little bit, on the existing buildings side we have a very active ongoing auditing and retrofit system but it's again, consistent with the approach in our development sites. It's consistent with the approach on our property management site. We're doing this every day. And so we've got a program here in Boston where were grading our existing buildings using LEED.</p><p>There's another program out there called Energy Star and we have something called the Sustainability Dashboard. And all we're doing is very simple. We're just monitoring our energy consumption, our waste production and our water consumption. And seeing how we're doing, if there are any low hanging fruit that's readily apparent that we can invest in the building and potentially earn some of these LEED certifications.</p><p>And we have a variety of other statistics if you want to hear them but probably maybe the most relevant here in the Pru Tower, actually the Prudential Center recently just moved from a steam-based chiller to a high-efficiency electric chiller as part of this program and we achieved, by our calculations, about a $1.7 million a year in savings a year for tenants in the Pru Tower and at 101 Huntington Avenue.</p><p>And then finally just on the program its called Leading By Example, Walking the Walk, we have really tried very hard within our own operations, particularly in the Boston region, to have our employees focused on what we're doing everyday from a consumption standpoint. So we have our employees focus on electricity, waste recycling and what our purchasing initiatives are.</p><p>And then we were excited very recently by Mayor Menino and his 2008 Green Business Award here in Boston for our environmental efforts but particularly on our education program for not only employees but also for our tenants. And again, my understanding is you have a copy of our Green Guide to Buildings that's in your package. So you can take a look at what were doing.</p><p>Finally, there's a phrase out there that's associated with this movement called the Triple Bottom Line and I guess the confluence of the environment, the social aspects of this movement with the economic aspects. And the way we flip that over and look at it on our business is clearly there's benefits to our environment to be building green.</p><p>So that's obviously a good thing. Our clients win from lower expenses if we're building our buildings right and whether you believe the studies or not, we really believe there are higher productivity measures that can be sold to the tenants. And we believe the shareholders win because the way we're marketing the buildings is true product differentiator should lead to faster absorption than the lower operating costs should lead to a higher NOIs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I don't know if anybody has any questions for these guys. We're going to grab lunch in a minute but if there's any questions out there? Hi, [Jordan].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I won't say that's a big question. It's a hard one to answer. I think that what we're seeing right now is probably not on a growth in cost at the moment. I'd say not dropping but stable. I think everybody's -- I think the construction industry is like anybody else, everybody's waiting for the -- see what happens how things shake out.</p><p>Sometimes our costs get driven by what's happening in markets outside and Peter talked about earlier the impact of the residential market had on Washington at one point in time. And a lot of our markets in New York even we've recently had some good bids and had some bad bids. Sometimes it's just a result of how much -- what kind of institutional works in the market at the time. And what hospitals and schools and whatnot are doing. And what opportunities are available to contractors.</p><p>So we're not anticipating the growth we saw in the past three or four or five years. And we had some years where costs were going up 10% a year, 50% a year. Those are tough years to guess where you're going to be in six or nine months. I think we feel pretty good that things are flattened out.</p><p>We don't expect them to drop a whole lot. But hopefully stay flat for awhile that would be nice. I mean certainly all our development stuff about process and what we're trying to do, we're trying to create certainty, and certainty makes us more effective. The more certainty we can create the better we can do our job and the more effective we can be. Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: A follow up to Jordan's question. If costs remain stable at best but obviously rents are likely coming down across most markets. What are the implications for land values and what have you seen? Have you seen land trade at all? Where do you think the land component plays over the next couple of years?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well I think -- I think before we buy a piece of land we don't just worry about rental, right. Are there going to be warm bodies to put in the building? So you start with tenants, right.</p><p>And if there aren't going to be opportunities to lease to people then we're probably not going to be buying land. I think land -- you tend to back into land values based on what rents are doing. Where people think rents are going to go and where costs are. And obviously if costs stay flat and rents drop logically you could say, hey, lands going to drop. But you know we've seen times in the past where people said I just won't to sell my land. I'll just sit on it and wait, okay because I think its worth more than it is.</p><p>So we would expect land to stabilize. If you think about land values and what they've done in the last three or four years, they've risen quite dramatically in some areas especially in some CBD areas. We would expect them to stabilize and be more predictable going forward. But we're not going to run out and start buying a bunch of land just because land rates may be aren't as high as they were two months ago or six months ago.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: There's something called land owneritis and land owners very, very rarely believe that the value of their land is going to go down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: And for the most part were working in CBD locations and in CBD locations it's really hard to determine what the value of land is because there's relatively little trading going on.</p><p>And in certain locations like the cities were in, the trading of land is so few and far between, that when you actually have the opportunity to buy a piece of land that you, in the long term, think is going to be a terrific value, you jump on it. Which is, I think, the reason that we were so attracted to the NPR site in Washington, DC, which we just purchased.</p><p>There, if you looked at it purely on a above grade FAR basis, I think were in at $260 a square foot, something like that. And we basically bought a building that is going to give us a 5% cash-on-cash return for the next four to five years.</p><p>We're also getting the opportunity to get paid to build a new building for National Public Radio and if you throw it all in together, I think, when we do our analyzed map we think we're going to be in that land in 2013 at about $200 a square foot for building a building in Washington, DC And today new construction runs in Washington, DC are $60 to $65 triple net. And there can be some pretty significant increases in construction for us to get paid reasonably well for that investment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Is that it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great, thank you. We're going to break for lunch right now which is right over here. Just to remind everybody there's a, on your name tag, there's a table number, there's assigned seating.</p><p>And also immediately after lunch we're going to do the property tours and you also have on your name tag a tour number which -- a tour letter which Tour B is the Waltham Tour that will meet by the escalators. And Tour A is the Russia Wharf tour that will meet across the hall in the room over there, thanks.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>DOUG LINDE: Hello. Please feel free to eat and chatter your silverware around. We want to -- we want to give as much opportunity as we can for the next panel, which I'm sure is probably one that everybody is, maybe it's not as important as everything else we've done -- no just kidding. Is probably the thing that is certainly at the tip of everyone's tongue other than what's going on in the capital markets. Which is so what's going on there in the leasing markets?</p><p>I have only been working at Boston Properties for 11 years but I've known Ray for a more extended period of time. The success of Boston Properties, not just its Washington, DC region, but its marketing approach, its perspective on how we handle our relationships with our customers, which are the tenants that are in our buildings, has been born out of the Ray Ritchey ethic and the Ray Ritchey approach to life.</p><p>And it is a clear, distinguishing characteristic of our organization about the way we go about dealing with, relating to, courting, respecting, negotiating with our tenants, and it's all based upon the marketing acumen that Ray has brought to the table.</p><p>And he is also at this point been able to train some pretty talented underlings who are now our partners who are carrying on that same ethic and that same perspective in terms of how we approach our markets.</p><p>I hope this morning you got some appreciation of the fact that these are not just office buildings and that you have a broker, someone comes to the door, you lease some space and you go on. There are things that we do and an approach that we take to these investments that we're making that I think is different than what the majority of real estate companies do across the market floor and probably across the Americas.</p><p>That same approach and that same perspective goes with how we deal with and talk about and try and attract tenants. And it permeates down to the design, the acquisition, the due diligence when we're looking at something, and Ray and our leasing team are a critical component for the satisfaction of our own comfort level and the expectations that we have for those assets and then ultimately we [enchargen] them the success.</p><p>They're ultimately off the front lines, customer contacts, who are the day to day people who make our building successful from an economic perspective because when they sign a lease we start getting rent, knock on wood. So with that I want to introduce Ray and please give him a warm welcome because he is a special person for Boston Properties.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY, EVP, NATIONAL DIRECTOR - ACQUISITIONS AND DEVELOPMENT, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Is this my retirement party? But thank you very much and I'm honored to be here today. Thank you so much for coming. Yes, my name is Ray Ritchey, otherwise known as Mayor Fenty's personal ticket broker out of Washington, DC That's one reason I can think Mr. Fenty has such kind comments.</p><p>Yes, we've been asked to lead the discussion on the recent conditions in all of our regions in these uncertain times. And in recognition of the critical environment that we're in and the fact that we're getting majority of our news from talking heads and promulgating all the information of the day we have decided to stick with that format for today's presentation and go with something we call softball with Ray Ritchey.</p><p>And so with that I'm very pleased to present our distinguished group of panelists joining me today, the head of leasing for each of our regions and they are as follows, David Provost, of Boston region, Andrew Levin in our New York region, John Brandbergh in New Jersey, Rod Diehl in San Francisco and last but not certainly not least John Taylor our Washington, DC office.</p><p>Now look at this picture I said these guys look like they've been separated at birth. I mean it's almost like the Stepford Wives equivalent of office leasing. And also very clear to me that I did not hire in my image, that's for sure. But we also like to follow up on Doug's comments that as impressive as the presentation today was in the capital markets and our development construction teams and back in our headquarters the IT group and all the people that come together to make Boston Properties the great company it is.</p><p>With all due respect to those people the individuals sitting at this table here maintaining the recent success we have enjoyed in all our regions, which is not only the REIT industry leader but in every one of our markets the leader in terms of occupancy. Without them we would not realize any success that we have over the last 5.5 years. So again I'd like to offer a round of applause, if I could please, to our leasing team.</p><p>Guys, I'm getting you that pause now because after what you talk we may not be getting any of our applause later on today. But so with that we do want to jump right into it. And we thought about soliciting all of you with questions or we went some to our brokers to get questions answered. But we decided candidly to go some to our more prominent shareholders and get their questions answered about what's really driving their decision today.</p><p>DOUG LINDE: So our first question comes from Mr. T. Brady, from Weston, Mass. who asks, \"I'm now recently in a situation where I have some time on my hands and want to consider investing in real estate more actively. How do I stay put in the Boston market as a place to put my money?\" So David, do you want to take that one?</p><p>DAVID PROVOST, EVP - LEASING, BOSTON REGION, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Sure. As a [Patriot Sam] by the way, boy do we miss Tom Brady. That was a tough loss the last couple of weeks. So the Boston marketplace despite what you heard on a macro level on the economics, the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market are very, very strong. On the supply side in Boston the vacancy rate, overall vacancy is 6% and that day it's actually below 3%. These are very, very low numbers.</p><p>Obviously everybody seems to be concerned more on the demand side. And despite what you hear in the western suburbs that the cocktail parties there are very few investment bankers in the Boston marketplace. Actually our downtown leasing told us that it actually comprises less than 2% of our tenant base. So the direct impact of what's happened on Wall Street we think will be minimal.</p><p>If you look in Cambridge the vacancy is below 8%. Obviously a supply constrained market -- demand remains very strong with some of the big tech companies moving in recently, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Google et cetera. And in the suburbs vacancy is right about 10% and continued strong organic growth from the tech market. So overall the market seems fundamentally very, very strong.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Dave, what do you hear about the VNO project at the [filing] station side is that to go forward or --</p><p>DAVID PROVOST: There's very limited development sites in Boston. There's one right out here and some people have been asking about this deal going up. That's Fan Pier, that's 500,000 square feet scheduled to come in summer of 2010.</p><p>The [Ronaldo] site or the [Philume] site as people call it is about 500,000 square feet of office and there was an article in The Boston Globe two days ago which said that they are going to move forward. It stalled for awhile, and if that doesn't move forward it's probably based on our construction guys are telling us, probably a delivery 3Q, 4Q '011.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: I'll also remind you guys to jump in here anytime you have questions or comments. We want this to be very much an interactive type of session.</p><p>DAVID PROVOST: But by the way on that, if you look at that, if you look at those two development sites combined with Russia Work, which you're going to see, right next door here, that's 550,000 square feet. If you add all three of those you're talking about 1.5 million square feet of new development which is about 2% or 3% addition to the supply. The Boston marketplace is about 50 million square feet so again not a huge -- you know based on the vacancy rates we talked about that's not a huge impact on the supply side.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Plus as we saw this morning we have tremendous internal demand just within Prudential Center which is basically in our downtown portfolio of properties.</p><p>DAVID PROVOST: That's right, yes.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: All right, the next question comes from [Macey Soprano] from [Paston], New Jersey who asks, \"My recently departed husband, food poisoning, was a big fan of BXP but I'm concerned about the impact the financial fallout in New York may have on the New Jersey market. Should I be?\" John, you want to answer that?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Sure, Ray. The submarket in New Jersey that is most susceptible to the financial fallout in New York is going to be the Hudson waterfront which we also refer to as Wall Street West. Now fortunately this 30 million square foot market has a pretty healthy vacancy rate of about 6%. However, Merrill Lynch, AIG and Lehman Brothers combined leased a total of about a million square feet so we do expect that number to change a bit.</p><p>More specifically in Princeton where our New Jersey assets are located Merrill Lynch as a 2 million square foot campus that they own and occupy and BlackRock leases 300,000 square feet in Plainsboro. We are told that both of these divisions are doing very well and so we don't see a space reduction for either of these users.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well the other thing about that market too, John, I think is that is when you have these mega campuses with millions of square feet of space single purpose building that really doesn't compete with our multi-tenant portfolio does it?</p><p>DAVID PROVOST: That's correct, yes. Merrill Lynch's campus they about six years ago built a campus in (inaudible). They vacated a campus in Plainsboro. This time they had the foresight to actually build eight different buildings so they could be sold as one-offs or multi-tenanted whereas the original campus didn't have that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So in Princeton are we seeing any cost reduction coming down on New York, or people looking at --</p><p>DAVID PROVOST: No, not yet. Fortunately Princeton, I like to refer to Princeton as well in a study, our market number really goes up and down drastically, which we keep chugging along with Tom's railroad I call it.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Okay our next question comes from [Mr. Peter Farb] from [Kield], Mississippi. I recently moved to New York City but clearly do not understand the market there. Could you provide some insight into what you see are the current market dynamics? Andy, you want to help Mr. Farb on this?</p><p>ANDREW LEVIN, EVP - LEASING, NEW YORK CITY REGION, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Well if anybody can tell me what the stock market is doing today I'll tell you what the real estate market is doing in New York. It's really -- people are just not sure what's going on in New York given what's going on in the financial world. We are coming from a position of strength in terms of vacancy. You know the vacancy in Midtown is 5% according to the current statistics, availability is only about 9%.</p><p>Now those numbers have deteriorated from last year where you're about 4% vacancy and 7% availability. Absorption is up this year. Clearly pricing is not going to continue to go up and most people's expectations right now is that it's going to go down. And there are a number of transactions that are in the works that have been put on hold as people try and understand what's going on in not only their business, but what's going on in the world.</p><p>There are still a scarcity of large blocks so anybody who's looking to do a transaction for 500,000 to 700,000 square feet facing a lease expiration still has very few choices today. And they can't say with certainty whether those choices will be available in the future. There's a lot of speculation as to what will be available in the future but there's no certainty to a lot of that stuff.</p><p>So anybody who has a lease expiration somebody is going to say what's the demand driver these days and for me it's really a lease expiration is the only demand driver. And I think we've seen an increase in renewal activity because people are reluctant to commit long term to new deals and people are reluctant to spend capital these days as the business outlook becomes a little bit uncertain. So I think overall there's a lot of uncertainty in the New York market right now.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: The other thing I'm seeing and this is kind of for everybody is that unlike previous downturns in the cycle there wasn't an over-commitment of space right up front. And David you're seeing this at the Prudential Center. I mean we're going through a kind of slow down yet the internal growth there wasn't that kind of extra fat in the market to take care of that. Are you seeing that in here?</p><p>DAVID PROVOST: People over the last few years have been taking space for (inaudible) for legitimate business purposes. There was not a run up in taking space. Demand has actually been quite moderate all year and hasn't really been great the past few years. Pricing has increased because we've got a real supply constraint in New York.</p><p>You know you talked about supply being added in Boston, a million and half square feet being added in Boston, there's two million square feet being added in New York over the next three years. And that's in Midtown. Midtown is a 200 million square foot market so the percentages -- it's a fixed supply side market. Demand has been quiet. It doesn't really take much demand to maintain pricing in New York. The real question is whether we're going to see a lot of sub lease space.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Are you seeing any indication that there was movement downtown even in these more difficult times? Because we haven't before, I mean, we've never seen even any pricing premium being too hard to get the people to go down to downtown.</p><p>ANDREW LEVIN: Right now that's still not a lot of available space downtown. I presume that a good majority of some of the larger blocks or some of the larger available space will be downtown. Not willing to increase the spread between downtown and midtown. For the larger financial firm that might make sense but for most tenants the flight to quality it usually go the other way, it goes from downtown to midtown and you might even see with some potential opportunities opening up in midtown a flight the other way.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Now are you seeing it just the softening just in the big deals? Are you still seeing the smaller tenancy on the sidelines too or not?</p><p>ANDREW LEVIN: It depends. Smaller tenants have lease expirations and they need to do things and they're a good number of choices and they're sort of doing things. I think we're going to start to see a lot of smaller firm creations, which will benefit a 540 Madison or a 2000 Central Tower. You know with folks leaving Lehman Brothers, folks leaving Bear Stearns starting their own ventures and starting small. So I think anybody who can wait is waiting whether they're large or small.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Okay let's go, I have a next question here. This one comes from A. Schwarzenegger of Sacramento, California who asks, \"I'm very much concerned about the condition of the California real estate markets especially in San Francisco. Please advise if my fears are well-founded? Rod, can you can take care of that for the good governor?</p><p>ROD DIEHL, EVP - LEASING, SAN FRANCISCO REGION, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Absolutely, Ray. If the Governator is fearful we better answer him clearly here. I can say this first of all, we as you may know, we operate in three primary sub-markets in the Bay area that being San Francisco, CVD of course from Embarcadero Center and then down the peninsula and into the Silicon Valley.</p><p>And really for almost this enter year the other markets, all three of those sub-markets have all been characterized as probably tentative in terms of some of the tenant's interests. Deals have been happening but I think they've been characterized by a lack of impetus to make a deal.</p><p>So when there are deals that are out there and tenants have to either renew or take down space we're making those deals happen as quickly as we can. They, I think, you mentioned this a second ago Ray and Andy as well all these markets really haven't been hit over the last five to six years by a tremendous amount of new supply.</p><p>And so the changes that we're seeing right now in the marketplace really are coming from the demand side, and they're moderate because tenants have not taken down more space than they've needed over the past five years.</p><p>They've generally waited, in fact, really especially down in the Silicon Valley there were tenants that sat and sat and doubled up in offices, and literally they were so burned from the last go around in the and they were under the discipline that was imposed upon them by a lot of their venture capital and other partners, were to be very conservative with their real estate, and consequently did not expand as quickly, didn't go out and take more space just to hedge against what was coming.</p><p>So when they did grow they took down what they needed, maybe 10% more, and now that's going to help. Because as they pull back there's not going to be a lot of shadow space, not as much. That's not to say there isn't sub-lease space in the market. There is but it's -- I think it's going to be quite moderated for those reasons.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: I think what characterizes all of our markets candidly is that our philosophy of focusing on those barrier to entry locations has really held together very well. Every one of our urban markets, lack of supply was really the problem up to about six months ago. And if there is a supply issue it tends to be in the markets we have just exited.</p><p>We talked today about the fact that we've sold $4.3 billion of real estate and while we did sell some key assets in New York and Washington and the urban areas that probably was an exit out of the commodities space. And really focusing squarely on the best assets and the best sub-markets in the United States and that really is Doug, and Ed, and Mort who provide that leadership really should be commended for executing that strategy so diligently when we had the opportunity to do that. [Steve], next question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: This is from [Laura Busch] of Corpus, Texas who asks or states, \"My husband is facing retirement and we're debating the merits of staying in the Washington area versus a move to Texas. What can we expect in the next year in terms of real estate conditions in the Washington area, gentlemen?\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well first I'd like to say, [Laura] you're welcome to stay in Washington. That the feeling is a little different about your husband, but generally the DC region from an office standpoint is in very good shape. There's positive job growth. We have a federal government, which in 2008 is going to pump $55 billion of new procurement into the economy that's new stuff, new business services, not government employee salaries and so forth. But this is buying new stuff.</p><p>So as long as we have that fundamental base there and I think that Washington may be beneficiary of this financial fallout, which we'll talk about a little bit later, there are some signs of softness in the market.</p><p>There are currently downtown about 15 buildings that are either delivered or under construction with no tenant commitments, and there are another eight that are just half committed. And in the suburbs, Virginia and Maryland, there are about 18 buildings in that same category, under construction or delivered with no tenant commitments.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: But John, I want you to kind of give a little finer point on that downtown number because I would like to address the difference between the traditional east-end CVD locations where we have assets and the NoMa market and the Ballpark district and the south-west part.</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH, EVP - LEASING, NEW JERSEY REGION, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Yes the majority of those 15 buildings are in markets that we're not in, the north of Mass Avenue market, which is north of Union Station, probably two million square feet of space that's either sitting there right now available or soon to be delivered.</p><p>South-west also we do have a couple of buildings in the south-west but they're fully leased primarily to the federal government for long-term leases. There's about 2.5 million square feet that is available in the south-west. And then you have the Ballpark district. The market there is pretty much reflective of the National's baseball team. They lost over 100 games this year. So those are not markets that we're in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Let me just also point out that this again shows the difference in the real strength of the Boston Properties' philosophy where we're embedded in these markets. Very often investors get the package and the opportunity to invest in a 'Washington, DC building'.</p><p>Well that's -- there's a far cry between K Street northeast and K Street northwest. And to have that in the trenches, market knowledge in each one of our four markets allows us to do the 2200 Penns as opposed to the 2200 North Capital projects.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: The other thing I'll point out, Laura and George, if you're interested in buying a building supposedly there are 150 buildings whose loans roll next year. So if you have cash, if you want to buy something, I think there'll be some opportunities there. We've moved a lot of property in terms of investment sales both Boston properties specifically and the market in general. I would say that we're probably, what, 80% this year in terms of total transactions, John, in the DC markets?</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: That's about right.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Yes the investment market has really come to a screeching halt in that market. Our next question comes from Mrs. J. Judy of Los Angeles who states that, \"My livelihood is totally dependent on the health of the legal profession.</p><p>What impact does the financial crisis have had on the growth of law firms in your respective markets?\" And this is one I think that affects everybody at the panel, maybe John not so much. But Andy why don't you talk about that from the get-go and we'll jump in here.</p><p>ANDREW LEVIN: Obviously we've got -- we've got a number of law firms in New York. This year we'll be flat if not done I think for most law firms in terms of their revenue. But with firms like Heller going out of business we've got -- we have firms like Kirkland &amp; Ellis who are going to be growing over the next few years.</p><p>They've got a strength in either litigation or bankruptcy or they have -- they do more financial firm, you know, financial buyer or strategic buyer type merger and acquisition work as opposed to financial buyer type work where they're seeing growth or expected growth. So it really depends on the firm.</p><p>And if you're going to characterize the industry as a whole I mean I think they're going to -- they're already seeing a soft, a softening 2008 versus 2007.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: What do you see, David, Ropes &amp; Gray, for example, what's been on there?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well what's interesting as we talk with Ropes &amp; Gray that's an international law firm as Bryan Koop pointed out, they think that business is going to be off a little bit but they just took another 50,000 square feet from us. So I don't know.</p><p>In Boston while law firms certainly are a large consumer of first-class office space they really haven't been growing that much in Boston. So they had -- they took us 150,000 square feet. They were leaving about 380,000 square feet, Ray. So it wasn't a huge amount of growth there anyhow. I think our bigger concern is if you see some of these firms dissolve, if they decide to break up, that's the bigger impact.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I would tell you though I think it's very similar to what we're seeing in the financial markets. These larger groups may break up, but that guy, that person who's been practicing law for 20 years is not going to immediately become a truck driver.</p><p>He or she is going to go back into the practice of law, obviously in Boston, will consume the same ratio of space and may come out as a different firm or it may emerge into another. But I don't see the overall demand -- I think we're in a period of transition here where we've got some transition from the larger firms that will either be merged with even bigger ones or smaller practices emerging. But I just don't have a sense there's going to be too much of a problem. Rod, how about San Francisco? What are you seeing there?</p><p>ROD DIEHL: Yes, Embarcadero Center, as many of you know, we have many law firms there. That's one of our largest, if you were to pick a single industry within that building it would be law firms. And in the past three years they contributed to the majority of our growth, a lot of the larger deals we did were with the law firms.</p><p>Now this year there haven't been as many new deals in Embarcadero Center with law firms. We have done a few expansions but not as many. But in the marketplace by and large there's been two pretty good-size deals done, DLA Piper and Gibson Dunn just to name a couple of them in Tishman's new building, in addition down on the peninsula several of the larger deals that have been done down there. Also King &amp; Spalding took down a pretty good-sized space and another firm called [Gunderson &amp; Dedler], two pretty good-sized deals that were done in that market.</p><p>So I think it's yet to be seen -- I mean we're going to feel the impacts, a little bit of the Heller Ehrman as well that is their large tenant in San Francisco. So we've been kind of waiting to see what that 260,000 square feet that they have at 333 Bush is going to look like, how much of it is going to remain occupied and how much will be vacated. So I think it's -- you want to add, Joe?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Just the other thing is in New York all the out of time firms are trying to have a foothold in New York and have a strong presence in New York. And I think they found over the past few years it's gotten quite expensive to do that.</p><p>I think they're now thinking that the cost to acquire these lawyers and the cost to take space will be more moderate. And I think some of the out-of-town firms who had planned to grow, grow bigger in New York, will try and do that, and try and --</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Well a corollary to that too is when we see these harder economic times for the law firms and we know the cost with relocating out of one space into another, and given that our assets are kind of the dominant go-to buildings in our respective markets for these law firms I think the prospects of renewing Palmer Dodge and all these guys who are coming up with the 2010, 2011 expirations is exceedingly high.</p><p>So I think while we may be seeing on some of our new developments having some slowdown in the demand, I think our existing portfolio is to be very much a beneficiary of retaining those law firms. John, you want to talk about Square54 real quick?</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: Yes Square 54 that's the former George Washington Hospital University site.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: 2200 Penn.</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: 2200 Penn. We are very close to a commitment for half the building. It's a law firm -- it's an international law firm. I think the law firms are a major driver of office space in Washington if this new financial stability act is passed I think that the law firms will be a major beneficiary of that. There's a lot of policy to be written, lots of regulations.</p><p>I think one of the things that the law firms will focus on more, they have in the last five years, but I think with the financial instability they'll do so even more. And that's the focus on who the landlord is, whether they have financing, will they be there when the building is delivered. In the past they believe that they can just sort of write those protections into the lease. And maybe they can do that now, also. But I think they'll really take a much harder look at the landlord.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: That's a good point, John. There's a new building under construction by a local developer at probably Main and Main in Washington, DC That's Connecticut and K. And they signed up Arent Fox which is a very solid Washington, DC law firm for about, what, 70% of it, John? 75% of the building? Bottom up, great deal. They had to work for months to get financing and they only achieved it after they did something they had never done before which is going personal on the loan.</p><p>And these are gentlemen that are in their 60s and 70s and the decision to go personal after that period of time we secure the loan I think really shows you how tough it is to get those law firm financings done in this type of environment. Any also law firms, guys?</p><p>Our next question comes from Ms. S. Palin of Wasilla, Alaska. \"Hopefully I'll be making a major career move in 2009. What impact does the change in administration going to have on your respective markets?\" John, I assume that first and foremost to you, but others may have a point on that as well.</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: Sure, by the way, good job last night, Sarah.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Is that Sarah or Tina Fey in the picture there? We're not quite sure.</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: Give Sarah a shout out. I think when there's a change in administration in DC, DC does very well. Those that are in power move to protect what they've had during the last four or eight years. And the newly enfranchised, obviously write the new policy, write the new regulations. So I think that the DC market will benefit from a change in administration even it's the same party but just a new administration I think will benefit from that.</p><p>History has shown that when there's a national or international crisis the DC market benefits from an office space standpoint. Unfortunately that's the sad commentary. If you look at the S&amp;L crisis with the formation of the RTC they leased hundreds of thousands of square feet and when they were -- basically worked themselves out of business that was backfilled very rapidly from the growth that was generated.</p><p>If you look at 9/11 the formation of Department of Homeland Security they've leased probably a million square feet. I think with this new office of financial stability, whatever it's going to be called, anecdotally the talk is that they'll need between 500,000 and a million square feet.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: And that's obviously bodes well for a lot of those buildings up in [Milmet] that are sitting vacant. And that's one of the few places the government can afford to go. Anyone else have comments on the change of administration?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I don't know about the administration in Washington but I've been much more encouraged about the administration in New York City that hopefully Mayor Bloomberg will with his recent announcement of trying to get the turn on his over turn will return to New York as I think it's key to the New York market that with stable leadership and Bloomberg has really shown to be that over the past eight years.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: And if you'll have no problem to make a major donation to his campaign I'm sure he'll be in support of that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: You know it's interesting in Washington when we have these elections an interesting side light.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'll grab your checkbook Ray.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: An interesting sidelight is with all the Congressman and Senators who do not go up for reelection trust me they're not going back to Arkansas. They're not going back to Iowa. They're staying right there in Washington, DC and they're starting their own boutique firms and while it's not a major demand driver it does drive up some demand in some of the top tier buildings in Washington, DC</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Our next question from our shareholders comes from our two largest, Mortimer Zuckerman and Ed Linde. I'm looking at his picture. I'm trying to figure how Mort gets younger looking every year as opposed to -- this is probably a 35-year old picture.</p><p>And Mort and Ed ask, \"What does the pipeline for future development look like in each of your markets both in terms of the general market and BP specifically? And would you start today on a speculative basis?\" John, what do you think about starting a spec building in Princeton?</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: On a spec base, you know, as we talked about earlier we are building 71 Carnegie Center for Princeton University and we've had some preliminary discussions about building a second building for them. So certainly on a situation like that we would build -- fortunately in 2000 we had our next spec building all teed up ready to go.</p><p>And five developers developed over a million square feet along the Princeton Rt. 1 quarter. We're talking about an 18 million square foot market. And today about half of that is still vacant. So fortunately for us we had the foresight to put the brakes on a bit. We always have our next building teed up but it's premature at this point.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Dave, how about the suburbs of Boston, we see settlement on there?</p><p>DAVID PROVOST: In the suburbs, well we just finished up 77 which some of you will see today, 200,000 square feet and it's pre-leased. This about five building under construction in Central 128. We'll point them out today. Three are fully committed. The other two we've got just about 500,000 square feet about 2% of the overall market are not committed.</p><p>So again I think we'll probably hold off. We also for our portfolio we have pretty significant roles in 2009, 2010 so I think we'd want to get comfortable with that before we'd go our speculative basis. But I must tell you there is -- Cambridge is such a tight market there is no development space for office left. There's none left. That's a finite market. It's bordered by residential, it's bordered by the university, it's bordered by the Charles River. So there's no other development site. Most of it is biotech.</p><p>Many of those tenants we've seen over many square feet of migration out from Cambridge out to the suburbs. We think that's going to continue. We think that there are real build-to-suit of opportunities. So I think from a (inaudible) standpoint we feel very optimistic about that.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Now David brings up a good point. It's interesting with this capital crisis our anecdotal observation both in Boston and a little bit in the Valley too -- Roger can opine to this. But the tech side does not seem to be constrained by the capital and still seem to be growing, still seem to be very strong, still be taking down space. Is that just an illusion or what are you seeing, Rod?</p><p>ROD DIEHL: Now I mean -- there's definitely been continued demand from the tech side. I mean from a development perspective I mean the Silicon Valley does have, as the Bay area has probably more of the new construction that's underway right now, 3 million square feet plus or minus buildings that are either recently completed or under construction now.</p><p>So there is some stuff in the pipeline. Now that sounds like a big number but keep in mind that Silicon Valley in total is a pretty big market. I mean you talk the office market and the R&amp;D market. And if you combine the two that's about 215 million square feet. If you look at just the office market, which is maybe 60 million-plus just Class A R&amp;D you're talking about 100 million square feet. So 3 million square feet of new is pretty -- it's pretty minimal.</p><p>So as far as the demand for the space many of those buildings have yet to sign any leases. There's a few big deals that are out there circling now that we expect by the end of the year at least one or two of those will land. So the demand for tech in these new buildings hasn't really come to fruition yet.</p><p>But I'd have to say I just saw the recent third quarter numbers for the R&amp;D market and it is tracking the positive net absorption year-to-date, which is meaningful down there considering that many of our other sub-markets have had negative net absorption this year. So that's good news.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: John, how about -- I guess pharma is more your niche in Princeton there. What are you seeing in terms of pharma demand?</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: Pharma certainly is the driver in the Princeton market. In pharma-related companies we've had several expansions this year with CROs with clinical research organizations and anybody related to pharma advertising. We've got an advertising agency that specializes in pharma, go from 5,000 square feet to 35,000 square feet.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: And John (inaudible) how about the defense contracting in Brack in Northern Virginia and Maryland?</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: The tech community in the Washington area is really defense, intelligence and biotech. And unfortunately with what's going on in the world today fortunately for Washington those are all doing quite well. And I think for the foreseeable future will be the same.</p><p>Also with the Brack realignment and I think some of you who follow Duke noticed that they picked up a very nice build-to-suit. It remains to be seen whether that actually goes all the way through because sometimes there's some head pegs there. But Brack, even though there's probably no net new consumption of space just the geographic relocation of that to other markets will hopefully stimulate some demand the other space we backfilled. That's certainly what we anticipate. Any other comments guys?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes on the tech we just continue to see really dramatic growth from the tech group. And we'd talked about it earlier Jason Fivek who heads up our greater Waltham leasing he joined us, what? 2001, and I remember we talked about phantom space.</p><p>He says, \"What's phantom space?\" That's from the '90s, people always talked about it and firms used to go in and say, \"Okay if I'm experiencing dramatic growth I want to take 10%.\" They used to take 20% and look at the speculative leasing that happened in '99 and 2000. They were taking 100% more than they needed. Sometimes they didn't have anything and they took the space. Because everybody got burned he started when he did his first deals he was looking at expansion given six months of doing the lease.</p><p>So if somebody needed 10,000 they would take 7,000. And we haven't seen any slowdown and continue to see real growth and again as we talk to them we say, \"Have you seen any slowdown,\" and they're kind of all expecting it but nobody has seen it yet.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: You know this is -- we talked about a Wisconsin place building in Chevy Chase, Maryland and Doug mentioned that we have a deal pending for the balance of the building. Well it's actually Microsoft who is committed for -- I'm supposed to say that or not? Well it's Microsoft. Sorry, Doug.</p><p>DOUG LINDE: The press release will be going out later today.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: And the big debate is whether they take the 64 or not in anticipation of growth because this is a building that is -- will be 100% leased. They're signing a seven to 10-year commitment and they don't want the situation where they're shy of the building. So we've seen the tech side be very, very stable in a relatively unstable market.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Now Microsoft that's a good example from that meeting -- I mean they're not specific to our space. But they had a real estate said they have a 1,000 job openings and haven't seen any slowdown, and if anything they're looking to grow and become -- in their core markets. I'm sure they're not growing in Oklahoma or Atlanta but they're growing in DC, they're growing in Boston and Cambridge, and they have a -- they're leasing with us 50,000 square feet. They are out in the market looking for 130,000 to 200,000 square feet of expansion. I mean that's incredible growth.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'd like to add one other thing to that, Ray, is that the green tech -- I mean we see -- we're starting to see more of that with different tenants in the Valley in particular. This is an area that people have talked a lot about but we are starting to see some demand coming from that. In fact, just most recently there's a company called Solyndra which is a solar power.</p><p>They've expanded, they're taking down some pretty concise piece of land up in the east side of the Silicon Valley. And Tesla Motors, which is not necessarily a tech company in a sense, but it is an electronic car company, electric car company. They recently announced a deal to take some land in north San Jose.</p><p>So we have some of those tenants in our portfolio. We do have a solar company. We have a company that does biofuels and these are early-stage companies. They're starting small but they're looking for more space. I mean this one tenant, this 6,000 foot tenant, looking for 20. So there is a bright spot there. And Silicon Valley has reinvented itself many times over the last 40 years and this could be one other way that it does that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Speaking of green, and [Michael Cana] did a great job talking about our approach to green. What are the tenants demanding? Is this a deal breaker on some deals? Is it a nice to have? What do we do in existing buildings when people say what are you going to do, make this building more environmentally sensitive? John, what happened with Princeton when you did that build-to-suit for them?</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: Princeton emphasized that they wanted a minimum of silver and fortunate for us most of that, the cost associated with that is coming from Princeton University. As far as second generation space we certainly always go green with carpet but we haven't done any, completed much of this at this time.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: And how about New York, what are you seeing with the --</p><p>DAVID PROVOST: It's definitely more of a -- it's definitely more of an attractive thing for a lot of foreign companies of which they're a lot in New York. But it's just -- it's starting from a development standpoint all the new developments are going to be lead, silver or gold. And that's just another marketing advantage of a new building, whether it's for a law firm who doesn't really understand why they need to be green.</p><p>But they've got clients who want them to be green. They've got new employees that they're taking on every year who are younger and in tune to this stuff and trying to decide between two different firms from a recruiting standpoint it's something helpful to them. I mean every lawyer I have now at the bottom of their e-mails that I get saying, \"Do you really need to print this document?\" It's coming into the market climate.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: And the answer is usually yes? John, do you want to talk about the government's approach towards green in terms of some of the stuff we're looking in?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: It's an absolute requirement if you do a lease with the federal government to have your building be green. It's definitely on every tenant's check list and depending on who the tenant is it may or may not be a deal breaker.</p><p>One of the law firms we're dealing with I think it was kind of interesting that absolutely, positively had to be in a green building, and they put that right in the letter of intent. But they said, the landlord will not require us to build green space. I thought that was a little interesting. But I think that's the next wave. The buildings first, and then all of the tenant build-out space will eventually be green also.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: I'd like to throw out to the audience, are there any questions you'd like to ask our panel of experts about their respective markets or what they're seeing? Any questions? Yes Chris?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible) that's a good, it's a very --</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: It's a timely question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Exactly, very timely. BlackRock has flip flopped a bit. Originally there were a -- they had a bulls eye on New Brunswick. For them to locate in the State of New Jersey they need to be in an urban enterprise zone which New Brunswick qualified for. And then Pennsylvania who is getting very aggressive trying to attract companies. Had them fairly close and now they're done a 180 and are concentrating on New Brunswick again and RFIs just went out.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Are there questions? Michael?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: As a just overall market? Yes I think Mort touched on that today and [Mike Canlupa] may have as well. We acquired the Prudential about 10 years ago and at that time the Back Bay, and again for everybody who doesn't know the market, the downtown market, the overall urban market is 15 million square feet. Back Bay is maybe say 12 million to 14 million square feet depending on what you call Back Bay of that. So it's a smaller market.</p><p>It has always traded at maybe 10% to 15% less than the financial district. That is swap now and I think the new development of the Prudential Center as well as some other developments is a big part of that. The high-end hedge funds and private equity firms came over and I think that obviously the brokers coming over that was really the final push that this is the place where people want to do it. Bryan Koop talked about it.</p><p>It is -- people are working harder, it's about quality of life. It's about 24/7. It's about those things about recruiting and retaining. Boston's dirty little secret and again we have space down here so we're aware of it that the financial district there's not a lot of night life. There's not a lot of convenience retail. There's not a lot of residential.</p><p>But we're really excited about next door bringing a lot of that and what is here is right along the waterfront. If you get deep into the concrete jungle as we talked about across the Greenway it's not -- it's not much different than glorified Hartford. And so some of the stuff we look as -- and that's not negative selling. That is just comparative analysis but --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Leave off from Hartford.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Oh I'm sorry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I like Hartford.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: All right, this is why I love these guys. Are these guys not great?</p><p>DOUG LINDE: A press release will be going out.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: But anyhow, so again the vacancy rate we just talked about, the 6% overall so it's obviously higher on the financial district, still single digit. Back Bay is 3% and the biggest challenge that our downtown leasing team has is finding more space. That's why we're excited about Mike and the development group, 88 is really an expansion valve to help our tenants grow.</p><p>And what's very interesting and everybody talks about, well as we talk to brokers and we talk to our clients is to your point maybe if we can wait, we will wait. Guess what? A lot of these people can't wait. They need more space.</p><p>And what they're saying is everybody else is going to go out of business but I still need more space. And so you talk to these private equity firms actually everybody else that's in your portfolio is going to go out of business but I actually need to grow by 40%. And as we're continuing to see that now again. Is that going to turn in the next couple of months, we'll see. But right now it still remains pretty strong.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: One more question please, yes, Mitch?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Maybe you want to start with that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Sub-lease space has remained pretty constant at about 20% of direct availability. And during the 2001, the dot.com breakup that was up probably around 40%, 45%. So right now as a historical number it's pretty normal in terms of on-market. And I think the assumption is that that will increase up. But right now it's pretty healthy.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: John Brandbergh?</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: Yes the sub-lease rate in our market right now is about 10%. But fortunately and (inaudible) whenever we have sub-lease space we have in our leases Bob Pester and Rod have in theirs as well at Embarcadero Center that if you go to the sub-lease market for a sub-tenant you cannot compete with a landlord. So if we're talking to them or they're an existing tenant, we have available space that suits their needs they're prohibitive from doing sub-lease.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: In our three core markets sub-lease is at historic lows anywhere from 1% to 4%. I think the bigger -- what happens before sub-leases obviously layoffs. And we haven't seen -- and we're really watching this and to Doug point's we're all nervous Nellies. We're watching -- sub-lease seems to be that first indicator.</p><p>But actually the first indicator is the layoffs. And again because we have a property measurement, we actually walk all our tenant spaces to make sure are there any empty offices. We're not seeing that. So in order for a lot of the space to go under the sub-lease market there would really need to be layoffs. So that's what we're really keeping our eye on.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Now David do you think because Boston went through so many M&amp;A activities, three, four, five years ago that we've been -- the blow is a little softened here in the last few months or what?</p><p>DAVID PROVOST: Yes, there really isn't many banks left in Boston. I think the largest bank that's headquartered in Boston is what? The Eastern Bank, is that accurate? I mean that's a great trivia question. I don't know.</p><p>I mean there's not a lot of -- and that was a real concern for us as we've been through enough downturns and our concern was eight years ago what's going to get us out of this mess? And 50 years ago it had been the banks and the Fidelity's of the world. This time it was really that mid-sized firm, 30,000 to 50,000 square feet going to 80,000 to 100,000. So it's a diverse tenant base and we feel pretty confident about it.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Quick comments, guys, on sub-leasing, Rod?</p><p>ROD DIEHL: Yes just quickly in San Francisco the sub-lease space has hedged up a little bit. This year we were running about 500,000 to 600,000 square feet. It's a little over a million square feet right now. And the metric that I usually track is what percentage of that is the overall available space? And right now in San Francisco that's about 16.5%.</p><p>If you move down the peninsula that market has actually picked up a little bit more than that. That same metric is about 25% and if you go into the Silicon Valley it's about 13.5%. So it's probably worse in the peninsula and there's a couple of specific sub-leases that kind of move that number up. Down in the Redwood Shores that was a company called PDL that put a bunch of space on the market. So it's edged up a little bit but not dramatically.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: John, anything on the sub-lease environment?</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: Yes in our three markets the percentage of the total available space is 10% or less and that's down very dramatically from four or five years ago. Tenants are being very conservative in the amount of space that they take. We have never known a tenant that's gone out of business because they didn't have enough space.</p><p>And I think to some extent even though we'd like tenants to lease more space it may make sense for us to support them in that. They are looking more at expansion down the road as opposed to -- which puts more of the onus on us. But they're being very conservative.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Yes and these statistics that are being offered up here are market-wide statistics, and our own portfolio. I mean it's virtually non-existent I would say in all five of these regions. So like any good talking head show and specifically Mr. Zuckerman's [McLachlan] group, in fact he gives his condolences. He's now flying to down to tape Sunday's program so make sure you watch it.</p><p>I'm sure he'll be talking about the same topics he talked about this morning. So I'm asking each one of our panelists to give a prediction of the coming year, and why don't we use a movie theme as kind of the basis behind it. John, do you want to start?</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: Well lots of different movies I can think of. But probably the best for the DC region is Being There -- actually the inflection is Been There. Being in the right location, in DC, you will be okay in the future.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Rod Diehl?</p><p>ROD DIEHL: I'm going to expand that, right, and a little bit beyond just one year if you wouldn't mind. I'm going to -- this might sound a little corny, but I'm going to say Little Miss Sunshine for California. And the reason is I have a good friend of mine who's in the home building industry and had this conversation there, feeling the tough times as we all know.</p><p>He said to me when I asked him how things were going and if things were going to change in his world, and he said, \"Look, this place is going to get better. It's a beautiful place to live. People are going to find a way to earn a living here and stay here, and it will recover.\" And I think that's the case. It may take awhile -- we don't know how long, but in the long term the Bay area is a wonderful area to live and to run your business and for that -- I think the go forward is positive.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: (inaudible)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I mean so much of our market is perception and I think if it was the tenant rep brokers they would say, atonement. You know I would think that the market is going to fall off a cliff. I think that if I had to say anything it's probably, I don't know, there's a movie, Frantic, was that what it was, Frantic? I mean was that a movie, Frantic?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Sure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Sounds good, why didn't I. I think I saw this movie and it was a Frantic, I remember it was with Harrison Ford and my wife and I watched it, we came out and it was just a real [clumper], it was very slow, and my wife said, \"They should have renamed that Deeply Concerned.\" It really wasn't -- so I think the perception is that it's going to be frantic but everything is going to be fine. So how about, It's A Wonderful Life, how's that?</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: John?</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: I think it's what you've been hearing all day, I'll reiterate, Best in Show. We have the best product and the best market.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Good career move there, John.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Can I change my answer, Ray, Best in Show.</p><p>JOHN BRANDBERGH: And we'll continue to weather the storms.</p><p>DAVID PROVOST: In New York I have the writer's strike on so we're not really making great movies. I think the only prediction you can make in here is that there's going to be a lot of predictions in this movie. Up and down, and I think we all have to wait to see what the reality is going to be because right now there's a lot of perception and a lot of negative perception. But I think we'll have to see what the reality pans out to be.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, I thought you'd go with the Good, Bad and the Ugly.</p><p>RAY RITCHEY: Well just first of all let's go to a round of applause to our panelists here, and Doug has been gracious enough to ask me to just kind of summarize today's presentation and the event last night.</p><p>And again I think the message we try to get across again is the supply constrained nature of our markets, our long-term leases and the strong balance sheet. I think much more important than those three facts is what you saw today with the depth and breadth of talent that Boston Properties brings to solving the real estate issues of the day.</p><p>From Mort Zuckerman down to this panel I think that I daresay that that was like the all-star line up of real estate. And I sat back in that room today so incredibly proud to have been associated with this company for 28 years. And more importantly looking forward to knowing that the team we've assembled here is going to do our darnedest.</p><p>And that team, the 20-some odd people there today is merely reflective of the 650 people that are throughout out our buildings, throughout our regional offices, interacting every day with our tenants making sure we offer our clients the best possible space in our respective markets.</p><p>Lastly I want to say to all of you we look at these conferences whether it's NAREIT or various investor conferences and we see many friends, and it's so great to see you all come back, come interested, participating and committed to making Boston Properties stores successful, and on that we're most grateful.

I want to thank everybody for coming to our Investor Conference today and welcome everyone, and also those people listening in on the webcast. I know this has been a pretty tough week this week and we appreciate you guys tearing yourselves away from your Bloomberg screens to come here. Believe me, had we known six months ago what we know today, we probably wouldn't have picked today and maybe not even this month.</p><p>I just want to briefly go through the agenda. We have a series of management presentations to go through, these include a discussion with our President, Doug Linde, and several of our Regional Managers who will talk about our strategy and some of our portfolio. I'm going to provide an update on the capital markets. I assure you this will be a scintillating topic, especially if you like horror flicks.</p><p>We're going to have a session on our development that will be lead by Mike Walsh and Mitch Norville. Over lunch Ray Ritchey and our crack team of leasing pros are going to talk about the market and this afternoon we're going to have property tours that include a tour and discussion about Russia Wharf, which is located right next door.</p><p>And also we're going to go out to the suburbs and see our CityPoint development. We should be finished around 4:30 and back here. For logistics, on your name tags you will see a table assignment for lunch and also a tour assignment because there are two separate tours.</p><p>I also want to thank a few people who worked tirelessly on putting this conference together. Hopefully you've had a chance to meet or at least speak with Arista Joyner who is our new Investor Relations Manager. Arista joined us this spring from the Midwest and she really worked hard putting this whole thing together and organized the entire event. I also want to recognize [Manny Carvello], [Lisa Teralictus], [Rachel Doyle], [Laura Markasie], [Andy Simpson], all of whom were a huge part of this.</p><p>I do want to refer you to the Safe Harbor, which is our forward-looking statement disclosure. Unlike on an airplane, I don't have to read you the safety instructions but you do have to read it, so I appreciate that. We're going to start things off this morning with some words from Mort Zuckerman. So I'd like to invite Mort up.</p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, BOSTON PROPERTIES: It's not going to be easy to capture the mood of the day, but I thought I would share a story with you about this fellow who came home to his wife a couple of days ago and he said, \"Look sweetheart, I don't know how to tell you this. I thought I was investing our funds safely.</p><p>We had our entire net worth invested in AIG and Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all we thought very, very good investments and they've been virtually wiped out. I just feel terrible about it and I just felt I had to share that with you.\" And she said, \"Listen don't worry, these things happen. I love you, I'll always love you. I'll miss you, but I will always love you.\"</p><p>As a friend of mine put it recently, he said, \"My net worth is now down to a level I never thought it would get up to.\" And in a sense, that does capture a lot of what has happened. A lot of people have lost a lot of money but there has been so much wealth accumulated over the last decade or so that we still have the sort of fire power and fuel to get through this period and rekindle the economy.</p><p>I'm going to just try and indicate some of the basic trends, at least as we see it, and to some extent how it will affect the business that we are in. We obviously all see a lot of the same statistics, the thing that really began to unravel the bubble that, I guess in retrospect, we were all living in. I mean it was what happened to housing.</p><p>I must say this is something which I have watched for quite a long time, not because it's in our particular area of real estate development but quite simply because it is such a critical industry in this country. It is probably one of the largest employers of labor of any industry and we were building 1.6 million to 1.8 million units and those prices were going up.</p><p>Just to put that in perspective, the average increase in housing prices from the year 1945 to the 2000 was 3% a year. And somewhere around 2000, 2001 and 2002 house prices really took off and they grew at a compounded rate between 2002 and 2006 of almost 15% a year. Now it got to a level where those housing prices were quite simply unsustainable by all but a very small portion of the market, if you assume somebody was able to devote even a relatively higher rate of their, or proportion of their income, to cover a home with a 30 year conventional mortgage rate.</p><p>And the market simply stalled and once it stalled it began to slide. I wrote an editorial in US News way back when and looked at those numbers and wrote about it and basically said, \"Before you buy a house just be very, very, very cautious.\" And nobody expected, I think, the kind of decline that we had and nobody quite knows how big the decline is.</p><p>The estimate is to date, if you look at the Case-Schiller Index, for example, which measures one kind of housing, there's another government formula which measures mostly FHA and similarly financed housing which has declined less. But the Case-Schiller Index, which measures new family homes in 20 markets, is off roughly 20% in the last year.</p><p>And frankly, those don't really reflect the true decline in the housing values because these are nominal prices. These do not include sales incentives. And those sales incentives, if you were to believe David Rosenberg of Merrill Lynch, run over $50,000 a unit. So the housing prices, in fact, have declined even more than that.</p><p>And what's more, there is a whole change in the attitude of the buyers who are now really looking at these housing prices and saying \"Why buy now, they're going down. I'll have a better deal six months from now or a year from now, particularly in a time of relative economic uncertainty.\"</p><p>So housing prices in, my judgment, are going to decline and nobody knows where the bottom is. And I do believe that anybody who tells you that they know either doesn't know or has a specific interest in telling you where the bottom is.</p><p>I was listening to Marty Feldstein, the former Chairman of the Economic Advisors and the Principal Economic Advisor for Reagan, who's now at Harvard. And he estimated not only that there are 10 million mortgages today that exceed the value of homes, but that 50% of those mortgages, roughly 5 million homes, the mortgages exceed the value of the homes by 20%.</p><p>Now if you have another 20% decline in housing, you're going to have 5 million homes that homeowners are going to have mortgages that exceed the value of their homes by 40% and probably another 5 million that will exceed by 20% and the rest of them under that. And nobody knows what those people are going to do.</p><p>But it is going to look to me, and I'm sure to many of you, as if it would be in their self interest to either walk from the homes or basically find a way to sit down with the mortgage lender and say, \"Hey, you want the house, you can have it. But unless you write down that mortgage to a level that I can afford, I'm out of here. I'll either rent or I'll find another home, or you can foreclose on the home and then I'll come back in and I'll buy it for even less because the value of foreclosed homes decelerates much more rapidly than any other kind of home.\"</p><p>So there's going to be something that's going to happen. And we don't know just what it is because this has not happened in the lifetime of anybody sitting in this room today. This is really an unprecedented experience. We really had not had major league drops, year-over-year, in housing since the late 1930s. So we don't know what's going to happen. We don't know what people are going to do.</p><p>At some point I suppose, if they get to be discouraged enough, they may very well walk from a lot of these homes. And then you will have a lot of foreclosed homes that are going to be thrown on the markets fairly quickly. Because of course as we know, when you have a lot of mortgages that have been bundled and pooled and sold off as securitized mortgage-backed paper, you have servicers who are going to have to find some way to deal with all of these. It's not going to be easy to renegotiate home mortgages under these circumstances.</p><p>And therefore, just as we over shot in terms of appreciation of home values, you may over shoot in terms of declines. And that's going to have just a hugely damaging effect. I don't know if this is an exact number, but the estimate has been that at the peak of the value of homes, which was the largest single asset on the balance sheet of the average American household, was $22.4 trillion.</p><p>You lose say roughly 30% of that, you're talking about a gigantic decline in the perceived wealth of the American family. And there is, of course as we know, some translation of a decline in wealth to consumer spending, certainly to consumer sentiment. So you're looking at a consumer who is going to be very nervous about his or her major asset, is going to see the stock market having declined, another source of wealth mostly for the top quintile, top 20% who are the major owners of stocks. And what effect is that going to have on consumer spending?</p><p>And the point of all of this in once sense is to say, look, the problems may have started in the housing world, but that housing bubble, once it burst, immediately jumped into the world of finance and burst the bubble in the financial world. You now have double bubble in the housing and the financial world that are sort of interacting with each other, with no known bottom at this stage of the game. It is just an unprecedented time and we are looking at one of the most difficult economic times as we look forward to the next couple years and any one of us, I think, has experienced.</p><p>So that's sort of the back drop of one part of it. It's not the only part of it. What of course has happened is it may have started in subprime homes and Alt-A homes, in part because of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which had somewhere between a third and a half of these home mortgages in the first half dozen years of this century or this decade, pushed by politicians who wanted to expand home ownership and exceeded to, by management of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and in many ways was a disgrace.</p><p>And it was a disgrace in political terms because particularly the Democrats, I have to say, back in the latter part of the last century and the beginning part of this century who dominated this issue, they set up a huge political operation, one of the most lethal political operations, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that in terms of rewarding friends and punishing enemies.</p><p>And every time some group, and a number of them did, Larry Summers, even John McCain, who really tried to get Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under control, they were just $1 trillion to $2 trillion in terms of total mortgages a decade ago and now they're somewhere around $5.5 trillion in terms of both mortgage paper that they own and mortgaged securities that they have guaranteed.</p><p>They now make up probably 75% of all of the mortgage financing in the country and maybe even more. And they had an absolutely lethal political operation. And one of those companies that operated, as we know, in the gray area between being implicitly private -- publicly supported in terms of their financing, but they had a lot of stock. It gets worse than that. They had roughly $65 of debt for every dollar of equity. At least that was in terms of the equity which they represented that they had.</p><p>Now it turns out that the total equity of the two company's numbers, say within the last six months, was about $81 billion, $83 billion. But when they were finally taken over and the government auditors went in, they found out that of this $81 billion or $83 billion, $64 billion of it were what they call tax assets. What are tax assets? These are tax loss carry-forwards that could have sheltered income.</p><p>Now no other American corporation keeps that on their balance sheets but they did. And it was 75% of their perceived net worth. This of course assumes that they would have had earnings, which they had not had for quite a number of quarters preceding the government review of it and their projection, needless to say, are for substantial losses. And by the way, they had other tax shelter or tax losses that they could have used.</p><p>In addition to that, they changed the time period during which a home was delinquent to sort of write down that mortgage. It used to be 90 days. If it was delinquent for 90 days in terms of home mortgage payments, they began to write down that mortgage. They changed that period from 90 days to two years. Furthermore, they had some securities which were -- absolutely should have been mark-to-market and were not.</p><p>Now why did they not do all of this? Of course they did it because they knew that if they did expose this it would indicate how far below even their own regulatory capital requirements were. So you are going to see, I believe, literally some criminal indictments coming out of all that.</p><p>But that was one of the major compressors of air in the housing bubble, because they put so much money into this subprime and Alt-A mortgages, which is where the crisis has occurred. Something like 46% of the subprime loans are in delinquency or in default and we have not hit the bottom of that.</p><p>Now in the financial world, of course you all I'm sure are as familiar with it as anybody, but this began to have a compounding effect on the financial world. Because the financial world in large part depends on confidence. Credit is a word that derives from the Latin crederi, which means to believe. And people stopped believing and progressively more and more people stopped believing in these financial assets held by any number of financial firms.</p><p>And it turns out of course that the financial firms, particularly the major investment banks, had just escalated their leverage. In the year 2004 the SEC changed the regulations in terms of leverage. It was basically capped out at 12-to-1, certain of the assets had discounts, 6% for the secured assets and 15% for the equity assets.</p><p>And many of the discounts on the assets were waived and they were allowed to more than double the ratio of leverage to debt to equity. And the next thing you knew, within a fairly short period of time, leverage went up to 30, 35-to-1. Lehman had a 30-to-1 debt to equity ratio, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>But the interesting thing about the debt to equity is that, for a lot of these investment banking firms and for many other firms, particularly in the shadow banking world which I'll get to in a moment, you had the opportunity to use short-term debt to make long-term investments. And then money was around in plentiful supply at very low rates for quite a period of time. And the irrational exuberance, a phrase which was used in a different context, really affected the shadow-banking world.</p><p>What was the shadow-banking world? Well back in the 1930s probably 90%-plus of all of the financing in this country was done through the conventional commercial banking world. Today it's less than 30%. But a shadow-banking world has emerged, hedge funds, investment banking firms, conduits, SIVs, money markets, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>And what happened was that this 70% plus was basically unregulated, particularly after what happened in 2004 when the SEC lifted the regulations. And then there was the loss of confidence in the viability of the balance sheets of these companies, as housing prices plummeted taking down the home mortgage values, which in turn took down the mortgage securities, which then affected the credit default swaps and the credit default swaps and the credit default swaps, you really had a situation of really compounding confusion and a lack of confidence in what the real net worth of these companies were and a gradual and then accelerating freeze up of the financial system.</p><p>In terms of the lack of understanding of what was happening within these financial institutions, I'm going to cite two things. One was this trader Societe Generale who managed to get involved in $74 billion of trade in a company whose net worth did not even exceed the $74 billion. It was supposed to be one of the most sophisticated banks in Europe and it was just a great scandal.</p><p>And when they finally found about it at the right level of management, they lost $7.2 billion. They decided to dissolve all those trades in a very short period of time, I presume, because they didn't like the way it would look if they still had their trades on. But this compounded the losses from an estimated $1.72 to $7.2 billion, a decision which I will never understand.</p><p>But be that as it may, that gave a lot of people a feeling of do we really know what's going on in these various financial institutions in terms of the sophistication of the trading and the sophistication of the instruments that were being traded, the futures and the straddles et cetera, et cetera. A lot of the senior management of these institutions would say, \"You know there are some rocket scientists in our shop who really understand it.\" But a lot of them didn't understand it.</p><p>And the other one I have to say was, when it was made public that Citigroup had $80 billion in an SIV, which was a part of the \"Shadow-banking\" system, was not on their books, they have a negative pledge. Basically they were borrowing short to invest long and making that spread, adding it to their earnings.</p><p>But it was a separate company, it was not on their books, because Citigroup itself had a negative pledge and they did not provide the financing. But they said if they couldn't get the financing then Citigroup would step in. Well they had to step in and then you began to have a compounding of the sense of a lack of confidence.</p><p>And what has happened now, particularly after, in my judgment, the Fed and the Treasury made a huge error in not helping Lehman Brothers continue, because that left, I just saw the statistics yesterday again, they had roughly $150 billion in unsecured paper out there. And $120 million of it apparently has now been a complete loss.</p><p>Some of it was held by, it was Fannie and Freddie paper, by some of these money market funds, I think it's called reserve, which was a $60-odd billion dollar money market fund. And the buck was broken. The dollar that people invested they were no longer able to get back. They still haven't been able to repay the people who determined to withdraw. They withdrew or wanted to withdraw $58 billion out of the $60-odd billion, $62 billion, $63 billion fund within a matter of a few days and they haven't been able to liquidate their positions.</p><p>And the reason why they were in this place is that they weren't investing in all these safe things, they were competing for money so they wanted to give a slightly higher yield. They took a little bit more risk and it blew up in their face. So we are in a situation now where the financial world is going through great upheaval.</p><p>Of the five major investment banks, three of them basically have disappeared. Lehman Brothers of course, Bear Stearns in a different way and Merrill Lynch within a forced marriage with the Banc of America. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became bank holding companies.</p><p>I believe that the principal reason for it was that they each had $100 billion or more in repos coming due within, on an average basis, I believe for Morgan Stanley around 40 to 50 days and for Goldman Sachs slightly longer. But the ability to roll over those funds was really in question and the Fed will be able to help them liquidate some of their paper and make sure that they didn't get into a liquidity crunch, because those banks to a greater or lesser degree are still fairly solid.</p><p>So there we are in this extraordinary double bubble of financial crunch and housing crunch and we are not at the bottom. And nobody knows where the bottom is. I have to say that what happened and what is happening now is there is still a credit crunch. The Fed's come up with this program of $700 billion.</p><p>I don't exactly know and I've never heard anybody justify where the number of $700 billion came from. The idea of course is that they're going to buy these toxic securities from a lot of the financial firms, create some kind of a market in it and that will presumably improve the financial condition of these major financial institutions and diminish the risk that within a matter of 48 hours or 72 hours one of them could fall through the trap door.</p><p>What I don't believe it will do will be to dramatically affect what is currently clearly a credit squeeze. You know in the mortgage world there has been such a dramatic change in the confidence of lenders that they're doing the following. They're reducing the loan-to-value ratio significantly. They're insisting that the borrowers actually have a serious credit score and that they verify and validate the income and the net worth that they assert.</p><p>You will know that something like 46%, according to Credit Suisse, of all the subprime and Alt-A loans were no-docs or low-docs loans, that is no documents or low documentation. And they did a survey of these people and it turned out that virtually all of them acknowledged that they had lied about their net worth or their income or both. But the number that really stupefied me was that 60% said they exaggerated their income by 50% or more.</p><p>And now you find out of course that these people cannot afford to carry these homes. What everybody was banking on was housing prices going up, which they were at a dramatic rate. Everybody thought, \"Gees, why don't I buy a home, my buddy down the street, Joe Jerk, bought three units and in a matter of 18 months he made 40% on his money. I'm a hell of a lot smarter than Joe Jerk, so I'll buy three units or two units or what have you.\"</p><p>It turned out that 25% of the homes that were bought were bought on spec. Now only 4% declared that they were buying them for investment purposes. And the reason for that, if you declared that you were going to be an occupant of the home, you got a higher mortgage and a lower rate. And this has all now turned out to be more or less fictional and everybody is now trying to unravel all of the excessive confidence and exuberance about where home values were going.</p><p>The same thing though I believe is true in the financial world, the conventional financial world, the banks and the other institutions that generally provide finance for business. I think that the terms for lending are going to change dramatically. Whatever happens in the housing world, the very transformation of the terms that are being proposed is going to dramatically shrink the housing market. And whatever happens in the business world, the terms that are now going to be proposed are going to shrink the availability of finance to the business world through to the conventional banking or financial system.</p><p>Now again, nobody knows what the consequences of that may be, but it isn't going to be good. I think we're going to be in a fairly lengthy period of a declining economy. A very good economist at Harvard, Ken Rogoff, studied 18 recessions in the industrialized world, the Western style economies. There were six of them where the recession started in their version of Wall Street, in the financial world, moved into their version of Main Street and then had the dreaded adverse feedback loop back into the financial world.</p><p>Those recessions were deeper and lasted longer. On average I might add, they lasted three years. We had that same kind of experience in this country. We had what started in the financial world with the bursting of the bubble in housing that affected the bubble in the financing world, is going to move into the real economy to a greater degree by far, I think, than what we have experienced to date.</p><p>And then you will have that, again, adverse feedback loop back into the financial world, given everything that's going to go on. It's going to affect consumer card -- credit card paper, it's going to affect auto loans obviously, auto loans are plunging. It's going to affect many other different kinds of financing and nobody knows what this mix is going to produce.</p><p>And the $700 billion \"bailout,\" rescue plan, whatever you want to call it, if it passes today because it's going to be voted on today, will in my judgment not dramatically reduce the credit squeeze, it will somewhat, but it will at least give people in the world of finance, and particularly amongst counterparties et cetera, et cetera, that the bottom will not fall out of a major firm in a matter of 48 hours. The trap door will not open up and some firm will disappear.</p><p>We are also seeing, by the way, the same thing now extending into the financial system in Europe where in many of the countries now the central banks are trying to make sure that their financial institutions don't disappear. And they're taking all sorts of steps. But it does mean too that international trade is going to go down.</p><p>Now this is not, and I want to make this clear, it's not going to be anything like the Great Depression of the 1930s. Why? In 1929 the Federal Government made up 3% of GDP, today it makes up 21% of GDP. In 1929 the relationship of the two major virtually decoupled and stable industries in this country, namely education and health, were about one tenth what they are today.</p><p>They're well over 20% today, nobody knows the exact numbers, and they were much, much less then and not really basically a ward of the Federal and State government. And international trade is a much healthier part of the economy today than it was way back then when trade virtually collapsed.</p><p>As for monetary policy, the money supply back in the last 1920s early 1930s was by law a function of the amount of gold that we had in our vault. And a lot of European countries had, for various reasons, in agreements the ability to exchange their currency for the gold, which they did. The gold supply went down and the money supply had to shrink. This was not the time to shrink the money supply.</p><p>And finally of course, the understanding of macroeconomics emerged in the 1930s, which is when Keynes did his major work. And Keynes once famously said, \"You know, in the long run we'll all be dead.\" Wrong. I've always disagreed with him. In the long run we'll all survive and flourish, in the short run we can be dead. And this is, I think, a part of the problem that we're now trying to deal with, which is how we comfortably get through where we are today.</p><p>So I don't think it's going to be anything like the Great Depression, but it's going to be a tough period. I think it's going to be the worst recession and the longest recession we've had since the end of World War II. Now I hope this doesn't sound immodest, but I think that in fairness to you I'm going to give you as good a description of what Boston Properties did under these circumstances.</p><p>I must say to you that, even when we took on some of the policies and executed them that I'm about to describe, we did not fully foresee what in fact we've now been through. In fact, I don't know of anybody who foresaw that we would have a credit squeeze and a credit freeze that I think a week ago Wednesday caused Goldman Sachs to have to pay 20% for overnight money on that Wednesday night. And Citigroup in Europe was paying 25% and everybody else was in that range.</p><p>But we, frankly, looked at value and we thought that a number of the values in the commercial real estate market, we didn't know if they were at the top. In fact when we started to sell some of these assets, one of my colleagues said, \"Why are we selling, prices are still going up.\"</p><p>And I said, \"Well yes if the prices weren't going up we wouldn't be able to sell.\" But at these prices we were sellers. And we sold about $4.3 billion worth of real estate at prices that we could not get today because the financing is unavailable. And because of the perception of values is unavailable we were able to sell some properties at a cap rate of under 4% and none of them went much above 4.5%. And we raised an awful lot of money and we did some refinancing and we're in extraordinary financial shape.</p><p>And we decided, frankly, even after all of that, that we would try and access the credit markets when the money was available, not when we needed it. And so about five or six weeks ago, I think, we raised $740-odd million in the market, it was a convertible issue. That's no longer available because of the elimination of short selling. And we did it I think at a 5 3/8% rate, which looks absolutely miraculous today.</p><p>But it put us into extraordinary financial condition to do things. One of the things that we were able to do was to buy some buildings that were available, including what we believed to be two of the best buildings in New York, namely the General Motors Building and 540 Madison Avenue, which are two of the most highly regarded buildings in New York for the best kinds of office tenants, at a price which was 20% to 25% below what it had been the previous year.</p><p>So we made these purchases because we thought they were extremely good values in terms of a price per pound. That is, we could not have replicated those buildings if we had been able to get those sites, and we were not able to get sites like that because Manhattan is truly a supply-constrained market.</p><p>There are literally only two new buildings coming on stream in the next four years in Midtown New York and they're on the west side of New York, not on the east side of New York. Virtually nothing is available on the east side of New York in terms of new construction. There's a lot of space downtown, much of which I believe will never even get out of the ground for a number of years, but in Midtown New York there's virtually nothing.</p><p>So we thought we had the opportunity to buy these buildings at an extremely attractive price, which is what we stated after we bought it. We bought two other buildings which were just a shade below the two buildings that I just mentioned, but they were all in very good shape. We had virtually no space rolling over for two to three years in any of these buildings.</p><p>And a lot of the buildings, particularly the General Motors Building, had average rents that were dramatically below the market. So we thought every time these leases rolled over, we sold the building at a 3.76% cap rate, that wasn't as good as the General Motors Building, and we bought the General Motors Building at a 5% cap rate.</p><p>And in the General Motors Building not only were we way under the cost to duplicate that building, those sites simply aren't available, but both the retail space and the office space was dramatically below the market, probably 50% at that point of where the market was. So every time the space rolled over we only had 15% rolling over, so the first three or four years we thought we could pick up some appreciation. And in terms of leasing that, that is being borne out.</p><p>So we ended up in this place where we really are not dependent on any financing, not even for construction financing, if we choose not pursue it. We undoubtedly will to the extent that it is available, because we want to have some dry powder since we think there will be opportunities that will come up over the next couple years and we'd like to be positioned to take advantage of that.</p><p>But having said that, there is no doubt but that we are looking at a much more difficult period going forward than we have seen in the past. Now we have tried to anticipate this and have really throughout the entire career of Boston Properties, which now to my amazement goes back almost 40 years when Ed Linde and I started the company.</p><p>And what our sort of basic philosophy was, which is really quite simple and for us really quite obvious and you will hear a lot more about this here, is we try to stay, a, and most importantly, in supply-constrained markets. One of the guys on our Board was a guy by the name of Bill Daley. Bill Daley was a Secretary of Commerce, head of the Democratic party and now a major player in JPMorgan Chase. He took Jamie Dimon's position in the bank in Chicago and needless to say is also a brother of the Mayor of Chicago.</p><p>And the Mayor of Chicago, whom I happen to know just slightly, would call me, \"My brother thinks your company is really a great company, why don't you come and develop in Chicago?\" Now it's not easy to figure out a way to deflect that, but I found the perfect response I have to say. I said, \"You know Mayor, I said, the reason why we can't go to Chicago is that it's too well managed.\"</p><p>He said, \"What do you mean by that?\" I said, \"Because when you get an increase in demand, you get an increase in supply. We like to be in markets where you can't get an increase in supply and therefore you get an increase in rent. So that if we are building a building in a market, we want to know over time that we're going to do better in terms of the increase in the rents than the rate of increase in the consumer price index.\" And that sort of placated him.</p><p>But that in fact does really convey our view. And in that markets that we are in, Boston which has an absolutely insane approval process, Cambridge which has very little land, virtually no land to develop. We've been involved in Cambridge Center since 1980. It took us almost 20 years to complete that whole development, we won that in a competition way back then.</p><p>And we have tried to build the best buildings in the best suburban markets in the Cambridge and Boston area where we own Prudential Center and where in [the back] day virtually there's very, very little ability to add space to that market, which is where the -- that market in Boston is shifting to a degree to that. Not that it's all moving there, but that's going to be sort of the Midtown of Boston.</p><p>And we're in San Francisco and Washington. And the Washington area is constrained not only because of the lack of sites but because of the fact that there is height limit. And so you have to get a site where you can get enough size and fortunately we have the most talented real estate person in the Washington market, Ray Ritchey, who has been with Boston Properties I think 29 years now and is an absolutely wonderful man.</p><p>I happen to have met the Mayor of Washington just yesterday. We were not talking about real estate, we were talking about the educational system in New York City, I'm going to be the Vice Chairman of the Fund for Public Schools and he wanted to talk about that. I mentioned that we do a little bit of work in Washington in real estate and he said, \"Well I've never met you,\" which he had not.</p><p>And I said, \"Well you may have met my colleague, Ray Ritchey.\" Ray Ritchey, my goodness. He was so complimentary about Ray, so I know and have known for a long time that we are fortunate to have the best man in the Washington market running all of our operations there. And we tried to really in a sense establish really good independent operations in each of our markets. And by and large I think it's worked out fairly well.</p><p>Anyways, somebody once described where we are today in the following way. This man was driving a car in Paris and he was going around the Arc de Triomphe, he had a tremendously important market -- meeting, rather, that he had to go to and he couldn't find a place to leave his car. And he said, \"God, I'll do whatever you want. If you can just find me a parking space now, I will do whatever you want.\" And he was going around and a car pulls out and he's got the perfect parking. He pulls in and he says, \"God, he says, don't worry, I don't need you any more.\"</p><p>You see the guy didn't understand the business model. So where we are today is where everybody's going to have to look at their business models and see what works. And it's going to change. We think we are uniquely positioned amongst our confreres in the REIT world to adjust to the new markets.</p><p>We by and large had always a very, very conservatively financed company. We are even more conservatively financed today than we ever have been. We are, we believe, in the right markets which are supply-constrained buildings at the top of those markets, or buying to the top of the markets. The best properties we believe had always done better in good times and really done relatively much better in what we euphemistically called challenging times.</p><p>So that's sort of been the, at least as we see it, the environment in which we are working and how we have prepared for our self and how we are positioned to go forward. We have a development right next door here in Russia Wharf, which is 82% pre-leased. We have another development in New York which is also going to be substantially pre-leased. We've already signed one of the tenants, we're close to another. And wherever we are developing we are, as I said, the buildings are at the top end of the market and there are always good tenants for those kinds of buildings.</p><p>So this is roughly what I have been privileged to talk to you about. And I have to say that I've had an absolutely spectacular time working in the real estate world and working in Boston Properties and working with my colleagues for now 40 years and I look forward to another 40 years. Thank you all very, very much. I'd be happy to answer questions. Nobody has to ask the first question, but if anybody wants to ask a second question? Yes?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN: Well I don't think we're going to have a real inflation for at least a short period of time. We are clearly going to flood the economy with money through deficit. Next year our deficit is going to go somewhere above $1 trillion, if you in any way account properly for the $700 billion, which I'm just assuming for the sake of conversation this is going to occur today, in the shorter run, and the shorter run is going to be two, three, for years.</p><p>But after that I think we're going to have major inflationary pressures, simply because we're going to be flooding our economy with money. And ultimately that's not the only reason why we have inflation, but that is going to produce inflation in this country.</p><p>What is interesting is the relative strength of the dollar. That I think is raises a very interesting phenomenon because you would think, with the kind of deficits that we are running, that it might weaken the dollar. Yet still, if you look at what's happening in Europe where they don't have a central economy or they have a group of diverse economies, people still I think look to the United States, even under these circumstances, as a better place for money.</p><p>And if you look and see how we are doing relative say to China and to Russia, Russia's stock market crashed to about 60%, 65%, it's still down over 51% in the last matter of six months. And they don't even know what they're doing, they're flooding their system with money, all this oil money that has come in. Now they had a $500 billion bank roll at that point, I'll bet you 80% of that is gone just trying to sustain their economic system and their financial growth.</p><p>China has also had a tremendous crash in their market. So I think a lot of people recognize in a sense the resilience and diversification and strength of the American economy. And in this sense I think we're going to do better, because the one thing that you have to worry about is a run on the dollar. And that I don't think is going to happen and I think we again see the implicit strength of the American economy.</p><p>Still, I think in the short run I cannot imagine that we are going to see -- with a weakening economy, the main driver of inflation is salaries and wages, that is not going to happen in any serious way at all. So I just don't see that we're going to have inflation in the next couple years, other than very modest inflation.</p><p>But I think longer term we're going to build the environment for an inflationary up tick and I think within five years we're going to be worried much more about inflation than anything else. Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: You've painted a pretty dour view of the economy. I was just wondering if you can think about a bull case and what probability you would put to that. And is there any way that we're not going to see a severe recession and a deep long recession the way you've painted it?</p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN: You know I have to say that I think, as we say and there is a phrase in the Middle East, it is written, I do not believe there's any way that we can stop the decline in housing prices. Housing prices are still 60% above where they were at the end of that year 2000, even after this decline. And this I might say is just unsustainable, especially today. So I don't think that there is any way of avoiding a continued drop in housing, [then] it's going to have all of its obvious consequences.</p><p>And I would also say I don't think that, even if we pass this $700 billion bill, that we are going to immediately revive the level of confidence that has to exist in the financial world. I think that whether it's mortgage lending or commercial lending, whoever is a lender today is going to be a lot more cautious. Confidence, once it breaks, does not rebuild itself and remake itself within a matter of days, weeks or months. It's just going to take enough time for people to come back and develop some greater degree of confidence in the future.</p><p>That is why I just do not see our way out of it. I don't think, as I said, we're going to have anything close to a depression, I don't think anybody knows how serious this can be. It is a rather pessimistic view of the economy. In fact, I distinguish between an optimist and a pessimist today by saying that an optimist feels this is the best of all possible worlds and a pessimist fears he may be right. Go ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mort, you mentioned obviously the acquisitions you've done and buying at discounts to theoretically what they would have traded a year ago. Can you just speculate on what you think the downside potential for commercial real estate values, specifically CBD Office might be? And as well, you've also talked on conference calls about increasing leverage for opportunistic transactions, but do you see that probably as something you might pull back on as well in this environment?</p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN: Well look, I do think that there is a general - an increasing degree of pessimism about the market for commercial real estate. People think that companies are simply cutting back on their employment, particularly in the financial industry. The financial industry in 1980 had about 10% of corporate profits in America, last year it was close to 40%. A lot of employment went up correspondingly, a lot of that's going to shrink. And people think this is going to affect the demand for office space and I would agree.</p><p>But again, you have to differentiate and distinguish, just as if you're in New York City, I can tell you Manhattan is not just a part of the New York economy. Manhattan is a part of the global economy, 60-odd percent of the sales at Apple are to foreigners. Apple is this wonderful amazing store in the General Motors Building where their sales are continuing to go up very dramatically. It's just an astounding retail performance and it's become a destination point on the basis of just that store.</p><p>But it does speak to the fact that particularly the highest quality residential areas in New York, areas along Park Avenue, Fifth Avenue, Central Park West, Central Park South, all those with views are still doing very well. And frankly, it's also true of the office space. The best office buildings are still doing well.</p><p>Now do I think this will continue? By and large yes because, as I was trying to say before with that story, you know people and companies' fortunes may have gone down, but they still never believe that would still be doing as well as they are doing. So there are still going to be those companies that are growing.</p><p>We see it now. We're had a tenant, a law firm that unraveled in one of our buildings, 120,000 square feet. The rent was $65 a foot and because we did the lease 10 years ago and it was a 20-year lease and the rent today is going to be -- the building space is all built up, we have a security deposit for here and we're going to be able to sublease that space, or re-lease that space.</p><p>We have a situation in the -- actually the New York Times got this story absolutely wrong, surprise, surprise. I believe, I haven't seen the paper today, they said they'd put in a correction. But they described a lease that we were about to do and we are involved still in those negotiations for 300,000 square feet in Citigroup Center. And they said the tenant had to agreed to stay where they were and they were extending the five-year lease.</p><p>I wasn't even in New York at the time, I was in Boston, I get a frantic call from their senior partner who said it's not true, it's 100% false. Besides, it wasn't our space it was sublease space. But setting that aside, there are tenants around and there are tenants who are growing.</p><p>And this is again one of the advantages of being in the prime buildings because a lot of these tenants want to be in the prime buildings. They want to be on the east side of New York rather than on the west side of New York. And I don't mean to diminish the west side, I'm just saying it's a different quality of real estate.</p><p>I will tell you that the EOP deal that Blackstone went ahead with actually started because I called the Blackstone people. Ed and I have been talking about this for a while and we've been watching EOP. And I said, \"You know this is a deal we ought to do together.\"</p><p>Well Blackstone being Blackstone, they studied it and they said, \"Yes it's a very good deal, we'd like to do it by our self, but we'd like you to buy the New York real estate.\" And they offered it to us under those terms, I think it was about a 4.3 or 4.25 cap rate. And while we liked the New York assets, they were not the kind of assets that we would normally buy. For us it was a play to buy the company. We turned it down, we said \"no thank you.\" And [Harry Mackwell] bought it at a 3.1% cap rate.</p><p>Now it just knocked me over there was that kind of bubble. But what has happened, it is really the prime real estate that has continued to do relatively well. So do I think it's going to be as easy to lease space with the same kind of rate of appreciation? No, I don't.</p><p>But a lot of our buildings, we have the longest average lease term, I think it's about seven years and nine months, or six months, deliberately, because we are perfectly happy to predict what we think is going to be the market in two or three years, which is the nature of the development business. But if you're looking out 10 years, it's much difficult to predict, we'd rather have the longer-term leases.</p><p>And we are substantially full. I think we had a 99.52% occupancy rate the last time I looked at it. It may be slightly lower now. But I do think that we are -- it's going to be a tougher market environment for sure. Companies are going to be more conscious of the rents they are paying. But still I think we're in the right place, the right markets and the right buildings. And those will still, I think, do relatively well. There was a question back there, did I miss somebody?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: To the extent you're comfortable and maybe after the rest of questions on the economy, can you provide some thoughts on the upcoming election and also the Middle East?</p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN: Well if the election had been held two weeks ago I believe John McCain would have won. The incredible credit freeze and the attempt on the part of the Administration to scare the American people into proving their particular version of bailing out the world of finance by saying, \"Oh it's going to affect your credit at the -- you know the President yesterday had 20 small business men in, well they couldn't get their financing for their inventory or they couldn't get financing for their expansion or they couldn't get,\" --</p><p>The news that is emanating is that we are in a very, very serious economic time and it is affecting the entire attitude of the American public. It was always going to be the most important issue, the number one issue, but it is even more intensely shared and widely shared and widely believed to be by far the number one issue. Nobody's talking about Iraq, nobody's talking about very much else other than what's going on in the Congress and with this program.</p><p>And if you listen to them, the President goes there, I must say one of the worst speeches I've heard him give and, believe me, that's a real standard to break. But he spoke with complete lack of affect but he also said, you know we are on a verge of a tremendous possible decline. We must do something about it, it's going to affect everybody. And they want to get popular support.</p><p>There's huge popular antagonism to this bill. Huge. It is overwhelming. The calls that came into Washington are 300 to one against it because it was presented as a bailout. And it's a bailout of whom? It's presented as a bailout of the world of finance. Wall Street is the euphemism for the world of finance.</p><p>And the country sees and has seen Wall Street be so prosperous and do so well with getting salaries that were almost unimaginable, and bonuses. The bonuses for Wall Street community in the year 2006 were a mere $62 billion, that's [with the bonuses]. So when you have this as a political back drop, it's a real issue to say to somebody who has to sell his home, you have to sell it at market. But then he finds out that the government's going to buy in the Wall Street toxic paper at something above \"market.\"</p><p>And that's what's going to happen because it's the only way to bail out the financial system. It may not be my preferred way of doing this in providing liquidity to the financial system, but it's the one we're going to have to live with. And we have to do something rather than nothing and I think therefore, at this point, we'll get through.</p><p>Although what the Senate did to this bill I have to tell you was just a disgrace. They added on I don't know how many, I think for raw manufacturers I think they got $190 million tax break. And there was another one I saw this morning that was just astounding.</p><p>So I do think that there is nothing that's going to happen between now and election day that is going to take this off the front pages. And therefore, on that issue, the country is going to say throw the bums out. You blame the party in power. And whatever you want to say about how much John McCain separated himself from the Bush Administration, which was quite considerably, it was very critical of it but that's irrelevant.</p><p>And even though Sarah Palin I think did extremely well last night in at least holding her own against Joe Biden, so all these concerns about her will be disappearing as they inevitably do for the Vice President in a national campaign. Unless something happens in those two debates that we can't foresee, or unless there is some major international event that will change what the subject is, I just don't see Obama losing. I think he will win and he may win fairly big. Five points or six points would be a very big victory for him.</p><p>Now as far as the Middle East is concerned, the Middle East is a very, very tough place to anticipate anything getting done. And if anything, conditions have gotten worse. But I will say this. Without going into it in any great detail since I happen to be personally involved in it, there is a great fear in the Middle East among the Sunni Arab countries, of Iran, they are obsessed with Iran. They put great pressure on the United States, on its President when he went there, on its Secretary of State when he went there, to do something about Iran.</p><p>Now in that sense there is a recognition that the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians is a side show. So that may create the environment in which progress will be made in that area. Certainly there is, legitimately, a sense that we have transformed the conditions on the ground in military terms, in security terms and today even in political terms in Iraq.</p><p>And that I think, if we stay in there for a long enough period of time, and it's not going to be 16 months, that would be a disaster in my judgment since we would throw away what we need, I will tell you something which I'm going to use in an editorial next week off the record.</p><p>When Obama was in Iraq on this tour [De'l Resond], that he made, every Sunni tribal leader signed a petition and said, please do not leave in the time period that you have espoused, because we need more time in order to make sure that we and the Shia community, because the Shia dominate the government, can find a way to work together. And if you do that, all the relationships that we are now trying to build will break down and we'll be back into a sectarian war.</p><p>Now it doesn't mean he's changing his position, as you heard Joe Biden say, because once these politicians take a stand they feel they cannot reverse themselves without being accused of being weak and flip flopping. That's the thing that worries me about a political campaign, that things are stated that are not necessarily in our national interest, but they are in the political interest of this or that candidate.</p><p>So that is the most worrisome thing. I don't think that there will be any kind of military attack on Iran, that I don't believe will happen. And they just had another resolution without any additional sanctions that was passed in the United Nations, so it's meaningless. But there would be intensive efforts on the part of at least the Western countries to intensify the effect of sanctions on Iran. And they will be joined by a lot of partners who will not be visible on the scenes because of the concerns that they all have about Iran.</p><p>So in one sense, there will be I think a very different balance in the whole area of the Middle East, including Afghanistan, all the way from Afghanistan to the Mediterranean than we've had before. And it will work in the favor of the United States. One last question I think. Yes, over here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Can you talk a little bit about your view on short-term and long-term interest rates from here and how that affects commercial real estate valuations?</p><p>MORT ZUCKERMAN: Well firstly short-term funds of any significant size is virtually unavailable today. So anybody with cash is going to have an opportunity to do very well in terms of the purchase of real estate if they can finance it. You can't put together, even with the building where you have the building 85% pre-leased, you can't put together easily a $500 million construction loan or a $700 million construction loan, which we could have done a year ago with one telephone call.</p><p>So that is going to be a serious impediment to new construction, new development and to purchases. The financing of real estate is going to change dramatically, there's going to be a lot more in the way of equity financing that is going to be necessary.</p><p>And in that sense, the buyers will have the advantage of the market going forward. Which means in one sense purchase prices for buildings will go down. They're already gone down, as I said, 20%, 25%. They may go down another 10% or 15%. This is true, as I say of more conventional, real -- that is more commodity space, the highest level buildings have always sold at a premium and they're virtually unavailable.</p><p>Now longer term, of course, you have another issue because the -- not, two things will happen. One is the interest rates will go up for longer term financing maybe by 150 basis points. The ratio of the debt to the total purchase price will go down. Equity yields will be seen to have to go up.</p><p>And therefore on one level for a while, I think Cap rates will go up, not down. And I cannot tell you by how much, because literally nobody knows how serious this is. One of the things that is a counter veiling aspect here is that if the economy gets to be really weak, the Feds are going to do whatever they can to change the whole interest rate environment. And there may be some opportunities that come out of that.</p><p>I do believe in the short run that's going to be the case, but the private market is still very, very, very cautious. I think that's going to take a long time to rebuild the kind of confidence that is going to be necessary to do anything close to the financing that we've have been -- I don't think the financing we've had for the last several years is going to be available.</p><p>But even in more conventional times that financing is still going to be held back except for very, very limited number of situations and borrowers. I would like to think that we would be in the latter category, but that is all under the heading of TK, or to come. I think I'm probably taking too much of your time this morning, but I thank you all very much for the chance to speak with you.</p><p>&lt;Presentation DOUG LINDE, PRESIDENT, BOSTON PROPERTIES: We're going to quickly jump into our next presentation which is, you get to hear me for a little while. And three of my colleagues here, Bryan Koop, Bob Pester, and Robert Selsam, and we're going to attempt to put a little bit more flesh around some of the bones that Mort described. And my goal when you leave here today is for you to at least gain a little bit more of an appreciation for what Boston Properties looks like from an asset perspective, from a value creation perspective and how, I hope, you will be able to differentiate, and the market will be able to differentiate the cash flows and the opportunities, and the assets and the types of activities that Boston Properties acts in each and every day to increase shareholder value. The predicament that we are looking at today is probably one that has been seen for many, many generations. And I am described by my father as a child of the depression, because I am a nervous nelly. And I worry a lot about lots of different things. I tend to worry more than most of the people that surround me. But I think my nervousness to some degree permeates our organization. But I think that's a good thing. And there was saying that was told me by a gentleman named Bill McCall who's sort of the elder statesman of the Boston real estate market. When I moved back to Boston from Seattle back in 1993 after the last really bad cycle, and he used to describe it as follows, he said, \"Those whom the gods fail always first felt infallible.\" And I can tell you and can assure you that we at Boston Properties do not feel infallible. We are concerned with what's going on. We think about what we are doing on a day-to-day basis. And we try in every molecule of our mind to put ourselves in a position that we can take advantage of and protect ourselves in situations such as we're in today. We have had a pretty boring, consistent, straightforward strategy for years and years and years. And that strategy has been as Mort described, we are in the top core tile, top 10 percent, top one percent of the types of assets that are owned in the commercial real estate office sector. We have what, you'll the word, and you'll see the pictures that demonstrate it later, iconic office properties. I think it's ultimately the descriptive word that you should take away from today in terms of the types of buildings that we own, the types of buildings we purchase, and the types of buildings that we are going to develop. We believe in value creation. And value creation comes in lots of different ways, shapes and forms, but primarily it comes in looking for opportunities either in lease structure, in land, and environment and trying to change something about those typical opportunities over a period of time, to increase cash flow. We have a group of management partners, friends, associates, who really think about our business in a very micro form. Not a macro form. You listen to Mort and you sort of hear him, heard him describe a few of the transactions that we're working on in New York City. I can tell you that Ray and Bob, and Mike, and Bryan, and the rest of us all think about the concerns and the opportunities and the risks that we encounter on a day-to-day basis, as well as the acquisitions and the development. Today we worry about leasing. I worry about the leasing that we have going on today, the leasing that we have going in 2009, and the leasing that we have going in 2011. And by the way, we can all tell you about each one of those various pieces of the space, and each one of those buildings that we're concerned with and the ones where we think we have opportunity, and the ones where we have some risk. But it's that type of a focus approach that brings from our management team the kind of value and the kind of thinking, and the kind of critical decision-making that we think really puts us in a position to make decisions and to act in an environment like today in a very constructive manner. We have this regional focus which means we can understand because of the types of markets we're in the kinds of opportunities and the kinds of issues that we have in a very micro basis. We're not in 12 different markets. We're not in 14 different submarkets in 12 different markets. We're basically in four markets plus Princeton. And our activities and thoughts are about those markets. We're not spending our time worrying about, geese are there opportunities in India? Are there opportunities in London? Are there opportunities in Southeast Asia? We're worried about the 500,000 square feet of space that's rolling over in 2009 in Reston, Virginia that leased to the National Geotechnical Agency and whether or not they're going to renew tomorrow. That's the kind of things that your management team, that you shareholders are looking to us to deliver and those are the kinds of things that we're working on a day-to-day basis. I sort of put this tongue-in-cheek slide up there about new markets. We get asked the question each and every time we have a conference call where we sit in, in every presentation so, where are you looking to expand, where are you going to go next? As Mort described there are certain markets that we really, really like for specific reasons primarily because of the supply constraints and there is enough opportunity in the markets that we're in that we feel very comfortable and confident saying for now we're going stick to our knitting and we're going to stay where we are. We believe in creating shareholder value. And shareholder value is something that we think about every single day. It's the portfolio, it's the leasing strategy, it's the capital strategy and it all comes together to put us in a position where we can feel comfortable with the cash flows that we are providing on a day-to-day basis each and every day. First, it's about occupancy, and it's -- but occupancy doesn't just come from doing lots of leasing. It comes from the types of buildings that we lease. We have long term leases as Mort described. Our average lease length is over seven years. We have Class A office buildings. And we have strong tenants. In good markets, as Mort described, we do very well. In bad markets on a relative basis, we do better. But it's really the tenants and the types of tenants that look to our buildings that is the backbone of that income stream. Clearly we are a company that has an awful lot of exposure to financial services in the form of the financial services companies themselves, as well as the law firms, and the advisors, and the accountants that sort of make up the financial services economy. If you look at that law firm piece of the pie, we have about 200 different law firms in our Portfolio, 53% of them are in their top -- the American Law Review's top 50 firms from a revenue perspective, 83% of them are in the top 200. So it's a very diverse portfolio. The largest one is about $30 million. As Mort described we are no immune to the issues associated with what's going on today, and we've had a law firm dissolving. The law firm is Heller Ehrman. They lease 130,000 square feet. The space is in 7 Times Square or Times Square Tower. And as Mort described they're paying $64 a square foot. We actually think there's an opportunity there. We happen to have an LC and we think we're going to be in a position where we're going to be able to lease that space at a rent well in excess of $64 a square foot, basically on an as-is basis because the space is very well configured. And in all likelihood that law firm's going to leave its furniture, its fixtures, its computers, its telephones, and just sort of walk away. And we have a, actually a valuable asset. If you look at the financial services side, the two largest tenants are Lehman Brothers and we all know that Lehman Brothers is having its issues right now. And as we put out a press release, Lehman Brothers is a tenant in about 450,000 square feet of space at 399 Park Avenue. We can't tell you whether Lehman Brothers is going to accept or reject that lease. We can tell you that the entities that are in there are PIM, their Private Investment Management Group, as well as some of the Neuberger and Berman entities. And it appears that 399 is part of their plan going forward, but we don't know yet. The largest tenant in that financial services entity is Citigroup. They have about $63 million of revenue. Lehman Brothers was the second largest at $43 million. I think the next largest tenant is less than $15 million. So it really jumps down. And there are about 100 tenants in that financial services pot of that portfolio right there. So we really do feel good about absorbing the oops and the issues associated with what is going to happen in New York City and potentially happens in other markets. As Mort described, we sort of move from the financial situation into \"the real economy,\" and we struggle from an economic perspective over the next few years. Finally, what we drive for is shareholder return. And over the past few years we think we've demonstrated day-in and day-out that Boston Properties' strategy of being in the highest quality buildings, having long term leases, having well financed and a highly liquid balance sheet, and having the kinds of markets where when things go well you have some dramatic opportunities for appreciation, has put us in good stead. And as you can see, we've done relatively well, relatively speaking. It's also about growth. Or not necessarily growing as at a rapid rate as you might like during a tough time. But being able to sustain and maintain your income stream to support debt service, to maintain your balance sheet, to keep your capital appetite available. And since we've been a public company we've had a pretty consistent average rate of growth in our funds from operation. Now, I am the first to admit that funds from operation is probably, as we move forward, not the most important metric for a real estate investment trust, particularly for Boston Properties, to be looking at. As Mike will talk later, we have the FASB 141 issue, we have this APB 14-a, and it's all going to start to skew our FFO. But by-and-large, if you look at that period between 2002 and 2005, which is when we were coming out of the last major downturn in the real estate markets, we had a pretty consistent funds from operation. We didn't grow, but we didn't shrink. And we expect, as we look forward between 2009 and 2010, and 2011, we're going to see some growth. It may not be the kind of growth that we saw between 2006 and 2008, but we're going to see growth and we're going to be able to maintain the same relative position that we have today. The locations that we choose are pretty important. And we think hard about the kinds of places we want to be in. As I said before, it's about iconic buildings. It's about architecture, it's about design, it's about a long term perspective on our real estate. And as I move through these slides, these are pictures of our buildings and while they all are very attractive and they demonstrate a little bit of a differentiation between the kinds of buildings that we own and that we operate, and that we manage, and maybe what you perceive as sort of the market. When Bryan, and Bob, and Robert speak in a few minutes what they're going to do is they're going to explain to you what we do and what opportunities we have with these kinds of assets to generate enhanced return, enhanced cash flow, and enhanced value on a day-to-day basis. It's not just the fact that they are, \"iconic,\" or \"trophy,\" it's what those kinds of buildings and what the tenants want, and what the tenants will allow us to provide to them, give us as an opportunity to create shareholder value, that this is all about. It's also about where these buildings are. We've always said that real estate is a very local business. It's a business about street corner. It's a business about the north side or the south side, depending upon where the sun is coming through. All of those things really matter. And our buildings, as you can see from these maps are clustered in specific areas in specific cities. And they're not just buildings on a map. Here's our Boston assets, look at those clusters. We're in two basic areas. We control the environment and the markets in Cambridge Center, and we control the environment in the Back Bay in the Prudential Center marketplace. Out in the suburbs, we're in Waltham and we slew, move a little bit further bit further north into Lexington, but you don't see us out on the Route 495 corridor, you don't see us out in the Route 3 corridor. We are primarily in very specific locations for very specific reasons. And it's largely based upon what we understand about the demographics of those markets, the importance of transportation, the critical nature of amenities, and what we can develop and translate into value. In San Francisco, it's all above being north of market and it's about Embarcadero Center. In Washington, DC it's about where you locate in the East End and where you locate in the CBD. If you're in Northern Virginia, you're in Reston. You're not on the Dulles Road, you're in commodity office buildings, you in a very specific area. And what is it about these areas? What is it about these buildings? You're going to listen to our regional folks talk in a few minutes. You're going to hear about the 24-hour location, the critical nature of driving tenants to want to retain their employees. We're in the business of serving customers. Our customers are tenants. And their goal in life is not just to own real estate so that they can operate their business. Their goal is to retain and demand the best employees. And how do we put them in the best position to do that? It's putting them in 24-hour locations. It's giving them the best architecture. It's giving them the most flexibility in terms of what they can and can't do with their space. And it's providing them with an environment where they can grow. We believe in the long term. We invest, we invest, we invest. And even in a down time we believe in putting capital into our assets so that we can put ourselves in a position to maintain long term value. That is what this company is all about. It's long term value. We don't make decisions that are going to potentially bite us in the short term. We believe in long-term valuation. There's a reason why Boston Properties lease term is over seven years. It's because we don't time the market. Our perspective is if you going to be in the market, you meet the market where you have to, you don't look for cycles, you don't try and time things, and you put yourself in a position where you are more disciplined about credit, more disciplined about the types of assets that you buy and when you when them. But you put yourself in a position where your strategy, high quality assets, long term leases, long term liabilities in the form of our balance sheet, and the kinds of tenants that are going to be growing through good and bad cycles, put themselves in a position where they can be productive and where you can work your way through challenging situations. And with that, I think I'm going to turn things over to Mr. Koop. BRYAN KOOP, SVP, REGIONAL MANAGER - BOSTON OFFICE, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Good morning. I'm going to talk about the Prudential Center this morning for Boston. And the best way to understand how we continue to develop the Prudential Center, how we operate the Prudential Center, how we market, how we interface with our tenants is really to understand our most productive relationships with our clients. And with our customers they're aggressive and strategic users of their real estate. They do three things that may not seem profound to you, but I assure you that our competitors do not review this and they do not understand how their customers in their office buildings are using real estate. Our best and most productive relationships are with customers that use our trophy assets, our real estate to recruit, bring in new associates into their firm all the time. They use it to retain their top talent that they've spent a lot time in recruiting, and then training and mentoring. And then also, they use it as a top line, not a bottom line. They use it to grow their businesses and, call it, grow their brand. And we'll run through just a couple examples of that, but it's really important to understand that all of this goes into our messaging to the marketplace and how we're differentiating our product, our trophy assets. Go to the next slide. Accenture is just a great example of a company that uses our trophy real estate to recruit new associates. Every year there's a new class of associates coming into Accenture as their consultants that they're going to be training. In Boston the Accenture office was located in Wellesley, at the Wellesley Office Park. And they had been for probably close to 20 years. The Wellesley Office Park is a fine office park. It's older in its product nature. It has a good suburban location. But they were up for renewal. And they were really struggling with what to do. Our leasing team found an opportunity to get in front of them in a personal way, and I'll you a story about personal marketing and how important it is in terms of how we market our assets in a few minutes. But our team was able to get in front of them and really understand what it was that they were looking for. They were, their biggest challenge was recruiting. Young people just didn't find it fun going out to Wellesley. They didn't want to live out there. They wanted to live in the city. Boston has a fantastic environment for a young person. We see that in the young people aspiring to come to our schools here. And then, when they live, here to stay here afterwards. So the urban environment that Doug mentioned is highly attractive to the young people. They really did not find it, once they came to Accenture, really particularly buzzing after being out on the road for two weeks to then have to go back to their regional headquarters and spend time out in suburbs again. So we appealed to them in terms of what the Prudential Center offered them. It offered them the ability to really create a great environment for their associates. And the next slide really shows a picture of that. They used in their recruiting, this is a picture of the Back Bay with the Prudential Center in the background. But you can see how they use it to recruit new associates. All right, let's go to the next slide. Bain Capital an existing tenant, one of our first tenants at 111 Huntington. They use our real estate to retain their associates. Walking through Bain is really a unique experience. You walk through there and you realize that this firm is recruiting and then keeping top talent from around the world. You see nationalities from around the world in their organization. This is an organization that is so focused on how their people work at the Prudential Center, like no tenant we've ever seen before. We have in-depth discussions about security. We have in-depth discussions about the type of restaurants we're going to be bringing in. You see on the screen here on the right, this was a feature of our security in Boston Magazine. We're extremely proud of this, because after 911, we were able to tap into this in some of the relationships that Mort has in Israel, and we brought a team over to really teach us about the way security is going to be done on an international basis. Bain absolutely loved this. They used this with their people in their in their orientation. It's a big part of how they keep their people. But it's also about the fact that these young people that are working there may be working overnight. They do 24-hour shifts all the time if they're in the middle of an acquisition. And they really need to use some of these amenities that you see here. This is just one of our workout facilities at the Prudential Center. We also have a health club with an outdoor-indoor pool. Bain uses this with their people. The next slide, shows our growth with Bain. We're very pleased and very proud of our relationship with them. We've grown them over 110% since inception. And they're a firm that they continue, even this week, to talk about their future growth. Their most recent discussion with us is about the fact that they see this as an opportunity for them, and you saw them active this week in their acquisition. When they acquire a company, they get actively involved in the management which means that they're going to have more people at this location. Next, Ropes. Ropes &amp; Gray is a international firm based in Boston. The story I wanted to tell you about personal marketing is that Dave Provost came to us when Ropes was in the marketplace and we had just found that Gillette would not be staying at the Prudential Center. The Ropes RP, Request for Proposals, came out and Dave Provost came to our leadership and said \"I'm going to tell [Tom Hines], the broker, that we are not going to submit a proposal unless we get to spend time with them in person, and not just a small period of time. We need to understand their needs.\" Well Tom, who's a good friend of mine, and Doug, and also Ed, went through the roof. But it was the smartest decision we ever made. He did allow us to meet with them in person. And one [probe] by Dave Provost that just set it off was, we're sitting at their office space in the reception area, to start off with looking over the Boston Harbor. And Dave said, \"This is just an incredible view here, and I'd just like to know what about this facility is not working?\" Oh my gosh, they vomited information to us. And for the next half-hour we feverishly wrote down notes. But the main headline was growth. They were concerned that they could not grow their company at that existing location for a host of reasons. But the point was we put our marketing material and our proposal together based on how the Prudential Center can help this firm grow. Go to the next slide. Now you can't see it from the back, but the point of this slide is that the Prudential Tower has a wonderful footprint for a company that wants to be able to switch and swap departments. Let's say the Mergers and Acquisitions department is shrinking, but Litigation is growing. The ability to switch and swap is something you can do at the Prudential Tower. And the term that we got from them was, \"Partner -- no partner discrimination.\" Partners could be traded on floors, whereas at their existing location you couldn't do that. Each floor was different. Each floor was a different shape. Somebody was going to get the short end of the stick, but not at the Prudential Center. Growth was important. They also wanted to put their firm back together. They were all over the building. They wanted them in a consistent spot. Next slide please. Now, the timing was perfect. We had been thinking about reinvesting in the Prudential Tower lobby. Over a period of time, this lobby had become dated. It was a little bit older in its look. And while some of the things were redeeming, it had some art deco features. It was heavy in its nature. And one of the requirements that Ropes had was they said, \"If you're going to redo the lobby we want to become involved.\" But their message was we want this lobby to tell the story of our firm and tell the story of how we're an international firm with an international icon like the Prudential Tower. How can that work for us? And we went together and we came up with really a great solution. This is a rendering that some of you may have seen yesterday the new lobby which we're quite proud of. Next slide please. A little about our retail that supports the Prudential Center, again it's back to how do we support our tenant, the office tenant. That's really the focus for us here. Well, we're very pleased that we were named the Retail Cash Cow by Women's World Daily which is the premier retail cause publication that determines what the trends are. We were ranked number three out of -- we were within the top five shopping centers in the United States retail format. We're in the same breath as Ala Moana, the Grove, Tyson's Corner. We've taken our retail format from $600 a square foot approximately when we acquired the Prudential Center, to over $1,000 a square foot this past year. But again, it's how our office tenants use this space. I'm always told that by many of our clients in the office buildings nobody every wants to have me come visit them. Everybody wants to come to the Prudential Center because of our amenities. A few short points about our strategy, we are not a retail REIT. That's not our main business. We're an office REIT. But in many ways our team believes that that may be an advantage in that we're not straddled with a bunch of luggage. We're able to do some unique things at the Prudential Center. Our goal is quite simply to be the number one destination in New England. All our promotions are geared towards driving traffic. We believe that if we do our part, which is simply to drive traffic through those arcades, that the retailers, it's up to them to do the job from there. A couple things that to note in terms of our tactical strategy on a day-to-day basis, we treat our arcades like city streets. The word mall is not a part of the vocabulary of our marketing team. It is a city street. And with that a city street is the randomness of the city street. We believe that the format that the conventional malls use which is restricted, it's, the jewelry store's got to be next to this person and that person, is not where the consumer's going. The consumer wants the randomness of the urban city street. We believe we're an extension of that, we're open 24-hours a day. The other is we are, we believe in local chauvinism. We love those local users that are unique. A big part of our population that's coming through the Prudential Center are tourists. They don't want to see what they see in every mall in America. They want to see something different. Easy example, when we entered, Sbarro, a great pizza place, was in our food court. But they're in every food court in America. We had to have Pizzeria Regina, of course the best pizza in Boston. And we were one their first units outside of the North End. That's what the tourist like, but that's also what our office users like. Our other bit that we like to focus on new to market. The Prudential Center is a wonderful opportunity for a retailer to launch their brand, not only in the region, but in the US. A great example, we were able to convince Lacoste when they came in and re-launched the brand from their great run in the '60s and '70s that this was the spot. We were one of their first three stores. We have expanded them twice now and I believe they're over $1,600 a square foot. There's many other example of that as well. Okay. Some of the other features that we think support this recruit, retain, and grow revenues for our customers is the fact that we are connected to 2.5 miles of arcades, weather protected. Boston does not have great weather. That's just a fact. We in fact have more rain than the city of Seattle. Well, on a rainy day sales go up at the Prudential Center. But it's also great for our office users. They never have to go outside. One of my friends who's also one our tenants came to me proudly at the end of spring and said, \"I did it. I went through an entire winter without ever wearing a winter coat, because I'm at the Prudential Center.\" He left his garage, he got his car, pulled in our parking garage, and then he never needed to leave. And all his restaurant appointments were enclosed. It's a big advantage for us. And we think it's going to become bigger because if you focus on sustainability and green which we're going talk about later, it's all about walk-ability. And that what the Prudential Center provides the customer. There is a unique website if you ever want to check it out call walk.com. If you put in a coordinate or address it'll give you a score on terms of the walk-ability of a location. We think that's pretty interesting. The Prudential Center was off the charts. We got 100. Next, our parking, a real secret weapon for us, we are the largest parking garage north of New York City, over 4,000 spots. We have our own direct ramp off the Massachusetts Turnpike which is really important to those western suburbs where they key executives are living. It's also the first place that a customer starts their day in Boston and ends their day. It's very typical for the average consumer to come in from the suburbs and say, \"I'm starting at the Pru, I know I can park there, it's safe, it's clean.\" They'll keep their car there throughout the day and then return to the Prudential Center. But this parking, we show on the right the reserve spot, if you can't see it in the back, incredibly valuable to a decision-maker making a decision on where they're going to go for office space. Most executives downtown probably are not parking below their office building, and not in a reserved spot. We have seen over and over again how precious these spots are to these executives. So we use all these things to support us. And we'll go to our next slide. Maybe there's one after this. Yes, there we go. This is Prudential Center today. We are 97% leased, 99% committed. Our biggest challenge for our leasing team and property management today is really working on growth and how we continue to keep our tenants within this portfolio. Now having three buildings really gives us a good advantage in that. And it's not unusual, I think we've had over five or six relocations just over the last twelve months. The next slide shows about our future for growth. Oops, let's go back one. There we go. 888 Boylston, a new tower, our last piece of real estate to develop at the Prudential Center, and we are in the midst of permitting that right now. This project will be a approximately over 450,000 square feet. We have 90,000 square feet of retail. Now we're still in the permitting process so I use the word approximately because it was originally permitted as a smaller building but we have good hopes that we are going to be able to obtain that. We think this in incredible, important for us on several points. One, is it activates the Boylston side street and we think this product is really right in line with where the customer is going and what they like to see, that unique building that they can call their own and be a big fish in a building like this. And then the other is we really do need a growth belt to take care of our remaining existing tenants. So in closing, on the Prudential Center it really goes back to focusing on how we work with our customers, our most productive relationships. And they are clearly using the Prudential Center and our trophy assets to recruit, retain and grow their companies. ROBERT PESTER, SVP, REGIONAL MANAGER - SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Good morning, Bryan. Thank you for that fine presentation. The only difference between Embarcadero Center and Prudential Center is we don't have anything enclosed because we have great weather. Good morning, my name's Bob Pester, I'm the Regional Manager in San Francisco. I'm going to talk for a few minutes about our acquisition of Embarcadero Center and what we've done to reposition that property. A Clift Notes version, we purchased the property approximately 10 years ago in November 1998. At the time of its development, there were six buildings originally. It was developed between 1968 and 1990. And there were two hotels. In 1998, we acquired the six buildings and over the process of the last couple of years we've sold two of them for fairly handsome profits, I might add. Next slide, please. How does this -- next. As of last month we are 93.5% occupied. We have 3 million square feet of office space. We have approximately 300,000 square feet of retail space. One of the major things we looked we at when we bought the center is the conversion of retail space to office space. If you've been to the center before, there's three levels of retail. There's the ground floor level which is really the main entrance into the office buildings because the office buildings are located on lobby level. And we analyzed and looked at how we converted some of this functionally obsolescence retail to office space. Some of that space was vacant as long as 18 years. So over the course of 1999, 2000, 2001, we converted approximately 40,000 square feet of retail space that had not been occupied to office space. In fact, we're still doing that. I'll mention that in a second. One of the beauties about Embarcadero Center is its location. Unfortunately for 90% of the buildings in San Francisco, Embarcadero Center forms a wall through the city. As you can see there's the four buildings along the waterfront. So unless you're higher than approximately 30, 35 stories in most of the North Financial district, you don't have views of the San Francisco Bay. And what really sells in San Francisco and really makes a difference as far as the rents you're going to get, is north waterfront views. I like to make the comment that in San Francisco at Embarcadero Center not only can we see the boat, the people in the boat, and the name on the boat, but you can see what the people are doing inside the boat. We're, as in most buildings in San Francisco, you might get a glimpse of the water and a glimpse of the boat. Just to give you an idea as far as the rent differentials, for waterfront view in San Francisco, let's say an [EC4], height of the market, we're probably getting $90, $95 a square foot for a building that's three or four blocks away from the Bay that may have some water views, it could be as much as a 15% to 20% differential. Here's an example of some of the views. All these shots were shot out of Embarcadero Center. One of the other things that we did as far as major renovations when we bought the property is we went on a program to reinvent all the common area corridors. Many of the buildings had not been redone in 25, 30 years so over the course of a four-year period, we basically rebuilt all of the common area corridors in the complex. One of the big selling features, similar to Prudential Center is all the amenities we have. We are the only shopping center in the financial district. And once you get outside of Union Square which is more of the carriage trade, there really is no place to shop. So we have the Gap. We've got the Williams Sonoma, we've got the Banana Republic. And it really is a destination location for a perspective during lunchtime, the shoppers that come into the Center. We also have a health club and 2,200 parking spaces. This will give you an example of a few of things we did that we put a conference center in, in 2000. This conference center was a space that had been vacant for 18 years. We rebuilt it out. It's leased out to the tenants and also offered as an amenity to the tenants as part of their operating expenses. The center has a significant public art component to it. In fact we actually have an art guide that shows the 17 works of art throughout the center. Now, one of the things we looked at when we bought the center is how to make it more welcoming and open when you walk in. Again, as I mentioned, you walk at street level into the buildings. And this top photo here shows how you -- when we first purchased the property it was sort of a dark, heavy feel when you walked into the buildings. We created that. We tore out all this mass, created a nice glass canopy coming in and livened up the retail with these window cuts that you see. We also did major renovations in Sacramento Alley, which was a very dark, ugly area into the complex, and created new entry portal into Justin Herman Plaza which is just opposite the Ferry Building. That's the shot you see up there in the right-hand corner. The former owners were very strict. The project was designed by John Portman. He was very strict that all the storefronts had to look the same. He really loved concrete. In fact, he loved it too much in the case of Embarcadero Center. So what we did, is we, once we purchased the property we allowed retailers to come in and create their own sense of identity and it actually enlivened the retail areas. You can see here where we allowed different storefronts. The shot to your left also shows where second floor lobby level retail had no identity, no signage, no visibility basically from the street. And that lobby level space in the Promenade level has always been the most difficult to lease, so we created a program of doing window cuts which you see here in lower right-hand photo of putting retail windows in all of the lobby level spaces. That's probably allowed us to lease about 40,000 square feet of space through the years. That is again, was basically functionally obsolescent. Then on the Promenade level which is the top third level of the retail complex. Again some of the most difficult retail space we had. We went into a program of converting all this over to office space. In fact, we just finished the last where we leased 12,000 square feet to a law firm that we signed a deal with last year, O'Melveny &amp; Myers, who's going occupy 185,000 feet. So we're converting two former restaurant spaces into office space. And that will basically complete the successful transformation on all that Promenade level which was retail at one point, mostly vacant retail into office space. We did the same thing with Bingham McCutchen. Just to, in closing, I know that Bryan mentioned some of the relationships that he has with tenants. And I think it's very important when you look at Boston Properties that in the case of New York, where have O'Melveny &amp; Meyers as a tenant and we also have them in San Francisco, O'Melveny actually was in a different building in San Francisco, a building that we sold a couple of years ago. Their lease was coming up for renewal in a year, and they came to us and asked about moving back into Embarcadero Center and the main reason that they wanted to do it was because of the relationship that they had with Boston Properties both in San Francisco and New York. As David Cartwright said who's their Head of Real Estate, he finds us the most, the most responsible, the most reasonable landlord that's he's ever dealt with. And I think if you look at our tenant roster, I know that Bryan mentioned a couple of tenants like Ropes and Gray, again, a tenant that we have at Embarcadero Center, a deal that we did just a couple of years ago based on the relationship. I think as you look through our portfolio both in Washington, DC, San Francisco, New York, Boston, you'll see many of those similar relationships based on the fact that tenants want to do business with Boston Properties. Robert? ROBERT SELSAM, SVP, REGIONAL MANAGER - NEW YORK OFFICE, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Good morning, I'm obviously Robert Selsam, Regional Manager in New York. I want to start by telling you a little bit about what we're doing at Citigroup Center. We bought the building in April of 2001. And we saw that the building had not reached its full potential in the New York market. Why do I say that? Well when it was designed in the 1970s by Citibank using legendary architect, Hugh Stubbins, they conceived it as a big mixing bowl, where the public and office tenants, retail shoppers, and people from the neighborhood would all just wander throughout the complex using 10 different entrances on two different levels. And the result was that there was no office lobby to speak of. It was on two levels because of double-decker elevators. And it was so porous that there was just simply no defined office lobby and everything was all mixed together. So since we bought the building we've been trying to figure out how to sort all this out, which was not easy for a couple of reasons. Many of the public spaces received bonuses from the City of New York when the building was built and they were sacrosanct and we couldn't take anything away that had been made public. And the second thing that made it so difficult was the composition of the building was so well done that all the pieces fit together absolutely perfectly in a giant jigsaw puzzle that included St. Peter's Church on the corner of 54th and Lexington. As you see here that was part of the overall plan and its part of the condominium. But in the foreground you'll see a bridge leading into the building that for most of the last seven years, since we bought the building, has not been used. And therein was the opportunity that we saw to create a new office lobby. So we went back to the original Stubbins firm because who better to tinker with what's considered somewhat of a masterpiece than the original architect? And with their help we have come up with a plan which you can see here to make a new office lobby out of the underutilized north end of the elevator banks on the upper and lower level with a new -- well this is the upper level, this is the lower level. And separating these lobbies from the retail by walling off the corridors that connect to the retail to the east and walling off the elevator lobbies to the south, we're creating a secure and distinct office lobby out of space that was just underutilized before. And that's what it will look like on that bridge, a 35 foot high glass structure. Now all visitors to the building will have to use this entrance because that's where the security and the check in will be. But the tenants in the building can use any of the entrances they use today and have the additional benefit of this as an extra entrance. Here's the view looking from Lexington Avenue. You'll note that it says 601 Lexington on it. And that's because when we cut the ribbon on this new lobby late next spring, we're going to rebrand the tower as 601 Lexington Avenue. It just doesn't make sense to have be called Citigroup Center anymore. And frankly we're tired of the fact that every time Citibank has a problem all of the TV cameras come and photograph the Citigroup Center sign on the front of our building. So we think that this new lobby and this new rebranding will really let Citigroup Center take its place where it should be as one of the very top buildings in New York, recognized throughout the world. Next I want to talk about the GM Building which we're very excited to have as our flagship for the New York office. As most of you probably know, the GM Building is the trophy of trophy properties. It's simply the best, the mostly coveted building in New York City and it commands the highest available rents in the marketplace. Rents that even today exceed $200 and up at the top of the building. Let's start with the land that it sits on because it is a unique piece of property or dirt if you will. It's directly across from the Plaza Hotel, recently completely renovated into five-star hotel and luxury apartments. and it is cattycornered to Central Park, the preeminent edge of Midtown Manhattan. And it's at the juncture of the residential district on Fifth Avenue and the hotel and residential district on Central Park South. And this is directly across from Central Park. And the site occupies the entire block which is unique in Midtown to only a few buildings that actually go avenue to avenue, street to street. Now, looking at the building itself, its marble clad columns rise 50 stories straight up in the air out of a beautifully designed public plaza. Designed and redesigned public plaza that as Mort mentioned, is home to the Apple Store and now famous and tourist attracting Apple Cube which is a remarkable piece of architecture. There is a stair and an elevator in there that goes down to the lower level. As you can see a little bit better here, and there's not a piece of structural steel in it. It is all made of glass. And this store which has become probably the most successful by revenue, store of any of its kind, anything like it in the world has now become the northern anchor of Fifth Avenue retail district. And that is something that we intend to capitalize on, because the, much of the other retail space in the building have leases that expire between 2010 and 2012. And we will be taking advantage of the traffic that is now being brought to the front of the building. Now going into the building itself, the lobby is stark and white and monumental. And it speaks of power and elegance and it tells you a lot about the kind of tenants who are in the building. In fact, it's a lobby where the likes of Carl Ichan and Sandy Weill and [Teddy Forceman] and Ron Barron and William Lauder can run into each other on a daily basis. The footprint of the GM Building is as you see a rectangle with a bustle. And what I want to mention is that every floor is the same which allows great flexibility for large tenants. These floors work well for large tenants, but importantly they also work very well on a divided basis. And many of the tenants are on divided floors. What's so unique is that every floor right down to the third floor has fabulous Central Park views from what would be your upper left-hand corner. So there is no floor that doesn't have gorgeous views of Central Park and certainly as you get near the top, the views are breathtaking. And we have two tenants that occupy about 0.75 million square feet, long term leases that are probably at about half of market rents so there is nowhere to go but up in the long term. And in the meantime, we will continue to do what we always do which is proactively find opportunities to increase rents and enhance value which we will be doing. Thank you. DOUG LINDE: So just to sort of get back to summarize where we are and why we're talking about these assets, they're different. These are not generic office buildings. They are spectacular pieces of architecture. They're very unusual locations, but most importantly, when we grab these assets either through an acquisition or through development, we do things to those buildings and we do them on a perpetual basis. This team up here, these regions which as you'll see later have development, construction management, leasing, legal, property management constantly thinking about ways to enhance these buildings, do things to these buildings to improve their image, their positioning. But most importantly their attractiveness to the types of tenants that we have in our portfolio today so that we can keep these buildings full. And we can put these buildings in a position where they can demand premium rents through the tough times and when we have those opportunities where the cycles are working in our favor, get tremendous opportunities for rental rate expansion and growth which is what we just came through and where we've seen the opportunities. These are not buildings that you can look at as cash flows and compare them to the cash flows of any other private company nor any other public company, be it a New York City REIT or a suburban REIT or a national REIT. They're different. This portfolio and the assets that we have in this portfolio are fundamentally different types of real estate. And not only are they the kind of pieces of real estate that we put this kind of capital into and that we constantly are trying to reinvigorate, but they also retain their value in a way that's very different because of their location and because of their architecture and because of their design and because of the loving care that we give them. The world that we are in today, I think, is one where people are sort of pushing themselves away from thinking about replacement costs. People are thinking about well what's the right cap rate. How much leverage are you going to be able to put on this building? And those are really fair, appropriate ways to think about the valuation of real estate. But there is going to be a point in time when the cities that we're in, and the economy that we're in starts to grow again. And when there is growth, there will be the requirement for new construction. And these are the places, Midtown Manhattan, Back Bay of Boston, Reston, Virginia, Waltham Massachusetts, North of Market Street in San Francisco, where you're going -- the CBD of Washington, DC, where you're going to want to be located, and where you're going want to have assets. And we are in this for the long haul. We are not a company that is looking to make a quick exit. We're not a company that is looking to be a trader of real estate. We're a long term owner-operator of real estate. And when those buildings start to get built again, we can assure you that the value associated with that new construction will be significantly more in terms of what it costs than what our basis is in these buildings. And therefore, illustrate the value creation and upside, and again, the opportunity for enhanced rental rate appreciation and growth over the long term in those buildings. So as you think about New York City today and you think about the fact that there are lots of financial service companies that are in fact struggling. And that there is no question that rental rates at the General Motors Building are less today than they would have been had we not gone through the serious situation that we're going through today, that Mort talked about for the first hour of this conference. There's no question that rents are lower. But that doesn't mean that the long term value of this building is any less or more valuable than it was when we purchased it five and one-half months ago. The issue is, is how do you position yourself for the downtime? And it happens to be that we have one available floor today at the General Motors Building and we'll have two available floors at the end of 2010, and between now and then nothing. That's it. And if you look at the rest of our portfolio, our rollover is less than seven percent in 2009. And it's just about seven percent in 2010. So you're talking about the next two and one-quarter years, about 14% of our portfolio having some rollover exposure. And there are many of those transactions that we're actually working on right now. And we speak after lunch about the leasing markets, we'll talk about what's going on with some of those spaces, where we're going to be renewing tenants at rents that are significantly higher than the contractual rents. So there is, in fact, going to be appreciation and rental rate growth. So as I said before, we are going to see increasing funds from operation, be it the less perfect matrix that we're using today in our cash flow over time as we move forward. So with that, I will open it up for questions and then we'll take a break. Any questions for any of the folks up here? There being none, we'll take a 10 minute break and then we'll come back and Mike will talk about our capital situation. Thanks. (BREAK) &lt;Presentation UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well welcome back. I just want to quickly revisit what Doug, Bryan, Bob and Robert were saying about the asset characteristics that our assets have. They described a lot of characteristics of our assets and they really make intuitive sense if you're a tenant and what you are looking for, and our tenants are really our most important judge. And the proof that our strategy really comes from the actual performance of our assets. And it's -- as you see the yields on this chart here, this is the current annualized, unleveraged cash net operating income divided by our total basis in these assets. That includes the original acquisition costs, all capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions that we put into these assets. And as you can see, these properties are generating yields that are dramatically higher than what current market acquisition yields are. And more importantly, they've shown tremendous growth since we acquired these assets. These yields have grown anywhere from 150 to over 500 basis points from the yields that they showed when we first acquired the assets. The projected 2009 cash yield, as Mort indicated earlier, is 5%. And we expect given the below-market nature, substantially below-market nature, of the leases in that building, that the unleveraged yields that it will show in the future will be well in excess of the yields that are on this chart. It may take 10 to 15 years to get there, to get all the leases to roll over, but over the long term, we expect to see tremendous performance from that asset. Even given the current uncertainty in New York City and in the general economy, we believe in the long-term success of Midtown Manhattan. And especially in the sub-markets, like the Park Avenue sub-market and the Plaza District, where the limitation on supply is just really, really significant. I mean, it's just impossibly high barriers to entry when you cannot find land to develop in these markets. Unfortunately, this really is not a joke today. This is reality. I want to spend a few minutes talking about our capital structure, our access to capital and the status of the capital markets today. The long-term mentality that we employ with our assets also extends to how we capitalize ourselves. We believe in a stable balance sheet with long term, fixed rate debt. Our assets primarily contain long-term leases, as you've heard today already, and we purposely match those with similar lease terms capital. In fact, our average debt maturity is 8.5 years, which is actually longer than our average lease tenure, which is just over seven years. We use very little floating rate debt. Our only floating rate debt is typically our construction loan activity and whatever outstandings we may have under our line of credit. Again, we believe in matching fixed rate assets with fixed rate debt. Including our recent convertible debt offering, we have outstanding debt of $6.4 billion today. This equates to a moderate leverage ratio of 33%. This conservative leverage position provides us with options to access all types of capital, whether it be debt or equity, to finance new opportunities. The type of capital that we employ is really dependent on the scale of the opportunities that we see. We look at our leverage and our fixed coverage capacity in making these determinations. And we continue to be underleveraged and we are well above the fixed charge requirements that we look to operate at today. Just to look at our loan maturity profile, as you can see, it's very well laddered. And we actively manage these maturities. One example of this is when we did our recent convertible debt or exchangeable debt offering, we selected a 5.5 year term instead of what is typical in the marketplace for that product, which is a five-year term. It probably costs us a few extra basis points to go out just another six months, but to us it moved the maturity of that debt out into 2014. And if you look at the chart, you can see the green bar is our convertible debt offering that we did. So we have very, very few maturities in that period. We didn't really want it to be maturing in 2013, where some of our other unsecured bonds that we did several years ago are maturing. So we actively chose to push that out. Given the very, very difficult credit climate today, I'm happy to say that our near-term exposure to loans maturing is minimal. With the pay off our $275 million mortgage loan on Embarcadero Center, that we paid off in September, we only have one loan expiring this year, which is a $16 million loan on a suburban asset in Boston. I don't care what is going on in the world, I think that we can handle the $16 million loan maturity. In 2009, we have $270 million of loans expiring. The largest of which is a $200 million loan on our South of Market development project in Reston, Virginia. And that loan has two years of extensions available to it and it's priced at LIBOR plus 100, which is a very, very attractive rate in today's environment. So if you pull that loan out, we have very, very few expiries next year as well. If you look at 2010 and 2011, it starts to grow a little bit. In 2010, we have $500 million. In 2011, we have $615 million of mortgage debt expiring. In 2010, we also have our line of credit, which is shown on there. And our line of credit, which is $1 billion, has a one-year extension available to it through August of 2011. The mortgage maturities in these two years are mostly smaller facilities. They have an average size of $75 million and all of these properties have extremely low leverage. In fact, based upon the current conservative underwriting standards that most life insurance companies are employing today, we believe we can raise over $900 million of additional proceeds through the refinance of these assets. The current weighted average interest rate on these loans is roughly 7%. When we went public in 1997, in our first five years as a public company, we were wed to the secured debt markets. We had our unsecured line of credit available to us, but that was the only unsecured debt we have. And as you can see on this pie on the left-hand side, we all secured mortgages. In 2002, we recognized this risk and we made the decision to become a publicly rated company so we could access the investment grade bond market. This transition has enabled us to expand our access to capital and we're now a mature issuer in multiple markets. We have the convertible debt market, we have the unsecured investment grade unsecured bond market, we have the permanent mortgage debt market, with CMBS and life insurance companies and pension funds and foreign banks. And we have the commercial bank market, which provides a short term, both unsecured and secured debt to us. If you look back at this decision, and especially given today's environment, and we are just thrilled with the flexibility that this access has brought us. We're committed to maintaining our investment grade ratings and our current ratings are A- from Standard &amp; Poor's, BAA2 from Moody's and BBB from Fitch. We have been consistently active in all of the markets. We've raised $16 billion of debt since our IPO in 1997 and $21 billion of total capital. It's incredibly important for us to consistently access the markets and maintain solid relationships with our investors. And we've been very proactive with this practice and treat our investors like they're our partners. Even in the CMBS market, with causing the life insurance company lenders to be completely non-competitive in the market, we actively worked with these relationships so we could have them for the long haul. I can't tell you how many times that a banker called me or a life insurance banker called me and they said, \"You know, I just got a call from an old client of mine, he hasn't called me for over five years and now he wants something.\" Just like anything else, these lenders are going to work on the deal, where they're comfortable with the relationships that they're dealing with and where they -- the likelihood for actually closing a loan is the highest. In addition to the access to the debt and public equity markets, we have the ability to raise private equity as well. We can do this through joint venture equity, like we did with the GM building transaction and the other New York City acquisitions that we did. And we can also do this through issuance of operating partnership units. And we have used operating partnership units to our advantage in the past, because investors are very attracted to two things. One, they're attracted to the fact that they can get a deferral of their tax. Because they can exchange their interest in real property into interest in Boston Properties. But secondly, they're very comfortable investing in our currency. And as Doug showed on his chart, our performance has been fantastic over the years and these investors have benefited. This has led to follow-on opportunities with them and doing multiple deals with the same partners. A good example of this is our entree to the land acquisition at 250 West 55th Street. It was somebody who had formally done a transaction with it, 875 Third Avenue. These kind of relationships are really, really borne out when you enter a market like today. Even during the credit crisis, we have been successful in accessing the markets and we have raised over $2.2 billion of capital since August of 2007. This includes over $300 million of construction and bridge loans from the bank market, we increased our line of credit from $600 million to $1 billion, we raised $750 million in the convertible debt market and we raised over $700 million of private equity associated with the acquisitions in New York. We're currently working on several additional transactions that I wan to go through. Our financing of 4 Embarcadero Center. This mortgage loan, which is in the amount of $375 million, continues to progress. The length of time that it has taken is pretty significant, but we have signed a commitment letter and we've put up a hard deposit for this. We're now completing loan documents and we plan to close this transaction in the fourth quarter. The fact that we've been talking about this transaction, I think, for the last two quarters is really a demonstration of how arduous the process is to go get a secured mortgage today. We have multiple lenders competing for this opportunity because as Bob pointed out, this is a fantastic asset. We're looking for a conservative leverage position. But once we chose a lender, the process to actually get to a commitment letter and negotiating the terms of that commitment letter has taken many, many months. Many more months than it would have taken 12 months ago, because of the current environment. We're also in the market for a construction loan on our Russia Wharf project. Russia Wharf is a very attractive opportunity to the bank market for a couple of reasons. One is the fantastic location and the design of the building is great. But probably the most important thing is the market acceptance that is already shown. The office space is already 82% pre-leased to Wellington Management Company. And that is one of the most important things that construction lenders are looking for today. Market acceptance, pre-leasing. We've received a good response from our relationship lenders for this opportunity and we are assessing term sheets that contain more than sufficient capacity to fund the remaining costs in the project. Going forward, over the next 12 months or so, we expect to continue to access the market. We're going to enter the market with a couple of more construction loans, including our 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue project in Washington DC as well as potentially raising another $250 million to $500 million of permanent debt capital, or long-term debt capital. All of these potential financings do not assume that we do new acquisition activity and are really designed to build additional dry powder for those opportunities, so we can be opportunistic when we see attractive investments. I just want to quickly go through the terms of our recent exchangeable debt offering. In August, about six weeks ago, we raised $747 million in this market. And the purpose was to restock our liquidity after the acquisition of the GM Building and the other buildings in New York that occurred in June and in August. The execution of this financing went exceedingly well. The -- we had a target capital raise of $500 million and because of the strong market demand that we saw, we were able to up size it to almost $750 million. We really felt the convert market offered the most efficient price capital at the time. The loan period's a coupon of three and five-eighths, we purchased a capped call, which increased our exchange rate from 20% above the price at the time, which was 100 and -- which was 20% above, it was $118 a share to $137 a share. And the all in effective interest rate of the loan, which includes the discount, any fees and the cost of the capped call, is 5.36%. We see this as very attractively priced capital for 5.5 years. I do want to note that a modification to accounting regulations, going into effect in 2009, will affect this convert as well as our other converts and requires us to report GAAP interest expense above the 5.36%. This one of several non-cash FFO measures that will be impacting our financial statements going forward, and as Doug mentioned, the impact of many of the GAAP rules are rendering FFO pretty irrelevant for companies like ours. In addition to the APB 14-1 rule that affects convertible debt, that's going to require us to book non-cash interest expense of somewhere between $0.20 and $0.22 in 2009, we also have FAS 141, or fair value lease accounting, which is impactful with our New York City transactions. If you look at the GM Building and the other three New York City buildings, that's going to add $0.64 to $0.65 to our FFO in 2009. In addition, we have non-cash G&amp;A. That includes stock compensation and the amortization of our outperformance plan. The expense related to that in 2008 is about $0.16 of non-cash expense. Our goal, with respect to all of these non-cash items and some of the accounting issues that we have to deal with, is to try to be completely transparent to our investors. So in our supplemental package, in our calls, we're going to provide to you all of the adjustments that you need so that you can get to what is the more meaningful cash earnings of the company. If I'm this banker, all I can say is at least it's not a closure. Unfortunately, there's going to be many, many mergers and bank closures as a result of the crisis that is going on. So what is the real impact to the market? Clearly the capacity of credit in the market is down. You heard Mort talk about it quite a bit. There's fewer and fewer lenders that are open for business every week. We have historically seen the result of these bank mergers on credit capacity. And unfortunately, it is consistently the fact that one plus one equals one. One plus one does not equal two. So even when things normalize, it's likely that capacity is going to be a little bit lower. With financing needs currently outstripping the supply of capital, lenders are being incredibly cautious, moving very, very slowly and they're extremely selective. All are looking for high-quality assets, mature Tier 1 markets, stable leasing profiles and good credit. Any red flag in a deal can blow up a deal. And there's just no room for storied transactions in today's environment. Leverage requirements have dropped precipitously, with lenders seeking 50% to 60% loans and strong in-place cash flow and pricing has gone through the roof. There's very, very little room for price negotiations today and spreads on all types of credits has moved up 150 basis points to north of 300 basis points from where it was before. All of this is bad news for borrowers. But there is a silver lining here. Those companies that have access to capital and conservative balance sheets will be able to take advantage of the deleveraging that is going to occur in many of these portfolios. In these markets, sponsorship and credibility are paramount and companies like Boston Properties will be able to use this to competitive advantage going forward. So the million dollar question is who has the capital. Who is lending today? Well I can tell you that the phone is ringing off the hook at the banks and the life insurance companies. They are the only outlets. They know they're the only outlets. And they're not immune to problems of their own. The domestic banks have traditionally been the source for short-term financing, construction loans and even permanent capital for middle market real estate. And they are capital constrained today. Many have well-documented exposures to sub-prime assets and other credit issues that are affecting their willingness to lend. Our direct experience with this market is that stronger banks continue to lend for their good, existing relationships. And only for their good existing relationships. However, pricings is up and hold levels are down. You used to see banks willing to put out $100 million, $125 million on a transaction without batting an eye. Many of them are $40 million or $50 million today. Pricing for a construction loan is now in the 250 to 300 basis point range over LIBOR. This is up from 100 to 150 basis points and fees are 1% to 2% for a three-year commitment. Foreign banks have been very active, particularly the German banks. They've been doing both short term and long term floating rate financing. And many borrowers have used them for long-term mortgages, where they will provide seven- to 10-year floating rate deals and they get swapped to fixed. Pricing has been competitive in the 200 basis point area over LIBOR for term loans, but it's definitely showing signs of strain. The foreign banks are also very focused on select sponsors, top-tier markets and asset quality. As has been evidenced by some of the difficulties in many of the European banks that have just been coming up this week, the capital flowing from these institutions is probably going to slow. The life insurance companies are really the steady Eddies of the market. They have a totally different funding source, and that source is very stable. They have been consistent in lending $40 billion to $50 billion annually to the real estate market over the years. And they did not get caught up in the fever that happened over the last couple of years. They simply maintained their underwriting discipline and put out as much money as they needed to and no more. I expect they will continue to do so, but they're not interested in filling the breach that is left by CMBS. They only want to rebuild the quality of their portfolios that were degradated slightly because the CMBS market took so much of the market share of the highest quality assets that the insurance companies were forced to down tier over the last few years. So now those companies are really looking to up tier into higher quality assets. They're aware of their position, as the long-term lender of choice today, and they've pushed pricing up and their underwriting standards have come in. Pricing over treasuries is currently 275 to 350 basis points and they have minimum floors on all-in rates that range anywhere from 6% to 6.5% today. The other thing that the life insurance companies are doing today is they're driving the leverage parameters for the entire market. The bank market typically looks to the life insurance company market as their takeout. So as the life insurance company lenders reduce their leverage, all of the banks are reducing how much they want to lend against assets as well. Leverage parameters, as I said, are definitely sub-60%. Life insurance companies are also concerned about overall debt coverage capacity that each property has, so their willingness to accept secondary financing or mezzanine financing on their loans is really limited. Moving on to the convert market, the convertible debt market has been a very active market and a great market for all of the REITs over the past few years. You can see it by some of the transactions that we have done over the last couple of years. The majority of these investors are hedge funds, however. And the market has recently been shaken up over the whole short sale restrictions that have come in that limited their ability to maintain their hedges or set up their hedges on their assets. Even those companies that don't have short sale restrictions on them, there's just a concern that they will have short sale restrictions on them. This has caused the entire convertible market to start trading very, very poorly and it's very dislocated. And it's brought the new issue market to a halt. Today, only six weeks after we did our $747 million deal, we cannot even get a bid from the convert market. The investment grade bond market is open, but it continues to be totally inactive to issuers and it's really due to historically wide credit spreads. Borrowing spreads in this market have been volatile and they're currently 400 basis points plus for companies like ours. This -- on a 10-year basis, relates to a borrowing cost of 7.75% or more. To date, most issuers, including ourselves have been able to raise capital elsewhere and they've avoided increasing the borrowing cost by accessing this market. Due to the overall inhospitability of the debt markets, we've definitely seen companies start to access equity markets. Just in the past few weeks, there's been, I think, 14 deals and its raised almost $2 billion in the REIT market. But the retail market driving this demand and institutional buyers being more cautious, the size of these transactions and your ability to access this market in size is somewhat questionable. And also you've got so much stock price volatility out there that it's a significant factor. I wanted to talk for a little bit about the CMBS market. You look at that market from 2005 to 2007 and the market originated over $600 billion of loans, which was roughly 40% of all new mortgage loans that were originated. If you just look at 2007, that market share actually grew to in excess of 50% of all new mortgage loans that were originated. As is well documented, the market crashed in late 2007, and spreads widened dramatically and everybody got stuck with their positions. This situation continues today, with BBB spreads north of 2,400 basis points. These spreads are crazy and they demonstrate the total lack of confidence that investors currently have in the CMBS market. Its resulted in the market being shut down for all of 2008, as you can see on the chart, only $12 billion of loans in 2008, and there's really no sign of this market returning. I believe that there's definitely a place for this market. It's probably going to come back and it's going to look like it did in the early 2000s, but the timing for that market coming back is more likely many years from now. Multiple years from now. And the loans on the books, the CMBS loans on the books, however, remain. And the CMBS market equates to 25% of all commercial mortgages today. If you think about it, CMBS, the mortgage REITs, the finance companies and many of the banks are out of the market today. It's likely that less than 50% of the market on this pie actually exists today in the market. It's pretty well documented that similar to the sub-prime residential market, the commercial mortgage underwriting standards in the last few years deteriorated to a place where a rational investor would not have invested. This not only included an increase in interest-only loans from being the exception to being more than 90% of new CMBS loans that were originated, but it was also in the analysis of cash flow. And the techniques that people use to size loans. There was a lot of use of future rental bumps and averaging leases to come up with loan sizes, ultra low, going in, loan coverages, sometimes below one times, and the institution of escrows that would cover the deficit cash flow of these properties for multiple years. Equity requirements were also drastically reduced to sometimes less than 5%. Today's more conservative underwriting has a huge impact on loan sizing and is going to drive further deleveraging over the next few years. This slide represents an actual February 2007 loan and it -- on the right-hand side, the September 2008 underwriting that we are experiencing today. Despite the reduction in treasury rates by 75 basis points, credit spreads have gone out 175 basis points. So borrowing costs are up. The loan-to-value ratios have come in. And more importantly, debt service coverage requirements, in place debt service coverage requirements, have gone from 1.1 times or sometimes below to at least 1.25 times and including an amortization schedule of either 25 or 30 years. If you just look at this analysis, and you try to size a loan to $20 million of cash flow, you get a 35% reduction in proceeds levels for the same asset. I have to say that it's very unlikely that we will ever return to the kind of underwriting standards that we saw in 2006 and 2007. Looking at the future debt maturity pipeline in the CMBS market, there are more than $50 billion of CMBS debt maturities in 2010 through 2012 that were originated as five-year floaters. These are only the loans that were originated as five-year floaters. And they were originated in the 2005 to 2007 period. So these are really the, I guess, the poster children of weak underwriting. If we assume that all of these were underwritten at maximum proceeds level, it could required $17.5 billion of equity to refinance these assets. In addition to these loans, there's an additional $80 billion of other CMBS loans that expired during this time frame, for a total of $130 billion expiring during this period. This compares to roughly $30 billion of maturities in 2008 and 2009. And again, it's only the CMBS market. So to date, when you look at the reduction in credit capacity, the real effect is it's slowed down transactions. There hasn't been that much refinancing requirements that have been affected, but as these debt maturities come due, it's going to force the action. And as you can see, the problem can really start to snowball on owners needing to refinance. So looking forward to 2010, I would say it certainly promises to offer some interesting opportunities for those companies that are well capitalized, like we are. So what does this credit mess mean for us? And what are we doing? Our goal is to ensure that we have ready access to all of the capital markets. No one could have predicted the dislocation that has occurred, but one thing is very, very clear. Access to a wide variety of capital is crucial for success today. Liquidity is precious. We're focused on maintaining our liquidity in terms of cash on the balance sheet, availability under committed lines of credit and balance sheet capacity. We're confident with our ability to fund our future development needs and -- over the next couple of years. And we're also going to tap the market consistently to continue to build that liquidity. This includes some of the transactions I've talked about, including Embarcadero Center and some of the construction loans that we plan to do. Lastly, we will continue to foster and grow our relationships with our capital partners. Our performance over the past 30 years with these partners has enabled us to build a reputation of a company that backs up words with performance. This credibility is irreplaceable when you are asking -- looking to seek a piece of that shrinking pie of capacity. Overall, I think you can see we feel pretty good about the capital markets. It's pretty tough out there. But honestly, in this type of tough market, there is a clear distinction between the people that can get credit and the people that can't get credit. There's a clear distinction in the pricing and the access to capital. And we believe that this is going to have -- this is going to give us a competitive advantage over the next two years. If anybody has any questions or anything, I'd be happy to respond. [Michael]? Questions and Answers UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible) UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: That's a good question, Michael. I mean, it's really things that are on the margin. We are accustomed to driving the process of what the terms of those loans are. And certainly as -- over the last five or seven years, we came up with a standard loan document that we would be willing to accept and that we negotiated with these lenders. And specifically with the lenders that we're doing this transaction with. And the times have changed a little bit and they're trying to change the rules. Now it's not on the interest rate or the loan proceeds or anything, but it's related for how much it costs to transfer the asset if you want to transfer the asset. Things that are on the margin like that. Amortization terms. We used to be able to drive interest-only periods for significantly longer. And today you can't. I mean, you really have to agree to a 25- or a 30-year amortization schedule. Typically a 30-year amortization schedule for loans -- for properties of the quality of ours. So it's really items that are on the margins that we were accustomed to being able to negotiate. And one of the reasons it took so long is not that we've continued to try to negotiate some of those terms, it's just it took forever for the institutions to go back and get an answer from their teams. Because they were focused on other things. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, I had a question on the CMBS loan maturities. I seem to recall that that is an aggregate amount and that's not broken down by product type. There is a difference between how many office maturities there will be versus retail versus residential. Have you -- I can see the data. Have you actually found that this is something that, on the office side, that sellers are interested or at least those that own those are starting to talk to you right now for the 2010? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure what the breakdown of the CMBS expiries are between the different product types. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's about 25% to 30% of more expirations are office? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: About 25% to 35% of the expirations are office product. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: So just interested, you mentioned that these are opportunities, as these products come due, or have maturities. There's no talk yet or you haven't talked with some of these folks as opportunities a year, two years out. Because if I'm -- that's something coming due in 2010, I'm not going to wait until 2010. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, I think the question is, is they may not try to wait until 2010 to refinance that debt, but it's an issue of whether they can actually raise the capital needed to refinance that debt. If there is -- if they're kind of upside down with respect to the current leverage position. And where they're going to get that equity to refinance that asset. And it's going to force people to sell those assets and potentially create additional opportunities in the marketplace for companies to have the capital to buy in that market. So if there's a significant amount of office product that is coming available, we're going to be in a position where we can take advantage of that. Because we have the multiple access to capital. Many of the private companies that bought these assets during 2005 and 2006 and 2007 only have access to the secured debt markets. And we have access to many other markets, including the equity markets, so that we are in a position, if we see opportunities that are attractive, to take advantage of them. And that's what we plan to do. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you for that. As a follow-up, did you know any of the specific assets that are collateralized by some of these 2010 maturities? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I really don't know specific assets. I don't really want to comment on specific assets, to be honest with you. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay. There is obviously, when you look at the 2008 expirations, obviously the [Maclo] transaction was the one that stuck out in February, which represented an opportunity. But if I look at this chart, and I look at the opportunities that will be coming, in 2010, 2011 and 2012, it would appear to me that there would be more opportunities coming at a time when the economic landscape is a little more -- is more sour than it is today. So just trying to match that with how patient your capital is when you look out at these investment opportunities to 2010 and 2012. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I think Doug wants to answer that. DOUG LINDE: Yes, the short answer is we do know where a number of the other well renowned opportunities are. It's no secret that Broadway Partners has interesting assets that have maturities in 2009. Hancock, we understand, has got a maturity pretty soon. There are also a book of loans that Lehman Brothers underwrote, many of which are underwater from a debt service perspective. So those maturity dates have come much sooner. I would say that we are going to patient and we are probably going to be less aggressive in an environment where the TED spread is 400 basis points, than we would be if AT&amp;T and General Electric could actually issue commercial paper, where there wasn't another bank potentially being assumed by somebody else, every other week, and that the current environment is not one where you want to necessarily use up your liquidity. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mike, could you talk about where required returns have gone for private equity for your joint venture capital? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I think Doug might be the best person to answer that question as well. DOUG LINDE: Just say that again? UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: For private capital or joint venture equity, where have required returns gone? DOUG LINDE: I actually happened to have a conversation with our -- one of our partners on Monday. And here's sort of the example they gave me. And you can take this for what it's worth. They said, \"Well, clearly you set a bar with the General Motors Building. So we're not going to look at anything that doesn't have a current return that is in -- lower than what you guys are projected to get in the first year or so at the General Motors Building.\" By -- what we do as sovereign wealth funds is we look around the world. And if you look around the world, there are dislocations that are occurring in other marketplaces that are significantly more attractive right now than what we are seeing from a transactional perspective in the United States. So as an example, we were talking about two transactions in London, one of them was the Norman Foster Building in the center of the city that just was acquired in a, I think, a 6/7 or a 6/8 cap rate, and then the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Building in Canary Wharf, where the debt's coming due, the borrower put $200 million or GBP200 million of equity in, the equity's gone. They can't service the debt. The building is going to be sold, probably, again by HSHB and expectations are it's going to go for 6.5% or 7.5% going in return. So at the moment, I would say that the relative value, dollars per square foot, replacement costs sort of thinking for at least some of the sovereign wealth funds, has been replaced by a current return, opportunistic view of the world that looks at things and says, things are probably going to get worse before they get better. So we're going to be patient as well. It doesn't mean for the right transaction they wouldn't do something. In fact, we were actually talking about a building in Washington DC that they were interested in pursuing and we -- whether or not we would be willing to partner with them, which had a yield that was similar to what we were -- I was just describing. But they are -- I would say they are certainly, based upon what has occurred with their investments in the US investments in particular for the financial services companies, are certainly not as aggressively looking to deploy capital as they might have been a year ago. But they are -- they have clearly got a commitment to diversify their asset bases and put money into real estate and putting money into real estate in the United States over the next period of time. I don't know if that next period of time is six months or 12 months or 18 months. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great. I think I will turn the program over to Mike Walsh, who's going to talk a little bit about development. &lt;Presentation MIKE WALSH, SVP - FINANCE, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Hello everyone. In our next segment, the panelists up here will walk through development, our history, some of the current projects that we have underway, the impact of those projects on NOI. Mitch Norville, our Chief Operating Officer, will go through our development process. And in addition, we'll talk about, in the various markets, where we see replacements costs. And then we'll hear from our on-the-ground experts. And I think we're sitting a little out of order for the presentation, but [Rob Silpey] will go through 250 West 55th Street. He's our on-the-ground expert and Head of Development in New York City. Peter Johnson, who is our Regional Manager in Washington DC will walk through Reston Town Center. And Mike Cantalupa, who's the Head of Development here in Boston will walk through our green initiatives. Development has always been, as you heard Mort, as you heard Doug, if you grab any member of management, it's always been part of Boston Properties' growth strategy. As you can see from the slide, since our IPO, we've developed about $2.9 billion worth of products. And those are first class, iconic, trophy, you can pick the adjectives, but they are the best buildings in those markets. They're building such as 111 Huntington Avenue here in Boston. The two towers in Times Square, 5 Times Square and Times Square Tower. 901 New York Avenue in Washington DC. And 2.5 million square feet in Reston Town Center. And what we found over the 38 years that we've been developers is that development projects will yield a much greater return on our invested equity than comparably located and designed acquisitions. And in addition, they're typically state-of-the-art, and we know ours are, are state-of-the-art assets, which require less investment as far as near-term capital over the first five to 10 years of their existence. And of the 10.7 million square feet that we've developed since our IPO, we still own about 8.6 million square feet. And today, those projects are yielding 11.5% on a cash-on-cash basis and I think that just proves our statement. One additional item that I noticed when we were looking at this is that in Midtown Manhattan, we developed two office towers, 5 Times Square and Times Square Tower for a total project cost of $1.19 billion. Well, in the spring of 2000 -- actually February of 2007, we sold 5 Times Square for $1.28 billion, so at the end of the day, I understand that we own Times Square Tower basically at no cost. Our current development pipeline consists of about 10 projects, with a total cost, as I mentioned, of $2.44 billion. And of the $2.44 billion, we either have funded with equity, funded with debt or funded with existing construction facility commitments, about $1.1 billion of that. We'll fund the remaining $1.3 billion with a combination of construction financing, Mike talked about Russia Wharf and 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue, where we'll be in the market for construction financing. Secured financing on existing unencumbered assets, remember that we sold $4.3 billion of assets over the last several years and we've unencumbered our balance sheet over that time frame. And with our $1 billion line of credit. And before I go into a few of these projects, and you're going to meet with some of the project managers later on today, I just want to talk about what we include in project costs because I think we're a little bit different. We include typical hard costs, soft costs, tenant improvement, leasing commission. We also include operating costs during the lease-up phase of the project and real estate taxes. But during the entire phase, the entire development process, we include a real return on our equity. I think that differentiates us a little bit. 77 CityPoint, you'll actually in -- on the bus tours today, we'll head out to our CityPoint development and you'll meet [Rich Monopoly], who's the project manager. This project has the distinction of being the first lead pre-certified project in Waltham, Massachusetts. So we're excited about that. It's 100% leased. The first tenants took occupancy earlier this year and in December, it will be 100% occupied. South of Market, there's two phases, and I'll hold off on that and let Peter explain a little bit more. Annapolis Junction is a 50% joint venture that we have with a local developer. It's a highly secured facility. It's basically plug-and-play for government contractors, who, because of the BRAC requirements, will be forced to move off the base, which is Fort Meade, directly adjacent, and move into this space. You'll see -- notice the high per unit cost and I can tell you that the rents are commensurate with that. We just received our accreditation from the government agencies this week, so we expect to be leasing that up in the near future. Wisconsin Place is a 1.1 million square foot mixed use development in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Our part in this project is to be the development manager. I think since 2005 we've been development manager for the infrastructure, which the garage where atop will sit an office product, which we're a two-thirds owner in. It's 55% preleased and we're in active discussions for the remainder of that space. 701 Carnegie Center is a build-to-suit for Princeton University down in our Carnegie Center project. 250 West 55th Avenue is our latest office tower in New York City. It's 22% leased to the law firm of [Gibbs and Dunn] and, as Mort said, we're in active discussions with tenants for the remainder of the space and Rob Silpey will go into more details on that in a few minutes. Russia Wharf, or 280 Congress Street, which is directly adjacent to us, is 815,000 square foot mixed use project where we're pleased to say that we've leased 82% of the office space to Wellington Management, which will help us in our financing. Wellington's taking the ninth floor, which is the first floor of office space, and floors 14 to 31. So we'll have 100,000 square feet on floors 10 through 13 with fantastic views in all directions. There is a residential component to this as well, a little over 200,000 square feet. And we'll develop the core and shell and look to either sell or partner with a residential developer. And Jeff Lowenberg, our project manager, will be meeting many of you across the way after lunch, where we have a great view of the site and several boards. And Jeff will go through the project in more detail. And last, but certainly not least, is 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue. Or as my good friend, Ray Ritchey says, the best damn site in Washington DC. This project is about 430,000 square feet of office, 72,000 square feet of retail and 330,000 square feet of residential. And similar to Russia Wharf, we'll develop the core and shell of the residential component and look to either partner or sell the residential. The project's not scheduled for delivery until 2011 to 2012 and we're already in active discussions with triple net rents in the $55 to $65 range. I want to take a moment and take our development pipeline into perspective because $2.44 billion in this environment seems rather large. Back in 2001, we had $1.9 billion underway and we were a company to about a total market cap of $8.2 billion, so that represents about 23%. Today the $2.44 billion, based on our company's size, is only 12%. So as a percentage of the company, it's not as large an endeavor. And, by the way, that 65% that's in the -- on this slide for 2001 included a tenant by the name of Arthur Anderson. After Arthur Anderson had their issues, that space was given back to us. It went back down to 53% and we were left with a 1.2 million square foot tower in Midtown Manhattan, entirely unencumbered by leases, being delivered into a difficult economic environment. Well I think there's lessons to be learned there. We believed in the real estate that well designed, well located, well managed product will do well even in bad times. And our leasing team, within six months of completion of the project, we were 85% leased and shortly thereafter we approached 95% to 100%. And our returns in this project were basically in line with our underwriting. As Doug and Mike have said on various earnings calls, we expect to yield about a 7.5% to 8% cash-on-cash yield on our CBD projects and somewhere between 8% and 11%. And you could throw all of that into a spreadsheet, you come up with an average of about 8% cash-on-cash return for our development projects. If you take that with $2.4 billion and subtract out cost of debt of about 6.5%, that means that in -- by the completion of this, we'll deliver about $36 million of cash NOI to the bottom line. Add in about 100 basis points for straight-line rent and add $60 million of incremental FFO generated just from 12% of our portfolio. In addition to the project underway, we either have on our balance sheet or under control about 12 million square feet of additional development. Now going back to the slide that we started with, with the $2.44 billion, 75% of those projects came from the shadow development pipeline. So it's incredibly important that we have, on our balance sheet or under control, land which is the raw material to help us grow. And these future sites are such as 10 and 20 CityPoint, and we'll talk more about that when we go out to Waltham today, Weston Corporate Center out in Weston, Massachusetts, projects such as 888 Wilson Street, which Bryan Koop spoke about. So while we don't expect to go forward on these projects on a speculative basis, we feel that we're well positioned to complete the projects that we have underway, to lease those projects and to actively look for new projects with the land base that we have, which will fuel Boston Properties' future growth. With that, I turn it over to Mitch. MITCH NORVILLE, EVP, COO, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. I've been asked to do a couple of things. One, we're going to share some cost information, there goes my mike, I'm going to change the slide. There you go. Too far. We're going to share a little bit of cost information on our projects with you and talk a little bit about that and probably leave most of the discussion for the end of the period, if you have any questions. And I'm going to talk a little bit about our development process, kind of our disciplined approach, and tie it into a few comments that Doug and Mort made earlier today. So could we go to the construction costs slide, at the risk that we've gone too far. No, you've got to go backwards. There you go. Or I guess we're missing that slide. No, it was the first slide. All right. You have it in your book. So let's talk about construction costs. Essentially what we've done is we've created a chart, which we can't seem to find on the slide show, that's okay. I've got a copy here. And you guys have it in front of you, hopefully. But what we've tried to do is give you an idea of what our construction cost basis is in each of our regions by the various product types that we develop. And we're actively either in pre-development or actually in development in the moment. As you look through the chart, you'll see CBD costs, revenue costs and so on. We've kind of broken out hard and soft costs, which what we're calling base construction costs, from the TIs and leasing commissions, which kind of vary by region and by transaction type as well. Please note that these costs do not include land or parking costs. And land and parking are just too big of variables to kind of stick into a chart like this and have any real meaning. Just for instance, on parking, in a suburban project, we typically have, the kind we're doing, high rise suburban projects. We typically have structured parking. The cost of a suburban parking space can vary anywhere from 12,000, 15,000 a space to 25,000 a space, depending on the site constraints, the size of the parking facility and the method of construction. So we didn't think that giving you any information, based on how we're doing our various projects, would actually give you a number that had any real basis. Again, this is a snapshot. It's kind of based on what we have in progress and what we have planned to go forward in the next two or three years. Again, I'd like to leave discussion for this to the end, so I'm going leave this here. We're going to move on to the next slide, which I'll try again. Yes. Here we go. We're backing up. And we're going to talk a little bit about our disciplined approach and process to development. Essentially development is a series of stages or activities that I'm going to run through here in a second, but I want to tie into a couple of things I said earlier before we get started. Mort mentioned earlier on that a few years back, we decided to become sellers of real estate. At about the same time, we really ramped up our development pipeline and unfortunately for us, we were actively already in predevelopment in lots of projects and something we had done at the last downturn to keep things going. Because if you're not in pre-development, if you're not actually out there doing some of the stuff we're going to talk about now, you can't just turn the switch on, become developers. You kind of have to be in this process year in and year out. And because we're in the process year in and year out, you have to have a very disciplined approach. You have to be able to use your underwriting abilities, so that even when the market is doing what it's doing right now, kind of turning in the other direction a little bit. And like it did with, as Mike just mentioned, at Anderson in New York, that you can still be successful. That you can still be a successful developer. We've never -- Doug said earlier, we've never timed the market from a standpoint of we're just trying to work in the hot times and not produce in the slow times. So again, as that as a backdrop, let's kind of move into the various stages of the process. Obviously the first stage of development is kind of conceptualization of what we're trying to do. And in this period, we're managing against risk and we're trying to manage against, at this particular phase, all development risk. So everything you've heard earlier about financing, design and stuff we're going to talk about, and basically the only thing we can rely on during the conceptual phase is our experience. And I think as you go through the case studies you're going to hear behind me, you're going to see that we have a very deep, a very experienced development team, which allows us to have some faith and courage at this stage of the game to either go out and buy property or to actually start a development when there's spec conditions. So moving on to the next phase, it's kind of entitlements. And the risk we're kind of managing against in entitlements are zoning risks. And that's density and use as well as site plans, permits and approvals. And all these risks tie into our ability to actually pick a building size, pick a building type, be able to do something we think is going to be successful in the market and convince jurisdictions that we're doing the right thing. How do we manage these risks? Well basically it's our knowledge of the process, it's our relationships with the various authorities that we've built over time. These relationships with authorities don't happen over night. It takes many projects, making our commitments to authorities and delivering on our commitments that allows us to move projects through this process, the entitlement process, and have something we can actually go forward with and be successful with. Kind of the next phase is design. And in design, we're managing -- obviously we're managing through a cost basis. So we want to make sure that we draw something that meets the market, has the quality we're looking for, can be delivered in a time basis we're trying to deliver it in, but at the same time, is at a cost we think meets the market and what we can do on the rent side. Again, how do we manage design? We have a very established process, a very team approach to design, which involves all aspects of our company. We have our leasing guys involved, our property management people involved, we have our construction people involved. We just -- we don't have development cowboys out there running around, designing buildings and turning it over to our other groups and saying, \"Hey, make this a success.\" We approach it from a very team involved approach and also we have very established relationships with our consultants, which allows us to get sometimes that extra oomph on our projects, whether it be a time commitment or a little better design. We know the people to pick. We know the best design people at a particular firm. We know the best people to hire from a project perspective that are going to deliver drawings to us that are 100% correct. So we can buy them at a better price. Again, being in the marketplace, knowing those people and knowing those consultants gives us a bit of an advantage that we try to take advantage of as we go through the design process. Obviously overlapping with the design is the construction process. Again, it costs quality and time. And how do you manage against those risks? Again, our contracting process varies from project to project. On a large New York project, we're probably going to do a GMP. We're going to involve the contractor from day one, he's going to be a part of our team. He's going to provide us information. We're going to get volume from a general contractor and from the sub-markets as we design our buildings and so that we've got to build our building where we're going to hit our budgets. On a stand alone suburban building, like Princeton, let's take the Princeton Building at Carnegie Center, we can design that building into a shorter time frame. Our construction process is more defined. We're probably going to go out to bid. And we're going to bid to GCs. And we think we can get the best price. We're going to work with two or three GCs we're very comfortable with and we're going to try to get the best price. So what I'm trying to get through is that we're going to match the contracting process to the project. And we're going to do it based upon our knowledge of what's going on in the market, are there any constraints that we have to work around on the contracting side and how do we get the best price and the best quality. Again, it -- our construction process is, again, a team involvement. And that kind of runs through the whole process here for us on the development side and that it's not just our construction guys, our project manager guys are very involved. Again, our property management guys are very involved, to make sure that we design and build the project that works for us from a cost standpoint, from an operating standpoint, and kind of meets the leasing market from a layout standpoint and from a does it have the kind of -- we call it the gee whiz factor. Does it catch a client's attention? Does it have the -- is the money spent in a way that we create value from a tenant's perspective so that their front door creates the image? You heard Bryan talk a little earlier about the lobby at the Pru Center. Does it convey the right image for the kinds of tenants we want to bring in? Those are all things that are built into the development process as well as how we manage our existing assets. Finally, on the construction side, we have established contractor relationships. Again, it allows us to pick the best people that work for those contractors to do our projects. It allows us to develop relationships with those people from project to project. So each project [isn't] a different activity for us. It's not another learning curve that we know people, they know how we work, they know how we want to get things done, we're able to, lots of times, save time and save money because of those relationships. Okay. Leasing. Again, you're going to hear our leasing team talk a little bit about demand and supply kinds of things and terms. And leasing people are very important to our development process. Obviously pre-leasing, you heard a lot about pre-leasing earlier today. I think Mike just told you we're about 50% pre-leased with the stuff we have under active development today and that's been a tenure of our company for 30, 40 years. We've never been a company that didn't stress pre-leasing. Even in good times, we stress pre-leasing. We don't just go out and build buildings because the market's better. We still stress pre-leasing. That's how you manage when the market turns and if things don't go your way necessarily. And the leasing team is a huge part of that process. That's their job. In setting terms, again, we look to our leasing guys to help us set the terms, to create flexibility in our development projects so that we're managing the downside. You don't have to manage the upside. The upside's going to come too. You have to manage the downside. So are we getting into development projects where based on the terms we're going out and the terms do deteriorate on us a little bit, are we still going to have a pretty good development at the end of the day? Not a catastrophe kind of thing. Again, if you're building, as Doug said, iconic assets that people want to be in, even when the things turn down, terms get worse, vacancy grows, people are going to be in your assets. People still have to renew leases, they have to move, businesses still have to operate. So as long as we're in the marketplace at the right place, with our developments, we can still be overall successful. Again, on the leasing side, we use pre-leasing return thresholds to make sure we have -- we manage our downside and we use our broker relationships to make sure we get in front of tenants that might not consider us. They might not consider us. They might think we're too expensive. They might think we're in the wrong part of town. The essential is a great idea of hey, have you guys really thought about what you can do if you come to one of our buildings? And we use those relationships to get in front of tenants to promote our developments as well. Okay, financing, Mike just spent a long time talking about financing so I'm not going to beat this one. Just simply say that, again, our ability to get capital, our ability to control cost is a huge, huge, huge, especially in these kind of times, advantage for us in our development pipeline. It also helps in our ability to make commitments to tenants. If you think about a tenant, and we're negotiating with tenants, in New York and Washington who are basically looking at buildings that have just started, you know we're 10, 20, 30 feet down in the ground and these tenants are looking at us and saying, \"Geez, can Boston Properties complete, can they finish? Are we willing to, to put our marbles in their basket and count on them to get to where we need to be?\" Again, we're -- our financing, our ability to get money when we need to get money is a big part of that process to us, being successful again, on the development side. Finally, just closing out the process discussion, from a risk point-of-view, is we spent a lot in our developments from the very beginning making sure that we design in and we build in ways to control cost, both from a staffing standpoint and our operating cost standpoint on our projects. Again, it's a team effort, it starts with our property managers, it plays to our leasing guys as well and also our construction and development guys. So that's what we manage in the development process. I want to just, next slide I'm going to talk about, is a quick -- Peter's going to spend a lot more time talking about this, as he does the top of the market case study, is how we structure ourselves regionally to have this team approach that I just talked about. You'll see here kind of a wheel we use in presentations that shows the project management at the center of the wheel. And it's the project manager's job to make sure that the expertise we need from the various departments whether it's leasing, construction, legal, corporate services, so on, that those guys are involved in the project when they need to be, that he brings to their attention, when we need their input, when they should be involved and how they should participate. Because they have their own things their doing on a daily basis., hey aren't involved with the 10 or 15 or 20 development projects we have going on. So it's the project manager's responsibility to make sure that information flows and that it's shared amongst the various groups. With that I'm going to turn it over to the next three guys who are actually, I think, going to tie in to some of these risk factors and talk about our development process in 3K space. Rob, it's up to you. ROBERT SELSAM: Okay, great. Thanks, Mitch, it's a -- thank you, thank you.. Some of you are familiar with our latest development in New York City, 250 West 55th Street. I would like to speak for a few minutes about the predevelopment period of the property's development cycle on that project, but before I do I thought I'd give you a little bit of background and overview of the project. 250 West 55th Street is designed in the tradition of great modernist architecture. It offers 24,000 square foot floor plates, efficient layout, 10-foot high, clear finished ceiling heights and have been pre-certified LEED Gold by the US Green Building Council. It is currently under construction and is scheduled for completion in early 2011. Located on 8th Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets, 250 West 55th gives us the opportunity to capitalize on an emerging office district on Midtown's west side. Anchored on the north by Time Warner Center and 59th Street and on the south by the new headquarters for the New York Times at 41st Street, there is a great deal of development underway on 8th Avenue today and much more planned for the future. This is a view of the corner of 55th and 8th looking south down 8th Avenue and to the east across 55th Street. This is the development site as it stood not too long ago. Since this picture was taken all of the buildings you see there in the foreground have been demolished. The predevelopment story on 55th Street is actually interesting. And it demonstrates the many challenges that we face as developers in New York City, not only in identifying opportunities for assemblage and development but, also, the multidisciplinary expertise that is required to plan and to zone and to design and to permit a large scale commercial development in New York City. The 55th Street assemblage included 12 lots that together total a footprint of approximately 46,000 feet. With disparate ownership of those lots, the challenge was to tie up the entire site which required negotiating, separately but simultaneously, deals with three different owners. The opportunity here was to create value by successfully controlling the entire site as the 46,000 square foot whole was clearly more valuable than the sum of its parts. It's also interesting to note, on this slide, that the site is actually situated across five separate zoning districts which required some very careful analysis with regard to the maximum floor area that could be built on the site and the bulk and massing of the building that we would ultimately design. In addition, on 55th Street, the assemblage included the acquisition of theatre development rights. Theatre development rights are excess or unused air rights that are owned by listed theatres in Manhattan Theatre Subdistrict. We were able to acquire 157,000 square feet of these unused air rights and transfer them from theaters on 44th Street within the Theatre Subdistrict up to our site on 55th Street. This allowed us to build a bigger building but also, very importantly, allowed us to average down our land costs and improve the economics of the deal. It's important to note that, in order to do this, this did require the approval of City Planning which we'll talk about on a subsequent slide. We originally became involved in 250 West 55th Street as a joint venture with a local developer and we were planning an 80 story tower with luxury condominiums above a four or five star hotel. But as is often the case, in the development business, in 2006 we were seeing some changes in the market. What we were seeing was a strengthening office market and what some of us believed to be the beginning of a weakening residential market which led us to reevaluate what was the highest and best use for the development of this site. With this in mind we made the decision to proceed with an office building which we all knew would be successful as the footprint of this site and the location of this site was really excellent for office development. It's generally perceived that New York City is a difficult place to do business and certainly it is a difficult place to develop. What is not understood with regard to zoning is that there's actually a very well developed zoning resolution in the City of New York which provides as a right development on each site in New York. The key, however, is knowing how to evaluate the zoning of any given site and effectively navigate the review and approval process with New York City's Department of City Planning, should approvals be required. As mentioned earlier, in this case, approvals were required to allow us to utilize the Theatre development rights that we wanted to transfer from the theatres on 44th Street up to our site on 55th Street. This required approval of three separate actions by City Planning. One was approval by certification of a portion of the Theatre development rights. As it turns out there were really two different types of Theatre development rights on this site. There was certification Theatre development rights and authorization development rights, each of which required the approval of City Planning. The third action that required approval of City Planning was the transfer floor area from one zoning district to another. As you recall, from a previous slide, there are five zoning districts on the site and we wanted to be able to build our building a certain place on the site which required us to transfer certain air rights that were generated in one district, in another district. During the review process it is to be expected that City Planning will express certain opinions on certain design related matters. And in this case what they chose to focus on was pedestrian circulation and street wall. Pedestrian circulation is pretty much what it sounds like. What City Planning was interested in doing was making it easier for the pedestrian traffic to walk around the block. In this case what that really amounted to was setting the building back from the property line. On the slide here, the dotted line that you see around the site is actually the property line and you can see that the building is actually set back both on 55th Street and on 8th Avenue, the effect being widening the sidewalk and making it easier for people to walk around. With regard to street wall, what you see on this slide was the original design of the building which provided for a podium which was 50 feet high. City Planning believed that a higher street wall was appropriate here, to put it into context with its view of the commercial district that was emerging here. Of course that is subject to some debate and opinion but when you're negotiating with City Planning you usually need to give them what they want or some of what they want. At the end of the day, after a negotiation, we ended up with a 57-foot-high street wall on the podium, they had wanted 65 feet. The essence of what we do better, we believe, than anyone else is really building design. And that not only means what you see from the outside but what's happening on the inside. And we took a very careful approach to designing this building inside out. We know the planning dimensions of many of our tenants. We know the dimensions of partner offices, associate offices, cubicles, corridors and with that in mind were able to design a floor which would optimize the efficiency of the planning for our tenants. What you see here is dimensions 43 feet, three inches, 35 feet, four inches are really not random numbers. These were all lease spans and dimensions that were created knowing the building blocks of how our tenants would be planning the space. What you see on this slide is a very typical plan for a law firm. And as I said, we really did go to great lengths to optimize the efficiency of this floor. This brings us to vacant possession and demolition. And what I'd like to focus on here, on this slide, is Lot 103 which you see here in a dark grey shaded area. As you know, when we acquired the site, there were buildings on the site and Lot 103 was a small residential building with five residential tenants. So one of our challenges was to get vacant possession of their apartments, i.e. buy them out of their leases. The residential tenants in New York City are afforded great rights and it is sometimes difficult, very difficult, to get residential tenants to move. So we embarked on an effort to negotiate a buyout with each and every one of thee tenants. Not knowing whether or not we would be successful. The reason that I mention that is the area shaded in red on this slide is actually the fore plate of our tower. And when we were designing and planning the building, not knowing whether or not we would be able to add Lot 103 to the footprint of the tower, it required that we design a building that could proceed without actually getting vacant possession of all the apartments in Lot 103. I'm happy to report that we were actually successful in buying out all the tenants and Lot 103 has since been demolished and has been incorporated into the footprint of the building. But not the footprint of the tower, the footprint of the podium, the tower is as shown on this slide. And with that I would like to hand the show over to Peter. PETER JOHNSTON, SVP, REGIONAL MANAGER, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Thanks Rob. Good morning, still, I believe. What I'm going to do is lead you through a very quick case study of Reston Town Center. And really focus principally on our team approach to development and how we apply in executing a development deal. And really the issue is, if you look at this, you can see One and Two Freedom Square, in the center, the upper part of the photograph, is how do you get from that to this? And this photo is only about five or six months old. And so in thinking about that process and how the team approach is applied at Boston Properties and I'll just give you a few quick facts and figures on this, won't spend a lot of time on it, but it's two, 10-story developments, one six story. And one of the important things, this was the largest speculative development being conducted in the region. And we haven't really been able to ascertain whether there's been a larger spec development really ever executed in the Washington region ever. But given the dynamics of this market, given the quality of what we've seen happen in the town center already, we were comfortable proceeding with it, 67 of office, 83.5 of retail. The design commenced in December of '04, we commenced construction in February of '06, delivered it in February of this year. The original project budget, that you see there, $113 million, and our current lease up of 83.6 and 86% of the retail. And while clearly, if you're familiar with the Dulles Toll Route core, and we describe the difference in how this is really an anomaly in the market unto itself, while traffic in that area has slowed, we continue to enjoy traffic through this complex to round out the leasing of the project. It's really for the very reasons that Doug enumerated, which is that this is not the typical office development, it's a special place and the market recognizes that. So everyone understands, based on past history and this morning's discussion, that were about really developing and owning the best real estate. But what I want to spend a few minutes on is, what the key to this is, our organizational structure. And that structure is specifically designed, and it's really been in place for the history of the company, to support that strategic goal with regard to development. And the foundation of that is this slide here which is an amplification of what Mitch showed during his presentation. And one thing I'd like you to focus on as you look at this is I've taken out of this particular slide the external focus, because I wanted to focus on the internal and the team approach piece as it relates to the Boston Properties. In our region, for this development, and it was a large one, three buildings, 650,000 feet, there are 17 people on that slide. The two names you see in the lower left, under Corporate Services, Mike LaBelle and Janet Breen running Risk Management are from the corporate office but that everybody else on there is located in Washington, be they the department heads, he actual operational folks who are executing the development so that the level of involvement and the care and feeding of these projects runs throughout the organization. And with that I want to talk about these bullet items. You've heard about the deep bench, but that slide if you think about that wheel, really is how do we translate that into differentiating Boston Properties in our execution of the project? The first bullet here, team approach to leveraging with functional expertise, its going department--by-department-by-department so when we develop the leasing plan it's talking to Ray, 'it's talking to [Jon Kaylor], it's bringing the staff member there who's going to be doing it to help develop that plan, all throughout the organization by discipline. So we're getting the benefit of that information, maximizing their involvement. By way of example, design, when we do iterations of these drawings, Rob talked about the care and how we look at what we put a footprint together from conceptual design to schematic to DD those drawing set on the table at each iteration. And everybody from Ray to myself on through the project team comes by with a different colored pen and marks those drawing comments up. At the end of that process we all sit in a room together and we vet that to come up with the best possible building that we can. Team staffing by department heads and regional management. Myself and the department head sits down, whose going to execute this development, who's the right person? We use that process to also cross train our people. In our region, in particular, but even in some of our others, we're in suburban Maryland, we're in Northern Virginia and we're in DC. Well the guy who does the development deal in DC he may work next on one in Virginia because we want that cross pollination. We want to understand the types of entitlements, that Rob described, that we have to go through as well in our region so that we can apply that and have a better rounded team for the future developments we have to execute. Active communication within the team dynamic, as you'd expect there's normal meetings and whether it be one-on-one casually throughout the office, but the regular team meetings that we have, but it's other things that go on as well. When do a lease transaction Jon, one of his staff is working on that development, Frank Hyre who runs Northern Virginia, he comes in. We want to talk about the credit of that tenant we go to Boston to Mike LaBelle's group and they do an underwriting who that is. So as were putting that income in place it's an in depth analysis. Where's the income coming from, what's the stability of that firm? Other elements of other communication within it is our proprietary IS applications, that allow management, and that's the people working in the projects, myself as the Regional Manager, all the way up to Doug to Mike to Mitch through our development database to see in real time what's going on with that project, when leases get executed, when we get approvals, et cetera. The budget and schedule buy-in, and I really take the two last bullets on this slide together, but the team members when we -- you think of that wheel and the project managers going out and going and getting that. What's the leasing plan, testing the assumptions as it relates to the income that we're going to put in place on that budget? Or the design schedule and working with our architectural team and all of those features, each individual who provides that input, they're responsible for that, they own it, it's theirs. While the project manager is responsible for the overall and seeing, as Mitch said, that we're pulling those parts and pieces and making sure those various people are executing it, everybody owns what they provide to this going on. And it allows us, all the way up to the chain, so that when that original budget and schedule is produced it's got the operational folks who are going to execute its input, it's got regional management's input and its got the senior executive's management input as well. So to apply this I'm going to use one example of the literally dozens that go through a given development deal. And it was a skin system analysis that we had to go through while we were developing this project. And I hope this will help illustrate how our team approach adds value to this process and helps mitigate some of the development risks inherent in our business. When you build a building obviously various components, there's the excavations, there's the structure, there's the mechanical systems, there's a skin. Well, part of the challenge in Reston, if you thought back to that slide, we had built two taller buildings, 16 and 18 stories, and the zoning envelope here only allowed us to build to 10 stories. Well, if you think about the evolution of a town like a Reston, and that urban environment we're creating within the suburban envelope, you wouldn't normally just build the tallest buildings first and then build a shorter building. So that and the evolution of the architectural forms that had taken place in Phase I which was done by [RTK] (inaudible) working with SmithGroup was, how do you take what had been more midrise, let's say brick buildings, and show something to fill that hole as it would have evolved to the taller buildings I just described. And it occurred to us that brick was the perfect material for that. And we wanted -- we thought that the right form to show the buildings in an evolution from that prior mercantile type design that had been done, potentially being viewed as older warehouses that, maybe had been renovated, clearly brick was the right material. But that presented problems for us. If you -- you might recall when we were doing this it was back in the '04 timeframe, well we had unprecedented residential construction going on in our market at that time. So what does that do? It puts tremendous pressure on the schedule for obtaining brick and masons and also on the cost because all the oxygen's been sucked up, where do you go and find it? And the other thing is when you build a brick building its, in terms of water proofing details, a lot of what gets done in our market and around, it's not curtain wall, which you can kind of tell where the leaks are coming from or precast, which is very easy to assemble and control that process of manufacturing. Brick is done typically with cavity wall construction it's much harder for quality control. And the other element of these buildings was knowing we wanted to show a renovated look to these buildings we had curtain wall elements and how do those things intersect. So we had to deal with these issues and in going forward we really had a couple of iterations of design we went through before we came to the conclusion, through the architects' strong suggestion, that we look into doing brick on precast as a solution to this. The challenge for us was, we'd seen a few of these buildings done, and they weren't very attractive. They'd been historically done on garages just as adding a veneer to try and make them look different. So the challenge for the architectural team was, could we do this, given the pedestrian urban scale of the Town Center, where you could walk right up to these buildings and really experience them, and a lot of it is about the street activity and the amenity base we created there. So we challenged our project construction and property management team, the A&amp;E team and the prospective general and subcontractors, who might be actually executing this, to go out, to survey existing projects and come up with alternate design schemes that we might be able to find acceptable in terms of quality. And achieve the best balance for the esthetic, the cost and the constructability we were looking for. In fact sent the team, the architect, the contractors and our folks down to, I think as far away as Florida, looking at various buildings. The solution was brick on precast that we ended up with. And you can see a panel here of how we actually assembled this, coming out of the yard where it's laid up, the brick goes into a mold. The concrete is poured behind it. You can see the interval sill right there and the finish quality is exceptional. It provided the desired appearance in the finished product. We were able not only to meet the schedule but we solved the problem with dealing with the masons and the available brick. These aren't full size brick, you can see the actual center dimension to this, so the availability of the product was there. And the quality control was there because this is being done in the yard it's not being done as you're scaffolding the building. And as far as the budget was concerned by building the three buildings at one time you got an economy of scale you otherwise would not, when you saw that larger picture of the whole complex the amount of these panels that we were buying helping to drop our cost down. And then, as importantly, as I mentioned earlier, simplifying the water proofing details. If you think about this view here in this panel you really take when you erect it on the structure of the building two of these panels is butting up against one another and a caulk joint going in there. So in terms of waterproofing details it's about the simplest you could possibly have. It's readily maintainable, it's traceable if something happens. And over time as you go to manage the building you end up with a product that you can go in over its life cycle and replace when necessary. And, we think, clearly given the success of the complex and the leasing it's been enormously successful and was a really good, I think, illustration of what the team approach provided. And that happens literally dozens and dozens of time throughout the development of one of these buildings. And with that I'll turn it over to Mike. MIKE CANTALUPA, SVP - DEVELOPMENT, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Thanks Peter. I'll actually say good afternoon because I think we just slid past noon time. I've been asked to talk a little bit about our approach to green building. Some may see this as the biggest social movement of our times and whether you believe that or not, clearly with both Presidential candidates supporting additional greenhouse gas regulations and with green building policies and programs across the country now in 31 States, 159 municipalities and 12 Federal agencies, this is a movement that's here to stay. So we thought it important to give you our thoughts on the green movement and how our strategy has developed over the last few years. I'll wrap up with a few points on our 77 4th Avenue building that Mike talked about. I think you'll agree that, with the presentations here, we tend to be very thoughtful about our business. And so as we sat back and analyzed this particular issue we really thought about it in three ways. What exactly is the impact of real estate on the environment, i.e. what's the problem? What does our customer want as a result? And what are the benefits of being green? How can we package that? This slide shows that we are large consumers and significant producers. As you can see we're big consumers of energy and electricity and water and from an output standpoint and carbon dioxide and waste. So in concluding here, and there are actually been very -- several studies that showed us, real estate has actually a larger impact on the environment than the automobile industry. So from a customer standpoint let me hit you with a few reference points. There's a project out there called the Carbon Disclosure Project. This year 321 of the S&amp;P 500 actually responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project so that's pretty interesting in and of itself. But 102 of those respondents have established greenhouse gas policies. About 40% of them view building green as very important and 43% of them see green activities and green building specifically as a part of their company's growth strategy. So that's kind of interesting. And then finally and most importantly 63% of CEOs view green building as a market differentiator. From our day-to-day experience, more recently, we're seeing a lot more in RFPs. As little as four years ago this was not even on the radar screen. We built a building in Cambridge for the Rhode Institute did not even come up as a topic of discussion in responding to the RFP and concluding the deal. But with the Wellington deal with the building, you'll see later on this afternoon, that was an absolute requirement. We had to deliver a building of Silver or better. And we're working on a number of major requirements right now which absolute requirement so, conclusion on this point, it's important to our customer so therefore it's important to us. The way we look at this from a benefit perspective. We think of it as a tremendous opportunity for us to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. And then potentially to differentiate us in a way that really meets what the customers need is and actually market it and sell it. Let me talk a little bit about what that means. From a straight numbers perspective, if we build the buildings right, these are the kinds of impacts that we can have on the building in terms of energy reduction, carbon dioxide reduction and so forth. But there's a bit of a softer side to this which is really people benefits. And the studies are getting better, I think, on this day-to-day but essentially with things like increases in natural light, greater temperature control, pumping higher volumes of fresher air into the building. There are a variety of studies out there that suggest that productivity gains happen anywhere from 2% to 18%. Probably the most famous study out there is the Lockheed Martin study which reduced absenteeism by 15%. But there are lesser known studies out there. There's actually a study that, I believe, was sponsored by [Cosar]. A law firm called Oakley Thompson that's in Melbourne, Australia, they moved from a green -- a non green space to a green space within the same building, they found a 9% increase in their secretary typing speed and a 7% increase in their law firm billing ratio. So that's real money, obviously, now maybe there was better views in the space and they were generally happier but there was obviously green space. Let me hit you with another number. A 1% productivity gain for an employee that makes $60,000 and has about $15,000 in additional benefits, so clearly nobody in this room was a part of that study, an average of 200 square foot of occupancy, that's about $3.75 a square foot in value to a tenant. And, as you'll see in some of the studies that I'll show you later on, that really is more than some of the premiums that are actually even associated with building green. So as a result of this we're really incorporating this into our sales presentations and turning what, I think, some other firms may view as a liability, because of added regulation, into a marketing benefit. Let me just give you a little bit of building green 101. There's several major standards out there. In the US there's LEED, there's a thing called Green Globe, there's a number of regional standards. In the medical industry there's a thing called Green Guide for Health Care and Europe has a number of green as well. We're -- in the US what we're using is LEED, so Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. It's administered by the US Green Building Council and we like to view them as say the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for the industry. They have 17,000 member organizations and to date, as of May actually, they have certified about 190 million square feet of space. This is the measuring system that they use. There's a variety of categories, many categories, more categories than are shown on this slide. For single family residentials, schools, retail, health care and so forth. These are the four categories that impact Boston Properties. So there's LEED New Construction. And that's really a special circumstance, I think, it's really one we know not only who the tenant is but their design is progressing together with the base building design. We have on opportunity to certify it in the same process. More often than not we're doing what is called LEED core shell. So the base building design is advancing in advance of the tenant design. That's exactly what's happening at Russia Wharf. And then the tenant design comes along and they develop their own standards if they want to develop to the same standards as we are for the building. They develop their own program. We're also using LEED Existing Building and I'll talk a little bit about that as it relates to our ongoing operations.. My understanding is there's a scorecard in your packet. This is a LEED core shell scorecard and essentially what happens is a scorecard for every project you're ranked based on sustainable sites and water efficiency, energy consumption and the like. And based on some of your site characteristics, which doesn't necessarily cost you money, and how much you want to invest in the project. You can achieve anywhere from certifiable level on up to more exotic levels, up to Gold and Platinum. So we've thought about this as it relates to three areas of our business, new development, our existing buildings and our corporate operations, so leading by example. And I think generally what we've concluded is that we've been building and operating green for years and we haven't been -- we haven't called it that. Our base building spec is actually at very high level, so the premiums to go or actually even get the buildings certified are really not that much. And we've always been above operating efficiency. From a new development standpoint generally speaking we're targeting LEED Silver or better for our buildings and the better is really on a case-by-case basis. So depending on the site characteristics we may decide to reach a little bit farther. As I've said, I think this is consistent with our long-term strategy of how we invest in our properties even on just a straight development side before green. We never really thought about -- in the perspective of it's not that much more expensive to put great quality stones in your building and lobby and great mechanical systems because they pay themselves back over long haul. And the same kind of thing, I think, is consistent with our green approach. And as I said, we think our buildings, general building standard, specifications is at a very high level anyway. And the way we generally measure that is it's approximately at about a Silver. So as it relates to the markets that we're in we're, as we told -- as we've said over the years, in high barrier to entry markets. We believe those markets are getting more and more challenging over time. We're finding that regulators are looking to limit the environmental impact as they redevelop their city. And as a result of that we also happen to be in some of the most progressive green building markets. So the way that all comes together is we really believe that we have a core competency for executing complex development. So this green building, some may say, is an added complexity but we really believe that it moves into our wheel house and our skill set as a development team. And that other developers actually may view this as a burden we really don't. We're embracing it and promoting it. I'm going to just give you a couple of data points here. This is a study that was put out by US GBC a few years ago and it is trying to identify the average green cost premium associated with their various categories of Silver, certified Silver on up to Gold and Platinum. And what I've done here is taken the numbers and applied them to a typical suburban office building in greater Boston. And what -- identified what the estimated cost increases to develop on a hard cost basis and then translate that into a return premium. As you can see, I think, certainly at the lower levels the premium is very modest to develop green and then depending on how exotic we want to get we can move into the higher levels. Bit of a case study for you. 77 CityPoint is a building that we just completed in January of this year. It was built on spec. As Mike said it was the first pre-certified Silver building on the marketplace but it was also the first speculative green office building on the marketplace. Prior to that point a lot of the building that had been certified under the US GB system had all been built either by a user or for a user. This building actually went on spec and from our perspective the response is overwhelming. The building opened up 100% lease and at the time we were competing with two other speculative buildings that had much slower leasing prospects. And we think this was directly attributable to the success of the building. Just a couple of numbers on this and this ties back to the point earlier of how our premium to build green is actually less than the competitions. So if you look at this cost premium, about $1.34 a square foot, not that much more than our base building cost but a 12% -- $0.12 a square foot rental premium we believe, to achieve the returns that we would have otherwise retained if we just developed on our base building spec. I think that compares to something on the order of a quarter that was in the prior slide. So just to wrap up here on the new development program this is our, lets call it our current development program and the various LEED ratings that we're trying to achieve. I actually think that we haven't actually got a certified -- a certification yet. A lot of these are in process, 77 4th Avenue is just about ready to be completed. There's a fairly lengthy review and approval process that's associated with actually getting your certification from US GBC. Just shifting gears here a little bit, on the existing buildings side we have a very active ongoing auditing and retrofit system but it's again, consistent with the approach in our development sites. It's consistent with the approach on our property management site. We're doing this every day. And so we've got a program here in Boston where were grading our existing buildings using LEED. There's another program out there called Energy Star and we have something called the Sustainability Dashboard. And all we're doing is very simple. We're just monitoring our energy consumption, our waste production and our water consumption. And seeing how we're doing, if there are any low hanging fruit that's readily apparent that we can invest in the building and potentially earn some of these LEED certifications. And we have a variety of other statistics if you want to hear them but probably maybe the most relevant here in the Pru Tower, actually the Prudential Center recently just moved from a steam-based chiller to a high-efficiency electric chiller as part of this program and we achieved, by our calculations, about a $1.7 million a year in savings a year for tenants in the Pru Tower and at 101 Huntington Avenue. And then finally just on the program its called Leading By Example, Walking the Walk, we have really tried very hard within our own operations, particularly in the Boston region, to have our employees focused on what we're doing everyday from a consumption standpoint. So we have our employees focus on electricity, waste recycling and what our purchasing initiatives are. And then we were excited very recently by Mayor Menino and his 2008 Green Business Award here in Boston for our environmental efforts but particularly on our education program for not only employees but also for our tenants. And again, my understanding is you have a copy of our Green Guide to Buildings that's in your package. So you can take a look at what were doing. Finally, there's a phrase out there that's associated with this movement called the Triple Bottom Line and I guess the confluence of the environment, the social aspects of this movement with the economic aspects. And the way we flip that over and look at it on our business is clearly there's benefits to our environment to be building green. So that's obviously a good thing. Our clients win from lower expenses if we're building our buildings right and whether you believe the studies or not, we really believe there are higher productivity measures that can be sold to the tenants. And we believe the shareholders win because the way we're marketing the buildings is true product differentiator should lead to faster absorption than the lower operating costs should lead to a higher NOIs. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I don't know if anybody has any questions for these guys. We're going to grab lunch in a minute but if there's any questions out there? Hi, [Jordan]. Questions and Answers UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible). UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I won't say that's a big question. It's a hard one to answer. I think that what we're seeing right now is probably not on a growth in cost at the moment. I'd say not dropping but stable. I think everybody's -- I think the construction industry is like anybody else, everybody's waiting for the -- see what happens how things shake out. Sometimes our costs get driven by what's happening in markets outside and Peter talked about earlier the impact of the residential market had on Washington at one point in time. And a lot of our markets in New York even we've recently had some good bids and had some bad bids. Sometimes it's just a result of how much -- what kind of institutional works in the market at the time. And what hospitals and schools and whatnot are doing. And what opportunities are available to contractors. So we're not anticipating the growth we saw in the past three or four or five years. And we had some years where costs were going up 10% a year, 50% a year. Those are tough years to guess where you're going to be in six or nine months. I think we feel pretty good that things are flattened out. We don't expect them to drop a whole lot. But hopefully stay flat for awhile that would be nice. I mean certainly all our development stuff about process and what we're trying to do, we're trying to create certainty, and certainty makes us more effective. The more certainty we can create the better we can do our job and the more effective we can be. Yes. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: A follow up to Jordan's question. If costs remain stable at best but obviously rents are likely coming down across most markets. What are the implications for land values and what have you seen? Have you seen land trade at all? Where do you think the land component plays over the next couple of years? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well I think -- I think before we buy a piece of land we don't just worry about rental, right. Are there going to be warm bodies to put in the building? So you start with tenants, right. And if there aren't going to be opportunities to lease to people then we're probably not going to be buying land. I think land -- you tend to back into land values based on what rents are doing. Where people think rents are going to go and where costs are. And obviously if costs stay flat and rents drop logically you could say, hey, lands going to drop. But you know we've seen times in the past where people said I just won't to sell my land. I'll just sit on it and wait, okay because I think its worth more than it is. So we would expect land to stabilize. If you think about land values and what they've done in the last three or four years, they've risen quite dramatically in some areas especially in some CBD areas. We would expect them to stabilize and be more predictable going forward. But we're not going to run out and start buying a bunch of land just because land rates may be aren't as high as they were two months ago or six months ago. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: There's something called land owneritis and land owners very, very rarely believe that the value of their land is going to go down. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: And for the most part were working in CBD locations and in CBD locations it's really hard to determine what the value of land is because there's relatively little trading going on. And in certain locations like the cities were in, the trading of land is so few and far between, that when you actually have the opportunity to buy a piece of land that you, in the long term, think is going to be a terrific value, you jump on it. Which is, I think, the reason that we were so attracted to the NPR site in Washington, DC, which we just purchased. There, if you looked at it purely on a above grade FAR basis, I think were in at $260 a square foot, something like that. And we basically bought a building that is going to give us a 5% cash-on-cash return for the next four to five years. We're also getting the opportunity to get paid to build a new building for National Public Radio and if you throw it all in together, I think, when we do our analyzed map we think we're going to be in that land in 2013 at about $200 a square foot for building a building in Washington, DC And today new construction runs in Washington, DC are $60 to $65 triple net. And there can be some pretty significant increases in construction for us to get paid reasonably well for that investment. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Is that it? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great, thank you. We're going to break for lunch right now which is right over here. Just to remind everybody there's a, on your name tag, there's a table number, there's assigned seating. And also immediately after lunch we're going to do the property tours and you also have on your name tag a tour number which -- a tour letter which Tour B is the Waltham Tour that will meet by the escalators. And Tour A is the Russia Wharf tour that will meet across the hall in the room over there, thanks. (BREAK) &lt;Presentation DOUG LINDE: Hello. Please feel free to eat and chatter your silverware around. We want to -- we want to give as much opportunity as we can for the next panel, which I'm sure is probably one that everybody is, maybe it's not as important as everything else we've done -- no just kidding. Is probably the thing that is certainly at the tip of everyone's tongue other than what's going on in the capital markets. Which is so what's going on there in the leasing markets? I have only been working at Boston Properties for 11 years but I've known Ray for a more extended period of time. The success of Boston Properties, not just its Washington, DC region, but its marketing approach, its perspective on how we handle our relationships with our customers, which are the tenants that are in our buildings, has been born out of the Ray Ritchey ethic and the Ray Ritchey approach to life. And it is a clear, distinguishing characteristic of our organization about the way we go about dealing with, relating to, courting, respecting, negotiating with our tenants, and it's all based upon the marketing acumen that Ray has brought to the table. And he is also at this point been able to train some pretty talented underlings who are now our partners who are carrying on that same ethic and that same perspective in terms of how we approach our markets. I hope this morning you got some appreciation of the fact that these are not just office buildings and that you have a broker, someone comes to the door, you lease some space and you go on. There are things that we do and an approach that we take to these investments that we're making that I think is different than what the majority of real estate companies do across the market floor and probably across the Americas. That same approach and that same perspective goes with how we deal with and talk about and try and attract tenants. And it permeates down to the design, the acquisition, the due diligence when we're looking at something, and Ray and our leasing team are a critical component for the satisfaction of our own comfort level and the expectations that we have for those assets and then ultimately we [enchargen] them the success. They're ultimately off the front lines, customer contacts, who are the day to day people who make our building successful from an economic perspective because when they sign a lease we start getting rent, knock on wood. So with that I want to introduce Ray and please give him a warm welcome because he is a special person for Boston Properties. RAY RITCHEY, EVP, NATIONAL DIRECTOR - ACQUISITIONS AND DEVELOPMENT, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Is this my retirement party? But thank you very much and I'm honored to be here today. Thank you so much for coming. Yes, my name is Ray Ritchey, otherwise known as Mayor Fenty's personal ticket broker out of Washington, DC That's one reason I can think Mr. Fenty has such kind comments. Yes, we've been asked to lead the discussion on the recent conditions in all of our regions in these uncertain times. And in recognition of the critical environment that we're in and the fact that we're getting majority of our news from talking heads and promulgating all the information of the day we have decided to stick with that format for today's presentation and go with something we call softball with Ray Ritchey. And so with that I'm very pleased to present our distinguished group of panelists joining me today, the head of leasing for each of our regions and they are as follows, David Provost, of Boston region, Andrew Levin in our New York region, John Brandbergh in New Jersey, Rod Diehl in San Francisco and last but not certainly not least John Taylor our Washington, DC office. Now look at this picture I said these guys look like they've been separated at birth. I mean it's almost like the Stepford Wives equivalent of office leasing. And also very clear to me that I did not hire in my image, that's for sure. But we also like to follow up on Doug's comments that as impressive as the presentation today was in the capital markets and our development construction teams and back in our headquarters the IT group and all the people that come together to make Boston Properties the great company it is. With all due respect to those people the individuals sitting at this table here maintaining the recent success we have enjoyed in all our regions, which is not only the REIT industry leader but in every one of our markets the leader in terms of occupancy. Without them we would not realize any success that we have over the last 5.5 years. So again I'd like to offer a round of applause, if I could please, to our leasing team. Guys, I'm getting you that pause now because after what you talk we may not be getting any of our applause later on today. But so with that we do want to jump right into it. And we thought about soliciting all of you with questions or we went some to our brokers to get questions answered. But we decided candidly to go some to our more prominent shareholders and get their questions answered about what's really driving their decision today. Questions and Answers DOUG LINDE: So our first question comes from Mr. T. Brady, from Weston, Mass. who asks, \"I'm now recently in a situation where I have some time on my hands and want to consider investing in real estate more actively. How do I stay put in the Boston market as a place to put my money?\" So David, do you want to take that one? DAVID PROVOST, EVP - LEASING, BOSTON REGION, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Sure. As a [Patriot Sam] by the way, boy do we miss Tom Brady. That was a tough loss the last couple of weeks. So the Boston marketplace despite what you heard on a macro level on the economics, the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market are very, very strong. On the supply side in Boston the vacancy rate, overall vacancy is 6% and that day it's actually below 3%. These are very, very low numbers. Obviously everybody seems to be concerned more on the demand side. And despite what you hear in the western suburbs that the cocktail parties there are very few investment bankers in the Boston marketplace. Actually our downtown leasing told us that it actually comprises less than 2% of our tenant base. So the direct impact of what's happened on Wall Street we think will be minimal. If you look in Cambridge the vacancy is below 8%. Obviously a supply constrained market -- demand remains very strong with some of the big tech companies moving in recently, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Google et cetera. And in the suburbs vacancy is right about 10% and continued strong organic growth from the tech market. So overall the market seems fundamentally very, very strong. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Dave, what do you hear about the VNO project at the [filing] station side is that to go forward or -- DAVID PROVOST: There's very limited development sites in Boston. There's one right out here and some people have been asking about this deal going up. That's Fan Pier, that's 500,000 square feet scheduled to come in summer of 2010. The [Ronaldo] site or the [Philume] site as people call it is about 500,000 square feet of office and there was an article in The Boston Globe two days ago which said that they are going to move forward. It stalled for awhile, and if that doesn't move forward it's probably based on our construction guys are telling us, probably a delivery 3Q, 4Q '011. RAY RITCHEY: I'll also remind you guys to jump in here anytime you have questions or comments. We want this to be very much an interactive type of session. DAVID PROVOST: But by the way on that, if you look at that, if you look at those two development sites combined with Russia Work, which you're going to see, right next door here, that's 550,000 square feet. If you add all three of those you're talking about 1.5 million square feet of new development which is about 2% or 3% addition to the supply. The Boston marketplace is about 50 million square feet so again not a huge -- you know based on the vacancy rates we talked about that's not a huge impact on the supply side. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Plus as we saw this morning we have tremendous internal demand just within Prudential Center which is basically in our downtown portfolio of properties. DAVID PROVOST: That's right, yes. RAY RITCHEY: All right, the next question comes from [Macey Soprano] from [Paston], New Jersey who asks, \"My recently departed husband, food poisoning, was a big fan of BXP but I'm concerned about the impact the financial fallout in New York may have on the New Jersey market. Should I be?\" John, you want to answer that? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Sure, Ray. The submarket in New Jersey that is most susceptible to the financial fallout in New York is going to be the Hudson waterfront which we also refer to as Wall Street West. Now fortunately this 30 million square foot market has a pretty healthy vacancy rate of about 6%. However, Merrill Lynch, AIG and Lehman Brothers combined leased a total of about a million square feet so we do expect that number to change a bit. More specifically in Princeton where our New Jersey assets are located Merrill Lynch as a 2 million square foot campus that they own and occupy and BlackRock leases 300,000 square feet in Plainsboro. We are told that both of these divisions are doing very well and so we don't see a space reduction for either of these users. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well the other thing about that market too, John, I think is that is when you have these mega campuses with millions of square feet of space single purpose building that really doesn't compete with our multi-tenant portfolio does it? DAVID PROVOST: That's correct, yes. Merrill Lynch's campus they about six years ago built a campus in (inaudible). They vacated a campus in Plainsboro. This time they had the foresight to actually build eight different buildings so they could be sold as one-offs or multi-tenanted whereas the original campus didn't have that. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So in Princeton are we seeing any cost reduction coming down on New York, or people looking at -- DAVID PROVOST: No, not yet. Fortunately Princeton, I like to refer to Princeton as well in a study, our market number really goes up and down drastically, which we keep chugging along with Tom's railroad I call it. RAY RITCHEY: Okay our next question comes from [Mr. Peter Farb] from [Kield], Mississippi. I recently moved to New York City but clearly do not understand the market there. Could you provide some insight into what you see are the current market dynamics? Andy, you want to help Mr. Farb on this? ANDREW LEVIN, EVP - LEASING, NEW YORK CITY REGION, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Well if anybody can tell me what the stock market is doing today I'll tell you what the real estate market is doing in New York. It's really -- people are just not sure what's going on in New York given what's going on in the financial world. We are coming from a position of strength in terms of vacancy. You know the vacancy in Midtown is 5% according to the current statistics, availability is only about 9%. Now those numbers have deteriorated from last year where you're about 4% vacancy and 7% availability. Absorption is up this year. Clearly pricing is not going to continue to go up and most people's expectations right now is that it's going to go down. And there are a number of transactions that are in the works that have been put on hold as people try and understand what's going on in not only their business, but what's going on in the world. There are still a scarcity of large blocks so anybody who's looking to do a transaction for 500,000 to 700,000 square feet facing a lease expiration still has very few choices today. And they can't say with certainty whether those choices will be available in the future. There's a lot of speculation as to what will be available in the future but there's no certainty to a lot of that stuff. So anybody who has a lease expiration somebody is going to say what's the demand driver these days and for me it's really a lease expiration is the only demand driver. And I think we've seen an increase in renewal activity because people are reluctant to commit long term to new deals and people are reluctant to spend capital these days as the business outlook becomes a little bit uncertain. So I think overall there's a lot of uncertainty in the New York market right now. RAY RITCHEY: The other thing I'm seeing and this is kind of for everybody is that unlike previous downturns in the cycle there wasn't an over-commitment of space right up front. And David you're seeing this at the Prudential Center. I mean we're going through a kind of slow down yet the internal growth there wasn't that kind of extra fat in the market to take care of that. Are you seeing that in here? DAVID PROVOST: People over the last few years have been taking space for (inaudible) for legitimate business purposes. There was not a run up in taking space. Demand has actually been quite moderate all year and hasn't really been great the past few years. Pricing has increased because we've got a real supply constraint in New York. You know you talked about supply being added in Boston, a million and half square feet being added in Boston, there's two million square feet being added in New York over the next three years. And that's in Midtown. Midtown is a 200 million square foot market so the percentages -- it's a fixed supply side market. Demand has been quiet. It doesn't really take much demand to maintain pricing in New York. The real question is whether we're going to see a lot of sub lease space. RAY RITCHEY: Are you seeing any indication that there was movement downtown even in these more difficult times? Because we haven't before, I mean, we've never seen even any pricing premium being too hard to get the people to go down to downtown. ANDREW LEVIN: Right now that's still not a lot of available space downtown. I presume that a good majority of some of the larger blocks or some of the larger available space will be downtown. Not willing to increase the spread between downtown and midtown. For the larger financial firm that might make sense but for most tenants the flight to quality it usually go the other way, it goes from downtown to midtown and you might even see with some potential opportunities opening up in midtown a flight the other way. RAY RITCHEY: Now are you seeing it just the softening just in the big deals? Are you still seeing the smaller tenancy on the sidelines too or not? ANDREW LEVIN: It depends. Smaller tenants have lease expirations and they need to do things and they're a good number of choices and they're sort of doing things. I think we're going to start to see a lot of smaller firm creations, which will benefit a 540 Madison or a 2000 Central Tower. You know with folks leaving Lehman Brothers, folks leaving Bear Stearns starting their own ventures and starting small. So I think anybody who can wait is waiting whether they're large or small. RAY RITCHEY: Okay let's go, I have a next question here. This one comes from A. Schwarzenegger of Sacramento, California who asks, \"I'm very much concerned about the condition of the California real estate markets especially in San Francisco. Please advise if my fears are well-founded? Rod, can you can take care of that for the good governor? ROD DIEHL, EVP - LEASING, SAN FRANCISCO REGION, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Absolutely, Ray. If the Governator is fearful we better answer him clearly here. I can say this first of all, we as you may know, we operate in three primary sub-markets in the Bay area that being San Francisco, CVD of course from Embarcadero Center and then down the peninsula and into the Silicon Valley. And really for almost this enter year the other markets, all three of those sub-markets have all been characterized as probably tentative in terms of some of the tenant's interests. Deals have been happening but I think they've been characterized by a lack of impetus to make a deal. So when there are deals that are out there and tenants have to either renew or take down space we're making those deals happen as quickly as we can. They, I think, you mentioned this a second ago Ray and Andy as well all these markets really haven't been hit over the last five to six years by a tremendous amount of new supply. And so the changes that we're seeing right now in the marketplace really are coming from the demand side, and they're moderate because tenants have not taken down more space than they've needed over the past five years. They've generally waited, in fact, really especially down in the Silicon Valley there were tenants that sat and sat and doubled up in offices, and literally they were so burned from the last go around in the and they were under the discipline that was imposed upon them by a lot of their venture capital and other partners, were to be very conservative with their real estate, and consequently did not expand as quickly, didn't go out and take more space just to hedge against what was coming. So when they did grow they took down what they needed, maybe 10% more, and now that's going to help. Because as they pull back there's not going to be a lot of shadow space, not as much. That's not to say there isn't sub-lease space in the market. There is but it's -- I think it's going to be quite moderated for those reasons. RAY RITCHEY: I think what characterizes all of our markets candidly is that our philosophy of focusing on those barrier to entry locations has really held together very well. Every one of our urban markets, lack of supply was really the problem up to about six months ago. And if there is a supply issue it tends to be in the markets we have just exited. We talked today about the fact that we've sold $4.3 billion of real estate and while we did sell some key assets in New York and Washington and the urban areas that probably was an exit out of the commodities space. And really focusing squarely on the best assets and the best sub-markets in the United States and that really is Doug, and Ed, and Mort who provide that leadership really should be commended for executing that strategy so diligently when we had the opportunity to do that. [Steve], next question. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: This is from [Laura Busch] of Corpus, Texas who asks or states, \"My husband is facing retirement and we're debating the merits of staying in the Washington area versus a move to Texas. What can we expect in the next year in terms of real estate conditions in the Washington area, gentlemen?\" UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well first I'd like to say, [Laura] you're welcome to stay in Washington. That the feeling is a little different about your husband, but generally the DC region from an office standpoint is in very good shape. There's positive job growth. We have a federal government, which in 2008 is going to pump $55 billion of new procurement into the economy that's new stuff, new business services, not government employee salaries and so forth. But this is buying new stuff. So as long as we have that fundamental base there and I think that Washington may be beneficiary of this financial fallout, which we'll talk about a little bit later, there are some signs of softness in the market. There are currently downtown about 15 buildings that are either delivered or under construction with no tenant commitments, and there are another eight that are just half committed. And in the suburbs, Virginia and Maryland, there are about 18 buildings in that same category, under construction or delivered with no tenant commitments. RAY RITCHEY: But John, I want you to kind of give a little finer point on that downtown number because I would like to address the difference between the traditional east-end CVD locations where we have assets and the NoMa market and the Ballpark district and the south-west part. JOHN BRANDBERGH, EVP - LEASING, NEW JERSEY REGION, BOSTON PROPERTIES: Yes the majority of those 15 buildings are in markets that we're not in, the north of Mass Avenue market, which is north of Union Station, probably two million square feet of space that's either sitting there right now available or soon to be delivered. South-west also we do have a couple of buildings in the south-west but they're fully leased primarily to the federal government for long-term leases. There's about 2.5 million square feet that is available in the south-west. And then you have the Ballpark district. The market there is pretty much reflective of the National's baseball team. They lost over 100 games this year. So those are not markets that we're in. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Let me just also point out that this again shows the difference in the real strength of the Boston Properties' philosophy where we're embedded in these markets. Very often investors get the package and the opportunity to invest in a 'Washington, DC building'. Well that's -- there's a far cry between K Street northeast and K Street northwest. And to have that in the trenches, market knowledge in each one of our four markets allows us to do the 2200 Penns as opposed to the 2200 North Capital projects. RAY RITCHEY: The other thing I'll point out, Laura and George, if you're interested in buying a building supposedly there are 150 buildings whose loans roll next year. So if you have cash, if you want to buy something, I think there'll be some opportunities there. We've moved a lot of property in terms of investment sales both Boston properties specifically and the market in general. I would say that we're probably, what, 80% this year in terms of total transactions, John, in the DC markets? JOHN BRANDBERGH: That's about right. RAY RITCHEY: Yes the investment market has really come to a screeching halt in that market. Our next question comes from Mrs. J. Judy of Los Angeles who states that, \"My livelihood is totally dependent on the health of the legal profession. What impact does the financial crisis have had on the growth of law firms in your respective markets?\" And this is one I think that affects everybody at the panel, maybe John not so much. But Andy why don't you talk about that from the get-go and we'll jump in here. ANDREW LEVIN: Obviously we've got -- we've got a number of law firms in New York. This year we'll be flat if not done I think for most law firms in terms of their revenue. But with firms like Heller going out of business we've got -- we have firms like Kirkland &amp; Ellis who are going to be growing over the next few years. They've got a strength in either litigation or bankruptcy or they have -- they do more financial firm, you know, financial buyer or strategic buyer type merger and acquisition work as opposed to financial buyer type work where they're seeing growth or expected growth. So it really depends on the firm. And if you're going to characterize the industry as a whole I mean I think they're going to -- they're already seeing a soft, a softening 2008 versus 2007. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: What do you see, David, Ropes &amp; Gray, for example, what's been on there? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well what's interesting as we talk with Ropes &amp; Gray that's an international law firm as Bryan Koop pointed out, they think that business is going to be off a little bit but they just took another 50,000 square feet from us. So I don't know. In Boston while law firms certainly are a large consumer of first-class office space they really haven't been growing that much in Boston. So they had -- they took us 150,000 square feet. They were leaving about 380,000 square feet, Ray. So it wasn't a huge amount of growth there anyhow. I think our bigger concern is if you see some of these firms dissolve, if they decide to break up, that's the bigger impact. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I would tell you though I think it's very similar to what we're seeing in the financial markets. These larger groups may break up, but that guy, that person who's been practicing law for 20 years is not going to immediately become a truck driver. He or she is going to go back into the practice of law, obviously in Boston, will consume the same ratio of space and may come out as a different firm or it may emerge into another. But I don't see the overall demand -- I think we're in a period of transition here where we've got some transition from the larger firms that will either be merged with even bigger ones or smaller practices emerging. But I just don't have a sense there's going to be too much of a problem. Rod, how about San Francisco? What are you seeing there? ROD DIEHL: Yes, Embarcadero Center, as many of you know, we have many law firms there. That's one of our largest, if you were to pick a single industry within that building it would be law firms. And in the past three years they contributed to the majority of our growth, a lot of the larger deals we did were with the law firms. Now this year there haven't been as many new deals in Embarcadero Center with law firms. We have done a few expansions but not as many. But in the marketplace by and large there's been two pretty good-size deals done, DLA Piper and Gibson Dunn just to name a couple of them in Tishman's new building, in addition down on the peninsula several of the larger deals that have been done down there. Also King &amp; Spalding took down a pretty good-sized space and another firm called [Gunderson &amp; Dedler], two pretty good-sized deals that were done in that market. So I think it's yet to be seen -- I mean we're going to feel the impacts, a little bit of the Heller Ehrman as well that is their large tenant in San Francisco. So we've been kind of waiting to see what that 260,000 square feet that they have at 333 Bush is going to look like, how much of it is going to remain occupied and how much will be vacated. So I think it's -- you want to add, Joe? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Just the other thing is in New York all the out of time firms are trying to have a foothold in New York and have a strong presence in New York. And I think they found over the past few years it's gotten quite expensive to do that. I think they're now thinking that the cost to acquire these lawyers and the cost to take space will be more moderate. And I think some of the out-of-town firms who had planned to grow, grow bigger in New York, will try and do that, and try and -- RAY RITCHEY: Well a corollary to that too is when we see these harder economic times for the law firms and we know the cost with relocating out of one space into another, and given that our assets are kind of the dominant go-to buildings in our respective markets for these law firms I think the prospects of renewing Palmer Dodge and all these guys who are coming up with the 2010, 2011 expirations is exceedingly high. So I think while we may be seeing on some of our new developments having some slowdown in the demand, I think our existing portfolio is to be very much a beneficiary of retaining those law firms. John, you want to talk about Square54 real quick? JOHN BRANDBERGH: Yes Square 54 that's the former George Washington Hospital University site. RAY RITCHEY: 2200 Penn. JOHN BRANDBERGH: 2200 Penn. We are very close to a commitment for half the building. It's a law firm -- it's an international law firm. I think the law firms are a major driver of office space in Washington if this new financial stability act is passed I think that the law firms will be a major beneficiary of that. There's a lot of policy to be written, lots of regulations. I think one of the things that the law firms will focus on more, they have in the last five years, but I think with the financial instability they'll do so even more. And that's the focus on who the landlord is, whether they have financing, will they be there when the building is delivered. In the past they believe that they can just sort of write those protections into the lease. And maybe they can do that now, also. But I think they'll really take a much harder look at the landlord. RAY RITCHEY: That's a good point, John. There's a new building under construction by a local developer at probably Main and Main in Washington, DC That's Connecticut and K. And they signed up Arent Fox which is a very solid Washington, DC law firm for about, what, 70% of it, John? 75% of the building? Bottom up, great deal. They had to work for months to get financing and they only achieved it after they did something they had never done before which is going personal on the loan. And these are gentlemen that are in their 60s and 70s and the decision to go personal after that period of time we secure the loan I think really shows you how tough it is to get those law firm financings done in this type of environment. Any also law firms, guys? Our next question comes from Ms. S. Palin of Wasilla, Alaska. \"Hopefully I'll be making a major career move in 2009. What impact does the change in administration going to have on your respective markets?\" John, I assume that first and foremost to you, but others may have a point on that as well. JOHN BRANDBERGH: Sure, by the way, good job last night, Sarah. RAY RITCHEY: Is that Sarah or Tina Fey in the picture there? We're not quite sure. JOHN BRANDBERGH: Give Sarah a shout out. I think when there's a change in administration in DC, DC does very well. Those that are in power move to protect what they've had during the last four or eight years. And the newly enfranchised, obviously write the new policy, write the new regulations. So I think that the DC market will benefit from a change in administration even it's the same party but just a new administration I think will benefit from that. History has shown that when there's a national or international crisis the DC market benefits from an office space standpoint. Unfortunately that's the sad commentary. If you look at the S&amp;L crisis with the formation of the RTC they leased hundreds of thousands of square feet and when they were -- basically worked themselves out of business that was backfilled very rapidly from the growth that was generated. If you look at 9/11 the formation of Department of Homeland Security they've leased probably a million square feet. I think with this new office of financial stability, whatever it's going to be called, anecdotally the talk is that they'll need between 500,000 and a million square feet. RAY RITCHEY: And that's obviously bodes well for a lot of those buildings up in [Milmet] that are sitting vacant. And that's one of the few places the government can afford to go. Anyone else have comments on the change of administration? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I don't know about the administration in Washington but I've been much more encouraged about the administration in New York City that hopefully Mayor Bloomberg will with his recent announcement of trying to get the turn on his over turn will return to New York as I think it's key to the New York market that with stable leadership and Bloomberg has really shown to be that over the past eight years. RAY RITCHEY: And if you'll have no problem to make a major donation to his campaign I'm sure he'll be in support of that. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: You know it's interesting in Washington when we have these elections an interesting side light. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'll grab your checkbook Ray. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: An interesting sidelight is with all the Congressman and Senators who do not go up for reelection trust me they're not going back to Arkansas. They're not going back to Iowa. They're staying right there in Washington, DC and they're starting their own boutique firms and while it's not a major demand driver it does drive up some demand in some of the top tier buildings in Washington, DC RAY RITCHEY: Our next question from our shareholders comes from our two largest, Mortimer Zuckerman and Ed Linde. I'm looking at his picture. I'm trying to figure how Mort gets younger looking every year as opposed to -- this is probably a 35-year old picture. And Mort and Ed ask, \"What does the pipeline for future development look like in each of your markets both in terms of the general market and BP specifically? And would you start today on a speculative basis?\" John, what do you think about starting a spec building in Princeton? JOHN BRANDBERGH: On a spec base, you know, as we talked about earlier we are building 71 Carnegie Center for Princeton University and we've had some preliminary discussions about building a second building for them. So certainly on a situation like that we would build -- fortunately in 2000 we had our next spec building all teed up ready to go. And five developers developed over a million square feet along the Princeton Rt. 1 quarter. We're talking about an 18 million square foot market. And today about half of that is still vacant. So fortunately for us we had the foresight to put the brakes on a bit. We always have our next building teed up but it's premature at this point. RAY RITCHEY: Dave, how about the suburbs of Boston, we see settlement on there? DAVID PROVOST: In the suburbs, well we just finished up 77 which some of you will see today, 200,000 square feet and it's pre-leased. This about five building under construction in Central 128. We'll point them out today. Three are fully committed. The other two we've got just about 500,000 square feet about 2% of the overall market are not committed. So again I think we'll probably hold off. We also for our portfolio we have pretty significant roles in 2009, 2010 so I think we'd want to get comfortable with that before we'd go our speculative basis. But I must tell you there is -- Cambridge is such a tight market there is no development space for office left. There's none left. That's a finite market. It's bordered by residential, it's bordered by the university, it's bordered by the Charles River. So there's no other development site. Most of it is biotech. Many of those tenants we've seen over many square feet of migration out from Cambridge out to the suburbs. We think that's going to continue. We think that there are real build-to-suit of opportunities. So I think from a (inaudible) standpoint we feel very optimistic about that. RAY RITCHEY: Now David brings up a good point. It's interesting with this capital crisis our anecdotal observation both in Boston and a little bit in the Valley too -- Roger can opine to this. But the tech side does not seem to be constrained by the capital and still seem to be growing, still seem to be very strong, still be taking down space. Is that just an illusion or what are you seeing, Rod? ROD DIEHL: Now I mean -- there's definitely been continued demand from the tech side. I mean from a development perspective I mean the Silicon Valley does have, as the Bay area has probably more of the new construction that's underway right now, 3 million square feet plus or minus buildings that are either recently completed or under construction now. So there is some stuff in the pipeline. Now that sounds like a big number but keep in mind that Silicon Valley in total is a pretty big market. I mean you talk the office market and the R&amp;D market. And if you combine the two that's about 215 million square feet. If you look at just the office market, which is maybe 60 million-plus just Class A R&amp;D you're talking about 100 million square feet. So 3 million square feet of new is pretty -- it's pretty minimal. So as far as the demand for the space many of those buildings have yet to sign any leases. There's a few big deals that are out there circling now that we expect by the end of the year at least one or two of those will land. So the demand for tech in these new buildings hasn't really come to fruition yet. But I'd have to say I just saw the recent third quarter numbers for the R&amp;D market and it is tracking the positive net absorption year-to-date, which is meaningful down there considering that many of our other sub-markets have had negative net absorption this year. So that's good news. RAY RITCHEY: John, how about -- I guess pharma is more your niche in Princeton there. What are you seeing in terms of pharma demand? JOHN BRANDBERGH: Pharma certainly is the driver in the Princeton market. In pharma-related companies we've had several expansions this year with CROs with clinical research organizations and anybody related to pharma advertising. We've got an advertising agency that specializes in pharma, go from 5,000 square feet to 35,000 square feet. RAY RITCHEY: And John (inaudible) how about the defense contracting in Brack in Northern Virginia and Maryland? JOHN BRANDBERGH: The tech community in the Washington area is really defense, intelligence and biotech. And unfortunately with what's going on in the world today fortunately for Washington those are all doing quite well. And I think for the foreseeable future will be the same. Also with the Brack realignment and I think some of you who follow Duke noticed that they picked up a very nice build-to-suit. It remains to be seen whether that actually goes all the way through because sometimes there's some head pegs there. But Brack, even though there's probably no net new consumption of space just the geographic relocation of that to other markets will hopefully stimulate some demand the other space we backfilled. That's certainly what we anticipate. Any other comments guys? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes on the tech we just continue to see really dramatic growth from the tech group. And we'd talked about it earlier Jason Fivek who heads up our greater Waltham leasing he joined us, what? 2001, and I remember we talked about phantom space. He says, \"What's phantom space?\" That's from the '90s, people always talked about it and firms used to go in and say, \"Okay if I'm experiencing dramatic growth I want to take 10%.\" They used to take 20% and look at the speculative leasing that happened in '99 and 2000. They were taking 100% more than they needed. Sometimes they didn't have anything and they took the space. Because everybody got burned he started when he did his first deals he was looking at expansion given six months of doing the lease. So if somebody needed 10,000 they would take 7,000. And we haven't seen any slowdown and continue to see real growth and again as we talk to them we say, \"Have you seen any slowdown,\" and they're kind of all expecting it but nobody has seen it yet. RAY RITCHEY: You know this is -- we talked about a Wisconsin place building in Chevy Chase, Maryland and Doug mentioned that we have a deal pending for the balance of the building. Well it's actually Microsoft who is committed for -- I'm supposed to say that or not? Well it's Microsoft. Sorry, Doug. DOUG LINDE: The press release will be going out later today. RAY RITCHEY: And the big debate is whether they take the 64 or not in anticipation of growth because this is a building that is -- will be 100% leased. They're signing a seven to 10-year commitment and they don't want the situation where they're shy of the building. So we've seen the tech side be very, very stable in a relatively unstable market. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Now Microsoft that's a good example from that meeting -- I mean they're not specific to our space. But they had a real estate said they have a 1,000 job openings and haven't seen any slowdown, and if anything they're looking to grow and become -- in their core markets. I'm sure they're not growing in Oklahoma or Atlanta but they're growing in DC, they're growing in Boston and Cambridge, and they have a -- they're leasing with us 50,000 square feet. They are out in the market looking for 130,000 to 200,000 square feet of expansion. I mean that's incredible growth. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'd like to add one other thing to that, Ray, is that the green tech -- I mean we see -- we're starting to see more of that with different tenants in the Valley in particular. This is an area that people have talked a lot about but we are starting to see some demand coming from that. In fact, just most recently there's a company called Solyndra which is a solar power. They've expanded, they're taking down some pretty concise piece of land up in the east side of the Silicon Valley. And Tesla Motors, which is not necessarily a tech company in a sense, but it is an electronic car company, electric car company. They recently announced a deal to take some land in north San Jose. So we have some of those tenants in our portfolio. We do have a solar company. We have a company that does biofuels and these are early-stage companies. They're starting small but they're looking for more space. I mean this one tenant, this 6,000 foot tenant, looking for 20. So there is a bright spot there. And Silicon Valley has reinvented itself many times over the last 40 years and this could be one other way that it does that. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Speaking of green, and [Michael Cana] did a great job talking about our approach to green. What are the tenants demanding? Is this a deal breaker on some deals? Is it a nice to have? What do we do in existing buildings when people say what are you going to do, make this building more environmentally sensitive? John, what happened with Princeton when you did that build-to-suit for them? JOHN BRANDBERGH: Princeton emphasized that they wanted a minimum of silver and fortunate for us most of that, the cost associated with that is coming from Princeton University. As far as second generation space we certainly always go green with carpet but we haven't done any, completed much of this at this time. RAY RITCHEY: And how about New York, what are you seeing with the -- DAVID PROVOST: It's definitely more of a -- it's definitely more of an attractive thing for a lot of foreign companies of which they're a lot in New York. But it's just -- it's starting from a development standpoint all the new developments are going to be lead, silver or gold. And that's just another marketing advantage of a new building, whether it's for a law firm who doesn't really understand why they need to be green. But they've got clients who want them to be green. They've got new employees that they're taking on every year who are younger and in tune to this stuff and trying to decide between two different firms from a recruiting standpoint it's something helpful to them. I mean every lawyer I have now at the bottom of their e-mails that I get saying, \"Do you really need to print this document?\" It's coming into the market climate. RAY RITCHEY: And the answer is usually yes? John, do you want to talk about the government's approach towards green in terms of some of the stuff we're looking in? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: It's an absolute requirement if you do a lease with the federal government to have your building be green. It's definitely on every tenant's check list and depending on who the tenant is it may or may not be a deal breaker. One of the law firms we're dealing with I think it was kind of interesting that absolutely, positively had to be in a green building, and they put that right in the letter of intent. But they said, the landlord will not require us to build green space. I thought that was a little interesting. But I think that's the next wave. The buildings first, and then all of the tenant build-out space will eventually be green also. RAY RITCHEY: I'd like to throw out to the audience, are there any questions you'd like to ask our panel of experts about their respective markets or what they're seeing? Any questions? Yes Chris? UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible) that's a good, it's a very -- RAY RITCHEY: It's a timely question. UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Exactly, very timely. BlackRock has flip flopped a bit. Originally there were a -- they had a bulls eye on New Brunswick. For them to locate in the State of New Jersey they need to be in an urban enterprise zone which New Brunswick qualified for. And then Pennsylvania who is getting very aggressive trying to attract companies. Had them fairly close and now they're done a 180 and are concentrating on New Brunswick again and RFIs just went out. RAY RITCHEY: Are there questions? Michael? UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible) RAY RITCHEY: As a just overall market? Yes I think Mort touched on that today and [Mike Canlupa] may have as well. We acquired the Prudential about 10 years ago and at that time the Back Bay, and again for everybody who doesn't know the market, the downtown market, the overall urban market is 15 million square feet. Back Bay is maybe say 12 million to 14 million square feet depending on what you call Back Bay of that. So it's a smaller market. It has always traded at maybe 10% to 15% less than the financial district. That is swap now and I think the new development of the Prudential Center as well as some other developments is a big part of that. The high-end hedge funds and private equity firms came over and I think that obviously the brokers coming over that was really the final push that this is the place where people want to do it. Bryan Koop talked about it. It is -- people are working harder, it's about quality of life. It's about 24/7. It's about those things about recruiting and retaining. Boston's dirty little secret and again we have space down here so we're aware of it that the financial district there's not a lot of night life. There's not a lot of convenience retail. There's not a lot of residential. But we're really excited about next door bringing a lot of that and what is here is right along the waterfront. If you get deep into the concrete jungle as we talked about across the Greenway it's not -- it's not much different than glorified Hartford. And so some of the stuff we look as -- and that's not negative selling. That is just comparative analysis but -- UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Leave off from Hartford. RAY RITCHEY: Oh I'm sorry. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I like Hartford. RAY RITCHEY: All right, this is why I love these guys. Are these guys not great? DOUG LINDE: A press release will be going out. RAY RITCHEY: But anyhow, so again the vacancy rate we just talked about, the 6% overall so it's obviously higher on the financial district, still single digit. Back Bay is 3% and the biggest challenge that our downtown leasing team has is finding more space. That's why we're excited about Mike and the development group, 88 is really an expansion valve to help our tenants grow. And what's very interesting and everybody talks about, well as we talk to brokers and we talk to our clients is to your point maybe if we can wait, we will wait. Guess what? A lot of these people can't wait. They need more space. And what they're saying is everybody else is going to go out of business but I still need more space. And so you talk to these private equity firms actually everybody else that's in your portfolio is going to go out of business but I actually need to grow by 40%. And as we're continuing to see that now again. Is that going to turn in the next couple of months, we'll see. But right now it still remains pretty strong. RAY RITCHEY: One more question please, yes, Mitch? UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible question - microphone inaccessible) RAY RITCHEY: Maybe you want to start with that. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Sub-lease space has remained pretty constant at about 20% of direct availability. And during the 2001, the dot.com breakup that was up probably around 40%, 45%. So right now as a historical number it's pretty normal in terms of on-market. And I think the assumption is that that will increase up. But right now it's pretty healthy. RAY RITCHEY: John Brandbergh? JOHN BRANDBERGH: Yes the sub-lease rate in our market right now is about 10%. But fortunately and (inaudible) whenever we have sub-lease space we have in our leases Bob Pester and Rod have in theirs as well at Embarcadero Center that if you go to the sub-lease market for a sub-tenant you cannot compete with a landlord. So if we're talking to them or they're an existing tenant, we have available space that suits their needs they're prohibitive from doing sub-lease. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: In our three core markets sub-lease is at historic lows anywhere from 1% to 4%. I think the bigger -- what happens before sub-leases obviously layoffs. And we haven't seen -- and we're really watching this and to Doug point's we're all nervous Nellies. We're watching -- sub-lease seems to be that first indicator. But actually the first indicator is the layoffs. And again because we have a property measurement, we actually walk all our tenant spaces to make sure are there any empty offices. We're not seeing that. So in order for a lot of the space to go under the sub-lease market there would really need to be layoffs. So that's what we're really keeping our eye on. RAY RITCHEY: Now David do you think because Boston went through so many M&amp;A activities, three, four, five years ago that we've been -- the blow is a little softened here in the last few months or what? DAVID PROVOST: Yes, there really isn't many banks left in Boston. I think the largest bank that's headquartered in Boston is what? The Eastern Bank, is that accurate? I mean that's a great trivia question. I don't know. I mean there's not a lot of -- and that was a real concern for us as we've been through enough downturns and our concern was eight years ago what's going to get us out of this mess? And 50 years ago it had been the banks and the Fidelity's of the world. This time it was really that mid-sized firm, 30,000 to 50,000 square feet going to 80,000 to 100,000. So it's a diverse tenant base and we feel pretty confident about it. RAY RITCHEY: Quick comments, guys, on sub-leasing, Rod? ROD DIEHL: Yes just quickly in San Francisco the sub-lease space has hedged up a little bit. This year we were running about 500,000 to 600,000 square feet. It's a little over a million square feet right now. And the metric that I usually track is what percentage of that is the overall available space? And right now in San Francisco that's about 16.5%. If you move down the peninsula that market has actually picked up a little bit more than that. That same metric is about 25% and if you go into the Silicon Valley it's about 13.5%. So it's probably worse in the peninsula and there's a couple of specific sub-leases that kind of move that number up. Down in the Redwood Shores that was a company called PDL that put a bunch of space on the market. So it's edged up a little bit but not dramatically. RAY RITCHEY: John, anything on the sub-lease environment? JOHN BRANDBERGH: Yes in our three markets the percentage of the total available space is 10% or less and that's down very dramatically from four or five years ago. Tenants are being very conservative in the amount of space that they take. We have never known a tenant that's gone out of business because they didn't have enough space. And I think to some extent even though we'd like tenants to lease more space it may make sense for us to support them in that. They are looking more at expansion down the road as opposed to -- which puts more of the onus on us. But they're being very conservative. RAY RITCHEY: Yes and these statistics that are being offered up here are market-wide statistics, and our own portfolio. I mean it's virtually non-existent I would say in all five of these regions. So like any good talking head show and specifically Mr. Zuckerman's [McLachlan] group, in fact he gives his condolences. He's now flying to down to tape Sunday's program so make sure you watch it. I'm sure he'll be talking about the same topics he talked about this morning. So I'm asking each one of our panelists to give a prediction of the coming year, and why don't we use a movie theme as kind of the basis behind it. John, do you want to start? JOHN BRANDBERGH: Well lots of different movies I can think of. But probably the best for the DC region is Being There -- actually the inflection is Been There. Being in the right location, in DC, you will be okay in the future. RAY RITCHEY: Rod Diehl? ROD DIEHL: I'm going to expand that, right, and a little bit beyond just one year if you wouldn't mind. I'm going to -- this might sound a little corny, but I'm going to say Little Miss Sunshine for California. And the reason is I have a good friend of mine who's in the home building industry and had this conversation there, feeling the tough times as we all know. He said to me when I asked him how things were going and if things were going to change in his world, and he said, \"Look, this place is going to get better. It's a beautiful place to live. People are going to find a way to earn a living here and stay here, and it will recover.\" And I think that's the case. It may take awhile -- we don't know how long, but in the long term the Bay area is a wonderful area to live and to run your business and for that -- I think the go forward is positive. RAY RITCHEY: (inaudible) UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I mean so much of our market is perception and I think if it was the tenant rep brokers they would say, atonement. You know I would think that the market is going to fall off a cliff. I think that if I had to say anything it's probably, I don't know, there's a movie, Frantic, was that what it was, Frantic? I mean was that a movie, Frantic? UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Sure. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Sounds good, why didn't I. I think I saw this movie and it was a Frantic, I remember it was with Harrison Ford and my wife and I watched it, we came out and it was just a real [clumper], it was very slow, and my wife said, \"They should have renamed that Deeply Concerned.\" It really wasn't -- so I think the perception is that it's going to be frantic but everything is going to be fine. So how about, It's A Wonderful Life, how's that? RAY RITCHEY: John? JOHN BRANDBERGH: I think it's what you've been hearing all day, I'll reiterate, Best in Show. We have the best product and the best market. RAY RITCHEY: Good career move there, John. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Can I change my answer, Ray, Best in Show. JOHN BRANDBERGH: And we'll continue to weather the storms. DAVID PROVOST: In New York I have the writer's strike on so we're not really making great movies. I think the only prediction you can make in here is that there's going to be a lot of predictions in this movie. Up and down, and I think we all have to wait to see what the reality is going to be because right now there's a lot of perception and a lot of negative perception. But I think we'll have to see what the reality pans out to be. UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, I thought you'd go with the Good, Bad and the Ugly. RAY RITCHEY: Well just first of all let's go to a round of applause to our panelists here, and Doug has been gracious enough to ask me to just kind of summarize today's presentation and the event last night. And again I think the message we try to get across again is the supply constrained nature of our markets, our long-term leases and the strong balance sheet. I think much more important than those three facts is what you saw today with the depth and breadth of talent that Boston Properties brings to solving the real estate issues of the day. From Mort Zuckerman down to this panel I think that I daresay that that was like the all-star line up of real estate. And I sat back in that room today so incredibly proud to have been associated with this company for 28 years. And more importantly looking forward to knowing that the team we've assembled here is going to do our darnedest. And that team, the 20-some odd people there today is merely reflective of the 650 people that are throughout out our buildings, throughout our regional offices, interacting every day with our tenants making sure we offer our clients the best possible space in our respective markets. Lastly I want to say to all of you we look at these conferences whether it's NAREIT or various investor conferences and we see many friends, and it's so great to see you all come back, come interested, participating and committed to making Boston Properties stores successful, and on that we're most grateful.

We are getting earnings from big names, including Alibaba, Ford and UPS. We'll get readings on durable goods orders, home prices and consumer confidence. Ahead of all of that we are looking at futures markets here in the U.S., pointing to go lower open on Wall Street, small losses to kick off this Tuesday morning. Dow Futures off eight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech also in focus. Both Apple and Twitter set to report earnings after the close of trading today. Checking in on market action overseas, looking over in Europe, where trading has gotten started, you're looking at the FTSE in London off 21 points; the CAC in France, off just a small a fraction of a percent, down two points. The DAX in Germany slightly higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wal-Mart taking a page out of amazon's playbook.

Wal-Mart also looking to use the devices to check warehouse inventories.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Flacco back, pressure on. To the middle, again, for Gilmore. And it ends, secured and intercepted by Tony Jefferson.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: The Baltimore Ravens missing a chance to tie up that game on the final play against the Arizona Cardinals. Ravens Quarterback, Joe Flacco, intercepted in the end zone, and Arizona won the game, 26-18.</p><p>And it's a big night for baseball. The World Series getting underway tonight in Kansas City. The Mets and Royals getting in one last workout yesterday before the series begins. It's said to be a pricey series for fans. The average ticket price is $723 and climbing, that's according to StubHub this morning and it gets more expensive when the teams face off in New York on Wednesday.</p><p>Well let's get to that new Monmouth University poll out this morning showing <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>losing more ground in the state of Iowa, while making more controversial comments in a town hall in New Hampshire. Blake Burman has all the latest from Washington, and it gets even more interesting this morning, Black.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Day by day it does, Sandra. Good morning to you. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>still holds commanding leads nationally, and in a couple of the early of the early voting states, but there's a growing trend in Iowa, according to polls taken there over the last week. Dr. Ben Carson has supplanted Trump in the first caucus state. Take a look at this: Carson has won four of the last five polls there with the fifth being a tie. They're all fairly sizable spreads, with the most recent from Monmouth University showing Carson with a 14-point lead.</p><p>Meantime, Trump is facing some scrutiny for a couple of comments he made yesterday in New Hampshire. In one of them Trump said it's easy for women to wear burkas because they don't have to wear makeup.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In fact, it's easier. You don't have to put on makeup. Look how beautiful everyone looks. Wouldn't it be easier? Right? Wouldn't that be easy? I tell you, if I was a woman, I don't want to -- I'm ready, darling, let's go. It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Separately, Sandra, Trump also took credit for Ford's decision to halt production plants truck plans in Mexico and stay in Ohio. However, that was strongly disputed by Ford and Ohio Governor, and presidential candidate, John Kasich. Sandra.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Blake Burman, thank you. Let's bring in former White House advisor to President Bush, Bryan Hook and Democratic Strategist, Richard Goodstein. Guys, I don't know where to begin.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH: Let's first tackle the burka comment. Bryan, to you first, is this going to hurt Trump?</p><p>BRYAN HOOK, former ADVISOR, WHITE HOUSE: You know, historically we try not to view American foreign policy through the lens of the burka. This is a very strange comment to be made when we are talking about a real crisis in the Middle East. It makes him in that entertainer column and less in the commander-in-chief column.</p><p>SMITH: Well, Richard, normally, you know, I think we'd be looking at a comment like that and saying, gosh, every controversial comment he makes he seems to go up in the polls. Now we are talking about him losing ground in Iowa, again, to Dr. Carson. Are things starting to change here?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Look, they're changing in a pretty fundamental way in this regard, Trump's whole calling card, incidentally so many of his comments are untethered from reality it makes me think he has a political death wish. His calling card is I'm a winner. If he loses, in his book he's a loser and there's nothing worse than being a loser to <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>So, he better turn that around in Iowa because he can't keep -- yes, he's ahead in all the other states, I understand that, but - incidentally, Ben Carson is the Gardner of this race, right? I know, I'm dating myself from the movie, being there, but he says all these inane things and people impute to it commonsense, when its, for the most part, idiocy. If I was a Republican, I would be scared to death, or frankly, somebody on Wall Street, that a major political party could nominate either of these two guys, it's scary.</p><p>SMITH: Bryan, it's hard to really decide where to go from here because it does seem that things are changing now, but at the same time, it seems like the establishment has been trying to figure out what to do with <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>but <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>responding to Richard's comment, has made it clear that he is not going to lose. He has made it clear that the second that he's dropping in the polls or it looks like he doesn't have a shot at winning the GOP primary, he said he's out of the race. He has made that very clear. So what naturally happens next?</p><p>HOOK: We have about a little less than 100 days until the Iowa caucus, and that's a long time in presidential politics. Trump is now down five points in that Monmouth poll since the last one. So we are -- we are seeing Trump lose altitude, and I think because we have what, you know, a few months left now, there's plenty of time for the race to move around. I do expect that you're going to see continual movement, and it's probably going to trend more in the establishment direction.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Can I raise an issue though, Gentlemen, and Rich, I know he's die to go make fun of me because I poo poo'ed when he said -</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELLL: He said Joe Biden was not going to run for president, and I said -- well, he's not. But with Iowa and to the good people of Iowa, how relevant are the caucuses, particularly with the Republicans, you look back, it was Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee were -</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the last two winners and they, well, were not the nominee?</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: Correct. Dagen, so you make a good point. There's even a different point, which is at this point four years ago, and I checked yesterday, on October 30th, 2011 poll, Herman Cain was in first, Mitt Romney was second, Rick Santorum, who ultimately won, was at five-percent. So, all this kind of bloviation about where the polls are, not just to us but everybody is a bit much and I think people have to take it into some perspective. You make a doubly good point, which is Iowa has not being a precursor of how somebody's going to do down the road. Again, for Trump, when your calling card is I'm a winner, and if you lose, that changes everything in people's eyes.</p><p>JONATHAN HILSENRATH, EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Can I jump in here? What struck me about these latest polls is that Ted Cruz is moving up. I want to hear both of you -- what you have to say about Ted Cruz and whether he's ready to make his move and whether such a move is sustainable?</p><p>HOOK: Senator Cruz has been hanging back and taking a very kind of slow and steady approach to the campaign and you know, somebody like Senator Cruz could play very well in Iowa but then when you see the other states that follow, New Hampshire, South Carolina and down the line, it gets a little trickier.</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: I would actually disagree a little bit, Bryan. Can I - if I don't mind. I predicted on your air, Sandra, with Maria, probably six weeks ago, that Cruz was the one to keep your eye on in this regard, I predict that Trump and Carson will crater. I think Cruz has a good shot at gutting kind of the evangelicals, the libertarians when Rand Paul goes away -</p><p>SMITH: If you're predict - if you're predicting that Dr. Carson will crater, we've heard your views on Trump, I'm going to force you to tell me why is Dr. Carson gaining so much in the polls right now.</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: So people say there's this whole outsider thing. That's just among Republicans, right? Democrats aren't showing any affection for outsiders and I think there's -- it's the same reason that tea party people are so angry with Congress. They are living kind of almost in an alternate reality that somehow or another, a guy like Carson, they just want to think that somehow there's something pure about him that's going to fix everything. It's, again, untethered from reality, but that would be my explanation for why Carson has this boom right now, because people just want to believe in those caucuses out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Richard, the democrats are showing benefit quite a bit of affection, in terms of money, at least, to -</p><p>SMITH: Bernie Sanders.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- to Bernie Sanders.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes, that's the socialist. He's a bit of an outside the mainstream in Washington.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No question. No question.</p><p>SMITH: Bryan last word to you.</p><p>HOOK: You're going to see continual movement around here. I also think you're going to see Ben Carson's change, probable quite a lot between now and when the first vote is cast in the Iowa caucuses.</p><p>SMITH: All right, good stuff. Bryan Hook and Richard Goodstein, thanks.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I will just quickly point out that Trump referred to the media as scum and horrible people so that made me feel good.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But meanwhile we spend every segment talking about the guy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly, so where would he be without these --</p><p>HILSENRATH: We love what he's doing for our ratings.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The horrible scum that we are.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH: All right, thank you, Gentlemen. Fox Business is teaming up with the \"Wall Street Journal\" to give you a Republican Debate focused on the economy, business and your money. Be sure to tune in on November 10th when the Republican candidates take the stage in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. You can only see that right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>I want to say thank you, Gentlemen. I was talking to our remote guests. Thank you, Dagen. Thank you, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Are you saying I'm not a gentleman?</p><p>SMITH: Moving on - oh, I can't win this morning. It must be Tuesday. Big tech earnings to look at this morning. Alibaba is scheduled to report before the bell, while Apple and Twitter are set to release results after the bell tonight. Everybody will be watching those. Estimates right now calling for Alibaba to post earnings per share .54 cents on revenues of $3.35 billion. Apple looking to beat Wall Street estimates for the fifth straight time. Investors will be focused on Iphone sales during the quarter and its forecast for the holidays. Twitter earnings puts the spotlight on newly minted CEO, Jack Dorsey. Since taking the reigns permanently this month, Dorsey has cut eight-percent of the company's workforce and donated a third of his stock to the employee equity pool.</p><p>Any big surprises that you're looking for today? Apple is going to be a big one to watch, obviously, and the fact that we are talking about the holidays when we are looking at all the earnings, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I'm certainly looking for Apple because the President of the Atlanta Fed has been saying this too, I want to see how consumers are holding up. There have been a lot of headwinds hitting the American economy. We've had a volatile stock market. We've had a stronger dollar, which is hurting exports. The big question for this economy is are consumers spending money? And we will see that if they're out buying Iphones.</p><p>SMITH: And it's shocking too, -- well, maybe not. As an economist you can tell me if I should be shocked, but here we have these low oil low prices, low gasoline prices and still we are not seeing the consumer spend that money elsewhere.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Not only that but we have unemployment rate coming down to nearly five -percent.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We have in American public that was scared by a very deep recession and slow recovery and people are reluctant to go out -</p><p>MCDOWELL: amazon is going to have record sales this holiday season.</p><p>SMITH: And FedEx says that they're going to have record shipments. So, people are shopping, it's just not necessarily -</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Mickey D's and Starbucks hit new all time highs in the stock market yesterday.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I don't know if McDonald's it's a great barometer for how aggressive Americans are spending.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- but the other one I'm looking at is Ford. I think Ford - we are having a car boom right now, a car sales boom.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: That's going to be an important one to watch.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So much that GM has given workers a raise, finally.</p><p>SMITH: All right, we are going to have more on that a little bit. Up next watch out for falling prices and drones. Why Wal-Mart wants to get into the drone delivery. Do you want one of these showing up in your doorstep?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: The United States sending a warship near one of China's artificial islands in the South China Sea. Cheryl Casone's following this story and more for us this morning. Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Sandra; good morning. Good morning, everyone. Defense Department officials say that a U.S. Navy Destroyer entered waters near the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea last night. The U.S. Lassen is armed with tomahawk missiles. This move is a direct challenge to China's claims that the artificial island chain is within its territorial boarders.</p><p>More than 300 people are dead after a 7.5 magnitude hit northeastern Afghanistan. Most of the deaths reported were in Pakistan, but tremors from the quake were also felt in northern India and Tajikistan. The death toll is set to rise, as the most severely affected areas are so remote that communications have been cut off.</p><p>Finally, the battle of the drones is heating up. This time it's Wal-Mart. The retailer applying to test drones, home delivery, curbside pickup and checking warehouse inventories. This move is a sign that the retailer plans to go head-to-head with amazon who has been vocal about their plans. Amazon says they're going to be ready to deliver these packages as soon as federal rules allow. That is the question mark because the FAA right, has to, you know, come together with the regulations. They're not even talking about beginning a framework, regulatory framework until 2016, at the earliest. So we can talk about delivery all we want. Are we going to see a drone in our doorstep? It's going to be a while.</p><p>SMITH: Right, so we're waiting on the air traffic control regulations these things, right, so they are not running into each other as they drop of your paper towels on your front door. I don't know, is that the goal?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just can't get my head around this how they would execute this, particularly in a crowded urban area. I don't understand - and growing up in a very rural area, that wouldn't make sense either. I don't under - I don't' get it.</p><p>SMITH: What do you think, Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH: There's a lot of suburb in the middle, and it looks like the FAA is moving towards allowing more and more of this, according to our story today on this, the FAA, it has issued already 2,000 approvals for testing and use of drones and commercial settings in different ways. What do I think of it? I think it's great. I think it's economic progress. It's an example of companies finding new ways to become more efficient.</p><p>SMITH: And it's exciting.</p><p>HILSENRATH: As creepy as it might feel -</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- because -</p><p>CASONE: No, it's dangerous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It just feels, with the volume of packages that some of these businesses ship, I don't understand how they would actually execute it.</p><p>(Cross talk)</p><p>CASONE: This is the war that's brewing though, between pilots, between the FAA, the air traffic controllers and the companies. I mean, it's a great business idea -</p><p>MCDOWELL: The FAA can't keep up as technology develops.</p><p>CASONE: -- but you already have pilots saying, Dagen, that they're seeing these drones and that they are - the minute one goes into an engine this whole story changes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But those are recreational drones that they've had the biggest problem --</p><p>CASONE: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- which now the FAA is requiring to be registered. A commercial drone would be less of a threat.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Dagen, when you look at a company like amazon or Wal-Mart, they have vast logistic organizations, --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- their job is to figure out how to make these things work at a lower cost than how to deal with -</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't want my skies filled with these.</p><p>SMITH: So just to Dagen's point, they're going to test this out in small residential neighborhoods first, that's according to the Wal-Mart, --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well they're also going to test it out in parking lots.</p><p>SMITH: -- and they're going to get permission from those living in the flight path, from the truck to the homes in that area. So it's complicated but it sounds like they --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, test them in parking lots because I'm too lazy to get out of my car and go into the Wal-Mart.</p><p>SMITH: I am.</p><p>HILSENRATH: This is progress.</p><p>SMITH: We have to go. Jon Hilsenrath says this is economic progress. We'll keep watching it. Coming up, investors waiting for the Federal Reserve's first rate hike in nearly a decade. I know somebody we can talk to about that.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH: We'll show you why you will not need to worry about that. We're keeping it simple for you right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: All right, welcome back. Let's get a quick check on markets this morning. Futures right now pointing to a selloff on Wall Street, a small one. We are looking a small fraction of percentage losses across the board there.</p><p>One hot topic investors are watching this week is the Federal Reserve. The central Bank on the verge of raising interest rates for the first time in years, but Jon Hilsenrath is here and he says consumers have nothing to fear because mortgage rates will stay low for quite some time. So you need to break this down for us and keep it simple.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right, so we are paying a lot of attention what the Fed is going to do. I have written a million stories about it this year, but the bottom line is for two reasons interest rates are going to stay low even after the Fed starts raising them. First of all, the U.S. economy and global economy are still fairy weak. They are not going gang busters, and in an environment like that, the Fed can't raise interest a lot. They might push them a little bit but not moving very fast. The other thing is that the Fed has telegraphed, they've already told us that they don't expect to raise aggressively after they do this first move, because inflation is also very low. So we are going into a period where once we get this first move off the Fed's table, there's going to be a very slow progression of follow-up interest rate increases.</p><p>If you look back to the 2004-2006 period, the last time Fed raised interest rates, we actually didn't see much movement in mortgage rates. In fact, we got a housing boom while the fed was raising rates.</p><p>SMITH: I was going to say, so that first interest rate hike, might it take some that are on the sidelines, might it bring in some of that pent up demand, where they're going to fear interest rates going higher so they'll jump in on the first hike?</p><p>HILSENRATH: I don't think it's going to be fear. I think what's going to happen is that when the Fed does this, people are going to say, hey, the world didn't end. I can get on with my life. I can go out and refinance my mortgage or take out a mortgage for a home -- particularly in the markets, you know. I think the markets are going to realize that the world didn't end when the feds does this and they're going to get on with the party.</p><p>SMITH: It's a good time to refinance right now?</p><p>HILSENRATH: You should refinance when it's right for you. If it's an opportunity now, you should go ahead and do it.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Jon Hilsenrath, thank you for keeping it simple. We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: Good morning, everyone. I'm Sandra Smith, Maria Bartiromo is off this morning. It is Tuesday, October 27, and with me this hour fox Business', Dagen McDowell, and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He said I was cranky this morning.</p><p>SMITH: He did?</p><p>MCDOWELL: He did. He's like, what's wrong with you? You're cranky. I said, no, I'm just disagreeing with you.</p><p>HILSENRATH: She's hating on drones.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I disagreed with you, there's a difference.</p><p>SMITH: Who said Tuesdays aren't fun? All right, these are your top stories at 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news: a debt deal on Capitol Hill. Congressional leaders and the White House reaching an agreement on a two year budget deal that also extends the debt limit.

It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: It will be a busy, busy day for earnings and economic data. Walmart taking a page out of Amazon's playbook. The retail giant wants drones to make deliveries at your front door. The company filing for regulatory approval to do so. Walmart also looking to use the devices to check warehouse inventories.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To the middle.

Instead, the company wants shoppers to spend that time outside.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here, here!</p><p>SMITH: Turning back to the markets, busy day on earnings and the economy. Alibaba scheduled to report earnings before the bell. Apple and Twitter are said to release results after the bell. We will also get September's Durable Goods orders which are expected to drop 1.2 percent as well as look at the housing market. Case-Shiller home price index will be out. Joining us to break all this down is Vining Sparks' Chief Economist Craig Dismuke. Welcome to you, Craig.</p><p>CRAIG DISMUKE, VINING SPARKS CHIEF ECONOMIST: Good morning.</p><p>SMITH: Alright, so, what are we looking for this morning? What is hot on your agenda?</p><p>DISMUKE: There are important reports, but right now everything is secondary to the inflation data. That is the real big elephant in a room kind of thing. Especially, with Fed policy and what is the Fed going to do. But in the durable-goods report, I expect we will see headline level orders expected to be down because of aircraft. Below that at the core level they're expected to be flat. What is most important will be the Capital goods orders report and specifically not a month over month basis because you get a little of noise on quarter over quarter basis. Orders have been pretty good. They're up 9.75 percent. That is their tracking for the quarter. Pointing for business investment being stronger in the future so that is good news. It's a good sign a business investment is stronger. If you look at the shipment of those items, they're up 2.75 percent quarter over quarter which point to business investment being of 2.75.</p><p>SMITH: Well, you obviously looked at these numbers closely. Much closer than any of us. Broadly speaking, where are we as far as economic progress in this recovery? Are we strengthening? And if we are, how slow or fast is it?</p><p>DISMUKE: I don't think we are strengthening. And John's point earlier, he mentioned the consumer is so key right now. This has been about the consumer driving economic growth and there have been phases to this recovery/expansion where different parts of the economy are driving activity. Right now, business investment has been weak, so it's down almost 5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. It was flat in the second quarter of this year.</p><p>Business investment has been up and down but overall, it's been weak. It is good news that business investment is a little bit better. That's positive. But at the end of the day, the consumer is what is key and it is an important report but I think it's secondary to what is happening with the consumer and then again with inflation.</p><p>JOHN HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Craig, I need you to settle a friendly disagreement between Dagen and me here about the housing market. We're getting home price data coming up. I say the housing market is strong and getting stronger. And she says it is garbage outside a few metro areas. What is your verdict and what are we going to see in the home price data that come out later today? Did I characterize your point of view?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST: Yes. And you used the word garbage (inaudible).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DISMUKE: It is home prices have been fairly strong, very little inventory. There's construction costs going up. Labor costs going up a little bit in housing. Lumber prices are down. Prices are generally going up. It is very -- the housing data is enigmatic right now. We are getting some weak data. Existing home sales better than expected last month. New home sales down 11.5 percent.</p><p>We keep getting this up and down activity. So, I would say in general housing market is trending better. But, there is that challenge and the challenge is if you look at 2013 when mortgage rates rose 90 basis points, housing total sales fell 13 percent. So, that was unusual. To see that drop from a 90 basis point increase. So, you look at what is different in the housing market today than in previous cycles. The biggest difference today is when you look at the number of owner occupied units which are down $2 million in 2005 and rent occupied units which are $10 million since 2006. Which is not good because people who rent cars don't wash them. I have never washed one.</p><p>Some people who rent houses or rent multifamily places aren't going to make a capital investment where they are living that we had when we had more of an ownership society so long term as a challenge.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We saw in the Glass-Steagall people over invested in those homes and wasted capital in the process. And a lot of other countries you don't have as much emphasis on home ownership. And they have perfectly civil society.</p><p>DISMUKE: Sure, but their economic growth is not as strong as we saw when we had more of a homeownership society. When you own something you take more pride in it and you're going to invest in it. And so, I think, in long-term it will be a different housing market. The peak housing was 6.2 percent.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Also, demographics at play here.</p><p>DISMUKE: That's a big one. The aging population is a demographic issue. It doesn't get enough focus at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like buying homes and selling it though.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: I don't think seniors are going to start trashing their homes. It's a different dynamic.</p><p>SMITH: Almost like those houses are maintained to higher standard because they are turned over so often and have to be maintained. That is the discussion for another day. Craig, great stuff. Thank you. Interesting perspective. John, you win.</p><p>MCDOWELL: John just leaned in and said I was right</p><p>SMITH: Alright. JP Morgan with its own mobile payment platform to rival existing services like Apple Paid. Nicole Petallides has that story this morning. Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST: That's right. The country's largest bank is stepping into the ring with the world's most valuable company. JP Morgan is the latest investor in the mobile payments based announcing Chase Pay, a platform that will allow Chase customers to make retail purchases using their smart phone. Creating a direct competitor to Apple Pay. JP Morgan says it has already won the endorsement of a major group of merchants giving it a leg up on the tech savvy rivals. So, the question is are consumers ready to use their phones, smart phones, ditch the credit cards and what happened to cash is king?</p><p>SMITH: Anybody use Apple Pay?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have signed up for it but I don't know how to use it in stores.</p><p>PETALLIDES: Using your smart phone will be the preferred method of payment. I mean, I just got used to using my debit card in the taxi. Just got out of using cash. This is the wave of the future and there is Apple Pay, Chase Pay credit cards.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: A total shift back to cash because everyone is afraid of the paper trail using credit cards and people accessing their data and now, we're going to be even more exposed with all this going on to our smart phones.</p><p>HILSENRATH: There isn't going to be. We see where it is going. People moving more towards mobile payments. And cash. I could go weeks without using my cash.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's why I use a credit card over cash and smart phones. Because I use cash. If I have more than $20, I will drop it and lose it. HILSENRATH: I call it bonus bucks when I discover cash.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If I lose it, it usually comes back. I have a tendency to drop it. And with a credit card I keep one credit card in my pocket.</p><p>SMITH: You guys must not be good tippers. How can you go through New York City without a few bucks in your pocket? Not that kind.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You add the tip. You don't have to worry about signing a form.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: This is just to bring it back to drones. This is like drones. This is progress when we see new ways of making payments.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I fully believe (inaudible)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETALLIDES: Be honest here. It's unbelievable. This is the wave of the future. Kids staying with babysitters and nannies demand it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Don't forget to start your day with Nicole Petallides on FBN: a.m. at 5:00 a.m. eastern. Catch it on the Fox Business Network. Up next. Is there a link between artificial turf and cancer?</p><p>We'll look at a new report that could cause major concerns in the world of sports. A lot of people have been talking about this.

Cheryl Casone has that story.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST: Jeffrey Katzenberg is crediting Elon Musk with his survival after a life-threatening car accident in Hollywood on October 19th.

Not thousands of movies.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But you're only sharing a password with one friend.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How much revenue if they get shared around a lot more. Netflix, they have subscriptions where you get the family plan or two log ins.</p><p>CASONE: This really hurts HBO and Showtime and HULU. And they don't have a way to know your giving your password to whether people. For all they know you have the computer going in one room and your TV going and it is you. The same as if you have a wall street journal log on and share it with somebody.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: You will always get leakage and you have to live with it. To the extent that it makes your friend or your relative that much more interested than your Hulu (inaudible)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Leakage in the digital world is much greater than in the paper world.</p><p>HILSENRATH: It has always been there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's always been there, but Sandra. She is about to lose her stuff.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SMITH: Thanks Dagen.</p><p>CASONE: All fair point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: I don't share my password with anyone. (CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The word retailers use to describe the thievery or shoplifting.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Athletes and parents beware the artificial turf at thousands of schools and parks around the country could be dangerous. The New York Times did this story a year ago. A lot of people still talking about it and surprised by it. Find out what is behind the latest health scare on this turf. Straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Top headlines in the Wall Street Journal. After years of decline, U.S. imports on the rise as low oil prices forced domestic producers to scale back supplies. Phil Flynn and the CME group. So, Phil, long story short, we are not producing as much here so we are having to buy it there and bring it in. Is that what is happening?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, CME GROUP: Well, that's exactly what is happening and we are losing the OPECSaudi Arabia started. What we are seeing is these other OPEC oil producers, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia are cutting prices, driving our guys out of business. This is what Saudi rate wanted to do. Can they sustain this price war? We know they are having big financial problems in these countries.</p><p>They can't continue to cut prices below our producers. The quality of the oil they are getting. Our refiners are used to refining Saudi oil and Nigerian oil. The shale oil is a little more difficult for them to refine because it is such a high-quality type of oil. They are not used to doing it, better off to export.</p><p>The other big story, natural gas, lowest price in three years. We broke below $2, 1 million metric BTUs. Winter might have been canceled because warm weather forecasts driving prices lower.</p><p>SMITH: This is part of the deal that was reached late last night. U.S. is planning to sell millions of barrels of crude oil from our strategic petroleum reserve from 2018 through 2025 under the budget deal reached last night. This is the second time the U.S. has raised cash from the reserve. Notable event?</p><p>FLYNN: It is a very notable event. It's basically showing we don't need the strategic petroleum reserve. We have a new reserve called North Dakota. The global energy market is changing. The other thing when you look at selling oil from the reserve, from the policy when we were worried about peak oil and the Middle East cutting off power supply. Now they're burying us with supplies.</p><p>SMITH: And the report shows a link with green artificial turf and cancer. Questions have been raised about synthetic fiber and scrap tire that makes up the surface. There's the belief that the tiny black rubber crimson the surface which have been known to contain carcinogens and chemicals can make people sick. However, there is no scientific data to prove the connection between the two. Okay, John. Your son plays football and lacrosse on turf.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Plays on turf all the time. My two sons and my daughter play on turf all the time. Frankly, there are a lot of other things that happen on those fields I worry about a lot more. When there's no scientific evidence to back it up. You worry about concussions and other injuries. I want to see some hard evidence before I put this on the list of things to worry about.</p><p>SMITH: We were living on asphalt green, so fun to play on it but it made you think all the little black or brown pellets in the turf. You get up and it's all over you. Amazing. It gets in their mouths, makes you wonder.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have bruises, doing a workout in the last few days. I think maybe you ought to worry about feeding your kids bacon and hot dogs if you are worried about cancer before you worry about artificial turf. Based on the Wall Street Journal today. That is the big deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Red meat tied to cancer. Pay a little more attention because there is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: Most of these reports is more correlation than causation.</p><p>HILSENRATH: The health organizations study is more scientific and I haven't looked at it but I would think they're close it to causation and correlation. The other problem here is every couple of weeks there is a news story telling us you need to worry about this or that. Americans are over worried with worried lists.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You ought to worry. Women getting lung cancer who never smoked is on the rise. Even as the numbers of people who are not smoking in this country are declining. And yet, they have to figure out what it is called.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But, you can stop doing everything. You got to figure out what is causing it and respond to that. You can't stop going on artificial turf.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: Russell investments Steven Wood joins us to weigh in on a big day of tech earnings. Plus, former treasury secretary David Malpass with his thoughts on a potential budget deal. We have a great couple hours coming up. Stay tuned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: Sandra Smith in for Maria Bartiroma. With me is Fox Business's Dagen McDowell and Wall Street Journal Chief Economic Correspondent Jon Hilsenrath. But, first your top stories breaking news. A debt deal on Capitol Hill and congressional leaders reaching an agreement on a two- year budget deal that also extends the debt limit.

We are getting earnings from big names, including  Alibaba, Ford and UPS.  We'll get readings on durable goods orders, home  prices and consumer confidence.  Ahead of all of that we are looking at  futures markets here in the U.S., pointing to go lower open on Wall Street,  small losses to kick off this Tuesday morning.  Dow Futures off eight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech also in focus.  Both Apple and Twitter set to report earnings after  the close of trading today.  Checking in on market action overseas, looking  over in Europe, where trading has gotten started, you're looking at the  FTSE in London off 21 points; the CAC in France, off just a small a  fraction of a percent, down two points.  The DAX in Germany slightly  higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wal-Mart taking a page out of amazon's playbook.

Ravens Quarterback, Joe Flacco,  intercepted in the end zone, and Arizona won the game, 26-18.</p><p>And it's a big night for baseball.  The World Series getting underway  tonight in Kansas City.  The Mets and Royals getting in one last workout  yesterday before the series begins.  It's said to be a pricey series for  fans.  The average ticket price is $723 and climbing, that's according to  StubHub this morning and it gets more expensive when the teams face off in  New York on Wednesday.</p><p>Well let's get to that new Monmouth University poll out this morning  showing Donald Trump losing more ground in the state of Iowa, while making  more controversial comments in a town hall in New Hampshire.  Blake Burman  has all the latest from Washington, and it gets even more interesting this  morning, Black.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Day by day it does, Sandra.  Good morning  to you.  Donald Trump still holds commanding leads nationally, and in a  couple of the early of the early voting states, but there's a growing trend  in Iowa, according to polls taken there over the last week.  Dr. Ben Carson  has supplanted Trump in the first caucus state.  Take a look at this:   Carson has won four of the last five polls there with the fifth being a  tie.  They're all fairly sizable spreads, with the most recent from  Monmouth University showing Carson with a 14-point lead.</p><p>Meantime, Trump is facing some scrutiny for a couple of comments he made  yesterday in New Hampshire.  In one of them Trump said it's easy for women  to wear burkas because they don't have to wear makeup.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  In fact, it's easier.  You don't  have to put on makeup.  Look how beautiful everyone looks.  Wouldn't it be  easier? Right?  Wouldn't that be easy?  I tell you, if I was a woman, I don't want  to -- I'm ready, darling, let's go.  It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Separately, Sandra, Trump also took credit for Ford's decision to  halt production plants truck plans in Mexico and stay in Ohio.  However,  that was strongly disputed by Ford and Ohio Governor, and presidential candidate, John  Kasich.  Sandra.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, Blake Burman, thank you.  Let's bring in former White  House advisor to President Bush, Bryan Hook and Democratic Strategist,  Richard Goodstein.  Guys, I don't know where to begin.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH:  Let's first tackle the burka comment.  Bryan, to you first, is this  going to hurt Trump?</p><p>BRYAN HOOK, former ADVISOR, WHITE HOUSE:  You know, historically we try not  to view American foreign policy through the lens of the burka.  This is a  very strange comment to be made when we are talking about a real crisis in  the Middle East.  It makes him in that entertainer column and less in the  commander-in-chief column.</p><p>SMITH:  Well, Richard, normally, you know, I think we'd be looking at a  comment like that and saying, gosh, every controversial comment he makes he seems  to go up in the polls.  Now we are talking about him losing ground in Iowa,  again, to Dr. Carson.  Are things starting to change here?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Look, they're changing in a  pretty fundamental way in this regard, Trump's whole calling card,  incidentally so many of his comments are untethered from reality it makes  me think he has a political death wish.  His calling card is I'm a winner.   If he loses, in his book he's a loser and there's nothing worse than being  a loser to Donald Trump.  So, he better turn that around in Iowa because he  can't keep -- yes, he's ahead in all the other states, I understand that,  but - incidentally, Ben Carson is the Gardner of this race, right?  I know,  I'm dating myself from the movie, being there, but he says all these inane  things and people impute to it commonsense, when its, for the most part,  idiocy.  If I was a Republican, I would be scared to death, or frankly,  somebody on Wall Street, that a major political party could nominate either  of these two guys, it's scary.</p><p>SMITH:  Bryan, it's hard to really decide where to go from here because it  does seem that things are changing now, but at the same time, it seems like  the establishment has been trying to figure out what to do with Donald  Trump, but Donald Trump, responding to Richard's comment, has made it clear  that he is not going to lose.  He has made it clear that the second that  he's dropping in the polls or it looks like he doesn't have a shot at  winning the GOP primary, he said he's out of the race.  He has made that  very clear.  So what naturally happens next?</p><p>HOOK:  We have about a little less than 100 days until the Iowa caucus, and  that's a long time in presidential politics.  Trump is now down five points  in that Monmouth poll since the last one.  So we are -- we are seeing Trump  lose altitude, and I think because we have what, you know, a few months left now, there's plenty of time for  the race to move around.  I do expect that you're going to see continual  movement, and it's probably going to trend more in the establishment  direction.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Can I raise an issue though, Gentlemen,  and Rich, I know he's die to go make fun of me because I poo poo'ed when he  said - </p><p>GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  He said Joe Biden was not going to run for president, and I said -- well, he's not. But with Iowa and to the good people of Iowa, how  relevant are the caucuses, particularly with the Republicans, you look back, it was Rick  Santorum and Mike Huckabee were - </p><p>GOLDSTEIN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- the last two winners and they, well, were not the nominee?</p><p>GOLDSTEIN:  Correct.  Dagen, so you make a good point.  There's even a  different point, which is at this point four years ago, and I checked yesterday, on  October 30th, 2011 poll, Herman Cain was in first, Mitt Romney was second,  Rick Santorum, who ultimately won, was at five-percent.  So, all this kind  of bloviation about where the polls are, not just to us but everybody is a  bit much and I think people have to take it into some perspective.  You  make a doubly good point, which is Iowa has not being a precursor of how  somebody's going to do down the road.  Again, for Trump, when your calling  card is I'm a winner, and if you lose, that changes everything in people's  eyes.</p><p>JONATHAN HILSENRATH, EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Can I jump in  here?  What struck me about these latest polls is that Ted Cruz is moving  up.  I want to hear both of you -- what you have to say about Ted Cruz and  whether he's ready to make his move and whether such a move is sustainable?</p><p>HOOK:  Senator Cruz has been hanging back and taking a very kind of slow  and steady approach to the campaign and you know, somebody like Senator  Cruz could play very well in Iowa but then when you see the other states  that follow, New Hampshire, South Carolina and down the line, it gets a  little trickier.  </p><p>GOLDSTEIN:  I would actually disagree a little bit, Bryan.  Can I - if I  don't mind.  I predicted on your air, Sandra, with Maria, probably six  weeks ago, that Cruz was the one to keep your eye on in this regard, I  predict that Trump and Carson will crater.  I think Cruz has a good shot at  gutting kind of the evangelicals, the libertarians when Rand Paul goes away  -</p><p>SMITH:  If you're predict - if you're predicting that Dr. Carson will  crater, we've heard your views on Trump, I'm going to force you to tell me  why is Dr. Carson gaining so much in the polls right now.</p><p>GOLDSTEIN:  So people say there's this whole outsider thing.  That's just  among Republicans, right?  Democrats aren't showing any affection for  outsiders and I think there's -- it's the same reason that tea party people  are so angry with Congress.  They are living kind of almost in an alternate  reality that somehow or another, a guy like Carson, they just want to think  that somehow there's something pure about him that's going to fix  everything.  It's, again, untethered from reality, but that would be my   explanation for why Carson has this boom right now, because people just  want to believe in those caucuses out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Richard, the democrats are showing benefit quite a bit of  affection, in terms of money, at least, to -</p><p>SMITH:  Bernie Sanders.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- to Bernie Sanders.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes, that's the socialist.  He's a bit of an outside the  mainstream in Washington.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  No question.  No question.</p><p>SMITH:  Bryan last word to you.</p><p>HOOK:  You're going to see continual movement around here.  I also think  you're going to see Ben Carson's change, probable quite a lot between now  and when the first vote is cast in the Iowa caucuses.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, good stuff.  Bryan Hook and Richard Goodstein, thanks.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I will just quickly point out that Trump referred to the  media as scum and horrible people so that made me feel good.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But meanwhile we spend every segment talking about the guy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly, so where would he be without these --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We love what he's doing for our ratings.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The horrible scum that we are.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH:  All right, thank you, Gentlemen.  Fox Business is teaming up with  the \"Wall Street Journal\" to give you a Republican Debate focused on the  economy, business and your money.  Be sure to tune in on November 10th when  the Republican candidates take the stage in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  You can  only see that right here on the Fox Business Network.  </p><p>I want to say thank you, Gentlemen.  I was talking to our remote guests.   Thank you, Dagen.  Thank you, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Are you saying I'm not a gentleman?</p><p>SMITH:  Moving on - oh, I can't win this morning.  It must be Tuesday.  Big  tech earnings to look at this morning.  Alibaba is scheduled to report  before the bell, while Apple and Twitter are set to release results after  the bell tonight.  Everybody will be watching those.  Estimates right now  calling for Alibaba to post earnings per share .54 cents on revenues of $3.35 billion.  Apple looking to beat Wall Street  estimates for the fifth straight time.  Investors will be focused on Iphone  sales during the quarter and its forecast for the holidays.  Twitter  earnings puts the spotlight on newly minted CEO, Jack Dorsey.  Since taking the reigns permanently this month, Dorsey has cut  eight-percent of the company's workforce and donated a third of his stock  to the employee equity pool.</p><p>Any big surprises that you're looking for today?  Apple is going to be a  big one to watch, obviously, and the fact that we are talking about the  holidays when we are looking at all the earnings, Jon. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I'm certainly looking for Apple because the President of the  Atlanta Fed has been saying this too, I want to see how consumers are  holding up.  There have been a lot of headwinds hitting the American  economy.  We've had a volatile stock market.  We've had a stronger dollar,  which is hurting exports.  The big question for this economy is are  consumers spending money?  And we will see that if they're out buying  Iphones.</p><p>SMITH:  And it's shocking too, -- well, maybe not.  As an economist you can  tell me if I should be shocked, but here we have these low oil low prices,  low gasoline prices and still we are not seeing the consumer spend that  money elsewhere.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Not only that but we have unemployment rate coming down to  nearly five -percent.</p><p>SMITH:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We have in American public that was scared by a very deep  recession and slow recovery and people are reluctant to go out -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  amazon is going to have record sales this holiday season.</p><p>SMITH:  And FedEx says that they're going to have record shipments.  So,  people are shopping, it's just not necessarily - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Mickey D's and Starbucks hit new all time highs in the stock  market yesterday.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I don't know if McDonald's it's a great barometer for how  aggressive Americans are spending.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- but the other one I'm looking at is Ford.  I think Ford -  we are having a car boom right now, a car sales boom.</p><p>SMITH:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's going to be an important one to watch.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So much that GM has given workers a raise, finally.</p><p>SMITH: All right, we are going to have more on that a little bit.  Up next  watch out for falling prices and drones.  Why Wal-Mart wants to get into  the drone delivery.  Do you want one of these showing up in your doorstep?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  The United States sending a warship near one of China's artificial  islands in the South China Sea.  Cheryl Casone's following this story and  more for us this morning.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Sandra; good morning.   Good morning, everyone.  Defense Department officials say that a U.S. Navy  Destroyer entered waters near the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea  last night.  The U.S. Lassen is armed with tomahawk missiles.  This move is  a direct challenge to China's claims that the artificial island chain is  within its territorial boarders.  </p><p>More than 300 people are dead after a 7.5 magnitude hit northeastern  Afghanistan.  Most of the deaths reported were in Pakistan, but tremors  from the quake were also felt in northern India and Tajikistan.  The death  toll is set to rise, as the most severely affected areas are so remote that  communications have been cut off.</p><p>Finally, the battle of the drones is heating up.  This time it's Wal-Mart.   The retailer applying to test drones, home delivery, curbside pickup and  checking warehouse inventories.  This move is a sign that the retailer  plans to go head-to-head with amazon who has been vocal about their plans.   Amazon says they're going to be ready to deliver these packages as soon as  federal rules allow.  That is the question mark because the FAA right, has  to, you know, come together with the regulations.  They're not even talking  about beginning a framework, regulatory framework until 2016, at the  earliest.  So we can talk about delivery all we want.  Are we going to see  a drone in our doorstep?  It's going to be a while.</p><p>SMITH:  Right, so we're waiting on the air traffic control regulations  these things, right, so they are not running into each other as they drop  of your paper towels on your front door.  I don't know, is that the goal?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just can't get my head around this how they would execute  this, particularly in a crowded urban area. I don't understand - and  growing up in a very rural area, that wouldn't make sense either.  I don't  under - I don't' get it.</p><p>SMITH:  What do you think, Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  There's a lot of suburb in the middle, and it looks like the  FAA is moving towards allowing more and more of this, according to our story today  on this, the FAA, it has issued already 2,000 approvals for testing and use  of drones and  commercial settings in different ways.  What do I think of  it?  I think it's great.  I think it's economic progress.  It's an example  of companies finding new ways to become more efficient.</p><p>SMITH:  And it's exciting.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  As creepy as it might feel -</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because -</p><p>CASONE:  No, it's dangerous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It just feels, with the volume of packages that some of these  businesses ship, I don't understand how they would actually execute it.  </p><p>(Cross talk)</p><p>CASONE:  This is the war that's brewing though, between pilots, between the  FAA, the air traffic controllers and the companies.  I mean, it's a great  business idea -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The FAA can't keep up as technology develops.</p><p>CASONE:  -- but you already have pilots saying, Dagen, that they're seeing  these drones and that they are - the minute one goes into an engine this  whole story changes. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But those are recreational drones that they've had the biggest  problem --</p><p>CASONE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- which now the FAA is requiring to be registered.  A  commercial drone would be less of a threat.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Dagen, when you look at a company like amazon or Wal-Mart, they have vast logistic organizations, --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- their job is to figure out how to make these things work at  a lower cost than how to deal with -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't want my skies filled with these.</p><p>SMITH:  So just to Dagen's point, they're going to test this out in small  residential neighborhoods first, that's according to the Wal-Mart, --</p><p>HILSENRATH:   Well they're also going to test it out in parking lots.</p><p>SMITH:  -- and they're going to get permission from those living in the  flight path, from the truck to the homes in that area.  So it's complicated  but it sounds like they --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, test them in parking lots because I'm too lazy to get out  of my car and go into the Wal-Mart.</p><p>SMITH:  I am.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  This is progress.</p><p>SMITH:  We have to go.  Jon Hilsenrath says this is economic progress.   We'll keep watching it.  Coming up, investors waiting for the Federal  Reserve's first rate hike in nearly a decade.  I know somebody we can talk  to about that.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH:  We'll show you why you will not need to worry about that.  We're  keeping it simple for you right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: All right, welcome back.  Let's get a quick check on markets this  morning. Futures right  now pointing to a selloff on Wall Street, a small one.  We  are looking a small fraction of percentage losses across the board there.  </p><p>One hot topic investors are watching this week is the Federal Reserve.  The  central Bank on the verge of raising interest rates for the first time in years,  but Jon Hilsenrath is here and he says consumers have nothing to fear  because mortgage rates will stay low for quite some time.  So you need to  break this down for us and keep it simple.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right, so we are paying a lot of attention what the Fed is  going to do.  I have written a million stories about it this year, but the  bottom line is for two reasons interest rates are going to stay low even  after the Fed starts raising them.  First of all, the U.S. economy and  global economy are still fairy weak.  They are not going gang busters, and  in an environment like that, the Fed can't raise interest a lot.  They  might push them a little bit but not moving very fast.  The other thing is  that the Fed has telegraphed, they've already told us that they don't  expect to raise aggressively after they do this first move, because  inflation is also very low.  So we are going into a period where once we  get this first move off the Fed's table, there's going to be a very slow  progression of follow-up interest rate increases.</p><p>If you look back to the 2004-2006 period, the last time Fed raised interest  rates, we actually didn't see much movement in mortgage rates.  In fact, we  got a housing boom while the fed was raising rates.</p><p>SMITH: I was going to say, so that first interest rate hike, might it take  some that are on the sidelines, might it bring in some of that pent up  demand, where they're going to fear interest rates going higher so they'll  jump in on the first hike?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I don't think it's going to be fear.  I think what's going to  happen is that when the Fed does this, people are going to say, hey, the  world didn't end.  I can get on with my life.  I can go out and refinance  my mortgage or take out a mortgage for a home -- particularly in the  markets, you know.  I think the markets are going to realize that the world  didn't end when the feds does this and they're going to get on with the  party.</p><p>SMITH:  It's a good time to refinance right now?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  You should refinance when it's right for you.  If it's an  opportunity now, you should go ahead and do it.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, Jon Hilsenrath, thank you for keeping it simple.  We  will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Sandra Smith, Maria Bartiromo is off  this morning.  It is Tuesday, October 27, and with me this hour fox   Business', Dagen McDowell, and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He said I was cranky this morning.</p><p>SMITH:  He did?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He did.  He's like, what's wrong with you?  You're cranky.  I  said, no, I'm just disagreeing with you.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  She's hating on drones.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I disagreed with you, there's a difference.</p><p>SMITH:  Who said Tuesdays aren't fun?  All right, these are your top  stories at 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news:  a debt deal on Capitol Hill.  Congressional leaders and the  White House reaching an agreement on a two year budget deal that also  extends the debt limit.  This marks one of the final acts for House  Speaker, John Boehner, who is set to leave office Friday.</p><p>Turning to the 2016 race, Donald Trump losing more ground to Ben Carson in  Iowa.  The latest university poll shows Ben Carson has a double digit lead  over Donald Trump, 32 percent to 18 percent.  This coming as Trump made  another round of controversial comments especially on women wearing a  burkas. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE-REPUBLICAN: It is easy.  You  don't have to put on makeup.  Look how beautiful everyone looks.  Isn't  that easy?  I tell you, if I was a woman I would.  I am ready, darling.   Let's go.  It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH:  It will be a busy, busy day for earnings and economic data.   Walmart taking a page out of Amazon's playbook.  The retail giant wants  drones to make deliveries at your front door.  The company filing for  regulatory approval to do so.  Walmart also looking to use the devices to  check warehouse inventories. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To the middle.  Secured and intercepted by Tony  Jefferson. </p><p>SMITH:  The Baltimore Ravens missing a chance to tie up the game on the  final play against the Arizona Cardinals.  The Ravens Quarterback Joe  Flacco was intercepted in the end zone and Arizona won the game 26 to 18. </p><p>It's a big night for baseball.  The World Series getting under way tonight  in Kansas City.  Pitcher Matt Harvey is getting a start for the Mets and he  will be going up against Edinson Volquez. </p><p>And one retailer is going dark on Black Friday.  REI Sporting goods is  canceling deals for the day and shutting down stores.  Instead, the company  wants shoppers to spend that time outside. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Here, here!</p><p>SMITH:  Turning back to the markets, busy day on earnings and the economy.   Alibaba scheduled to report earnings before the bell.  Apple and Twitter  are said to release results after the bell.  We will also get September's  Durable Goods orders which are expected to drop 1.2 percent as well as look  at the housing market.  Case-Shiller home price index will be out.  Joining  us to break all this down is Vining Sparks' Chief Economist Craig Dismuke.   Welcome to you, Craig.  </p><p>CRAIG DISMUKE, VINING SPARKS CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Good morning.</p><p>SMITH:  Alright, so, what are we looking for this morning?  What is hot on  your agenda? </p><p>DISMUKE:  There are important reports, but right now everything is  secondary to the inflation data.  That is the real big elephant in a room  kind of thing.  Especially, with Fed policy and what is the Fed going to  do.  But in the durable-goods report, I expect we will see headline level  orders expected to be down because of aircraft.  Below that at the core  level they're expected to be flat.  What is most important will be the  Capital goods orders report and specifically not a month over month basis  because you get a little of noise on quarter over quarter basis.  Orders  have been pretty good.  They're up 9.75 percent.  That is their tracking  for the quarter.  Pointing for business investment being stronger in the  future so that is good news.  It's a good sign a business investment is  stronger.  If you look at the shipment of those items, they're up 2.75  percent quarter over quarter which point to business investment being of  2.75. </p><p>SMITH:  Well, you obviously looked at these numbers closely.  Much closer  than any of us.  Broadly speaking, where are we as far as economic progress  in this recovery?  Are we strengthening?  And if we are, how slow or fast  is it? </p><p>DISMUKE:  I don't think we are strengthening.  And John's point earlier, he  mentioned the consumer is so key right now.  This has been about the  consumer driving economic growth and there have been phases to this  recovery/expansion where different parts of the economy are driving  activity.  Right now, business investment has been weak, so it's down  almost 5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.  It was flat in the  second quarter of this year.  </p><p>Business investment has been up and down but overall, it's been weak.  It  is good news that business investment is a little bit better.  That's  positive.  But at the end of the day, the consumer is what is key and it is  an important report but I think it's secondary to what is happening with  the consumer and then again with inflation. </p><p>JOHN HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Craig, I need you to settle a  friendly disagreement between Dagen and me here about the housing market.   We're getting home price data coming up.  I say the housing market is  strong and getting stronger.  And she says it is garbage outside a few  metro areas.  What is your verdict and what are we going to see in the home  price data that come out later today?  Did I characterize your point of  view?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST:  Yes.  And you used the word  garbage (inaudible).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DISMUKE:  It is home prices have been fairly strong, very little inventory.   There's construction costs going up.  Labor costs going up a little bit in  housing.  Lumber prices are down.  Prices are generally going up.  It is  very -- the housing data is enigmatic right now.  We are getting some weak  data.  Existing home sales better than expected last month.  New home sales  down 11.5 percent.</p><p>We keep getting this up and down activity.  So, I would say in general  housing market is trending better.  But, there is that challenge and the  challenge is if you look at 2013 when mortgage rates rose 90 basis points,  housing total sales fell 13 percent.  So, that was unusual.  To see that  drop from a 90 basis point increase.  So, you look at what is different in  the housing market today than in previous cycles.  The biggest difference  today is when you look at the number of owner occupied units which are down  $2 million in 2005 and rent occupied units which are $10 million since  2006.  Which is not good because people who rent cars don't wash them.  I  have never washed one.</p><p>Some people who rent houses or rent multifamily places aren't going to make  a capital investment where they are living that we had when we had more of  an ownership society so long term as a challenge. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  We saw in the Glass-Steagall people over invested in those  homes and wasted capital in the process.  And a lot of other countries you  don't have as much emphasis on home ownership.  And they have perfectly  civil society. </p><p>DISMUKE:  Sure, but their economic growth is not as strong as we saw when  we had more of a homeownership society.  When you own something you take  more pride in it and you're going to invest in it.  And so, I think, in  long-term it will be a different housing market.  The peak housing was 6.2  percent.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Also, demographics at play here. </p><p>DISMUKE:  That's a big one.  The aging population is a demographic issue.  It doesn't get enough focus at this point. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like buying homes and selling it though. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I don't think seniors are going to start trashing their homes.   It's a different dynamic. </p><p>SMITH:  Almost like those houses are maintained to higher standard because  they are turned over so often and have to be maintained.  That is the  discussion for another day.  Craig, great stuff.  Thank you.  Interesting  perspective.  John, you win.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  John just leaned in and said I was right</p><p>SMITH:  Alright.  JP Morgan with its own mobile payment platform to rival  existing services like Apple Paid.  Nicole Petallides has that story this  morning.  Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST:  That's right.  The country's  largest bank is stepping into the ring with the world's most valuable  company.  JP Morgan is the latest investor in the mobile payments based  announcing Chase Pay, a platform that will allow Chase customers to make  retail purchases using their smart phone.  Creating a direct competitor to  Apple Pay.  JP Morgan says it has already won the endorsement of a major  group of merchants giving it a leg up on the tech savvy rivals.  So, the  question is are consumers ready to use their phones, smart phones, ditch  the credit cards and what happened to cash is king? </p><p>SMITH:  Anybody use Apple Pay? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have signed up for it but I don't know how to use it in  stores. </p><p>PETALLIDES:  Using your smart phone will be the preferred method of  payment.  I mean, I just got used to using my debit card in the taxi.  Just  got out of using cash.  This is the wave of the future and there is Apple  Pay, Chase Pay credit cards.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  A total shift back to cash because everyone is afraid of the paper  trail using credit cards and people accessing their data and  now, we're  going to be even more exposed with all this going on to our smart phones. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  There isn't going to be.  We see where it is going.  People  moving more towards mobile payments.  And cash.  I could go weeks without  using my cash. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's why I use a credit card over cash and smart phones.   Because I use cash.  If I have more than $20, I will drop it and lose it.  HILSENRATH:  I call it bonus bucks when I discover cash. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If I lose it, it usually comes back.  I have a tendency to drop  it.  And with a credit card I keep one credit card in my pocket. </p><p>SMITH:  You guys must not be good tippers.  How can you go through New York  City without a few bucks in your pocket?  Not that kind.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You add the tip.  You don't have to worry about signing a form. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  This is just to bring it back to drones.  This is like drones.   This is progress when we see new ways of making payments. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I fully believe (inaudible)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETALLIDES:  Be honest here.  It's unbelievable.  This is the wave of the  future.  Kids staying with babysitters and nannies demand it.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  Alright.  Don't forget to start your day with Nicole Petallides on  FBN: a.m. at 5:00 a.m. eastern.  Catch it on the Fox Business Network.  Up  next.  Is there a link between artificial turf and cancer?  </p><p>We'll look at a new report that could cause major concerns in the world of  sports.  A lot of people have been talking about this.  Keep it right here  on Fox Business.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  Dreamworks Animation's CEO thanking Elon Musk for saving his life.   Cheryl Casone has that story. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST:  Jeffrey Katzenberg is crediting  Elon Musk with his survival after a life-threatening car accident in  Hollywood on October 19th.  Dreamworks Animation's CEO drove an electric  Tesla model X Sedan.  His car was totaled.  He needed surgery after  injuring his arm and wrist in the accident but he credits his life-saving  experience and crash, thanks to Tesla.</p><p>Our sources say Bill De Blasio is getting to endorse Hillary Clinton before  his planned candidate forum on November 6th.  Discussions are reportedly  under way between the two sides and how Bill De Blasio backing Clinton will  be announced.  </p><p>And according to a recent survey, 49 percent of streaming on demand users  ages 8 to 29 share at least one account with someone outside of their home. </p><p>HBO and other video providers might not encourage password sharing, but  they also don't track it.  And we know it happens all the time.  You give  your log information to a friend of a friend or your parents, your neighbor  and they use the service.  They can't track it.  This proliferates. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So, how is that different from me leaving my newspaper at the  airport and someone picking it up and reading it?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's one newspaper.  Not thousands of movies. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But you're only sharing a password with one friend.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How much revenue if they get shared around a lot more.  Netflix,  they have subscriptions where you get the family plan or two log ins.  </p><p>CASONE:  This really hurts HBO and Showtime and HULU.  And they don't have  a way to know your giving your password to whether people.  For all they  know you have the computer going in one room and your TV going and it is  you.  The same as if you have a wall street journal log on and share it  with somebody.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HILSENRATH:  You will always get leakage and you have to live with it.  To  the extent that it makes your friend or your relative that much more  interested than your Hulu (inaudible)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Leakage in the digital world is much greater than in the paper  world. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It has always been there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's always been there, but Sandra.  She is about to lose her  stuff. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SMITH:  Thanks Dagen.</p><p>CASONE:  All fair point. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  I don't share my password with anyone.  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The word retailers use to describe the thievery or shoplifting.  </p><p>SMITH:  Alright.  Athletes and parents beware the artificial turf at  thousands of schools and parks around the country could be dangerous.  The  New York Times did this story a year ago.  A lot of people still talking  about it and surprised by it.  Find out what is behind the latest health  scare on this turf.  Straight ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Top headlines in the Wall Street Journal.  After years of  decline, U.S. imports on the rise as low oil prices forced domestic  producers to scale back supplies.  Phil Flynn and the CME group.  So, Phil,  long story short, we are not producing as much here so we are having to buy  it there and bring it in. Is that what is happening? </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, CME GROUP:  Well, that's exactly what is happening and we are  losing the OPECSaudi Arabia started.  What we are seeing is these other  OPEC oil producers, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia are cutting prices, driving our  guys out of business.  This is what Saudi rate wanted to do.  Can they  sustain this price war?  We know they are having big financial problems in  these countries. </p><p>They can't continue to cut prices below our producers.  The quality of the  oil they are getting.  Our refiners are used to refining Saudi oil and  Nigerian oil.  The shale oil is a little more difficult for them to refine  because it is such a high-quality type of oil.  They are not used to doing  it, better off to export. </p><p>The other big story, natural gas, lowest price in three years.  We broke  below $2, 1 million metric BTUs.  Winter might have been canceled because  warm weather forecasts driving prices lower. </p><p>SMITH:  This is part of the deal that was reached late last night.  U.S. is  planning to sell millions of barrels of crude oil from our strategic  petroleum reserve from 2018 through 2025 under the budget deal reached last  night.  This is the second time the U.S. has raised cash from the reserve.   Notable event? </p><p>FLYNN:  It is a very notable event.  It's basically showing we don't need  the strategic petroleum reserve.  We have a new reserve called North  Dakota.  The global energy market is changing.  The other thing when you  look at selling oil from the reserve, from the policy when we were worried  about peak oil and the Middle East cutting off power supply. Now they're  burying us with supplies. </p><p>SMITH:  And the report shows a link with green artificial turf and cancer.   Questions have been raised about synthetic fiber and scrap tire that makes  up the surface.  There's the belief that the tiny black rubber crimson the  surface which have been known to contain carcinogens and chemicals can make  people sick.  However, there is no scientific data to prove the connection  between the two.  Okay, John.  Your son plays football and lacrosse on  turf. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Plays on turf all the time.  My two sons and my daughter play  on turf all the time.  Frankly, there are a lot of other things that happen  on those fields I worry about a lot more.  When there's no scientific  evidence to back it up.  You worry about concussions and other injuries.  I  want to see some hard evidence before I put this on the list of things to  worry about. </p><p>SMITH:  We were living on asphalt green, so fun to play on it but it made  you think all the little black or brown pellets in the turf.  You get up  and it's all over you.  Amazing.  It gets in their mouths, makes you  wonder. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have bruises, doing a workout in the last few days.  I think  maybe you ought to worry about feeding your kids bacon and hot dogs if you  are worried about cancer before you worry about artificial turf.  Based on  the Wall Street Journal today.  That is the big deal. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Red meat tied to cancer.  Pay a little more attention because  there is -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  Most of these reports is more correlation than causation. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  The health organizations study is more scientific and I  haven't looked at it but I would think they're close it to causation and  correlation.  The other problem here is every couple of weeks there is a  news story telling us you need to worry about this or that.  Americans are  over worried with worried lists. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You ought to worry.  Women getting lung cancer who never smoked  is on the rise.  Even as the numbers of people who are not smoking in this  country are declining.  And yet, they have to figure out what it is called. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But, you can stop doing everything.  You got to figure out  what is causing it and respond to that.  You can't stop going on artificial  turf. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  Russell investments Steven Wood joins us to weigh in on a big day  of tech earnings.  Plus, former treasury secretary David Malpass with his  thoughts on a potential budget deal.  We have a great couple hours coming  up.  Stay tuned. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  Sandra Smith in for Maria Bartiroma.  With me is Fox Business's  Dagen McDowell and Wall Street Journal Chief Economic Correspondent Jon  Hilsenrath.  But, first your top stories breaking news.  A debt deal on  Capitol Hill and congressional leaders reaching an agreement on a two- year  budget deal that also extends the debt limit.  But it could be problematic  for his likely replacement congressional Congressman Paul Ryan over  concerns from conservatives who will not support raising the debt limit. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DARRELL ISSA, CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN-REPUBLICAN:  We are about the  transition to a new speaker.  It is important that we have the speaker to  be Ryan, what leadership role.  It was the combination of the majority but  you need to to have the new speaker in the lead in this process. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: Donald Trump making more controversial comments on women.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

We are getting earnings from big names, including Alibaba, Ford and UPS. We'll get readings on durable goods orders, home prices and consumer confidence. Ahead of all of that we are looking at futures markets here in the U.S., pointing to go lower open on Wall Street, small losses to kick off this Tuesday morning. Dow Futures off eight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech also in focus. Both Apple and Twitter set to report earnings after the close of trading today. Checking in on market action overseas, looking over in Europe, where trading has gotten started, you're looking at the FTSE in London off 21 points; the CAC in France, off just a small a fraction of a percent, down two points. The DAX in Germany slightly higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wal-Mart taking a page out of amazon's playbook.

And it ends, secured and intercepted by Tony Jefferson.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: The Baltimore Ravens missing a chance to tie up that game on the final play against the Arizona Cardinals. Ravens Quarterback, Joe Flacco, intercepted in the end zone, and Arizona won the game, 26-18.</p><p>And it's a big night for baseball. The World Series getting underway tonight in Kansas City. The Mets and Royals getting in one last workout yesterday before the series begins. It's said to be a pricey series for fans. The average ticket price is $723 and climbing, that's according to StubHub this morning and it gets more expensive when the teams face off in New York on Wednesday.</p><p>Well let's get to that new Monmouth University poll out this morning showing <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>losing more ground in the state of Iowa, while making more controversial comments in a town hall in New Hampshire. Blake Burman has all the latest from Washington, and it gets even more interesting this morning, Black.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Day by day it does, Sandra. Good morning to you. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>still holds commanding leads nationally, and in a couple of the early of the early voting states, but there's a growing trend in Iowa, according to polls taken there over the last week. Dr. Ben Carson has supplanted Trump in the first caucus state. Take a look at this: Carson has won four of the last five polls there with the fifth being a tie. They're all fairly sizable spreads, with the most recent from Monmouth University showing Carson with a 14-point lead.</p><p>Meantime, Trump is facing some scrutiny for a couple of comments he made yesterday in New Hampshire. In one of them Trump said it's easy for women to wear burkas because they don't have to wear makeup.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In fact, it's easier. You don't have to put on makeup. Look how beautiful everyone looks. Wouldn't it be easier? Right? Wouldn't that be easy? I tell you, if I was a woman, I don't want to -- I'm ready, darling, let's go. It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Separately, Sandra, Trump also took credit for Ford's decision to halt production plants truck plans in Mexico and stay in Ohio. However, that was strongly disputed by Ford and Ohio Governor, and presidential candidate, John Kasich. Sandra.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Blake Burman, thank you. Let's bring in former White House advisor to President Bush, Bryan Hook and Democratic Strategist, Richard Goodstein. Guys, I don't know where to begin.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH: Let's first tackle the burka comment. Bryan, to you first, is this going to hurt Trump?</p><p>BRYAN HOOK, former ADVISOR, WHITE HOUSE: You know, historically we try not to view American foreign policy through the lens of the burka. This is a very strange comment to be made when we are talking about a real crisis in the Middle East. It makes him in that entertainer column and less in the commander-in-chief column.</p><p>SMITH: Well, Richard, normally, you know, I think we'd be looking at a comment like that and saying, gosh, every controversial comment he makes he seems to go up in the polls. Now we are talking about him losing ground in Iowa, again, to Dr. Carson. Are things starting to change here?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Look, they're changing in a pretty fundamental way in this regard, Trump's whole calling card, incidentally so many of his comments are untethered from reality it makes me think he has a political death wish. His calling card is I'm a winner. If he loses, in his book he's a loser and there's nothing worse than being a loser to <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>So, he better turn that around in Iowa because he can't keep -- yes, he's ahead in all the other states, I understand that, but - incidentally, Ben Carson is the Gardner of this race, right? I know, I'm dating myself from the movie, being there, but he says all these inane things and people impute to it commonsense, when its, for the most part, idiocy. If I was a Republican, I would be scared to death, or frankly, somebody on Wall Street, that a major political party could nominate either of these two guys, it's scary.</p><p>SMITH: Bryan, it's hard to really decide where to go from here because it does seem that things are changing now, but at the same time, it seems like the establishment has been trying to figure out what to do with <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>but <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>responding to Richard's comment, has made it clear that he is not going to lose. He has made it clear that the second that he's dropping in the polls or it looks like he doesn't have a shot at winning the GOP primary, he said he's out of the race. He has made that very clear. So what naturally happens next?</p><p>HOOK: We have about a little less than 100 days until the Iowa caucus, and that's a long time in presidential politics. Trump is now down five points in that Monmouth poll since the last one. So we are -- we are seeing Trump lose altitude, and I think because we have what, you know, a few months left now, there's plenty of time for the race to move around. I do expect that you're going to see continual movement, and it's probably going to trend more in the establishment direction.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Can I raise an issue though, Gentlemen, and Rich, I know he's die to go make fun of me because I poo poo'ed when he said -</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELLL: He said Joe Biden was not going to run for president, and I said -- well, he's not. But with Iowa and to the good people of Iowa, how relevant are the caucuses, particularly with the Republicans, you look back, it was Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee were -</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the last two winners and they, well, were not the nominee?</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: Correct. Dagen, so you make a good point. There's even a different point, which is at this point four years ago, and I checked yesterday, on October 30th, 2011 poll, Herman Cain was in first, Mitt Romney was second, Rick Santorum, who ultimately won, was at five-percent. So, all this kind of bloviation about where the polls are, not just to us but everybody is a bit much and I think people have to take it into some perspective. You make a doubly good point, which is Iowa has not being a precursor of how somebody's going to do down the road. Again, for Trump, when your calling card is I'm a winner, and if you lose, that changes everything in people's eyes.</p><p>JONATHAN HILSENRATH, EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Can I jump in here? What struck me about these latest polls is that Ted Cruz is moving up. I want to hear both of you -- what you have to say about Ted Cruz and whether he's ready to make his move and whether such a move is sustainable?</p><p>HOOK: Senator Cruz has been hanging back and taking a very kind of slow and steady approach to the campaign and you know, somebody like Senator Cruz could play very well in Iowa but then when you see the other states that follow, New Hampshire, South Carolina and down the line, it gets a little trickier.</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: I would actually disagree a little bit, Bryan. Can I - if I don't mind. I predicted on your air, Sandra, with Maria, probably six weeks ago, that Cruz was the one to keep your eye on in this regard, I predict that Trump and Carson will crater. I think Cruz has a good shot at gutting kind of the evangelicals, the libertarians when Rand Paul goes away -</p><p>SMITH: If you're predict - if you're predicting that Dr. Carson will crater, we've heard your views on Trump, I'm going to force you to tell me why is Dr. Carson gaining so much in the polls right now.</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: So people say there's this whole outsider thing. That's just among Republicans, right? Democrats aren't showing any affection for outsiders and I think there's -- it's the same reason that tea party people are so angry with Congress. They are living kind of almost in an alternate reality that somehow or another, a guy like Carson, they just want to think that somehow there's something pure about him that's going to fix everything. It's, again, untethered from reality, but that would be my explanation for why Carson has this boom right now, because people just want to believe in those caucuses out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Richard, the democrats are showing benefit quite a bit of affection, in terms of money, at least, to -</p><p>SMITH: Bernie Sanders.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- to Bernie Sanders.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes, that's the socialist. He's a bit of an outside the mainstream in Washington.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No question. No question.</p><p>SMITH: Bryan last word to you.</p><p>HOOK: You're going to see continual movement around here. I also think you're going to see Ben Carson's change, probable quite a lot between now and when the first vote is cast in the Iowa caucuses.</p><p>SMITH: All right, good stuff. Bryan Hook and Richard Goodstein, thanks.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I will just quickly point out that Trump referred to the media as scum and horrible people so that made me feel good.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But meanwhile we spend every segment talking about the guy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly, so where would he be without these --</p><p>HILSENRATH: We love what he's doing for our ratings.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The horrible scum that we are.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH: All right, thank you, Gentlemen. Fox Business is teaming up with the \"Wall Street Journal\" to give you a Republican Debate focused on the economy, business and your money. Be sure to tune in on November 10th when the Republican candidates take the stage in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. You can only see that right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>I want to say thank you, Gentlemen. I was talking to our remote guests. Thank you, Dagen. Thank you, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Are you saying I'm not a gentleman?</p><p>SMITH: Moving on - oh, I can't win this morning. It must be Tuesday. Big tech earnings to look at this morning. Alibaba is scheduled to report before the bell, while Apple and Twitter are set to release results after the bell tonight. Everybody will be watching those. Estimates right now calling for Alibaba to post earnings per share .54 cents on revenues of $3.35 billion. Apple looking to beat Wall Street estimates for the fifth straight time. Investors will be focused on Iphone sales during the quarter and its forecast for the holidays. Twitter earnings puts the spotlight on newly minted CEO, Jack Dorsey. Since taking the reigns permanently this month, Dorsey has cut eight-percent of the company's workforce and donated a third of his stock to the employee equity pool.</p><p>Any big surprises that you're looking for today? Apple is going to be a big one to watch, obviously, and the fact that we are talking about the holidays when we are looking at all the earnings, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I'm certainly looking for Apple because the President of the Atlanta Fed has been saying this too, I want to see how consumers are holding up. There have been a lot of headwinds hitting the American economy. We've had a volatile stock market. We've had a stronger dollar, which is hurting exports. The big question for this economy is are consumers spending money? And we will see that if they're out buying Iphones.</p><p>SMITH: And it's shocking too, -- well, maybe not. As an economist you can tell me if I should be shocked, but here we have these low oil low prices, low gasoline prices and still we are not seeing the consumer spend that money elsewhere.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Not only that but we have unemployment rate coming down to nearly five -percent.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We have in American public that was scared by a very deep recession and slow recovery and people are reluctant to go out -</p><p>MCDOWELL: amazon is going to have record sales this holiday season.</p><p>SMITH: And FedEx says that they're going to have record shipments. So, people are shopping, it's just not necessarily -</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Mickey D's and Starbucks hit new all time highs in the stock market yesterday.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I don't know if McDonald's it's a great barometer for how aggressive Americans are spending.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- but the other one I'm looking at is Ford. I think Ford - we are having a car boom right now, a car sales boom.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: That's going to be an important one to watch.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So much that GM has given workers a raise, finally.</p><p>SMITH: All right, we are going to have more on that a little bit. Up next watch out for falling prices and drones. Why Wal-Mart wants to get into the drone delivery. Do you want one of these showing up in your doorstep?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: The United States sending a warship near one of China's artificial islands in the South China Sea. Cheryl Casone's following this story and more for us this morning. Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Sandra; good morning. Good morning, everyone. Defense Department officials say that a U.S. Navy Destroyer entered waters near the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea last night. The U.S. Lassen is armed with tomahawk missiles. This move is a direct challenge to China's claims that the artificial island chain is within its territorial boarders.</p><p>More than 300 people are dead after a 7.5 magnitude hit northeastern Afghanistan. Most of the deaths reported were in Pakistan, but tremors from the quake were also felt in northern India and Tajikistan. The death toll is set to rise, as the most severely affected areas are so remote that communications have been cut off.</p><p>Finally, the battle of the drones is heating up. This time it's Wal-Mart. The retailer applying to test drones, home delivery, curbside pickup and checking warehouse inventories. This move is a sign that the retailer plans to go head-to-head with amazon who has been vocal about their plans. Amazon says they're going to be ready to deliver these packages as soon as federal rules allow. That is the question mark because the FAA right, has to, you know, come together with the regulations. They're not even talking about beginning a framework, regulatory framework until 2016, at the earliest. So we can talk about delivery all we want. Are we going to see a drone in our doorstep? It's going to be a while.</p><p>SMITH: Right, so we're waiting on the air traffic control regulations these things, right, so they are not running into each other as they drop of your paper towels on your front door. I don't know, is that the goal?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just can't get my head around this how they would execute this, particularly in a crowded urban area. I don't understand - and growing up in a very rural area, that wouldn't make sense either. I don't under - I don't' get it.</p><p>SMITH: What do you think, Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH: There's a lot of suburb in the middle, and it looks like the FAA is moving towards allowing more and more of this, according to our story today on this, the FAA, it has issued already 2,000 approvals for testing and use of drones and commercial settings in different ways. What do I think of it? I think it's great. I think it's economic progress. It's an example of companies finding new ways to become more efficient.</p><p>SMITH: And it's exciting.</p><p>HILSENRATH: As creepy as it might feel -</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- because -</p><p>CASONE: No, it's dangerous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It just feels, with the volume of packages that some of these businesses ship, I don't understand how they would actually execute it.</p><p>(Cross talk)</p><p>CASONE: This is the war that's brewing though, between pilots, between the FAA, the air traffic controllers and the companies. I mean, it's a great business idea -</p><p>MCDOWELL: The FAA can't keep up as technology develops.</p><p>CASONE: -- but you already have pilots saying, Dagen, that they're seeing these drones and that they are - the minute one goes into an engine this whole story changes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But those are recreational drones that they've had the biggest problem --</p><p>CASONE: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- which now the FAA is requiring to be registered. A commercial drone would be less of a threat.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Dagen, when you look at a company like amazon or Wal-Mart, they have vast logistic organizations, --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- their job is to figure out how to make these things work at a lower cost than how to deal with -</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't want my skies filled with these.</p><p>SMITH: So just to Dagen's point, they're going to test this out in small residential neighborhoods first, that's according to the Wal-Mart, --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well they're also going to test it out in parking lots.</p><p>SMITH: -- and they're going to get permission from those living in the flight path, from the truck to the homes in that area. So it's complicated but it sounds like they --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, test them in parking lots because I'm too lazy to get out of my car and go into the Wal-Mart.</p><p>SMITH: I am.</p><p>HILSENRATH: This is progress.</p><p>SMITH: We have to go. Jon Hilsenrath says this is economic progress. We'll keep watching it. Coming up, investors waiting for the Federal Reserve's first rate hike in nearly a decade. I know somebody we can talk to about that.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH: We'll show you why you will not need to worry about that. We're keeping it simple for you right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: All right, welcome back. Let's get a quick check on markets this morning. Futures right now pointing to a selloff on Wall Street, a small one. We are looking a small fraction of percentage losses across the board there.</p><p>One hot topic investors are watching this week is the Federal Reserve. The central Bank on the verge of raising interest rates for the first time in years, but Jon Hilsenrath is here and he says consumers have nothing to fear because mortgage rates will stay low for quite some time. So you need to break this down for us and keep it simple.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right, so we are paying a lot of attention what the Fed is going to do. I have written a million stories about it this year, but the bottom line is for two reasons interest rates are going to stay low even after the Fed starts raising them. First of all, the U.S. economy and global economy are still fairy weak. They are not going gang busters, and in an environment like that, the Fed can't raise interest a lot. They might push them a little bit but not moving very fast. The other thing is that the Fed has telegraphed, they've already told us that they don't expect to raise aggressively after they do this first move, because inflation is also very low. So we are going into a period where once we get this first move off the Fed's table, there's going to be a very slow progression of follow-up interest rate increases.</p><p>If you look back to the 2004-2006 period, the last time Fed raised interest rates, we actually didn't see much movement in mortgage rates. In fact, we got a housing boom while the fed was raising rates.</p><p>SMITH: I was going to say, so that first interest rate hike, might it take some that are on the sidelines, might it bring in some of that pent up demand, where they're going to fear interest rates going higher so they'll jump in on the first hike?</p><p>HILSENRATH: I don't think it's going to be fear. I think what's going to happen is that when the Fed does this, people are going to say, hey, the world didn't end. I can get on with my life. I can go out and refinance my mortgage or take out a mortgage for a home -- particularly in the markets, you know. I think the markets are going to realize that the world didn't end when the feds does this and they're going to get on with the party.</p><p>SMITH: It's a good time to refinance right now?</p><p>HILSENRATH: You should refinance when it's right for you. If it's an opportunity now, you should go ahead and do it.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Jon Hilsenrath, thank you for keeping it simple. We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: Good morning, everyone. I'm Sandra Smith, Maria Bartiromo is off this morning. It is Tuesday, October 27, and with me this hour fox Business', Dagen McDowell, and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He said I was cranky this morning.</p><p>SMITH: He did?</p><p>MCDOWELL: He did. He's like, what's wrong with you? You're cranky. I said, no, I'm just disagreeing with you.</p><p>HILSENRATH: She's hating on drones.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I disagreed with you, there's a difference.</p><p>SMITH: Who said Tuesdays aren't fun? All right, these are your top stories at 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news: a debt deal on Capitol Hill.

It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: It will be a busy, busy day for earnings and economic data. Walmart taking a page out of Amazon's playbook.

Alibaba scheduled to report earnings before the bell. Apple and Twitter are said to release results after the bell. We will also get September's Durable Goods orders which are expected to drop 1.2 percent as well as look at the housing market. Case-Shiller home price index will be out. Joining us to break all this down is Vining Sparks' Chief Economist Craig Dismuke. Welcome to you, Craig.</p><p>CRAIG DISMUKE, VINING SPARKS CHIEF ECONOMIST: Good morning.</p><p>SMITH: Alright, so, what are we looking for this morning? What is hot on your agenda?</p><p>DISMUKE: There are important reports, but right now everything is secondary to the inflation data. That is the real big elephant in a room kind of thing. Especially, with Fed policy and what is the Fed going to do. But in the durable-goods report, I expect we will see headline level orders expected to be down because of aircraft. Below that at the core level they're expected to be flat. What is most important will be the Capital goods orders report and specifically not a month over month basis because you get a little of noise on quarter over quarter basis. Orders have been pretty good. They're up 9.75 percent. That is their tracking for the quarter. Pointing for business investment being stronger in the future so that is good news. It's a good sign a business investment is stronger. If you look at the shipment of those items, they're up 2.75 percent quarter over quarter which point to business investment being of 2.75.</p><p>SMITH: Well, you obviously looked at these numbers closely. Much closer than any of us. Broadly speaking, where are we as far as economic progress in this recovery? Are we strengthening? And if we are, how slow or fast is it?</p><p>DISMUKE: I don't think we are strengthening. And John's point earlier, he mentioned the consumer is so key right now. This has been about the consumer driving economic growth and there have been phases to this recovery/expansion where different parts of the economy are driving activity. Right now, business investment has been weak, so it's down almost 5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. It was flat in the second quarter of this year.</p><p>Business investment has been up and down but overall, it's been weak. It is good news that business investment is a little bit better. That's positive. But at the end of the day, the consumer is what is key and it is an important report but I think it's secondary to what is happening with the consumer and then again with inflation.</p><p>JOHN HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Craig, I need you to settle a friendly disagreement between Dagen and me here about the housing market. We're getting home price data coming up. I say the housing market is strong and getting stronger. And she says it is garbage outside a few metro areas. What is your verdict and what are we going to see in the home price data that come out later today? Did I characterize your point of view?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST: Yes. And you used the word garbage (inaudible).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DISMUKE: It is home prices have been fairly strong, very little inventory. There's construction costs going up. Labor costs going up a little bit in housing. Lumber prices are down. Prices are generally going up. It is very -- the housing data is enigmatic right now. We are getting some weak data. Existing home sales better than expected last month. New home sales down 11.5 percent.</p><p>We keep getting this up and down activity. So, I would say in general housing market is trending better. But, there is that challenge and the challenge is if you look at 2013 when mortgage rates rose 90 basis points, housing total sales fell 13 percent. So, that was unusual. To see that drop from a 90 basis point increase. So, you look at what is different in the housing market today than in previous cycles. The biggest difference today is when you look at the number of owner occupied units which are down $2 million in 2005 and rent occupied units which are $10 million since 2006. Which is not good because people who rent cars don't wash them. I have never washed one.</p><p>Some people who rent houses or rent multifamily places aren't going to make a capital investment where they are living that we had when we had more of an ownership society so long term as a challenge.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We saw in the Glass-Steagall people over invested in those homes and wasted capital in the process. And a lot of other countries you don't have as much emphasis on home ownership. And they have perfectly civil society.</p><p>DISMUKE: Sure, but their economic growth is not as strong as we saw when we had more of a homeownership society. When you own something you take more pride in it and you're going to invest in it. And so, I think, in long-term it will be a different housing market. The peak housing was 6.2 percent.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Also, demographics at play here.</p><p>DISMUKE: That's a big one. The aging population is a demographic issue. It doesn't get enough focus at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like buying homes and selling it though.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: I don't think seniors are going to start trashing their homes. It's a different dynamic.</p><p>SMITH: Almost like those houses are maintained to higher standard because they are turned over so often and have to be maintained. That is the discussion for another day. Craig, great stuff. Thank you. Interesting perspective. John, you win.</p><p>MCDOWELL: John just leaned in and said I was right</p><p>SMITH: Alright. JP Morgan with its own mobile payment platform to rival existing services like Apple Paid. Nicole Petallides has that story this morning. Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST: That's right. The country's largest bank is stepping into the ring with the world's most valuable company. JP Morgan is the latest investor in the mobile payments based announcing Chase Pay, a platform that will allow Chase customers to make retail purchases using their smart phone. Creating a direct competitor to Apple Pay. JP Morgan says it has already won the endorsement of a major group of merchants giving it a leg up on the tech savvy rivals. So, the question is are consumers ready to use their phones, smart phones, ditch the credit cards and what happened to cash is king?</p><p>SMITH: Anybody use Apple Pay?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have signed up for it but I don't know how to use it in stores.</p><p>PETALLIDES: Using your smart phone will be the preferred method of payment. I mean, I just got used to using my debit card in the taxi. Just got out of using cash. This is the wave of the future and there is Apple Pay, Chase Pay credit cards.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: A total shift back to cash because everyone is afraid of the paper trail using credit cards and people accessing their data and now, we're going to be even more exposed with all this going on to our smart phones.</p><p>HILSENRATH: There isn't going to be. We see where it is going. People moving more towards mobile payments. And cash. I could go weeks without using my cash.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's why I use a credit card over cash and smart phones. Because I use cash. If I have more than $20, I will drop it and lose it. HILSENRATH: I call it bonus bucks when I discover cash.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If I lose it, it usually comes back. I have a tendency to drop it. And with a credit card I keep one credit card in my pocket.</p><p>SMITH: You guys must not be good tippers. How can you go through New York City without a few bucks in your pocket? Not that kind.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You add the tip. You don't have to worry about signing a form.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: This is just to bring it back to drones. This is like drones. This is progress when we see new ways of making payments.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I fully believe (inaudible)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETALLIDES: Be honest here. It's unbelievable. This is the wave of the future. Kids staying with babysitters and nannies demand it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Don't forget to start your day with Nicole Petallides on FBN: a.m. at 5:00 a.m. eastern. Catch it on the Fox Business Network. Up next. Is there a link between artificial turf and cancer?</p><p>We'll look at a new report that could cause major concerns in the world of sports. A lot of people have been talking about this.

Cheryl Casone has that story.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST: Jeffrey Katzenberg is crediting Elon Musk with his survival after a life-threatening car accident in Hollywood on October 19th.

And we know it happens all the time. You give your log information to a friend of a friend or your parents, your neighbor and they use the service. They can't track it. This proliferates.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So, how is that different from me leaving my newspaper at the airport and someone picking it up and reading it?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's one newspaper. Not thousands of movies.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But you're only sharing a password with one friend.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How much revenue if they get shared around a lot more. Netflix, they have subscriptions where you get the family plan or two log ins.</p><p>CASONE: This really hurts HBO and Showtime and HULU. And they don't have a way to know your giving your password to whether people. For all they know you have the computer going in one room and your TV going and it is you. The same as if you have a wall street journal log on and share it with somebody.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: You will always get leakage and you have to live with it. To the extent that it makes your friend or your relative that much more interested than your Hulu (inaudible)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Leakage in the digital world is much greater than in the paper world.</p><p>HILSENRATH: It has always been there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's always been there, but Sandra. She is about to lose her stuff.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SMITH: Thanks Dagen.</p><p>CASONE: All fair point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: I don't share my password with anyone. (CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The word retailers use to describe the thievery or shoplifting.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Athletes and parents beware the artificial turf at thousands of schools and parks around the country could be dangerous. The New York Times did this story a year ago. A lot of people still talking about it and surprised by it. Find out what is behind the latest health scare on this turf. Straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Top headlines in the Wall Street Journal. After years of decline, U.S. imports on the rise as low oil prices forced domestic producers to scale back supplies. Phil Flynn and the CME group. So, Phil, long story short, we are not producing as much here so we are having to buy it there and bring it in. Is that what is happening?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, CME GROUP: Well, that's exactly what is happening and we are losing the OPECSaudi Arabia started. What we are seeing is these other OPEC oil producers, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia are cutting prices, driving our guys out of business. This is what Saudi rate wanted to do. Can they sustain this price war? We know they are having big financial problems in these countries.</p><p>They can't continue to cut prices below our producers. The quality of the oil they are getting. Our refiners are used to refining Saudi oil and Nigerian oil. The shale oil is a little more difficult for them to refine because it is such a high-quality type of oil. They are not used to doing it, better off to export.</p><p>The other big story, natural gas, lowest price in three years. We broke below $2, 1 million metric BTUs. Winter might have been canceled because warm weather forecasts driving prices lower.</p><p>SMITH: This is part of the deal that was reached late last night. U.S. is planning to sell millions of barrels of crude oil from our strategic petroleum reserve from 2018 through 2025 under the budget deal reached last night. This is the second time the U.S. has raised cash from the reserve. Notable event?</p><p>FLYNN: It is a very notable event. It's basically showing we don't need the strategic petroleum reserve. We have a new reserve called North Dakota. The global energy market is changing. The other thing when you look at selling oil from the reserve, from the policy when we were worried about peak oil and the Middle East cutting off power supply. Now they're burying us with supplies.</p><p>SMITH: And the report shows a link with green artificial turf and cancer. Questions have been raised about synthetic fiber and scrap tire that makes up the surface. There's the belief that the tiny black rubber crimson the surface which have been known to contain carcinogens and chemicals can make people sick. However, there is no scientific data to prove the connection between the two. Okay, John. Your son plays football and lacrosse on turf.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Plays on turf all the time. My two sons and my daughter play on turf all the time. Frankly, there are a lot of other things that happen on those fields I worry about a lot more. When there's no scientific evidence to back it up. You worry about concussions and other injuries. I want to see some hard evidence before I put this on the list of things to worry about.</p><p>SMITH: We were living on asphalt green, so fun to play on it but it made you think all the little black or brown pellets in the turf. You get up and it's all over you. Amazing. It gets in their mouths, makes you wonder.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have bruises, doing a workout in the last few days. I think maybe you ought to worry about feeding your kids bacon and hot dogs if you are worried about cancer before you worry about artificial turf. Based on the Wall Street Journal today. That is the big deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Red meat tied to cancer. Pay a little more attention because there is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: Most of these reports is more correlation than causation.</p><p>HILSENRATH: The health organizations study is more scientific and I haven't looked at it but I would think they're close it to causation and correlation. The other problem here is every couple of weeks there is a news story telling us you need to worry about this or that. Americans are over worried with worried lists.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You ought to worry. Women getting lung cancer who never smoked is on the rise. Even as the numbers of people who are not smoking in this country are declining. And yet, they have to figure out what it is called.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But, you can stop doing everything. You got to figure out what is causing it and respond to that. You can't stop going on artificial turf.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: Russell investments Steven Wood joins us to weigh in on a big day of tech earnings.

And it gets even more expensive when the teams face off in New York next Wednesday - or, sorry, on Wednesday. That price is surely to be steeper than that.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>losing considerable ground in Iowa while making more controversial comments in a New Hampshire town hall meeting. Blake Burman has the latest from Washington for us this morning.</p><p>Blake, good morning.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Sandra. Good morning to you.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>still holds commanding leads nationally and in a couple of the early voting states, but there's a growing trend in Iowa according to the polls taken there over the last week. Dr. Ben Carson has supplanted Trump in the first caucus state. Carson has won four of the last five polls, as you can see here, with the fifth being a tie. They are all fairly sizable spreads, with the most recent from Monmouth University showing Carson with a 14 point lead.</p><p>In the meantime, Trump is facing some scrutiny now for a couple of comments he made yesterday in New Hampshire. In one of them, Trump said it's easy for women to wear burkas because they don't have to wear makeup.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In fact, it's easier. You don't have to put on make-up. Look how beautiful everyone looks. Wouldn't it be easier? Wha (ph). Right? Wouldn't that be easy? I'll tell you, if I was a woman, I don't want to - wha, I'm ready, darling, let's go. It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: And, separately, Trump also took credit for Ford's decision to halt truck production plans in Mexico and stay in Ohio. However, Sandra, that was strongly disputed by both Ford and the Ohio Governor and Presidential Candidate John Kasich.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Blake, thank you.</p><p>BURMAN: Thanks.</p><p>SMITH: Dagen, we're going to ask you for your comments on Trump's comments, about women in burkas and -</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Where did he - where was he giving that speech? Checky's (ph) Shack (ph) down in Boca Raton. Hey, I'll be here all week, try the veal. That's what it was like. That's - it's not president but I don't think anybody who's a fan of his really cares, do they?</p><p>SMITH: Well, it's interesting because here we're talking about how Dr. Carson in now - he's now won three of the last four major polls in Iowa and, Jon, one of the biggest demographics that he is successful with right now and gaining ground with is women.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, you know, I think - listening to Trump there, I think he really runs the risk of wearing out his welcome. I mean like you say, Dagen, this - he sounds like a bad stand- up comedian. Is that really what we want for the presidency? As far as Carson goes, you have to wonder, I mean America doesn't really know him. You have to wonder what kind of staying power he's going to have as people get to know him a little bit better.</p><p>SMITH: Well, the race is surely changing. Ted Cruz gaining some steam, as you pointed out last hour. Marco Rubio at 10 percent. Is the playing field changing?</p><p>HILSENRATH: It does look like - I think it is changing. I think you see people like Cruz coming up and you have to keep an eye on him. As - as - as -</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Carly is - Carly Fiorina has kind of lost her appeal to voters out -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes, that's - I was wondering about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That she had that incredible debate performance but she's kind of receded a little bit and I wonder what it would take to move her back up.</p><p>HILSENRATH: You have to wonder is, these Fox Business debates come up in a couple weeks, if that's going to be a stage for her to reassert herself, because that's going to be all of that business in the economy.</p><p>SMITH: Well, a GOP debate tomorrow night as well on the economy.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>SMITH: So that would be an opportunity, obviously, for her to shine. We'll see if that happens. But, yes, Carly Fiorina not on the top five in that most recent poll. So, all right, guys, thank you.</p><p>Big day for tech earnings with Apple and Twitter set to release quarterly numbers after today's close. Jo Ling Kent is here and joins us on set. She's talking Ali Baba.</p><p>JO LING KENT: Yes. We are seeing some big mobile revenue jumps, which is always good news for an ecommerce company. A huge earnings day. Ali Baba beat on the top and bottom just a few minutes ago. Revenue came in at $3.49 billion, beating that $3.35 billion the street was looking for. Plus, EPS of $0.57 a share, beating that expected $0.54 estimate. Gross merchandize volume was up 28 percent, revenue was up 32 percent, so some very big moves there for Ali Baba, especially as they go into singles day, their biggest sales day of the year, which comes up in November.</p><p>And T-Mobile earnings out later this hour. Expectations of $8.28 billion in revenue with $0.30 on EPS.</p><p>Ford also just out moments ago posting mixed results, $38.1 billion in revenue. That's a beat of the $35.07 billion the street was looking for. But adjusted EPS coming in just shy at $0.45, of that $0.46 estimate.</p><p>And then after the bell today, two big name in tech, of course. Apple's fiscal fourth quarter expected to post revenue of $1.11 billion with $1.88 in EPS. And the pressure really is on here for iPhone sales, Apple Watch, also looking at China as that slows down, if they're able to sustain momentum there.</p><p>And we're also going to be watching Twitter as well. This is the first earnings report since Jack Dorsey was named the permanent CEO. EPS expected of $0.05 a share. Revenue expected at $560 million. Now, that one is all about monthly active user growth plus these new products. Twitter Moments, is it resonating? Our users actually picking up and changing their behavior and sticking around on Twitter?</p><p>SMITH: So do you expect some good news for - for Twitter then?</p><p>KENT: It could be better but it may not get better for a while in terms of permanent growth in the positive direction. Jack Dorsey has a lot of work to do, even though everyone's pretty glad that he's back.</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I will say the delivery of ads on Instagram is top notch compared to all other social media applications.</p><p>KENT: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But this - so targeted. Interesting ads, video -</p><p>KENT: Seamless.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Seamless. And -</p><p>KENT: And you've seen that in FaceBook earnings, too, it's really working.</p><p>SMITH: Right. He's - he's sitting right next to me. I want to bring him in. Russell Investments chief market strategist Stephen Wood.</p><p>What do you expect out of these big tech giant, Apple, Twitter, optimism?</p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS: I think so. I think there's going to be a bright spot in earnings in the Q3 and it's not going to come from much of the S&amp;P 500. So I think where we're going to get firmer earnings is going to be in tech. I think we need to look at Apple and kind of back that out. I can't comment on a specific company, when will you back out Apple earnings. I think it's going to be a challenged third quarter and one of the - the less dim spots is going to be in tech.</p><p>SMITH: Less dim spot is going to be in tech. OK. So you kind of, sort of like technology I guess at this point.</p><p>WOOD: Yes. Yes. And as -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Steve -</p><p>WOOD: Yes, sir.</p><p>HILSENRATH: What are you getting from the conference calls that you're listening in on? We had a story in the paper yesterday that pointed to dimming expectations among CEOs for the outlook for growth in the U.S. and overseas. Are you picking up on any of that yourself?</p><p>WOOD: I think we are. We - it's - well, this has been a top line challenge environment for a long time. Companies have been pretty good at hitting their earnings numbers for a large number of quarters, you know, pushing half a decade, but we really haven't seen any movement in revenue and sales and I think that's really starting to push into the front quarter. But I think what - one of the bigger stories is going to be what happens in December with the Fed and our job is not to be like a total nerd fest here talking about the Fed.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, actually, that is what his job is -</p><p>WOOD: I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is (INAUDIBLE) Fed nerd.</p><p>KENT: I like it.</p><p>WOOD: Fed nerd. And I'm with you. No -</p><p>SMITH: I just tweeted out, hash tag nerds on set with us.</p><p>WOOD: Nerds on set.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>WOOD: Book-ended by nerds here. But I think the oil story, which has really challenged not only debt and equity space for the first week quarters as we go into 2016, some of the benefits from oil come into the economy and I think that's going to be a little bit of a lift.</p><p>SMITH: Do you think we're going to see it?</p><p>WOOD: I think so. Well, if you're an energy company, you've got to recognize all those losses in the first and second quarter. But if you're a consumer, you're not going to buy 12 months of gasoline in the first week of January. It takes you 12 months to pay 12 electric bills, to pay 12 energy bills. So I think as we move into this quarter, the fourth quarter, and the first quarter of next year, you begin to see some modest improvement based upon the drop in energy prices.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I thought Jo - so Jo Ling just reported all these earnings numbers. What - what you reported, the one that I found most interesting was Ford's top line. That Ford beat expectations on its revenue growth.</p><p>KENT: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We have a car sales boom going on in this country right now.</p><p>WOOD: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: People are - they - they haven't recognized it.</p><p>WOOD: Unreported, yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But - well, actually, we had a front-page story about it before the last Fed meeting. But I think that's an example of consumers finally starting to kick in and driving growth. It will be interesting to see what the other automakers have.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>WOOD: And that's an interesting - if you look at China too, the consumer story, the industrial story is well known in China, but the consumer story, and it's positive in China is probably less well covered, and I think you get some of that effect in the United States as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, speaking of -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Do you really believe that they're making that transition in China or -</p><p>WOOD: No, I do believe that they're making that transition. No matter what, they will make that transition. That's a government policy -</p><p>KENT: But do you believe the numbers behind that transition right now?</p><p>WOOD: I think believe in numbers is a strong statement.</p><p>KENT: OK.</p><p>WOOD: Coming out of China.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So are you buying emerging markets? Are you buying China?</p><p>WOOD: I would not say buying Chinese right now. I think that the - the Chinese government is going to transition from that export-oriented, more consumers based economy and that is going to create challenges and commodity based emerging market. So it might be a little bit early on emerging market, but valuations are starting to look attractive. They're beginning to bottom out in the cycle. We know that China's a 7 percent, 6.5 percent grower. That's going to happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can I -</p><p>WOOD: And the question is, whether it is priced in, in emerging markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm trying to promote Jon's story, because he's got a story on the front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today, and the central issue this week and this year will be the Federal Reserve. And I read every word in your story and it was - it basically shows a Fed that's a mess.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, Janet Yellen has a hard job on her hands on two fronts. One is that the economy is hard to read right now. You would expect inflation to be kicking in with unemployment coming down and it hasn't been. So she's got a hard decision to make on the economy. A harder decision - or a harder job is getting her 16 colleagues to agree with her. And as we lay out in this story, there's just a lot of people with different opinions.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Jon, thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll tell people to read it because it's great.</p><p>SMITH: And Stephen Wood, thank you. And Jo Ling Kent, thank you.</p><p>WOOD: Thank you.</p><p>KENT: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: We've got Walmart's new delivery service coming up next, about to lift off, putting the retail giant in the same new space has Amazon. And, by the way, a new poll out putting Dr. Carson at the top of the GOP candidates nationally. We're going to talk about that as well.</p><p>First, here are a few of the top headlines that we're watching in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning, including BP profit falling on weaker oil prices. Health insurance premiums set to climb in 2016. And that NASA spacecraft set for historic fly-by of one of Saturn's moons. We're coming right back. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: All right, we've got some new poll numbers just out giving Ben Carson a national lead. Cheryl Casone has this story and more.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Sandra, good morning.</p><p>Ben Carson edging <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>in a national poll for the first time. The latest CBS/\"New York Times\" poll gives Carson a four point lead over Trump, holding 26 percent of the vote. But, by the way, Iowa, we've been seeing Mr. Carson leading in Iowa. So big news, big news on this national scale today.</p><p>We've also got this for you. Another headache for the fantasy sports world. Legislation to regulate daily fantasy sports is expected to be introduced in Illinois today. This bill aims to protect consumers from draining - quote, \"draining their bank accounts,\" as well as make sure they have a legitimate shot at winning on these sites.</p><p>And finally the battle of the drones heating up, this time with Walmart. The retailer applying for permission to test drones for home delivery, curbside pickup, checking warehouse inventories and this could be a sign that the retailer plans to go head to head with Amazon. Amazon's been very vocal, Sandra, obviously, about trying to get drones into the skies for delivery service and things.</p><p>Here's my question, do you want groceries delivered at your home via drone? Are you OK with that, comfortable with that?</p><p>SMITH: No.</p><p>CASONE: No? Interesting. Wow.</p><p>Well, Dagen, I know you -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I - I think that there are some credible applications for drones, law enforcement -</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You surveying land, even, you know, firefighting. But I just - I can't picture mass execution of drone delivery.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, so you talk about law enforcement. I think drones have a bad name because we've been using them for the last decade to shoot people from the sky. And - but you have to look at how this technology could get applied commercially. And if Amazon and Walmart think they can do it for logistics purposes, then more power to them. Let them try it.</p><p>CASONE: Let me ask you something, though. What happens when a drone that's delivering a package at 2 Cedar Street in Iowa hits a small child on a bike and there's a massive lawsuit. It - you know what I mean, like if you're Amazon or you're Walmart, they've got - their lawyers have to be thinking about this kind -</p><p>SMITH: Wait, wait, wait, wait but a FedEx truck could do the same thing.</p><p>CASONE: It could.</p><p>SMITH: Or a Walmart truck could do the same thing. So I don't know if that's -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Exactly.</p><p>CASONE: But drones make me - like I said earlier, drones make me so much more nervous.</p><p>SMITH: But, wait, did you just say that they're considering the drones for curbside pickup?</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: Because I'm thinking that sounds even funnier.</p><p>CASONE: And (ph) delivery.</p><p>SMITH: Like you drive up to the store and a drone flies out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because I'm too lazy to get out of my car and actually go - go into the store.</p><p>SMITH: Fly out (ph).</p><p>HILSENRATH: But we - but we are. That's right. We have - that's why drive- through exists.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm not. I'm not.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But we - most Americans are. There would not be a thriving drive-through, you know, fast-food industry if we weren't all -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, I love getting out of my car and going in the McD's and socializing.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, now you can just -</p><p>SMITH: What are you -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Now you can just pull into the McD's parking lot and your Big Mac will come to you.</p><p>SMITH: Cheryl, good stuff. Thank you.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: All right, after years of decline, U.S. imports of foreign oil are on the rise in the U.S. What does this mean for dropping gasoline prices here at home? We'll head to the CME for an answer, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: A top headline in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning. After years of decline, U.S. imports are on the rise. This as low oil prices force domestic producers to scale back supply.</p><p>Phil Flynn is at the CME Group in Chicago.</p><p>Will this push our crude oil prices higher, Phil?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, CME GROUP: Well, right now they're pushing them lower. You know, it's put a lot of pressure on the market. You know, we're seeing these imports rise at a time when usually we see imports start to fall a little bit towards the end of the year. This is adding to the oil glut in the Gulf of Mexico where all that oil is. And it's also a sign that the U.S. oil producers are really losing the production war with the OPEC producers. Their production continues to stay strong, ours continue to fall. So this isn't really good news for the U.S. energy producer.</p><p>SMITH: All right. So, hey, by the way, we're looking at $43 for a barrel of crude.</p><p>FLYNN: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: What's the - what's consensus right now? What's - I mean the trend, obviously, as we look at a one week chart, has been down, Phil. But what are we looking at as far as price movement.</p><p>FLYNN: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: I know you watch the trend, the overall trend.</p><p>FLYNN: Right. Well, the mood is definitely negative, you know, and it's across the entire commodity complex. There's a lot of concern in the heart (ph) (INAUDIBLE) season. We're going to see that glut continue to build. You know, last week, you know, refinery runs were continuing to be below 90 percent as refiners are in maintenance (ph). So the demand for oil just isn't very strong. Now the good news is for gasoline prices, they have fallen 17 days in a row according to AAA.</p><p>SMITH: Wow.</p><p>FLYNN: The national average at $2.20. So if you want the bright side of the story, if you're not an oil producer, if you're a driver, you've got to love these prices.</p><p>SMITH: Well, Dagan, that would normally be the bright side of the story because that would mean that we could see a jump in consumer spending. That's extra cash in the pocket of the American consumer. But that hasn't happened yet, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It has happened somewhat. You wouldn't have record - a record holiday season at Amazon if it wasn't at least I think on the margins helping. And throughout the entire summer, you saw increases in small but nevertheless increases in consumer spending.</p><p>SMITH: To the economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I mean I don't -</p><p>HILSENRATH: And a boom - and a boom in car sales.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I - helped by extremely low interest rates for sure.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But there's a major auto boom going on and that - a lot of that has to do with the - the low energy prices.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But these - you know, these falling gasoline prices are happening at a great time because it's - it's happening going into the holiday shopping season.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So maybe we're going to see it this year.</p><p>SMITH: FedEx just reported yesterday, they expect record shipments. So at the same time they're expecting record shipments, up 12 percent they're saying year over year for this holiday season, they're also paying a heck of a lot more for the gasoline to get those boxes to the door.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is Phil still standing there? I have a question for him.</p><p>SMITH: He is. Phil.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hey, Phil.</p><p>FLYNN: Yes. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In terms of the production - any production pullback here in the United States with the frackers, is that destroyed forever or can they ramp production up assuming that these companies are healthy financially?</p><p>FLYNN: I think that - I think your final statement is the most important thing, how financially viable are these companies? In a perfect world, yes, they could turn the - turn it on very quickly. The problem is, where are they going to get the capital? A lot of these small - smaller fracking firms just don't have the capital to produce, so they're under a lot of pressure.</p><p>You know, the first time prices went up, we saw rig counts come back up. That's not going to happen again because the capital isn't going to be there.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But, Phil, I thought the private equity guys are standing on the sidelines ready to jump in because prices are so low and feed capital into the industry if it looks like there's a demand pickup.</p><p>FLYNN: Well, I think there was definitely money on the sidelines it's going to (INAUDIBLE) on the street. That doesn't mean it's going to, you know, save the entire industry. But there was another story that was really interest as well, is that China, one of the big real estate people in China, is buying up all the Texas oil fields.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Phil Flynn, always love having you. Thank you.</p><p>FLYNN: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: Coming up, two D.C. outsider saying exactly what's on their minds despite the repercussions. Is the same brash style that's suddenly hurting Trump helping Carson? Have you seen the new national poll? That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: Good morning. I'm Sandra Smith. Maria Bartiromo is off this morning. It is Tuesday, October 27th. And with me this hour, Fox Business' Dagen McDowell and \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>Here are your top stories at 6:30 a.m., sorry, 7:30 a.m. Wow, time is flying when you're having fun</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>falling to second place now in a new national poll. It's the first time that we've seen him in this position. The latest CBS News/\"New York Times\" poll showing Ben Carson has the lead with 26 percent support. He has a four-point lead now over Trump, who has 22 percent. The rest of the field lagging far behind in the single digits. This after Trump's latest controversial comments on women, makeup and burqas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: In fact, it's easier. You don't have to put up makeup. Look how beautiful everyone looks. Wouldn't it be easier - wha - right, Wouldn't that be easy? I'll tell you, if I was a woman, I don't want to - wha, I'm ready, darling, let's go. It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: All right, breaking overnight: a debt deal -- we will get go that in a second. A debt deal on Capitol Hill. Congressional leaders and the White House reaching an agreement on a two year budget deal that also extends the debt limit. This marks one of the final acts for House Speaker, John Boehner, who is set to leave office on Friday.</p><p>And a quick look at those markets this morning; not a lot of movement, as my father always used to say, sharply unchanged. It's been a busy day for earnings and we've got economic data on tap later this morning. Futures right now are edging lower. Dow Futures off 17 points, indicating a slight selloff on the open.</p><p>Wal-Mart taking a page out of amazon's playbook. The retail giant wants to use drones to make deliveries to your front door. The company filing for regulatory approval. Wal-Mart also looking to use devices to check warehouse inventories and curbside pickup.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Flacco back; pressure on to the middle, again, for Gilmore. And it is secured and intercepted by Tony Jefferson.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: Now that was a catch.

He has a 4- point lead over Trump. Joining me now is Nkama --</p><p>DAVID MALPASS, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, ENCIMA GLOBAL: Encima.</p><p>SMITH: I'm sorry; I'm out of it this morning. I think its 6:30 in the morning too, by the way, former Deputy Assistant Secretary, David Malpass, by the way. David, great to have you here. I want to get to breaking news right away. What do you make of Dr. Ben Carson taking over Trump in the polls?</p><p>MALPASS: Yeah, hi Sandra, good morning; and Dagen. Look, it's huge because you know, momentum builds, fund-raising builds. Trump is having the problem of having his foot in his mouth quite often; so people are having to evaluate, would you rather have a president with humanity or a president that doesn't have humanity?</p><p>SMITH: It is interesting you point that out because this is -- I want go through this here, because he's Dr. Carson, four point lead over <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>This poll just out, single digests for Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Carly Fiorina, still in the top five there, but Carson and Trump seem to be pulling away the field, that the margins are still pretty big there, Carson/Trump, over the rest of the other candidates.</p><p>MALPASS: Right, but these are national polls. The primary is state-by- state, and so, I don't think they mean a whole lot now, other than this concept of momentum. It causes people to take a look at the -- at the new guys. So each of the lower ranked ones want to be in the public eye, let people look at them.</p><p>SMITH: You mentioned the primary state-by-state, well, I'll point out Trump holds second place in Iowa. Dr. Ben Carson has now won three of the last four major polls in the state of Iowa, this coming on the heels of these controversial comments that we aired going into this clip. You were there for reaction of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and his comments about women and burqas, saying they are easier the wear aren't they.</p><p>MALPASS: He really has to stop talking about women and their looks. Also, you know, in Iowa he has been talking about corn, and that is a really dangerous topic. So this is -- I think, you know, candidates need to stay on their message and he is not doing it. Jeb's message, you know, is four- percent growth --</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": I think his message is, look at me. I am <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>--</p><p>MALPASS: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- and what I wondered is, what is this guy going to say when he starts feeling threatened? When he starts looking like a loser and falls to second, third and fourth place?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: We've heard that.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think he's going to say even more outrageous things.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We've already you heard when he feels threatened -</p><p>SMITH: He'll pull out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- because he referred to the media as horrible scum because people have been reporting on polls where he isn't leading. So that is how - I mean, it's easy to make fun of the media and less easy with women. But I think he is actually being hurt by the epic amount of media coverage, when it earlier it was helping him greatly.</p><p>MALPASS: Right; I think Jon has got it. He just wants people to look at him. So here we are talking about him rather than, and the nation has this giant debt problem, spending problem --</p><p>SMITH: And you talk about the money angle of this, in one of most recent tweets, in the past last 24 hours <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>tweeted out, \"All presidential candidates should immediately disavow their superpacs. They are not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself.\"</p><p>MALPASS: Well that works for him because he made a lot of money. You know, he was lucky when he was born, with a father that made him a big loan, and then he's made a lot of luck. So he's got the money to do it; the others probably don't.</p><p>SMITH: So how come -</p><p>HILSENRATH: We also had a -- we had a story in the paper the other day saying that he's done his own share of fund-raising. So, he's not pure on that front either.</p><p>SMITH: And we've got this debate coming up tomorrow night that will be focused on the ec -- do you think that's an opportunity for Carly Fiorina to get back her mojo?</p><p>MALPASS: Sure, and she comes across well on the national stage, as we saw in the last debate. So they all have a chance, now, to stand up to Trump, give their message, and see what he's got. Now, one issue is, he's, on certain issues, been pretty good. I've been happy to see him saying that the Fed should not be zero percent interest rate. You know, it is a good one because it is a rich guy saying, look, it benefits me. I'm, rich. The Fed has the rates set for my benefit. They should stop. So that's a pretty good line for him.</p><p>SMITH: And, real quick, your reaction to the White House and congressional leaders reaching this tentative budget deal?</p><p>MALPASS: Yes, I wanted them to use debt limit, and I've wanted this for some years, to actually restrain spending. The concern here is that their basically having a blowout. Each -</p><p>HILSENRATH: They're breaking the budget cap.</p><p>MALPASS: They're breaking the caps. Each part of congress gets the spending that they want and they all agree to add it to the national --</p><p>MCDOWELL: They all like to spend, don't they -</p><p>MALPASS: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- as long as it is in their interests.</p><p>MALPASS: Very -- I think there is only one-way forward for them to see debt limit works to make more debt. So they really need to rewrite it. They keep avoiding that. You know, the Debt Limit was written in World War I, when the government wanted much more debt that is the purpose of the Debt Limit.</p><p>HILSENRATH: The message today is, see you after the election. No one wants to deal but it before election.</p><p>SMITH: David Malpass, really great getting your perspective this morning.</p><p>MALPASS: Good to see you, Sandra.</p><p>SMITH: Thanks for being here, bright and early.</p><p>MALPASS: Thanks.</p><p>SMITH: Well, a quick reminder, Fox Business will be teaming up with \"The Wall Street Journal\" to give you a Republican Debate focused on your money, the economy, business.

The survey says most users don't care if they are responsible for profit loss for a corporation. Sandra back to you.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Cheryl; thank you. Do you share any of your passwords?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. Never. No, don't ask me for my password.</p><p>SMITH: Look, honestly, it doesn't make me feel bad for the company because you haven't figured out your business model if this is possible; right? You have to allow for that margin of -</p><p>HILSENRATH: I mean, we were arguing about this before. I think people share their stuff. We share our newspapers. You know, back in the day, we would share our cassettes -</p><p>SMITH: Where are you going -</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- with some song that we took off the radio. So people share stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But there's a - the issue with this - there was an article that I was reading this morning about when couples break up that you have your ex-boyfriend or girlfriend or even spouse, who is still Jonesing off of your -- Bogarding your password.</p><p>SMITH: Moving on.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So change your password.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I agree with that, but this sounds like an issue that will come up in the court of \"Judge Judy\" and she will scold everybody and say, unless you are married, don't share your password.</p><p>SMITH: There you have it, never get divorced, Dagen, also gave that advice yesterday, as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, never get mar -- no you can -- it is not don't get divorced, it's just never get married. If you think there's a shot --</p><p>SMITH: Okay. The bulls are out this morning. Deal making is making a comeback on Wall Street. A record number of executives say they are planning some kind of M&amp;A in the next 12 months, that's according to a new report from EY. Let's bring in Rich Jeanneret of EY Transaction Services. Rich, good morning to you.</p><p>RICH JEANNERET, AMERICAS VICE CHAIR, EY TRANSACTION SERVICES: Good morning.</p><p>SMITH: All right, so -</p><p>GENERATE: Great to be back.</p><p>SMITH: -- what do we need to do about the deal-making coming back because that's generally associated with a bullish market; is it?</p><p>JEANNERET: they -- the deal market has been back and the story has been the big deal but what is exciting about our 13th annual, -- our 13th Semiannual Capital Conference Barometer is the exuberance around deal- making as high as its been in the last couple years. More than 75-percent saying they want to do details. Companies with more than $5 billion of market cap. That rate of response for deal making the next year was up over 90-percent. Pipelines are strong, and I think the slow growth environment is sending a signal to the c-suite (ps) keep growing. We are going to reward inorganic growth. Watch how stocks trade up after deals are announced.</p><p>SMITH: All right, so what about sectors are you seeing most deals in right now?</p><p>JEANNERET: Well, you know, there has been a lot of great news in technology, consumer products. There is business model disruption occurring throughout corporate America. The changes in customer preference is driving the consumer products industry and you are seeing blurring occurring between sectors. More than 90-percent of companies who said they were going to do deals in the next-year plan to do deals outside their sector. I think it's a reflection of that a blurring occurring in a rapid way. As business models transform, people acquire technology and intellectual capital in places other than their own.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Rich, to what extent is this being driven by low interest rates? To what extent is this just another artificial impact that the Fed is having on markets, by allowing companies to just take out a lot of debt to go out and buy another company?</p><p>JEANNERET: Jon, I think low rate environment clearly is an element, but I don't think it is a major element here. I don't think the Fed move is going to disrupt this M&amp;A market, should they decide to move soon. I think this is driven by the desire to create top-line growth, to continue business model transformation. Record amounts of capital and liquidity available, most of it is corporate cash sitting on the balance sheet that is being unused. So I don't think there is a lot of debt being taken on to do these deals. If you look at debt to capitalization ratios, they're the lowest they have been in almost a decade. So this is strategic. I think companies are transacting for strategic growth, business model transformation and to create shareholder value.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Are these smart deals, if they're doing them in sectors that they have no experience in?</p><p>JEANNERET: Well I think people are being proactive about business model transformation. You're seeing business models disrupted overnight. I think companies are being smart about acquiring technologies, intellectual capital, workforce in places that are relative of the evolving technological transformation, business model transformation that's occurring around the world today.</p><p>SMITH: Rich, this is a really interesting stat: 86-percent see cyber- attacks as a high level threat to the deal making process. That is probably the highest that it has ever been, in history, I would take?</p><p>JEANNERET: It is. I think people are concerned about two things, one, could their actual deal process be hacked and competitive information about their deal making, you know, be exposed to others; and then, two, just looking at the cyber-risk within a deal, if you're buying a business today, you've got to look what risk that business has with respect to it's IT and cyber-exposure.</p><p>SMITH: All right, great stuff. Rich Jeanneret, thanks for joining us this morning.</p><p>JEANNERET: Thanks.</p><p>SMITH: Coming up, a brand-new report making the case that eating bacon and hotdogs could be just as bad for you are as smoking cigarettes? We are going to show you why, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: Ham, bacon, sausage can cause cancer, that's according to the World Health Organization. Experts say sufficient evidence that eating processed meats is \"Carcinogenic to humans.\" Joining us now is Dr. Devi. Maybe you could bring calm to this situation.</p><p>DR. DEVI NAMPIAPARAMPIL, NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: Sure.</p><p>SMITH: Should we just stop eating bacon and hotdogs altogether?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: I don't think we need to stop eating those things. I mean, I, myself, don't even want to give up eating bacon; but we do have to worry about eating it every single day. So in this report they were looking at people who were having a lot of red meat and processed meats on a daily basis. So what they are talking about is about two slices of bacon per day. Then there are a couple things to think about.</p><p>SMITH: Hold on. First off, I always call pork white meat. I don't call it red meat.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: That's true, I know. I do too, but it's sort of in that gray area, right, where it kind of has some overlap. It depends on the cuts, and probably for the purposes of this study, the processing, you know, itself.</p><p>SMITH: Okay.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Dr. Devi, what is the problem here? Is it the red meat or the processing? I get concerned about any kind of processed food these days. Is that where the potential problem is?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Well this study looked at both things, right. So for red meat they didn't have as much evidence as they did for processing. So seems like if you had to pick between two, the processing might be what you have to be more concerned about. But there are a couple other things to think about in the study; right. So generally, I mean, this is a synthesis of a bunch of different studies. So what we do, let's say there is a pharmaceutical trial, we usually take people who have never had the drug in the first place and then split it up into two groups. One group gets the drug and then you compare to it see what the results are. But in this case you're not really comparing people; you are not giving one group of people hot dogs or red meats every day and then checking to see what happens. You are just letting people kind of follow their usual patterns, which people who eat hot dogs every day might be very different than a vegetarian.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the World Health Organization put processed meat bacon, hot dogs, into the same risk category as smoking and diesel engine exhaust. That is how they view people who -</p><p>HILSENRATH: They put it a little bit lower. They put it right next to herbicide, I think.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Well there is some confusion because of the wording, right. So they put it in \"Sufficient Evidence\", but it doesn't mean that your actually risk factors are as high. So what they said is that based on reviewing all these studies that your risk of developing, let's say colon cancer, goes up by 18-percent. Now that is confusing because it's not going -- it is not going up by that absolute percentage. So if your risk of having colon cancer is about 5-percent to begin with, and it goes up by 18-percent, it is still a little bit less than 6-percent --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have a really -</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: -- which is still very low.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- basic question.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Other than potentially making you overweight and obese, if you eat too much bacon or hotdogs or whatever, what is it about eating these foods causes the cancer?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Well, we don't know. So that is part of the problem, that we don't know what is involved. I mean, they took a lot of different processing and put it together. These were 800 papers, approximately, that they (inaudible) together -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: -- and sometimes that can be, you know, kind of like comparing apples and oranges. So I think the general, take home message is, of course, if you are eating red meat or processed foods, try to limit it. Try to live a healthy lifestyle; right? I don't think this is so shocking.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Didn't we already know that hotdogs and bacon were bad for you? I feel like I grew up hearing that.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: There's a little bit of that.</p><p>SMITH: I mean, no, I didn't grow up hearing that. I mean, bacon, what's wrong with it?</p><p>HILSENRATH: You mean you could eat all the hot dogs you wanted?</p><p>SMITH: No, but I think that's harsh and especially to the agriculture industry, to say that they are bad for you when Dr. Devi will be first to point out that everything in moderation. Meat suppliers, by the way, processors, they have spoken out about this. They're arguing meat is essential for protein and vitamins.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Well, that's true. It depends also on your cut of meat. So if you are talking about a filet mignon that is going to be a little bit different because that's very lean beef, for example. People also use that for --</p><p>HILSENRATH: So the industry also called into question the findings here. Is there anything that raises questions for you about how the studies were done?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Well, like we were talking about, right, so the fact that it's observational, so you're not really separating the people into these different groups and testing them. Then, also, putting together so many studies is difficult. So I think that is another factor that we have to consider. But, like you said, you know, I think this is still something people should be a little bit concerned about, in the sense that, eating processed foods every day could add to your risk; but also, you know, to be fair, just back, I mean, about 100 years ago people won the Nobel prize for processing food.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Dr. Devi, thank you for clearing it up and bringing some calm to the situation.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: Especially during breakfast. All right, next hour, \"Duck Dynasty\" star Willie Robertson; author and columnist, Monica Crowley; and Charles Schwab's Liz Ann Sonders. They're all here, this all-star cast.

And you've seen this particularly with the -- with the tea party a few years ago.</p><p>And I think that, that's one huge advantage that he has in that state that Trump does not.</p><p>SMITH: Speaking of fundraising, talk about Jeb Bush, I mean, in the most recent quarter, he still raised more money than anybody else. I know his burn rate is big and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: And he -- but now he's cutting --</p><p>SMITH: And he's cutting his staff, but in this poll you've got Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, do you anticipate a big move from any of them post the next --</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think --</p><p>SMITH: Debate or the next couple of debates? --</p><p>HILSENRATH: There're going to be a lot of moves. You know, if we -- if we look back to the 2012 cycle, there were a lot of people who came up and then fell back.</p><p>I mean, at this -- at this point four years ago, we were talking about Newt Gingrich as the high flier, and he fell out a few months before anyone cast a single vote.</p><p>And we ended up getting the establishment candidate in the Republican Party; Mitt Romney as the candidate.

So, what overall is your take on third quarter earnings season so far?</p><p>SONDERS: So, out of the bloc, it started weak, which was the expectation. And if you look more broadly than just the S&amp;P 500, which of course is a large cap index, and look more broadly at the S&amp;P 1,500.</p><p>The key rate to the percentage of companies beating expectations is running a little over 60 percent. Now, the problem though is that, the top line beat rate, so revenue beat rate, is actually quite a bit lower, it's under 45 percent.</p><p>So right now, expectations are for earnings to be down about 3 percent, I think that improves between now and the end of reporting season.</p><p>But we're still somewhat likely to be in negative territory. So, it is likely that this is an earnings recession, I just don't think it will correspond with an economic recession.</p><p>SMITH: Interesting, so you sound somewhat optimistic, generally speaking, do you believe that the stock market is going to continue higher through the rest of this year?</p><p>SONDERS: So, I think this rally that we're in right now does have some legs, but I think we're probably back in more of the trading range kind of environment that we were in earlier in the year before the correction unfolded.</p><p>And I think what will define when you hit the low-end of that range and the high-end of that range will be less about things like earnings and valuation and more about the technical conditions of the market.</p><p>Things like market breadth, but also sentiment conditions. And sentiment had really gotten washed out, investors were extraordinarily pessimistic particularly back in late August when you had the mini-flash crash and then the ensuing choppiness thereafter.</p><p>But since we've had the rally up about 10 percent off the lows, sentiment has swung back up toward excessive optimism. So, I think that probably more than anything will define the ebbs and flows.</p><p>I think we're so out of secular bull market, but we've had a neutral recommendation or a neutral rating on the market this year, which means we're telling investors to just stay at your normal equity allocation, don't take excessive bets on the upside.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Liz Ann, you called this an earnings recession, which is a pretty striking word. How are companies going to respond to an earnings recession?</p><p>What we've seen in the past is they respond by cutting workers and cutting payrolls. What kind of responses are you hearing about in their earnings calls right now?</p><p>SONDERS: Well, I don't -- I don't -- I follow individual companies, so I don't tend to be on the earnings call, that's it. And earnings recession just means that the overall S&amp;P 500 goes into negative territory.</p><p>But the concentration therein is heavily towards the energy sector. So down over 65 percent year-over-year growth expectations for just the energy sector.</p><p>Second to that would be the materials, obviously, connected to the commodity space. More broadly than that, actually, many sectors are doing quite well, some of which are in double digit territory on the upside.</p><p>To this -- although overall, we're going to possibly see negative earnings, the concentration is very much in the commodity-related space.</p><p>SMITH: And Liz Ann --</p><p>SONDERS: We've seen instances like that before where earnings have dipped negative, but it hasn't been an overall economic recession and that's often been times where you've had a strong dollar and weak commodity prices.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Do you think --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Liz --</p><p>HILSENRATH: The market is cheaper or expensive right now?</p><p>SONDERS: Neither. I think, the market is sort of in-line with median valuations on a trailing or a forward PE. On a Shiller-Case(ph) basis, the market is expensive, but frankly, it's been above its long term norm for this entire bull market.</p><p>So, I wouldn't put a lot of weight into that on a short-term timing perspective. I think it's neither an opportunity valuation nor is it a deterrent for the market.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Liz Ann, but in terms of the expectations for next year in earnings, do you think there's still too high, because if they are, many people do believe that they're still lofty, then stocks would look a lot more expensive if they come down.</p><p>SONDERS: I think they maybe a little bit high, but I think we are in the same pattern in games that has been played out quarter after quarter, which is looking out several quarters, you probably have estimates a little bit too high.</p><p>Analysts will ultimately lower the bar too far heading into each quarter, setting up the opportunity for analysts to beat those expectations.</p><p>So, I think we're probably -- real earnings for next year are probably somewhere in between where estimates are now and where analysts are going to go.</p><p>SMITH: Hey, Liz Ann, we led off this hour talking about this new national poll out. How closely are you as somebody who watches the markets so closely?</p><p>How closely are you watching the changes and the ebbs and flows in the 2016 race for the White House. How important is that and does it play into your decisions and your expectations in the market?</p><p>SONDERS: It's not really that important at all right now. In fact, I think most of the volatility we've seen in the market really has nothing to do with the presidential candidates.</p><p>There may be a factor of it that's driven by what's going on in Congress and a potential for a government shutdown.</p><p>But I think in terms of market impact, I don't think if we even get it, that happens until we actually have two candidates running against one another, when we start to see their policy prescriptions put on the table.</p><p>We start to see polling closer to the election that may give a biases to who is coming in, and therefore, what changes might possibly be up for.</p><p>But at this stage, I don't think it's a market mover.</p><p>SMITH: Very interesting, and a part of Jon Hilsenrath's cover article on the \"Wall Street Journal\", \"Fed strives for clear signal on rate move.\"</p><p>Do you believe that we're going to get any indication, Liz Ann, that there will be a move on interest rates by the end of the year?</p><p>SONDERS: I'd be surprise if they did anything terribly bold in this meeting, this week. I think it's very likely that they do nothing in terms of rates.</p><p>And I'm not so sure they adjust the statement. If anything, they may make sure that in their statement, they keep the option for a December move open.</p><p>Which I think they would like to do. But --</p><p>SMITH: Yes --</p><p>SONDERS: Beyond that, I think it would be fairly benign this statement --</p><p>SMITH: Liz Ann Sonders, thank you for joining us this morning.</p><p>SONDERS: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: Great to have you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have one quick thing. Chris Low, he's an economist, FTN Financial, comes on this program very often, here is his e-mail note to clients this morning.</p><p>\"Jon Hilsenrath's story about Fed communication in today's \"Wall Street Journal\" is terrific.\"</p><p>HILSENRATH: Sure --</p><p>MCDOWELL: A reminder of why we all read Hilsenrath in the first place.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Oh, that's nice to hear --</p><p>SMITH: And watch him -- and a reminder why you're watching him right now.

So, the company is actually going to be paying their employees to go outside that day and then hopefully tweet about it, Facebook about it, Instagram pictures, things like that. So --</p><p>SMITH: I think it's really interesting here, it makes you wonder if there's going to be a huge reversal in this trend to be open all the time, be open on every holiday.</p><p>And I think it's a beautiful thing, they've got 12,000 employees and they're saying, go do it, you'll --</p><p>HILSENRATH: But --</p><p>SMITH: Love it, the holiday --</p><p>HILSENRATH: We live -- we live in such a cynical era.

We don't do a lot on Black Friday anyway.</p><p>So, let's just give everybody off and -- you know, people are lining up outside of Wal-Mart on Black Friday trampling each other.</p><p>So, they're probably not going to --</p><p>MCDOWELL: On --</p><p>CASONE: Sandra, well --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thanksgiving Day now --</p><p>SMITH: Well, by the way, they're -- so, they're also closed Thanksgiving Day. I guess you can assume that if they're going to be closed the day after. They already got more than 35,000 likes on their Facebook page for announcing this.</p><p>I'm serious, I wonder if you're going to see more companies follow suit -- and by the way, the more we are shopping online --</p><p>CASONE: Right, exactly --</p><p>SMITH: How many of these stores really need to --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But --</p><p>SMITH: Stuff --</p><p>CASONE: Exactly --</p><p>SMITH: Their stores --</p><p>CASONE: Which would be a good thing.

All right, Cheryl --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Build a fort!</p><p>SMITH: Thank you -- yes --</p><p>CASONE: Here we go --</p><p>SMITH: Coming up, the U.S. positioning warships right now near China's territory. What does this mean for relations between the two countries?</p><p>We're going to discuss that with Fox's Lea Gabrielle, she'll be joining us in studio next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: A showdown on that sea, the U.S. sending a warship within 12 nautical miles of the sputtered islands claimed by Beijing in the South China Sea.</p><p>This is seen as a potential challenge to China's territorial claim over the contested waters. Former U.S. Navy officer and Fox News correspondent Lea Gabrielle joins me now and former intelligence official as well.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS: Oh, thank you --</p><p>SMITH: Great to get your insight always on these stories. What do you make of this showdown on that sea?</p><p>GABRIELLE: Well, I actually don't think it's much of a showdown at all to be honest with you. And the reason I say that is because, these are islands that China claims in the South China Sea.</p><p>China claims that the entire South China Sea belongs to them. But other countries would argue with that including the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, a number of others.</p><p>What China has been doing is, they've been building on top of these reefs. Some of these reefs (INAUDIBLE) reefs they've been building on top of since 2003 to '13.</p><p>Some of them were submerged in high tide and they basically been adding on to them building ports, building airstrips that are --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Capable of --</p><p>SMITH: Yes --</p><p>GABRIELLE: Of military aircraft and that type of thing. So, when you look at this 12 nautical miles, what you're talking about is within a country's sovereign territory.</p><p>There's a right of transit passage, meaning, you can navigate through those waters within 12 miles of a country's sovereign territory.</p><p>By us saying, oh, we're going to -- we're going to go through your 12 nautical-mile area, that's kind of admitting to China that, that's their sovereign territory.</p><p>So my take on this is, forget about that, let's go do naval exercises. Let's get, you know, some of these countries like the Philippines involved, let's invite China to do naval exercises right there within 12 miles of these islands.</p><p>And not even acknowledge their claims to these islands.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So, what's the U.S. game here? Why -- what are -- what are we trying to demonstrate by sending our ship in that area?</p><p>GABRIELLE: Well, what we're demonstrating is freedom of navigation. You know, according to the conventional law of the sea, basically, countries can pass through areas.</p><p>You can look like Strait of Gibraltar, the Strait of Hormuz by Iran, different straits, different choke points that we call them in the world.</p><p>Where, you know -- where ships need to be able to pass through for trade and other things. And this particular area of the world, about 30 percent of trade passes through here.</p><p>So, we're saying, you know, we are basically saying that there is freedom of navigation in these waters, and we're going to prove that and we're going to show that by moving within 12 nautical miles.</p><p>But my issue with this is that 12 nautical-mile rule does not apply to when a country starts piling sand on top of a reef and calling it their island - -</p><p>SMITH: Their island.</p><p>GABRIELLE: When we don't acknowledge that these are China's islands.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But wait, if the longer that we wait to do something about this, the more heighten the danger --</p><p>GABRIELLE: Right --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the harder it is to actually take power away from China --</p><p>GABRIELLE: I absolute agree. And it's right that we are -- that we are seaming through these areas, it's wrong that we're making a big deal of it.</p><p>We should just be doing it, and if we do want to make a big deal of something, which I think we probably should, because China continues to build these up.</p><p>And what they're doing is, they're basically closing down -- essentially, they're making a claim that could ultimately close down on freedom of navigation through that area.</p><p>And I'm saying, do more. Just passing through, just going through that and saying we're going through this 12-nautical mile area. I don't think that's enough at this point.</p><p>I think that they need a stronger statement and I think what we should be doing is naval exercises in that area.</p><p>HILSENRATH: What's the risk of the confrontation or an accident?</p><p>SMITH: Recap it --</p><p>GABRIELLE: Well, right now, everyone just making statements. We're making statements through our actions, through our words. China is too.</p><p>But no one wants that to happen.</p><p>SMITH: All right, we always love getting your insights, Lea Gabrielle, thank you. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: GOP presidential hopeful <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>strikes again, this time going after women who choose to wear burkas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We want it with the women -- oh, but they don't have to wear the -- you know, what?

God, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.</p><p>Look, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>can literally say anything and get away with anything. This remark I think, look, a lot of it was said in jest. He's married to a supermodel who is once famous for her lingerie shoes. I don't think he wants his wife wearing a Burke.</p><p>I think he's actually making a bigger point here, which is, you know, about the invasion of Iraq which he has opposed from the start, and so on. That when the United States intervenes in certain areas, you know, whether it's democracy building or trying to change the culture, you know, oftentimes we're going to fail, especially when it comes to the Muslim world.</p><p>I think he made a very indelicate comment about this, but I think it points to this bigger issue.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: OK. But a new national poll, Dr. Carson, a four-point lead over <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>What do you make of that?</p><p>CROWLEY: This is the first national poll actually in over 100 days that has shown somebody actually beating <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>SMITH: Trump was very quick to point that out.</p><p>CROWLEY: Yes, exactly. Look, comments like we just highlighted here. They might actually be starting to wear on <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>supporters. So, it might be some Trump fatigued starting to come into play here.</p><p>He's got a very passionate core, a block of support, which I don't think is going to go away and he has become a better candidate as times has gone by. So, we have to see how this shakes out.</p><p>I do think as the voters get closer to actually casting their vote or what I call spending their vote the way they spend money, it's an emotional act as much as it is an intellectual one, I think people will start to have second thoughts about not just him but Ben Carson.</p><p>That doesn't mean they won't vote for them, but I think they'll start getting more serious about analyzing how they are going to spend their vote and who they would like to see to be the nominee in terms of electability.</p><p>HILSENRATH: When I hear comments like that I ask myself is that a candidate or an entertainer? What are the most striking thing about that berth comment that we just heard, was it the laughter in the background. It sounded like he was up there trying to be an entertainer and not a candidate.</p><p>CROWLEY: Yes. I mean, you hear that and he's doing stick, you know. I mean, I don't think they're mutually exclusive when they come to Trump. I do think he is a serious candidate and I also think that he is an entertainer, which is explains why he's been leading at least until now.</p><p>SMITH: We haven't got in your take since Joe Biden drop out of the race, oh, sorry, never entered into the race. He announced that he wouldn't be entering the race. How does these change things for in your perspective on the democratic side?</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, I was certainly wrong about this because for months I'd been predicting that Biden was going to get in the race. And, look, he didn't entirely close the door.</p><p>SMITH: He didn't.</p><p>CROWLEY: Did you listen to that to his announcement in the Rose Garden with the President; it was more of an announcement saying I am not running.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>CROWLEY: So, I think they are actually waiting on the FBI investigation. And if Hillary Clinton had serious grave legal trouble, Joe Biden will be able to ride in.</p><p>SMITH: Well, he kind of ended the speech in the Rose Garden with, \"I'm here if anybody needs me.\"</p><p>CROWLEY; And by the way, on 60 Minutes on Sunday, when he was asked about Hillary Clinton, he said, if she is the nominee, of course, I will support her. And I thought that phrase if she's the nominee it leaves a lot of latitude here. I just -- I may not be entirely wrong yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. I hope <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>works out a better standup routine, you know, does some works out some material at a chuck hat in Paramus, New Jersey, if we are going to have to listen to this rather than low, but, no.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CROWLEY: Yes, I mean, yes. He can literally say anything and get away with it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: He can but...</p><p>HILSENRATH: But he's falling in the polls. Can he keep doing that?</p><p>CROWLEY: It might, and like I said, look, as we get closer to the point where voters are actually thinking about really spending their votes on somebody, that it might work against him, then again, it might not.</p><p>The dynamic we're seeing this year is completely unlike anything we have ever seen before.

When the wind shifts and come out of the North, we're right and dense center of those as well, so it's a wonderful production.</p><p>FLOCK: An incredible view from up here. And maybe, Sandra, you see as we pan out, how many of these I am looking at this horizon.</p><p>WEBB: Roughly about 75 to 100.</p><p>FLOCK: The thing about is if you look at the numbers, last week, actually, Texas provided in terms of wind power, a third, wind power provided a third of the power for Texas. Incredible.</p><p>WEBB: Yes it is. And we're able to -- we have 400 megawatts here which can power up to 80,000 homes, which is equal to taking about 146,000 cars off the highway.</p><p>FLOCK: And, Sandra, I've got to show you what we're dealing with up here. You can imagine. And thanks to the good folks at EDP for letting us come up here. We are all tied in with this is harnesses, and I guess these are designed in case somehow I go over the side. I'm not going there.</p><p>WEBB: No, you're not. They will hold you up and then we would have to form an angle and rescue you.</p><p>FLOCK: An angle rescue. I'm going to leave you with one shot. Go ahead, Dino, spin around show us, our guys are intrepid crew out here on top of this, first ever live broadcast from the top of a wind turbine. We are 30 story's in the air.</p><p>And I tell you, look at the, look at that, Din, is that incredible. Coming up, the moon going down, the sun coming up over Texas, Sandra. Wish you were here.</p><p>SMITH: Al right. Jeff Flock. Only you and you only really get like the massive nature of those turbines until you stand next to one. Over stand next to one.</p><p>Jeff Flock, amazing reporting as always. Thank you.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And it sounded windy up there, which I guess is a good thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: Like, honestly, you know how he got, he's tethered to a rope up there, like there is no elevator. Think about how he got up there. He's not -- he's not doing it for Fox Business. Jeff Flock, thank you.</p><p>All right. Well, the latest CBS News, New York Times poll showing Ben Carson as the lead with 26 percent support, he's a four-point lead now over <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>who has 22 percent.</p><p>This latest hit for Trump in the polls comes as he still refuses to apologize for comments made about Carson's religion.</p><p>Joining us now is Duck commander CEO and star of the A&amp;E show, \"Duck Dynasty\" Willie Robertson. Welcome to you, sir.</p><p>WILLIE ROBERTSON, DUCK COMMANDER &amp; CEO: How are you?</p><p>SMITH: We always like to share our LSU camaraderie, both LSU big fans, go tigers.</p><p>ROBERTSON: It's a good year. It's a good year.</p><p>SMITH: Good year.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Undefeated.</p><p>SMITH: Yes, number four.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want Sandra to start sound and southern.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: For the next five minutes.</p><p>SMITH: That will give you a cocktail. But it's good to see you. I mean, have you officially supported <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>I know you've shared your like for him.</p><p>ROBERTSON: I've shared my like for him. You know, I'm not a politician, so, I don't really, I don't endorse people. I'm just a...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: But you're a big businessman. And you're a big businessman. You employ how many people?</p><p>ROBERTSON: We got a few people, not as many as Mr. Trump, but there is a lot of things that Trump says that I really like. I don't agree with everything he says but there's a lot of stuff he says that makes sense. And I like the charisma, I like the energy and see what's he end in.</p><p>You know, I've met Ben Carson as well, he's a super nice guy, great guy. You know, I certainty share his faith. So, only that he's taken the faith, you've got...</p><p>SMITH: Back to get Dr. Ben Carson.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Right. He has taken kind of that which there are other people you'd probably thought who have thought would have, you know, have that. Trump does the same thing with the, you know, you saw in your face which is I kind of thought Christie was going to, you know, a year ago, it was like Christie was that guy, then Trump just go fast. So, a lot (Inaudible) that came in that took over these issues.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you say there's a lot of things that Trump says or believes that appeal to you, walk us through what you like about him besides the energy, you mentioned the energy. But what is it that really is one thing that you like.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROBERTSON: You know, one of the things, he actually says, you know, people over there are getting their heads chopped off who are Christians and that has bugged me, it was like -- I didn't hear a lot of talk about that.</p><p>And as a Christian, I'm going, what is going on in this world? Where literally is just we're videoing then people getting their heads lopped off. And he actually said, I mean, when he said, and I thought, I think it's the first time I heard somebody actually say it, you know, that was running for president.</p><p>So, those kind of things to me are big, you know, I just heard for these people all over the world who are getting persecuted.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, he doesn't want to be involved in that stuff. He's basically wants to watch...</p><p>ROBERTSON: He's saying he's going to go, well...</p><p>SMITH: Well, there have been a direct exchanges and attacks on religion between <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and Ben Carson. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>said, And I'm a Presbyterian, that's pretty much straight down the middle of religion, right?</p><p>And then he said to Ben Carson, you're not -- you're not really a Christian.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: He was quietly mocking Seventh Day Adventist.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Well, he didn't say he's not -- I didn't even know that by the way. I started to realize.</p><p>SMITH: So, but religion has entered into the conversation, and it is part of this election but there's a lot going on.</p><p>ROBERTSON: It's hard, yes. I mean, to me it is about running the country. I like the idea of running it as a business, you know, it just seems like if you look at the deaths, it seems that we haven't done our great job of that, you know, run this time like a business and, you know, kind of like Giuliani came over in New York, you know, he turned it around and looked at it as a business.</p><p>And run this thing as a business. So, it's not all, to me, it's not all about religion. I mean, I am a religious guy but it's all about who has the competency to run, and I am still, again, I'm learning, I'm still watching myself, it's too early.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you expect you're going to end up campaigning for somebody? Because you -- they -- if you get behind a candidate they're going to ask you to hit the road for some. I's suspect given your popularity.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Well, once we -- no, I can't. I don't know if I have time, I have a TV show coming, so.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>ROBERTSON: So, I don't know if I have the time to run for them.</p><p>SMITH: You got TV show, you have a new book out today.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Yes. \"American Hunter\" came out today. So, yes, we've got a lot of things going on. But politics interest me. And, again, I was in Israel with Mike Huckabee, another great guy. I mean, these are great guys and I like talking to him, sharing ideas and maybe giving him some of my ideas and some things that, you know, we believe in and maybe it will help.</p><p>SMITH: Well, Willie, you live down there in the great State of Louisiana and you got your ear to the ground, when it comes to what people are talking about. I mean, what's this conversation that you're hearing with the people of Louisiana, who are they talking about, what issues are most important to them in this...</p><p>ROBERTSON: Well, I ran out of issues.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROBERTSON: We are playing Alabama in a couple of -- next week. So, it's also hunting season. But now I think people, you know, you see stories, you know, that come out and we just kind of wonder and like, what is this country come to where like the coach in Washington you can't say a prayer, he's threaten to get fired...</p><p>SMITH: We've got video of that by the way. The coach that takes to the field after the games, he prays and he welcomes the players to join him. And then the school took issue with that. And where do you fall on whether there is room for prayer?</p><p>ROBERTSON: Well, I'm kind with the founding fathers of the country who are strong believers that, you know, that this whole country was founded on our Christian faith. So, they didn't shy away from it. I won't shy away from it. And if you get fired you get fired, you know. I mean, that's some things are worth losing your job over.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Can I say a little bit about -- this is you're talking about business. How is business right now. What are you seeing, are people spending money on your product?</p><p>ROBERTSON: They are. Yes. We still have people -- a lot of people come down and visit, they want to come to the warehouse and take a picture and then they'll go in and spend money and we have seen it, you know, 2013 for us was the high, you know, that was the high mark.</p><p>And so, now we're seeing where it has leveled off and still there is a lot of people spending. In fact, when the economy is down, we've noticed that hunting stuff it doesn't miss a lag.</p><p>Guys are going to go hunting, girls are going to go hunting no matter, they're going to bother. Camouflage and they Duck calls and so...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: Is there going to be a good...</p><p>ROBERTSON: In fact, sometimes even more because, you know, you can go out and actually get your food and provide. So, you know, sometimes it helps.</p><p>SMITH: Great point. By the way, you're actually on your Twitter, you're saying still time to sign up and be entered to go hunting with you. You're going to enter in your Twitter site, where are you taking somebody on a hunt?</p><p>ROBERTSON: We're taking them hunt in Louisiana. Yes, right down there.</p><p>SMITH: Nice.</p><p>ROBERTSON: We've teamed up and we're doing some things with adaption which is where close to our hearts.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sandra said in the break she doesn't like duck hunting.</p><p>ROBERTSON: You don't like duck hunting?</p><p>SMITH: It bores me a little but I like duck meat and you know, I cook everything I hunt and it just bores me a little bit. I've a German shorthaired pointer and we like to go out in the fields like fuzzy crowd...</p><p>ROBERTSON: I mean to take to a better spot because it shouldn't be boring. It should be fun.</p><p>SMITH: I know, I like to walk in the fields and the trees and the grass.</p><p>ROBERTSON: You need to talk and cook and...</p><p>SMITH: All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You got to be careful which ducks you cook because some of them depending on the duck they can taste like wet garbage.</p><p>SMITH: You haven't get...</p><p>ROBERTSON: You get that wet. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's true. It's what the duck ate.</p><p>ROBERTSON: You got a -- well, that's true.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: One thing I love about...</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's not impossible, I know.</p><p>SMITH: One thing I love about going to school in Louisiana is all the boys down there they all know how to cook, they all know how to dance. I mean, I'm this Louisiana.</p><p>ROBERTSON: She has lost it. She says Louisiana.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know, I've lost it.</p><p>SMITH: Willie Robertson, pleasure having you.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Nice to see you.</p><p>SMITH: All right. Taking a look at the market. Futures lower ahead of the open, keep it right here on Fox Business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: We're about 30 minutes away from the opening bell, final thoughts to Dagen McDowell and John -- what do you got?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Read Jon Hilsenrath article on the front page of the Wall Street Journal today because and John can answer this question. It looks like a Fed that does not know how to communicate with the press, members that are maybe arguing with each other. Can they get it together? Or maybe not roll the market.</p><p>HILSENRATH: You know, I got to say, Dagen, we got to kind of a rocky start.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because I want to bring with you typical man.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: But I love everything that you're saying right now. I couldn't really work.</p><p>SMITH: You called her grumpy when we started the show.</p><p>HILSENRATH: It was really and we didn't have enough caffeine.</p><p>SMITH: Got it.</p><p>HILSENRATH: There is the Fed meeting that starts this week and they have some problems constructing a message while they are trying to make a difficult decision about interest rates. We don't get any action this week from the Fed but looking towards the end of the year we got to see Janet Yellen kind of taking control of this committee and getting a straighter message out of the Central Bank.</p><p>SMITH: OK. As far as an actual rate hike the market is still saying as Mike...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: Let's talk after the next jobs report. We will have a better idea then.</p><p>SMITH: All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And go Mets and go with the World Series. I am and ink stain wretch, so I carry the papers around with me. But go Mets, World Series starts tonight.</p><p>SMITH: All right. It's going to be a big night indeed. And by the way it was fun talking LSU Tigers with Willie. I mean, did you knew that as much fun as I did in the break?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. But he is so down to earth it's incredible.</p><p>SMITH: All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it's nice to have some good some southern...</p><p>SMITH: Very down to earth, very down to earth. All right. Thank you to Dagen McDowell and Jon Hilsenrath for joining us all show.</p><p>Don't miss our all-star lineup tomorrow on Mornings with Maria. We will sit down with media mogul Steve Forbes will be here. And we'll continue our coverage of this earning season with the CEOs of Southern Company and Athena Health.</p><p>It all begins at 6 a.m. Eastern right here on the Fox Business Network. \"VARNEY AND COMPANY\", it is next, Stuart, it is all yours, sir.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

We are getting earnings from big names, including  Alibaba, Ford and UPS.  We'll get readings on durable goods orders, home  prices and consumer confidence.  Ahead of all of that we are looking at  futures markets here in the U.S., pointing to go lower open on Wall Street,  small losses to kick off this Tuesday morning.

Ravens Quarterback, Joe Flacco,  intercepted in the end zone, and Arizona won the game, 26-18.</p><p>And it's a big night for baseball.  The World Series getting underway  tonight in Kansas City.  The Mets and Royals getting in one last workout  yesterday before the series begins.  It's said to be a pricey series for  fans.  The average ticket price is $723 and climbing, that's according to  StubHub this morning and it gets more expensive when the teams face off in  New York on Wednesday.</p><p>Well let's get to that new Monmouth University poll out this morning  showing Donald Trump losing more ground in the state of Iowa, while making  more controversial comments in a town hall in New Hampshire.  Blake Burman  has all the latest from Washington, and it gets even more interesting this  morning, Black.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Day by day it does, Sandra.  Good morning  to you.  Donald Trump still holds commanding leads nationally, and in a  couple of the early of the early voting states, but there's a growing trend  in Iowa, according to polls taken there over the last week.  Dr. Ben Carson  has supplanted Trump in the first caucus state.  Take a look at this:   Carson has won four of the last five polls there with the fifth being a  tie.  They're all fairly sizable spreads, with the most recent from  Monmouth University showing Carson with a 14-point lead.</p><p>Meantime, Trump is facing some scrutiny for a couple of comments he made  yesterday in New Hampshire.  In one of them Trump said it's easy for women  to wear burkas because they don't have to wear makeup.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  In fact, it's easier.  You don't  have to put on makeup.  Look how beautiful everyone looks.  Wouldn't it be  easier? Right?  Wouldn't that be easy?  I tell you, if I was a woman, I don't want  to -- I'm ready, darling, let's go.  It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Separately, Sandra, Trump also took credit for Ford's decision to  halt production plants truck plans in Mexico and stay in Ohio.  However,  that was strongly disputed by Ford and Ohio Governor, and presidential candidate, John  Kasich.  Sandra.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, Blake Burman, thank you.  Let's bring in former White  House advisor to President Bush, Bryan Hook and Democratic Strategist,  Richard Goodstein.  Guys, I don't know where to begin.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH:  Let's first tackle the burka comment.  Bryan, to you first, is this  going to hurt Trump?</p><p>BRYAN HOOK, former ADVISOR, WHITE HOUSE:  You know, historically we try not  to view American foreign policy through the lens of the burka.  This is a  very strange comment to be made when we are talking about a real crisis in  the Middle East.  It makes him in that entertainer column and less in the  commander-in-chief column.</p><p>SMITH:  Well, Richard, normally, you know, I think we'd be looking at a  comment like that and saying, gosh, every controversial comment he makes he seems  to go up in the polls.  Now we are talking about him losing ground in Iowa,  again, to Dr. Carson.  Are things starting to change here?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Look, they're changing in a  pretty fundamental way in this regard, Trump's whole calling card,  incidentally so many of his comments are untethered from reality it makes  me think he has a political death wish.  His calling card is I'm a winner.   If he loses, in his book he's a loser and there's nothing worse than being  a loser to Donald Trump.  So, he better turn that around in Iowa because he  can't keep -- yes, he's ahead in all the other states, I understand that,  but - incidentally, Ben Carson is the Gardner of this race, right?  I know,  I'm dating myself from the movie, being there, but he says all these inane  things and people impute to it commonsense, when its, for the most part,  idiocy.  If I was a Republican, I would be scared to death, or frankly,  somebody on Wall Street, that a major political party could nominate either  of these two guys, it's scary.</p><p>SMITH:  Bryan, it's hard to really decide where to go from here because it  does seem that things are changing now, but at the same time, it seems like  the establishment has been trying to figure out what to do with Donald  Trump, but Donald Trump, responding to Richard's comment, has made it clear  that he is not going to lose.  He has made it clear that the second that  he's dropping in the polls or it looks like he doesn't have a shot at  winning the GOP primary, he said he's out of the race.  He has made that  very clear.  So what naturally happens next?</p><p>HOOK:  We have about a little less than 100 days until the Iowa caucus, and  that's a long time in presidential politics.  Trump is now down five points  in that Monmouth poll since the last one.  So we are -- we are seeing Trump  lose altitude, and I think because we have what, you know, a few months left now, there's plenty of time for  the race to move around.  I do expect that you're going to see continual  movement, and it's probably going to trend more in the establishment  direction.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Can I raise an issue though, Gentlemen,  and Rich, I know he's die to go make fun of me because I poo poo'ed when he  said - </p><p>GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELLL:  He said Joe Biden was not going to run for president, and I said -- well, he's not. But with Iowa and to the good people of Iowa, how  relevant are the caucuses, particularly with the Republicans, you look back, it was Rick  Santorum and Mike Huckabee were - </p><p>GOLDSTEIN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- the last two winners and they, well, were not the nominee?</p><p>GOLDSTEIN:  Correct.  Dagen, so you make a good point.  There's even a  different point, which is at this point four years ago, and I checked yesterday, on  October 30th, 2011 poll, Herman Cain was in first, Mitt Romney was second,  Rick Santorum, who ultimately won, was at five-percent.  So, all this kind  of bloviation about where the polls are, not just to us but everybody is a  bit much and I think people have to take it into some perspective.  You  make a doubly good point, which is Iowa has not being a precursor of how  somebody's going to do down the road.  Again, for Trump, when your calling  card is I'm a winner, and if you lose, that changes everything in people's  eyes.</p><p>JONATHAN HILSENRATH, EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Can I jump in  here?  What struck me about these latest polls is that Ted Cruz is moving  up.  I want to hear both of you -- what you have to say about Ted Cruz and  whether he's ready to make his move and whether such a move is sustainable?</p><p>HOOK:  Senator Cruz has been hanging back and taking a very kind of slow  and steady approach to the campaign and you know, somebody like Senator  Cruz could play very well in Iowa but then when you see the other states  that follow, New Hampshire, South Carolina and down the line, it gets a  little trickier.  </p><p>GOLDSTEIN:  I would actually disagree a little bit, Bryan.  Can I - if I  don't mind.  I predicted on your air, Sandra, with Maria, probably six  weeks ago, that Cruz was the one to keep your eye on in this regard, I  predict that Trump and Carson will crater.  I think Cruz has a good shot at  gutting kind of the evangelicals, the libertarians when Rand Paul goes away  -</p><p>SMITH:  If you're predict - if you're predicting that Dr. Carson will  crater, we've heard your views on Trump, I'm going to force you to tell me  why is Dr. Carson gaining so much in the polls right now.</p><p>GOLDSTEIN:  So people say there's this whole outsider thing.  That's just  among Republicans, right?  Democrats aren't showing any affection for  outsiders and I think there's -- it's the same reason that tea party people  are so angry with Congress.  They are living kind of almost in an alternate  reality that somehow or another, a guy like Carson, they just want to think  that somehow there's something pure about him that's going to fix  everything.  It's, again, untethered from reality, but that would be my   explanation for why Carson has this boom right now, because people just  want to believe in those caucuses out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Richard, the democrats are showing benefit quite a bit of  affection, in terms of money, at least, to -</p><p>SMITH:  Bernie Sanders.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- to Bernie Sanders.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes, that's the socialist.  He's a bit of an outside the  mainstream in Washington.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  No question.  No question.</p><p>SMITH:  Bryan last word to you.</p><p>HOOK:  You're going to see continual movement around here.  I also think  you're going to see Ben Carson's change, probable quite a lot between now  and when the first vote is cast in the Iowa caucuses.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, good stuff.  Bryan Hook and Richard Goodstein, thanks.</p><p>GOODSTEIN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I will just quickly point out that Trump referred to the  media as scum and horrible people so that made me feel good.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But meanwhile we spend every segment talking about the guy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly, so where would he be without these --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We love what he's doing for our ratings.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The horrible scum that we are.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH:  All right, thank you, Gentlemen.  Fox Business is teaming up with  the \"Wall Street Journal\" to give you a Republican Debate focused on the  economy, business and your money.  Be sure to tune in on November 10th when  the Republican candidates take the stage in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  You can  only see that right here on the Fox Business Network.  </p><p>I want to say thank you, Gentlemen.  I was talking to our remote guests.   Thank you, Dagen.  Thank you, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Are you saying I'm not a gentleman?</p><p>SMITH:  Moving on - oh, I can't win this morning.  It must be Tuesday.  Big  tech earnings to look at this morning.  Alibaba is scheduled to report  before the bell, while Apple and Twitter are set to release results after  the bell tonight.  Everybody will be watching those.  Estimates right now  calling for Alibaba to post earnings per share .54 cents on revenues of $3.35 billion.  Apple looking to beat Wall Street  estimates for the fifth straight time.  Investors will be focused on Iphone  sales during the quarter and its forecast for the holidays.  Twitter  earnings puts the spotlight on newly minted CEO, Jack Dorsey.  Since taking the reigns permanently this month, Dorsey has cut  eight-percent of the company's workforce and donated a third of his stock  to the employee equity pool.</p><p>Any big surprises that you're looking for today?  Apple is going to be a  big one to watch, obviously, and the fact that we are talking about the  holidays when we are looking at all the earnings, Jon. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I'm certainly looking for Apple because the President of the  Atlanta Fed has been saying this too, I want to see how consumers are  holding up.  There have been a lot of headwinds hitting the American  economy.  We've had a volatile stock market.  We've had a stronger dollar,  which is hurting exports.  The big question for this economy is are  consumers spending money?  And we will see that if they're out buying  Iphones.</p><p>SMITH:  And it's shocking too, -- well, maybe not.  As an economist you can  tell me if I should be shocked, but here we have these low oil low prices,  low gasoline prices and still we are not seeing the consumer spend that  money elsewhere.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Not only that but we have unemployment rate coming down to  nearly five -percent.</p><p>SMITH:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We have in American public that was scared by a very deep  recession and slow recovery and people are reluctant to go out -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  amazon is going to have record sales this holiday season.</p><p>SMITH:  And FedEx says that they're going to have record shipments.  So,  people are shopping, it's just not necessarily - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Mickey D's and Starbucks hit new all time highs in the stock  market yesterday.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I don't know if McDonald's it's a great barometer for how  aggressive Americans are spending.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- but the other one I'm looking at is Ford.  I think Ford -  we are having a car boom right now, a car sales boom.</p><p>SMITH:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's going to be an important one to watch.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So much that GM has given workers a raise, finally.</p><p>SMITH: All right, we are going to have more on that a little bit.  Up next  watch out for falling prices and drones.  Why Wal-Mart wants to get into  the drone delivery.  Do you want one of these showing up in your doorstep?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  The United States sending a warship near one of China's artificial  islands in the South China Sea.  Cheryl Casone's following this story and  more for us this morning.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Sandra; good morning.   Good morning, everyone.  Defense Department officials say that a U.S. Navy  Destroyer entered waters near the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea  last night.  The U.S. Lassen is armed with tomahawk missiles.  This move is  a direct challenge to China's claims that the artificial island chain is  within its territorial boarders.  </p><p>More than 300 people are dead after a 7.5 magnitude hit northeastern  Afghanistan.  Most of the deaths reported were in Pakistan, but tremors  from the quake were also felt in northern India and Tajikistan.  The death  toll is set to rise, as the most severely affected areas are so remote that  communications have been cut off.</p><p>Finally, the battle of the drones is heating up.  This time it's Wal-Mart.   The retailer applying to test drones, home delivery, curbside pickup and  checking warehouse inventories.  This move is a sign that the retailer  plans to go head-to-head with amazon who has been vocal about their plans.   Amazon says they're going to be ready to deliver these packages as soon as  federal rules allow.  That is the question mark because the FAA right, has  to, you know, come together with the regulations.  They're not even talking  about beginning a framework, regulatory framework until 2016, at the  earliest.  So we can talk about delivery all we want.  Are we going to see  a drone in our doorstep?  It's going to be a while.</p><p>SMITH:  Right, so we're waiting on the air traffic control regulations  these things, right, so they are not running into each other as they drop  of your paper towels on your front door.  I don't know, is that the goal?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just can't get my head around this how they would execute  this, particularly in a crowded urban area. I don't understand - and  growing up in a very rural area, that wouldn't make sense either.  I don't  under - I don't' get it.</p><p>SMITH:  What do you think, Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  There's a lot of suburb in the middle, and it looks like the  FAA is moving towards allowing more and more of this, according to our story today  on this, the FAA, it has issued already 2,000 approvals for testing and use  of drones and  commercial settings in different ways.  What do I think of  it?  I think it's great.  I think it's economic progress.  It's an example  of companies finding new ways to become more efficient.</p><p>SMITH:  And it's exciting.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  As creepy as it might feel -</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because -</p><p>CASONE:  No, it's dangerous.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It just feels, with the volume of packages that some of these  businesses ship, I don't understand how they would actually execute it.  </p><p>(Cross talk)</p><p>CASONE:  This is the war that's brewing though, between pilots, between the  FAA, the air traffic controllers and the companies.  I mean, it's a great  business idea -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The FAA can't keep up as technology develops.</p><p>CASONE:  -- but you already have pilots saying, Dagen, that they're seeing  these drones and that they are - the minute one goes into an engine this  whole story changes. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But those are recreational drones that they've had the biggest  problem --</p><p>CASONE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- which now the FAA is requiring to be registered.  A  commercial drone would be less of a threat.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Dagen, when you look at a company like amazon or Wal-Mart, they have vast logistic organizations, --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- their job is to figure out how to make these things work at  a lower cost than how to deal with -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't want my skies filled with these.</p><p>SMITH:  So just to Dagen's point, they're going to test this out in small  residential neighborhoods first, that's according to the Wal-Mart, --</p><p>HILSENRATH:   Well they're also going to test it out in parking lots.</p><p>SMITH:  -- and they're going to get permission from those living in the  flight path, from the truck to the homes in that area.  So it's complicated  but it sounds like they --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, test them in parking lots because I'm too lazy to get out  of my car and go into the Wal-Mart.</p><p>SMITH:  I am.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  This is progress.</p><p>SMITH:  We have to go.  Jon Hilsenrath says this is economic progress.   We'll keep watching it.  Coming up, investors waiting for the Federal  Reserve's first rate hike in nearly a decade.  I know somebody we can talk  to about that.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH:  We'll show you why you will not need to worry about that.  We're  keeping it simple for you right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: All right, welcome back.  Let's get a quick check on markets this  morning. Futures right  now pointing to a selloff on Wall Street, a small one.  We  are looking a small fraction of percentage losses across the board there.  </p><p>One hot topic investors are watching this week is the Federal Reserve.  The  central Bank on the verge of raising interest rates for the first time in years,  but Jon Hilsenrath is here and he says consumers have nothing to fear  because mortgage rates will stay low for quite some time.  So you need to  break this down for us and keep it simple.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right, so we are paying a lot of attention what the Fed is  going to do.  I have written a million stories about it this year, but the  bottom line is for two reasons interest rates are going to stay low even  after the Fed starts raising them.  First of all, the U.S. economy and  global economy are still fairy weak.  They are not going gang busters, and  in an environment like that, the Fed can't raise interest a lot.  They  might push them a little bit but not moving very fast.  The other thing is  that the Fed has telegraphed, they've already told us that they don't  expect to raise aggressively after they do this first move, because  inflation is also very low.  So we are going into a period where once we  get this first move off the Fed's table, there's going to be a very slow  progression of follow-up interest rate increases.</p><p>If you look back to the 2004-2006 period, the last time Fed raised interest  rates, we actually didn't see much movement in mortgage rates.  In fact, we  got a housing boom while the fed was raising rates.</p><p>SMITH: I was going to say, so that first interest rate hike, might it take  some that are on the sidelines, might it bring in some of that pent up  demand, where they're going to fear interest rates going higher so they'll  jump in on the first hike?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I don't think it's going to be fear.  I think what's going to  happen is that when the Fed does this, people are going to say, hey, the  world didn't end.  I can get on with my life.  I can go out and refinance  my mortgage or take out a mortgage for a home -- particularly in the  markets, you know.  I think the markets are going to realize that the world  didn't end when the feds does this and they're going to get on with the  party.</p><p>SMITH:  It's a good time to refinance right now?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  You should refinance when it's right for you.  If it's an  opportunity now, you should go ahead and do it.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, Jon Hilsenrath, thank you for keeping it simple.  We  will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Sandra Smith, Maria Bartiromo is off  this morning.  It is Tuesday, October 27, and with me this hour fox   Business', Dagen McDowell, and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He said I was cranky this morning.</p><p>SMITH:  He did?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He did.  He's like, what's wrong with you?  You're cranky.  I  said, no, I'm just disagreeing with you.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  She's hating on drones.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I disagreed with you, there's a difference.</p><p>SMITH:  Who said Tuesdays aren't fun?  All right, these are your top  stories at 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news:  a debt deal on Capitol Hill.  Congressional leaders and the  White House reaching an agreement on a two year budget deal that also  extends the debt limit.  This marks one of the final acts for House  Speaker, John Boehner, who is set to leave office Friday.</p><p>Turning to the 2016 race, Donald Trump losing more ground to Ben Carson in  Iowa.  The latest university poll shows Ben Carson has a double digit lead  over Donald Trump, 32 percent to 18 percent.  This coming as Trump made  another round of controversial comments especially on women wearing a  burkas. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE-REPUBLICAN: It is easy.  You  don't have to put on makeup.  Look how beautiful everyone looks.  Isn't  that easy?  I tell you, if I was a woman I would.  I am ready, darling.   Let's go.  It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH:  It will be a busy, busy day for earnings and economic data.   Walmart taking a page out of Amazon's playbook.

Alibaba scheduled to report earnings before the bell.  Apple and Twitter  are said to release results after the bell.  We will also get September's  Durable Goods orders which are expected to drop 1.2 percent as well as look  at the housing market.  Case-Shiller home price index will be out.  Joining  us to break all this down is Vining Sparks' Chief Economist Craig Dismuke.   Welcome to you, Craig.  </p><p>CRAIG DISMUKE, VINING SPARKS CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Good morning.</p><p>SMITH:  Alright, so, what are we looking for this morning?  What is hot on  your agenda? </p><p>DISMUKE:  There are important reports, but right now everything is  secondary to the inflation data.  That is the real big elephant in a room  kind of thing.  Especially, with Fed policy and what is the Fed going to  do.  But in the durable-goods report, I expect we will see headline level  orders expected to be down because of aircraft.  Below that at the core  level they're expected to be flat.  What is most important will be the  Capital goods orders report and specifically not a month over month basis  because you get a little of noise on quarter over quarter basis.  Orders  have been pretty good.  They're up 9.75 percent.  That is their tracking  for the quarter.  Pointing for business investment being stronger in the  future so that is good news.  It's a good sign a business investment is  stronger.  If you look at the shipment of those items, they're up 2.75  percent quarter over quarter which point to business investment being of  2.75. </p><p>SMITH:  Well, you obviously looked at these numbers closely.  Much closer  than any of us.  Broadly speaking, where are we as far as economic progress  in this recovery?  Are we strengthening?  And if we are, how slow or fast  is it? </p><p>DISMUKE:  I don't think we are strengthening.  And John's point earlier, he  mentioned the consumer is so key right now.  This has been about the  consumer driving economic growth and there have been phases to this  recovery/expansion where different parts of the economy are driving  activity.  Right now, business investment has been weak, so it's down  almost 5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.  It was flat in the  second quarter of this year.  </p><p>Business investment has been up and down but overall, it's been weak.  It  is good news that business investment is a little bit better.  That's  positive.  But at the end of the day, the consumer is what is key and it is  an important report but I think it's secondary to what is happening with  the consumer and then again with inflation. </p><p>JOHN HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Craig, I need you to settle a  friendly disagreement between Dagen and me here about the housing market.   We're getting home price data coming up.  I say the housing market is  strong and getting stronger.  And she says it is garbage outside a few  metro areas.  What is your verdict and what are we going to see in the home  price data that come out later today?  Did I characterize your point of  view?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST:  Yes.  And you used the word  garbage (inaudible).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DISMUKE:  It is home prices have been fairly strong, very little inventory.   There's construction costs going up.  Labor costs going up a little bit in  housing.  Lumber prices are down.  Prices are generally going up.  It is  very -- the housing data is enigmatic right now.  We are getting some weak  data.  Existing home sales better than expected last month.  New home sales  down 11.5 percent.</p><p>We keep getting this up and down activity.  So, I would say in general  housing market is trending better.  But, there is that challenge and the  challenge is if you look at 2013 when mortgage rates rose 90 basis points,  housing total sales fell 13 percent.  So, that was unusual.  To see that  drop from a 90 basis point increase.  So, you look at what is different in  the housing market today than in previous cycles.  The biggest difference  today is when you look at the number of owner occupied units which are down  $2 million in 2005 and rent occupied units which are $10 million since  2006.  Which is not good because people who rent cars don't wash them.  I  have never washed one.</p><p>Some people who rent houses or rent multifamily places aren't going to make  a capital investment where they are living that we had when we had more of  an ownership society so long term as a challenge. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  We saw in the Glass-Steagall people over invested in those  homes and wasted capital in the process.  And a lot of other countries you  don't have as much emphasis on home ownership.  And they have perfectly  civil society. </p><p>DISMUKE:  Sure, but their economic growth is not as strong as we saw when  we had more of a homeownership society.  When you own something you take  more pride in it and you're going to invest in it.  And so, I think, in  long-term it will be a different housing market.  The peak housing was 6.2  percent.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Also, demographics at play here. </p><p>DISMUKE:  That's a big one.  The aging population is a demographic issue.  It doesn't get enough focus at this point. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like buying homes and selling it though. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I don't think seniors are going to start trashing their homes.   It's a different dynamic. </p><p>SMITH:  Almost like those houses are maintained to higher standard because  they are turned over so often and have to be maintained.  That is the  discussion for another day.  Craig, great stuff.  Thank you.  Interesting  perspective.  John, you win.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  John just leaned in and said I was right</p><p>SMITH:  Alright.  JP Morgan with its own mobile payment platform to rival  existing services like Apple Paid.  Nicole Petallides has that story this  morning.  Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST:  That's right.  The country's  largest bank is stepping into the ring with the world's most valuable  company.  JP Morgan is the latest investor in the mobile payments based  announcing Chase Pay, a platform that will allow Chase customers to make  retail purchases using their smart phone.  Creating a direct competitor to  Apple Pay.  JP Morgan says it has already won the endorsement of a major  group of merchants giving it a leg up on the tech savvy rivals.  So, the  question is are consumers ready to use their phones, smart phones, ditch  the credit cards and what happened to cash is king? </p><p>SMITH:  Anybody use Apple Pay? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have signed up for it but I don't know how to use it in  stores. </p><p>PETALLIDES:  Using your smart phone will be the preferred method of  payment.  I mean, I just got used to using my debit card in the taxi.  Just  got out of using cash.  This is the wave of the future and there is Apple  Pay, Chase Pay credit cards.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  A total shift back to cash because everyone is afraid of the paper  trail using credit cards and people accessing their data and  now, we're  going to be even more exposed with all this going on to our smart phones. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  There isn't going to be.  We see where it is going.  People  moving more towards mobile payments.  And cash.  I could go weeks without  using my cash. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's why I use a credit card over cash and smart phones.   Because I use cash.  If I have more than $20, I will drop it and lose it.  HILSENRATH:  I call it bonus bucks when I discover cash. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If I lose it, it usually comes back.  I have a tendency to drop  it.  And with a credit card I keep one credit card in my pocket. </p><p>SMITH:  You guys must not be good tippers.  How can you go through New York  City without a few bucks in your pocket?  Not that kind.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You add the tip.  You don't have to worry about signing a form. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  This is just to bring it back to drones.  This is like drones.   This is progress when we see new ways of making payments. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I fully believe (inaudible)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETALLIDES:  Be honest here.  It's unbelievable.  This is the wave of the  future.  Kids staying with babysitters and nannies demand it.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  Alright.  Don't forget to start your day with Nicole Petallides on  FBN: a.m. at 5:00 a.m. eastern.  Catch it on the Fox Business Network.  Up  next.  Is there a link between artificial turf and cancer?  </p><p>We'll look at a new report that could cause major concerns in the world of  sports.  A lot of people have been talking about this.  Keep it right here  on Fox Business.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  Dreamworks Animation's CEO thanking Elon Musk for saving his life.   Cheryl Casone has that story. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST:  Jeffrey Katzenberg is crediting  Elon Musk with his survival after a life-threatening car accident in  Hollywood on October 19th.  Dreamworks Animation's CEO drove an electric  Tesla model X Sedan.  His car was totaled.  He needed surgery after  injuring his arm and wrist in the accident but he credits his life-saving  experience and crash, thanks to Tesla.</p><p>Our sources say Bill De Blasio is getting to endorse Hillary Clinton before  his planned candidate forum on November 6th.  Discussions are reportedly  under way between the two sides and how Bill De Blasio backing Clinton will  be announced.  </p><p>And according to a recent survey, 49 percent of streaming on demand users  ages 8 to 29 share at least one account with someone outside of their home. </p><p>HBO and other video providers might not encourage password sharing, but  they also don't track it.  And we know it happens all the time.  You give  your log information to a friend of a friend or your parents, your neighbor  and they use the service.  They can't track it.  This proliferates. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So, how is that different from me leaving my newspaper at the  airport and someone picking it up and reading it?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's one newspaper.  Not thousands of movies. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But you're only sharing a password with one friend.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How much revenue if they get shared around a lot more.  Netflix,  they have subscriptions where you get the family plan or two log ins.  </p><p>CASONE:  This really hurts HBO and Showtime and HULU.  And they don't have  a way to know your giving your password to whether people.  For all they  know you have the computer going in one room and your TV going and it is  you.  The same as if you have a wall street journal log on and share it  with somebody.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HILSENRATH:  You will always get leakage and you have to live with it.  To  the extent that it makes your friend or your relative that much more  interested than your Hulu (inaudible)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Leakage in the digital world is much greater than in the paper  world. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It has always been there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's always been there, but Sandra.  She is about to lose her  stuff. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SMITH:  Thanks Dagen.</p><p>CASONE:  All fair point. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  I don't share my password with anyone.  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The word retailers use to describe the thievery or shoplifting.  </p><p>SMITH:  Alright.  Athletes and parents beware the artificial turf at  thousands of schools and parks around the country could be dangerous.  The  New York Times did this story a year ago.  A lot of people still talking  about it and surprised by it.  Find out what is behind the latest health  scare on this turf.  Straight ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Top headlines in the Wall Street Journal.  After years of  decline, U.S. imports on the rise as low oil prices forced domestic  producers to scale back supplies.  Phil Flynn and the CME group.  So, Phil,  long story short, we are not producing as much here so we are having to buy  it there and bring it in. Is that what is happening? </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, CME GROUP:  Well, that's exactly what is happening and we are  losing the OPECSaudi Arabia started.  What we are seeing is these other  OPEC oil producers, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia are cutting prices, driving our  guys out of business.  This is what Saudi rate wanted to do.  Can they  sustain this price war?  We know they are having big financial problems in  these countries. </p><p>They can't continue to cut prices below our producers.  The quality of the  oil they are getting.  Our refiners are used to refining Saudi oil and  Nigerian oil.  The shale oil is a little more difficult for them to refine  because it is such a high-quality type of oil.  They are not used to doing  it, better off to export. </p><p>The other big story, natural gas, lowest price in three years.  We broke  below $2, 1 million metric BTUs.  Winter might have been canceled because  warm weather forecasts driving prices lower. </p><p>SMITH:  This is part of the deal that was reached late last night.  U.S. is  planning to sell millions of barrels of crude oil from our strategic  petroleum reserve from 2018 through 2025 under the budget deal reached last  night.  This is the second time the U.S. has raised cash from the reserve.   Notable event? </p><p>FLYNN:  It is a very notable event.  It's basically showing we don't need  the strategic petroleum reserve.  We have a new reserve called North  Dakota.  The global energy market is changing.  The other thing when you  look at selling oil from the reserve, from the policy when we were worried  about peak oil and the Middle East cutting off power supply. Now they're  burying us with supplies. </p><p>SMITH:  And the report shows a link with green artificial turf and cancer.   Questions have been raised about synthetic fiber and scrap tire that makes  up the surface.  There's the belief that the tiny black rubber crimson the  surface which have been known to contain carcinogens and chemicals can make  people sick.  However, there is no scientific data to prove the connection  between the two.  Okay, John.  Your son plays football and lacrosse on  turf. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Plays on turf all the time.  My two sons and my daughter play  on turf all the time.  Frankly, there are a lot of other things that happen  on those fields I worry about a lot more.  When there's no scientific  evidence to back it up.  You worry about concussions and other injuries.  I  want to see some hard evidence before I put this on the list of things to  worry about. </p><p>SMITH:  We were living on asphalt green, so fun to play on it but it made  you think all the little black or brown pellets in the turf.  You get up  and it's all over you.  Amazing.  It gets in their mouths, makes you  wonder. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have bruises, doing a workout in the last few days.  I think  maybe you ought to worry about feeding your kids bacon and hot dogs if you  are worried about cancer before you worry about artificial turf.  Based on  the Wall Street Journal today.  That is the big deal. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Red meat tied to cancer.  Pay a little more attention because  there is -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  Most of these reports is more correlation than causation. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  The health organizations study is more scientific and I  haven't looked at it but I would think they're close it to causation and  correlation.  The other problem here is every couple of weeks there is a  news story telling us you need to worry about this or that.  Americans are  over worried with worried lists. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You ought to worry.  Women getting lung cancer who never smoked  is on the rise.  Even as the numbers of people who are not smoking in this  country are declining.  And yet, they have to figure out what it is called. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But, you can stop doing everything.  You got to figure out  what is causing it and respond to that.  You can't stop going on artificial  turf. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  Russell investments Steven Wood joins us to weigh in on a big day  of tech earnings.  Plus, former treasury secretary David Malpass with his  thoughts on a potential budget deal.  We have a great couple hours coming  up.  Stay tuned. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  Sandra Smith in for Maria Bartiroma.  With me is Fox Business's  Dagen McDowell and Wall Street Journal Chief Economic Correspondent Jon  Hilsenrath.  But, first your top stories breaking news.  A debt deal on  Capitol Hill and congressional leaders reaching an agreement on a two- year  budget deal that also extends the debt limit.  But it could be problematic  for his likely replacement congressional Congressman Paul Ryan over  concerns from conservatives who will not support raising the debt limit. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DARRELL ISSA, CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN-REPUBLICAN:  We are about the  transition to a new speaker.  It is important that we have the speaker to  be Ryan, what leadership role.  It was the combination of the majority but  you need to to have the new speaker in the lead in this process. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: Donald Trump making more controversial comments on women.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

And it gets even more expensive when the  teams face off in New York next Wednesday - or, sorry, on Wednesday. That  price is surely to be steeper than that.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, Donald Trump losing considerable ground in Iowa  while making more controversial comments in a New Hampshire town hall  meeting. Blake Burman has the latest from Washington for us this morning. </p><p>Blake, good morning.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Sandra. Good morning to you.</p><p>Donald Trump still holds commanding leads nationally and in a couple of the  early voting states, but there's a growing trend in Iowa according to the  polls taken there over the last week. Dr. Ben Carson has supplanted Trump  in the first caucus state. Carson has won four of the last five polls, as  you can see here, with the fifth being a tie. They are all fairly sizable  spreads, with the most recent from Monmouth University showing Carson with  a 14 point lead. </p><p>In the meantime, Trump is facing some scrutiny now for a couple of comments  he made yesterday in New Hampshire. In one of them, Trump said it's easy  for women to wear burkas because they don't have to wear makeup. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In fact, it's easier. You don't  have to put on make-up. Look how beautiful everyone looks. Wouldn't it be  easier? Wha (ph). Right? Wouldn't that be easy? I'll tell you, if I was a  woman, I don't want to - wha, I'm ready, darling, let's go. It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: And, separately, Trump also took credit for Ford's decision to halt  truck production plans in Mexico and stay in Ohio. However, Sandra, that  was strongly disputed by both Ford and the Ohio Governor and Presidential  Candidate John Kasich. </p><p>Back to you.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Blake, thank you. </p><p>BURMAN: Thanks.</p><p>SMITH: Dagen, we're going to ask you for your comments on Trump's comments,  about women in burkas and -</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Where did he - where was he giving that  speech? Checky's (ph) Shack (ph) down in Boca Raton. Hey, I'll be here all  week, try the veal. That's what it was like. That's - it's not president  but I don't think anybody who's a fan of his really cares, do they?</p><p>SMITH: Well, it's interesting because here we're talking about how Dr.  Carson in now - he's now won three of the last four major polls in Iowa  and, Jon, one of the biggest demographics that he is successful with right  now and gaining ground with is women.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, you know, I think -  listening to Trump there, I think he really runs the risk of wearing out  his welcome. I mean like you say, Dagen, this - he sounds like a bad stand- up comedian. Is that really what we want for the presidency? As far as  Carson goes, you have to wonder, I mean America doesn't really know him.  You have to wonder what kind of staying power he's going to have as people  get to know him a little bit better. </p><p>SMITH: Well, the race is surely changing. Ted Cruz gaining some steam, as  you pointed out last hour. Marco Rubio at 10 percent. Is the playing field  changing? </p><p>HILSENRATH: It does look like - I think it is changing. I think you see  people like Cruz coming up and you have to keep an eye on him. As - as - as  -</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Carly is - Carly Fiorina has kind of lost her appeal to  voters out -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes, that's - I was wondering about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That she had that incredible debate performance but she's kind of  receded a little bit and I wonder what it would take to move her back up.</p><p>HILSENRATH: You have to wonder is, these Fox Business debates come up in a  couple weeks, if that's going to be a stage for her to reassert herself,  because that's going to be all of that business in the economy. </p><p>SMITH: Well, a GOP debate tomorrow night as well on the economy.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>SMITH: So that would be an opportunity, obviously, for her to shine. We'll  see if that happens. But, yes, Carly Fiorina not on the top five in that  most recent poll. So, all right, guys, thank you.</p><p>Big day for tech earnings with Apple and Twitter set to release quarterly  numbers after today's close. Jo Ling Kent is here and joins us on set.  She's talking Ali Baba. </p><p>JO LING KENT: Yes. We are seeing some big mobile revenue jumps, which is  always good news for an ecommerce company. A huge earnings day. Ali Baba  beat on the top and bottom just a few minutes ago. Revenue came in at $3.49  billion, beating that $3.35 billion the street was looking for. Plus, EPS  of $0.57 a share, beating that expected $0.54 estimate. Gross merchandize  volume was up 28 percent, revenue was up 32 percent, so some very big moves  there for Ali Baba, especially as they go into singles day, their biggest  sales day of the year, which comes up in November. </p><p>And T-Mobile earnings out later this hour. Expectations of $8.28 billion in  revenue with $0.30 on EPS. </p><p>Ford also just out moments ago posting mixed results, $38.1 billion in  revenue. That's a beat of the $35.07 billion the street was looking for.  But adjusted EPS coming in just shy at $0.45, of that $0.46 estimate. </p><p>And then after the bell today, two big name in tech, of course. Apple's  fiscal fourth quarter expected to post revenue of $1.11 billion with $1.88  in EPS. And the pressure really is on here for iPhone sales, Apple Watch,  also looking at China as that slows down, if they're able to sustain  momentum there. </p><p>And we're also going to be watching Twitter as well. This is the first  earnings report since Jack Dorsey was named the permanent CEO. EPS expected  of $0.05 a share. Revenue expected at $560 million. Now, that one is all  about monthly active user growth plus these new products. Twitter Moments,  is it resonating? Our users actually picking up and changing their behavior  and sticking around on Twitter?</p><p>SMITH: So do you expect some good news for - for Twitter then?</p><p>KENT: It could be better but it may not get better for a while in terms of  permanent growth in the positive direction. Jack Dorsey has a lot of work  to do, even though everyone's pretty glad that he's back. </p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I will say the delivery of ads on Instagram is top notch compared  to all other social media applications. </p><p>KENT: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But this - so targeted. Interesting ads, video -</p><p>KENT: Seamless.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Seamless. And -</p><p>KENT: And you've seen that in FaceBook earnings, too, it's really working. </p><p>SMITH: Right. He's - he's sitting right next to me. I want to bring him in.  Russell Investments chief market strategist Stephen Wood. </p><p>What do you expect out of these big tech giant, Apple, Twitter, optimism? </p><p>STEPHEN WOOD, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS: I think so. I think there's going to be  a bright spot in earnings in the Q3 and it's not going to come from much of  the S&amp;P 500. So I think where we're going to get firmer earnings is going  to be in tech. I think we need to look at Apple and kind of back that out.  I can't comment on a specific company, when will you back out Apple  earnings. I think it's going to be a challenged third quarter and one of  the - the less dim spots is going to be in tech. </p><p>SMITH: Less dim spot is going to be in tech. OK. So you kind of, sort of  like technology I guess at this point. </p><p>WOOD: Yes. Yes. And as -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Steve -</p><p>WOOD: Yes, sir.</p><p>HILSENRATH: What are you getting from the conference calls that you're  listening in on? We had a story in the paper yesterday that pointed to  dimming expectations among CEOs for the outlook for growth in the U.S. and  overseas. Are you picking up on any of that yourself? </p><p>WOOD: I think we are. We - it's - well, this has been a top line challenge  environment for a long time. Companies have been pretty good at hitting  their earnings numbers for a large number of quarters, you know, pushing  half a decade, but we really haven't seen any movement in revenue and sales  and I think that's really starting to push into the front quarter. But I  think what - one of the bigger stories is going to be what happens in  December with the Fed and our job is not to be like a total nerd fest here  talking about the Fed. </p><p>SMITH: Yes. </p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, actually, that is what his job is -</p><p>WOOD: I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is (INAUDIBLE) Fed nerd. </p><p>KENT: I like it.</p><p>WOOD: Fed nerd. And I'm with you. No -</p><p>SMITH: I just tweeted out, hash tag nerds on set with us.</p><p>WOOD: Nerds on set.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>WOOD: Book-ended by nerds here. But I think the oil story, which has really  challenged not only debt and equity space for the first week quarters as we  go into 2016, some of the benefits from oil come into the economy and I  think that's going to be a little bit of a lift. </p><p>SMITH: Do you think we're going to see it?</p><p>WOOD: I think so. Well, if you're an energy company, you've got to  recognize all those losses in the first and second quarter. But if you're a  consumer, you're not going to buy 12 months of gasoline in the first week  of January. It takes you 12 months to pay 12 electric bills, to pay 12  energy bills. So I think as we move into this quarter, the fourth quarter,  and the first quarter of next year, you begin to see some modest  improvement based upon the drop in energy prices. </p><p>HILSENRATH: I thought Jo - so Jo Ling just reported all these earnings  numbers. What - what you reported, the one that I found most interesting  was Ford's top line. That Ford beat expectations on its revenue growth.</p><p>KENT: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We have a car sales boom going on in this country right now.</p><p>WOOD: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: People are - they - they haven't recognized it.</p><p>WOOD: Unreported, yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But - well, actually, we had a front-page story about it before  the last Fed meeting. But I think that's an example of consumers finally  starting to kick in and driving growth. It will be interesting to see what  the other automakers have.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>WOOD: And that's an interesting - if you look at China too, the consumer  story, the industrial story is well known in China, but the consumer story,  and it's positive in China is probably less well covered, and I think you  get some of that effect in the United States as well. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, speaking of -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Do you really believe that they're making that transition in  China or -</p><p>WOOD: No, I do believe that they're making that transition. No matter what,  they will make that transition. That's a government policy - </p><p>KENT: But do you believe the numbers behind that transition right now?</p><p>WOOD: I think believe in numbers is a strong statement.</p><p>KENT: OK.</p><p>WOOD: Coming out of China.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So are you buying emerging markets? Are you buying China?</p><p>WOOD: I would not say buying Chinese right now. I think that the - the  Chinese government is going to transition from that export-oriented, more  consumers based economy and that is going to create challenges and  commodity based emerging market. So it might be a little bit early on  emerging market, but valuations are starting to look attractive. They're  beginning to bottom out in the cycle. We know that China's a 7 percent, 6.5  percent grower. That's going to happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can I -</p><p>WOOD: And the question is, whether it is priced in, in emerging markets. </p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm trying to promote Jon's story, because he's got a story on  the front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today, and the central issue  this week and this year will be the Federal Reserve. And I read every word  in your story and it was - it basically shows a Fed that's a mess. </p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, Janet Yellen has a hard job on her hands on two fronts.  One is that the economy is hard to read right now. You would expect  inflation to be kicking in with unemployment coming down and it hasn't  been. So she's got a hard decision to make on the economy. A harder  decision - or a harder job is getting her 16 colleagues to agree with her.  And as we lay out in this story, there's just a lot of people with  different opinions. </p><p>SMITH: All right, Jon, thank you. </p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll tell people to read it because it's great.</p><p>SMITH: And Stephen Wood, thank you. And Jo Ling Kent, thank you.</p><p>WOOD: Thank you.</p><p>KENT: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: We've got Walmart's new delivery service coming up next, about to  lift off, putting the retail giant in the same new space has Amazon. And,  by the way, a new poll out putting Dr. Carson at the top of the GOP  candidates nationally. We're going to talk about that as well. </p><p>First, here are a few of the top headlines that we're watching in \"The Wall  Street Journal\" this morning, including BP profit falling on weaker oil  prices. Health insurance premiums set to climb in 2016. And that NASA  spacecraft set for historic fly-by of one of Saturn's moons. We're coming  right back. Stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: All right, we've got some new poll numbers just out giving Ben  Carson a national lead. Cheryl Casone has this story and more. </p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Sandra, good morning.</p><p>Ben Carson edging Donald Trump in a national poll for the first time. The  latest CBS/\"New York Times\" poll gives Carson a four point lead over Trump,  holding 26 percent of the vote. But, by the way, Iowa, we've been seeing  Mr. Carson leading in Iowa. So big news, big news on this national scale  today. </p><p>We've also got this for you. Another headache for the fantasy sports world.  Legislation to regulate daily fantasy sports is expected to be introduced  in Illinois today. This bill aims to protect consumers from draining -  quote, \"draining their bank accounts,\" as well as make sure they have a  legitimate shot at winning on these sites. </p><p>And finally the battle of the drones heating up, this time with Walmart.  The retailer applying for permission to test drones for home delivery,  curbside pickup, checking warehouse inventories and this could be a sign  that the retailer plans to go head to head with Amazon. Amazon's been very  vocal, Sandra, obviously, about trying to get drones into the skies for  delivery service and things. </p><p>Here's my question, do you want groceries delivered at your home via drone?  Are you OK with that, comfortable with that? </p><p>SMITH: No. </p><p>CASONE: No? Interesting. Wow.</p><p>Well, Dagen, I know you -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I - I think that there are some credible applications for  drones, law enforcement -</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You surveying land, even, you know, firefighting. But I just - I  can't picture mass execution of drone delivery. </p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, so you talk about law enforcement. I think drones have a  bad name because we've been using them for the last decade to shoot people  from the sky. And - but you have to look at how this technology could get  applied commercially. And if Amazon and Walmart think they can do it for  logistics purposes, then more power to them. Let them try it. </p><p>CASONE: Let me ask you something, though. What happens when a drone that's  delivering a package at 2 Cedar Street in Iowa hits a small child on a bike  and there's a massive lawsuit. It - you know what I mean, like if you're  Amazon or you're Walmart, they've got - their lawyers have to be thinking  about this kind -</p><p>SMITH: Wait, wait, wait, wait but a FedEx truck could do the same thing.</p><p>CASONE: It could.</p><p>SMITH: Or a Walmart truck could do the same thing. So I don't know if  that's -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Exactly.</p><p>CASONE: But drones make me - like I said earlier, drones make me so much  more nervous. </p><p>SMITH: But, wait, did you just say that they're considering the drones for  curbside pickup? </p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: Because I'm thinking that sounds even funnier.</p><p>CASONE: And (ph) delivery.</p><p>SMITH: Like you drive up to the store and a drone flies out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because I'm too lazy to get out of my car and actually go - go  into the store. </p><p>SMITH: Fly out (ph).</p><p>HILSENRATH: But we - but we are. That's right. We have - that's why drive- through exists.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm not. I'm not.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But we - most Americans are. There would not be a thriving  drive-through, you know, fast-food industry if we weren't all -</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, I love getting out of my car and going in the McD's and  socializing. </p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, now you can just -</p><p>SMITH: What are you -</p><p>HILSENRATH: Now you can just pull into the McD's parking lot and your Big  Mac will come to you.</p><p>SMITH: Cheryl, good stuff. Thank you.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: All right, after years of decline, U.S. imports of foreign oil are  on the rise in the U.S. What does this mean for dropping gasoline prices  here at home? We'll head to the CME for an answer, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: A top headline in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning. After  years of decline, U.S. imports are on the rise. This as low oil prices  force domestic producers to scale back supply. </p><p>Phil Flynn is at the CME Group in Chicago. </p><p>Will this push our crude oil prices higher, Phil? </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, CME GROUP: Well, right now they're pushing them lower. You  know, it's put a lot of pressure on the market. You know, we're seeing  these imports rise at a time when usually we see imports start to fall a  little bit towards the end of the year. This is adding to the oil glut in  the Gulf of Mexico where all that oil is. And it's also a sign that the  U.S. oil producers are really losing the production war with the OPEC  producers. Their production continues to stay strong, ours continue to  fall. So this isn't really good news for the U.S. energy producer. </p><p>SMITH: All right. So, hey, by the way, we're looking at $43 for a barrel of  crude.</p><p>FLYNN: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: What's the - what's consensus right now? What's - I mean the trend,  obviously, as we look at a one week chart, has been down, Phil. But what  are we looking at as far as price movement. </p><p>FLYNN: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: I know you watch the trend, the overall trend. </p><p>FLYNN: Right. Well, the mood is definitely negative, you know, and it's  across the entire commodity complex. There's a lot of concern in the heart  (ph) (INAUDIBLE) season. We're going to see that glut continue to build.  You know, last week, you know, refinery runs were continuing to be below 90  percent as refiners are in maintenance (ph). So the demand for oil just  isn't very strong. Now the good news is for gasoline prices, they have  fallen 17 days in a row according to AAA.</p><p>SMITH: Wow.</p><p>FLYNN: The national average at $2.20. So if you want the bright side of the  story, if you're not an oil producer, if you're a driver, you've got to  love these prices. </p><p>SMITH: Well, Dagan, that would normally be the bright side of the story  because that would mean that we could see a jump in consumer spending.  That's extra cash in the pocket of the American consumer. But that hasn't  happened yet, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It has happened somewhat. You wouldn't have record - a record  holiday season at Amazon if it wasn't at least I think on the margins  helping. And throughout the entire summer, you saw increases in small but  nevertheless increases in consumer spending. </p><p>SMITH: To the economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I mean I don't -</p><p>HILSENRATH: And a boom - and a boom in car sales.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I - helped by extremely low interest rates for sure. </p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But there's a major auto boom going on and that - a lot of that  has to do with the - the low energy prices.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But these - you know, these falling gasoline prices are  happening at a great time because it's - it's happening going into the  holiday shopping season. </p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So maybe we're going to see it this year.</p><p>SMITH: FedEx just reported yesterday, they expect record shipments. So at  the same time they're expecting record shipments, up 12 percent they're  saying year over year for this holiday season, they're also paying a heck  of a lot more for the gasoline to get those boxes to the door. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Is Phil still standing there? I have a question for him.</p><p>SMITH: He is. Phil.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hey, Phil.</p><p>FLYNN: Yes. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In terms of the production - any production pullback here in the  United States with the frackers, is that destroyed forever or can they ramp  production up assuming that these companies are healthy financially? </p><p>FLYNN: I think that - I think your final statement is the most important  thing, how financially viable are these companies? In a perfect world, yes,  they could turn the - turn it on very quickly. The problem is, where are  they going to get the capital? A lot of these small - smaller fracking  firms just don't have the capital to produce, so they're under a lot of  pressure. </p><p>You know, the first time prices went up, we saw rig counts come back up.  That's not going to happen again because the capital isn't going to be  there.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But, Phil, I thought the private equity guys are standing on  the sidelines ready to jump in because prices are so low and feed capital  into the industry if it looks like there's a demand pickup. </p><p>FLYNN: Well, I think there was definitely money on the sidelines it's going  to (INAUDIBLE) on the street. That doesn't mean it's going to, you know,  save the entire industry. But there was another story that was really  interest as well, is that China, one of the big real estate people in  China, is buying up all the Texas oil fields. </p><p>SMITH: All right, Phil Flynn, always love having you. Thank you.</p><p>FLYNN: Thank you.</p><p>SMITH: Coming up, two D.C. outsider saying exactly what's on their minds  despite the repercussions. Is the same brash style that's suddenly hurting  Trump helping Carson? Have you seen the new national poll? That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH: Good morning. I'm Sandra Smith. Maria Bartiromo is off this morning.  It is Tuesday, October 27th. And with me this hour, Fox Business' Dagen  McDowell and \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Jon Hilsenrath. </p><p>Here are your top stories at 6:30 a.m., sorry, 7:30 a.m. Wow, time is  flying when you're having fun </p><p>Donald Trump falling to second place now in a new national poll. It's the  first time that we've seen him in this position. The latest CBS News/\"New  York Times\" poll showing Ben Carson has the lead with 26 percent support.  He has a four-point lead now over Trump, who has 22 percent. The rest of  the field lagging far behind in the single digits. This after Trump's  latest controversial comments on women, makeup and burqas. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: In fact, it's easier. You don't have to put up makeup. Look how  beautiful everyone looks. Wouldn't it be easier - wha - right, Wouldn't  that be easy? I'll tell you, if I was a woman, I don't want to - wha, I'm  ready, darling, let's go. It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH:  All right, breaking overnight:  a debt deal -- we will get go that  in a second.  A debt deal on Capitol Hill.  Congressional leaders and the  White House reaching an agreement on a two year budget deal that also  extends the debt limit.  This marks one of the final acts for House  Speaker, John Boehner, who is set to leave office on Friday.</p><p>And a quick look at those markets this morning; not a lot of movement, as  my father always used to say, sharply unchanged.  It's been a busy day for  earnings and we've got economic data on tap later this morning.  Futures  right now are edging lower.  Dow Futures off 17 points, indicating a slight  selloff on the open.</p><p>Wal-Mart taking a page out of amazon's playbook.  The retail giant wants to  use drones to make deliveries to your front door.  The company filing for  regulatory approval.  Wal-Mart also looking to use devices to check  warehouse inventories and curbside pickup.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Flacco back; pressure on to the middle, again, for Gilmore.   And it is secured and intercepted by Tony Jefferson.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH:  Now that was a catch.  The Baltimore Ravens missing a chance to tie  up the game on final play against the Arizona Cardinals.  Ravens  quarterback, Joe Flacco, intercepted in the end zone and Arizona won that  game, 26-18.</p><p>And it is a big night for baseball; the World Series getting under way  tonight in Kansas City.  First pitch 8:00 pm Eastern on Fox.</p><p>And, one retailer is going dark on Black Friday, a reversal of recent  trends.  REI, the outdoor gear company and sporting goods company, is  cancelling deals for the day and shutting down all of its stores, sending  its employees home.  Instead, the company wants the shoppers to spend that  time outside it says.</p><p>Dr. Ben Carson, here it is, capturing the lead in this new national poll,  for the first time over Donald Trump.  The latest CBS News/\"New York Times\"  poll showing Carson has the lead now with 26-percent support.  He has a 4- point lead over Trump.  Joining me now is Nkama -- </p><p>DAVID MALPASS, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, ENCIMA GLOBAL:  Encima.</p><p>SMITH:  I'm sorry; I'm out of it this morning.  I think its 6:30 in the  morning too, by the way, former Deputy Assistant Secretary, David Malpass,  by the way.  David, great to have you here.  I want to get to breaking news  right away.  What do you make of Dr. Ben Carson taking over Trump in the  polls?</p><p>MALPASS:  Yeah, hi Sandra, good morning; and Dagen.  Look, it's huge  because you know, momentum builds, fund-raising builds.  Trump is having  the problem of having his foot in his mouth quite often; so people are  having to evaluate, would you rather have a president with humanity or a  president that doesn't have humanity?</p><p>SMITH:  It is interesting you point that out because this is -- I want go  through this here, because he's Dr. Carson, four point lead over Donald  Trump.  This poll just out, single digests for Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and  Carly Fiorina, still in the top five there, but Carson and Trump seem to be  pulling away the field, that the margins are still pretty big there,  Carson/Trump, over the rest of the other candidates.  </p><p>MALPASS:  Right, but these are national polls.  The primary is state-by- state, and so, I don't think they mean a whole lot now, other than this  concept of momentum.  It causes people to take a look at the -- at the new  guys.  So each of the lower ranked ones want to be in the public eye, let  people look at them.</p><p>SMITH:  You mentioned the primary state-by-state, well, I'll point out  Trump holds second place in Iowa.  Dr. Ben Carson has now won three of the  last four major polls in the state of Iowa, this coming on the heels of  these controversial comments that we aired going into this clip.  You were  there for reaction of Donald Trump and his comments about women and burqas,  saying they are easier the wear aren't they.</p><p>MALPASS:  He really has to stop talking about women and their looks.  Also,  you know, in Iowa he has been talking about corn, and that is a really  dangerous topic.  So this is -- I think, you know, candidates need to stay  on their message and he is not doing it.  Jeb's message, you know, is four- percent growth --</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  I think his message is,  look at me.  I am Donald Trump -- </p><p>MALPASS:  Yes. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- and what I wondered is, what is this guy going to say when  he starts feeling threatened?  When he starts looking like a loser and  falls to second, third and fourth place?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  We've heard that.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think he's going to say even more outrageous things.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We've already you heard when he feels threatened - </p><p>SMITH:  He'll pull out.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because he referred to the media as horrible scum because  people have been reporting on polls where he isn't leading.  So that is how  - I mean, it's easy to make fun of the media and less easy with women.  But  I think he is actually being hurt by the epic amount of media coverage,  when it earlier it was helping him greatly.</p><p>MALPASS:  Right; I think Jon has got it.  He just wants people to look at  him.  So here we are talking about him rather than, and the nation has this  giant debt problem, spending problem --</p><p>SMITH:  And you talk about the money angle of this, in one of most recent  tweets, in the past last 24 hours Donald Trump tweeted out, \"All  presidential candidates should immediately disavow their superpacs.  They  are not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself.\"</p><p>MALPASS:  Well that works for him because he made a lot of money.  You  know, he was lucky when he was born, with a father that made him a big  loan, and then he's made a lot of luck.  So he's got the money to do it;  the others probably don't.</p><p>SMITH:  So how come -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We also had a -- we had a story in the paper the other day  saying that he's done his own share of fund-raising.  So, he's not pure on  that front either.</p><p>SMITH:  And we've got this debate coming up tomorrow night that will be  focused on the ec -- do you think that's an opportunity for Carly Fiorina  to get back her mojo?</p><p>MALPASS:  Sure, and she comes across well on the national stage, as we saw  in the last debate.  So they all have a chance, now, to stand up to Trump,  give their message, and see what he's got.  Now, one issue is, he's, on  certain issues, been pretty good.  I've been happy to see him saying that  the Fed should not be zero percent interest rate.  You know, it is a good  one because it is a rich guy saying, look, it benefits me.  I'm, rich.  The  Fed has the rates set for my benefit.  They should stop.  So that's a  pretty good line for him.</p><p>SMITH:  And, real quick, your reaction to the White House and congressional  leaders reaching this tentative budget deal?</p><p>MALPASS:  Yes, I wanted them to use debt limit, and I've wanted this for  some years, to actually restrain spending.  The concern here is that their  basically having a blowout.  Each -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  They're breaking the budget cap.</p><p>MALPASS:  They're breaking the caps.  Each part of congress gets the  spending that they want and they all agree to add it to the national --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They all like to spend, don't they -</p><p>MALPASS:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- as long as it is in their interests.</p><p>MALPASS:  Very -- I think there is only one-way forward for them to see  debt limit works to make more debt.  So they really need to rewrite it.   They keep avoiding that.  You know, the Debt Limit was written in World War  I, when the government wanted much more debt that is the purpose of the  Debt Limit.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The message today is, see you after the election.  No one  wants to deal but it before election.</p><p>SMITH:  David Malpass, really great getting your perspective this morning.</p><p>MALPASS:  Good to see you, Sandra.</p><p>SMITH:  Thanks for being here, bright and early.</p><p>MALPASS:  Thanks.</p><p>SMITH:  Well, a quick reminder, Fox Business will be teaming up with \"The  Wall Street Journal\" to give you a Republican Debate focused on your money,  the economy, business.  Be sure to tune in, right here, on Fox Business  November 10th, when the Republican candidates take the stage in Milwaukee,  Wisconsin.  You can only see it right here, on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Well, the M&amp;A boom on Wall Street, straight ahead we'll break down the  biggest yields in the making and who could be up for grabs next.  Plus,  we'll all - we've all done it, hopping on someone else's Netflix account to  watch your favorite show.  Hey, speak for yourselves, I haven't.  But, will  providers soon cut the cord on the password sharing?  Are they going to  come in on all the fun?  That's coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  Dreamworks Animation CEO, Jeffrey Katzenberg, thanking TESLA CEO,  Elon Musk, for saving his life.  Cheryl Casone is on that story for us this  morning.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE:  Good morning; that is right, Sandra.  Jeffrey Katzenberg  crediting TESLA's CEO, Elon Musk, with his survival after a life- threatening car accident in Hollywood on October 19.  Dreamworks Animation  CEO drives an electric Tesla Model S.  His car was totaled.  He needed  surgery after injuring his arm and his wrist in that accident.  </p><p>New York Mayor, Bill De Blasio, reportedly endorsing Hillary Clinton for  president before his planned candidate's forum in Iowa, December 6.   According to the Associated Press, discussions are still under way between  the two sides on how De Blasio's backing of Clinton will be announced.</p><p>And, according to a recent survey 49-percent of streaming on-demand users,  ages 18 to 29, share at least one account with someone outside of their  home.  While HBO and other streaming video providers might not encourage  password sharing, they also don't track it.  The survey says most users  don't care if they are responsible for profit loss for a corporation.   Sandra back to you. </p><p>SMITH:  All right, Cheryl; thank you.  Do you share any of your passwords?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Never.  No, don't ask me for my password. </p><p>SMITH:  Look, honestly, it doesn't make me feel bad for the company because  you haven't figured out your business model if this is possible; right?   You have to allow for that margin of -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, we were arguing about this before.  I think people  share their stuff.  We share our newspapers.  You know, back in the day, we  would share our cassettes -</p><p>SMITH:  Where are you going -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- with some song that we took off the radio.  So people share  stuff. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there's a - the issue with this - there was an article that  I was reading this morning about when couples break up that you have your  ex-boyfriend or girlfriend or even spouse, who is still Jonesing off of  your -- Bogarding your password.</p><p>SMITH:  Moving on.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So change your password.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I agree with that, but this sounds like an issue that will come  up in the court of \"Judge Judy\" and she will scold everybody and say,  unless you are married, don't share your password.</p><p>SMITH:  There you have it, never get divorced, Dagen, also gave that advice  yesterday, as well.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, never get mar -- no you can -- it is not don't get divorced,  it's just never get married.  If you think there's a shot --</p><p>SMITH:   Okay.  The bulls are out this morning.  Deal making is making a  comeback on Wall Street.  A record number of executives say they are  planning some kind of M&amp;A in the next 12 months, that's according to a new  report from EY.  Let's bring in Rich Jeanneret of EY Transaction Services.   Rich, good morning to you.  </p><p>RICH JEANNERET, AMERICAS VICE CHAIR, EY TRANSACTION SERVICES:  Good  morning. </p><p>SMITH:  All right, so -</p><p>GENERATE:  Great to be back.</p><p>SMITH:  -- what do we need to do about the deal-making coming back because  that's generally associated with a bullish market; is it?</p><p>JEANNERET:  they -- the deal market has been back and the story has been  the big deal but what is exciting about our 13th annual, -- our 13th  Semiannual Capital Conference Barometer is the exuberance around deal- making as high as its been in the last couple years.  More than 75-percent  saying they want to do details.  Companies with more than $5 billion of  market cap.  That rate of response for deal making the next year was up  over 90-percent.  Pipelines are strong, and I think the slow growth  environment is sending a signal to the c-suite (ps) keep growing.  We are  going to reward inorganic growth.  Watch how stocks trade up after deals  are announced. </p><p>SMITH:  All right, so what about sectors are you seeing most deals in right  now?</p><p>JEANNERET:  Well, you know, there has been a lot of great news in  technology, consumer products.  There is business model disruption  occurring throughout corporate America.  The changes in customer preference  is driving the consumer products industry and you are seeing blurring  occurring between sectors.  More than 90-percent of companies who said they  were going to do deals in the next-year plan to do deals outside their  sector.  I think it's a reflection of that a blurring occurring in a rapid  way.  As business models transform, people acquire technology and  intellectual capital in places other than their own.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Rich, to what extent is this being driven by low interest  rates?  To what extent is this just another artificial impact that the Fed  is having on markets, by allowing companies to just take out a lot of debt  to go out and buy another company?</p><p>JEANNERET:  Jon, I think low rate environment clearly is an element, but I  don't think it is a major element here.  I don't think the Fed move is  going to disrupt this M&amp;A market, should they decide to move soon.  I think  this is driven by the desire to create top-line growth, to continue  business model transformation.  Record amounts of capital and liquidity  available, most of it is corporate cash sitting on the balance sheet that  is being unused.  So I don't think there is a lot of debt being taken on to  do these deals.  If you look at debt to capitalization ratios, they're the  lowest they have been in almost a decade.  So this is strategic.  I think  companies are transacting for strategic growth, business model  transformation and to create shareholder value.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Are these smart deals, if they're doing them in sectors that  they have no experience in?</p><p>JEANNERET:  Well I think people are being proactive about business model  transformation.  You're seeing business models disrupted overnight.  I  think companies are being smart about acquiring technologies, intellectual  capital, workforce in places that are relative of the evolving  technological transformation, business model transformation that's  occurring around the world today.</p><p>SMITH:  Rich, this is a really interesting stat:  86-percent see cyber- attacks as a high level threat to the deal making process.  That is  probably the highest that it has ever been, in history, I would take?</p><p>JEANNERET:  It is.  I think people are concerned about two things, one,  could their actual deal process be hacked and competitive information about  their deal making, you know, be exposed to others; and then, two, just  looking at the cyber-risk within a deal, if you're buying a business today,  you've got to look what risk that business has with respect to it's IT and  cyber-exposure.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, great stuff.  Rich Jeanneret, thanks for joining us this  morning.</p><p>JEANNERET:  Thanks.</p><p>SMITH:  Coming up, a brand-new report making the case that eating bacon and  hotdogs could be just as bad for you are as smoking cigarettes?  We are  going to show you why, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  Ham, bacon, sausage can cause cancer, that's according to the World  Health Organization.  Experts say sufficient evidence that eating processed  meats is \"Carcinogenic to humans.\"  Joining us now is Dr. Devi.  Maybe you  could bring calm to this situation.</p><p>DR. DEVI NAMPIAPARAMPIL, NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: Sure.</p><p>SMITH:  Should we just stop eating bacon and hotdogs altogether?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  I don't think we need to stop eating those things.  I  mean, I, myself, don't even want to give up eating bacon; but we do have to  worry about eating it every single day. So in this report they were looking  at people who were having a lot of red meat and processed meats on a daily  basis.  So what they are talking about is about two slices of bacon per  day.  Then there are a couple things to think about.</p><p>SMITH:  Hold on.  First off, I always call pork white meat.  I don't call  it red meat.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  That's true, I know.  I do too, but it's sort of in that  gray area, right, where it kind of has some overlap.  It depends on the  cuts, and probably for the purposes of this study, the processing, you  know, itself.</p><p>SMITH:  Okay.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Dr. Devi, what is the problem here?  Is it the red meat or the  processing?  I get concerned about any kind of processed food these days.   Is that where the potential problem is?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  Well this study looked at both things, right.  So for red  meat they didn't have as much evidence as they did for processing.  So  seems like if you had to pick between two, the processing might be what you  have to be more concerned about.  But there are a couple other things to  think about in the study; right.  So generally, I mean, this is a synthesis  of a bunch of different studies.  So what we do, let's say there is a  pharmaceutical trial, we usually take people who have never had the drug in  the first place and then split it up into two groups.  One group gets the  drug and then you compare to it see what the results are.  But in this case  you're not really comparing people; you are not giving one group of people  hot dogs or red meats every day and then checking to see what happens.  You  are just letting people kind of follow their usual patterns, which people  who eat hot dogs every day might be very different than a vegetarian.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the World Health Organization put processed meat bacon, hot  dogs, into the same risk category as smoking and diesel engine exhaust.   That is how they view people who -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  They put it a little bit lower.  They put it right next to  herbicide, I think.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  Well there is some confusion because of the wording,  right.  So they put it in \"Sufficient Evidence\", but it doesn't mean that  your actually risk factors are as high.  So what they said is that based on  reviewing all these studies that your risk of developing, let's say colon  cancer, goes up by 18-percent.  Now that is confusing because it's not  going -- it is not going up by that absolute percentage.  So if your risk  of having colon cancer is about 5-percent to begin with, and it goes up by  18-percent, it is still a little bit less than 6-percent --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have a really -</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  -- which is still very low.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- basic question.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Other than potentially making you overweight and obese, if you  eat too much bacon or hotdogs or whatever, what is it about eating these  foods causes the cancer?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  Well, we don't know.  So that is part of the problem, that  we don't know what is involved.  I mean, they took a lot of different  processing and put it together.  These were 800 papers, approximately, that  they (inaudible) together - </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  -- and sometimes that can be, you know, kind of like  comparing apples and oranges.  So I think the general, take home message  is, of course, if you are eating red meat or processed foods, try to limit  it.  Try to live a healthy lifestyle; right?  I don't think this is so  shocking.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Didn't we already know that hotdogs and bacon were bad for  you?  I feel like I grew up hearing that.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  There's a little bit of that.</p><p>SMITH:  I mean, no, I didn't grow up hearing that.  I mean, bacon, what's  wrong with it?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  You mean you could eat all the hot dogs you wanted?</p><p>SMITH:  No, but I think that's harsh and especially to the agriculture  industry, to say that they are bad for you when Dr. Devi will be first to  point out that everything in moderation.  Meat suppliers, by the way,  processors, they have spoken out about this.  They're arguing meat is  essential for protein and vitamins.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  Well, that's true.  It depends also on your cut of meat.   So if you are talking about a filet mignon that is going to be a little bit  different because that's very lean beef, for example.  People also use that  for --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So the industry also called into question the findings here.   Is there anything that raises questions for you about how the studies were  done?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  Well, like we were talking about, right, so the fact that  it's observational, so you're not really separating the people into these  different groups and testing them.  Then, also, putting together so many  studies is difficult.  So I think that is another factor that we have to  consider.  But, like you said, you know, I think this is still something  people should be a little bit concerned about, in the sense that, eating  processed foods every day could add to your risk; but also, you know, to be  fair, just back, I mean, about 100 years ago people won the Nobel prize for  processing food.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, Dr. Devi, thank you for clearing it up and bringing some  calm to the situation.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  Especially during breakfast.  All right, next hour, \"Duck Dynasty\"  star Willie Robertson; author and columnist, Monica Crowley; and Charles  Schwab's Liz Ann Sonders.  They're all here, this all-star cast.

Blake Burman has the  latest on that  poll from Washington, Blake. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Hi there, Sandra, Donald Trump had led every  major national poll for more than one hundred days, dating all the way back  to early July until this morning. </p><p>A brand new poll from \"Cbs\" and the \"New York Times\" shows Dr. Ben Carson  on top of Trump nationally, 26 to 22, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina  appear in the next tier with the rest of the field at 4 percent or less.</p><p>Is this short-lived or the start of something new especially with the next  debate coming up tomorrow night, we'll see in the upcoming days, but for  now, this also mirrors a trend in Iowa. </p><p>The latest Iowa poll from Monmouth University shows Carson with a  commanding 14-point lead there, with 32 percent support, Carson's leveled  in Iowa appear more defined as he's won four of the last five polls there.</p><p>And in interview just this past hour, Trump was asked about Carson's recent  surge, and he said -- this was his reaction, that Carson has problems that  are about to be revealed.</p><p>Here are some of that interview.  \"A lot of things will come out now, and  we'll see how he holds up to the scrutiny.  I have  been there for I guess  a 100 and some odd days and we'll see how Ben holds up to the scrutiny.\"</p><p>Donald Trump just a little while ago.  That scrutiny could very well come  from Trump himself, it was said in the recent days that he  doesn't know  about Carson's faith.</p><p>He also called Carson weak on immigration and not up to the challenge in  negotiating successful trade deals.  And Sandra, as I mentioned that  debate, tomorrow night -- </p><p>SMITH:  All right --   </p><p>BURMAN:  Back to you.</p><p>SMITH:  And Fox Business is in a couple of weeks.  All right, Blake Burman  -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>All right, Jon, why is Dr. Ben Carson getting so much in the polls right  now?  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, CHIEF ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well,  I think that when the Republican base is looking for an outsider, and it  looks like Donald Trump is wearing out his welcome with part of that base.</p><p>And so people are turning to Ben Carson and trying to decide if he's an  alternative.  It's very early in this race still, it's hard to know at this  point who is going to hold up in the end.  </p><p>SMITH:  Go ahead -- </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS:  Carson and Iowa, and I have said this  before, the home-schooling network of people is a critical base of support  for him.</p><p>And they have a great deal of political power in terms of getting out the  vote, and even in fundraising.  And you've seen this particularly with the  -- with the tea party a few years ago.</p><p>And I think that, that's one huge advantage that he has in that state that  Trump does not.  </p><p>SMITH:  Speaking of fundraising, talk about Jeb Bush, I mean, in the most  recent quarter, he still raised more money than anybody else.  I know his  burn rate is big and -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he -- but now he's cutting -- </p><p>SMITH:  And he's cutting his staff, but in this poll you've got Marco  Rubio, Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, do you anticipate a big move from any of  them post the next --  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think -- </p><p>SMITH:  Debate or the next couple of debates? -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  There're going to be a lot of moves.  You know, if we -- if we  look back to the 2012 cycle, there were a lot of people who came up and  then fell back.</p><p>I mean, at this -- at this point four years ago, we were talking about Newt  Gingrich as the high flier, and he fell out a few months before anyone cast  a single vote.</p><p>And we ended up getting the establishment candidate in the Republican  Party; Mitt Romney as the candidate.  So, I think you still can't count out  a guy like Bush.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right, we want to turn to the markets now.  Alibaba reporting  quarterly results this morning, shares of the online retailer  soaring in  the pre-market.</p><p>Alibaba beating estimates on both earnings and revenue for the latest  period.  Apple and Twitter, we're waiting on, they are  expected to report  earnings after the close of trading today. </p><p>And for that, we want to bring in Charles Schwab Chief Investment  Strategist, Liz Ann Sonders, good morning to you, Liz Ann -- </p><p>LIZ ANN SONDERS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CHARLES SCHWAB:  Good morning  -- </p><p>SMITH:  Thanks for joining us.  So, what overall is your take on third  quarter earnings season so far?  </p><p>SONDERS:  So, out of the bloc, it started weak, which was the expectation.   And if you look more broadly than just the S&amp;P 500, which of course is a  large cap index, and look more broadly at the S&amp;P 1,500.</p><p>The key rate to the percentage of companies beating expectations is running  a little over 60 percent.  Now, the problem though is that, the top line  beat rate, so revenue beat rate, is actually quite a bit lower, it's under  45 percent.</p><p>So right now, expectations are for earnings to be down about 3 percent, I  think that improves between now and the end of reporting season.</p><p>But we're still somewhat likely to be in negative territory.  So, it is  likely that this is an earnings recession, I just don't think it will  correspond with an economic recession.  </p><p>SMITH:  Interesting, so you sound somewhat optimistic, generally speaking,  do you believe that the stock market is going to  continue higher through  the rest of this year?  </p><p>SONDERS:  So, I think this rally that we're in right now does have some  legs, but I think we're probably back in more of the trading range kind of  environment that we were in earlier in the year before the correction  unfolded.</p><p>And I think what will define when you hit the low-end of that range and the  high-end of that range will be less about things like earnings and  valuation and more about the technical conditions of the market.</p><p>Things like market breadth, but also sentiment conditions.  And sentiment  had really gotten washed out, investors were extraordinarily pessimistic  particularly back in late August when you had the mini-flash crash and then  the ensuing choppiness thereafter.</p><p>But since we've had the rally up about 10 percent off the lows, sentiment  has swung back up toward excessive optimism.  So, I think that probably  more than anything will define the ebbs and flows.</p><p>I think we're so out of secular bull market, but we've had a neutral  recommendation or a neutral rating on the market this year, which means  we're telling investors to just stay at your normal equity allocation,  don't take excessive bets on the upside.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Liz Ann, you called this an earnings recession, which is a  pretty striking word.  How are companies going to respond to an earnings  recession?</p><p>What we've seen in the past is they respond by cutting workers and cutting  payrolls.  What kind of responses are you hearing about in their earnings  calls right now?  </p><p>SONDERS:  Well, I don't -- I don't -- I follow individual companies, so I  don't tend to be on the earnings call, that's it.  And earnings recession  just means that the overall S&amp;P 500 goes into negative territory.</p><p>But the concentration therein is heavily towards the energy sector.  So  down over 65 percent year-over-year growth expectations for just the energy  sector.</p><p>Second to that would be the materials, obviously, connected to the  commodity space.  More broadly than that, actually, many sectors are doing  quite well, some of which are in double digit territory on the upside.</p><p>To this -- although overall, we're going to possibly see negative earnings,  the concentration is very much in the commodity-related  space.  </p><p>SMITH:  And Liz Ann -- </p><p>SONDERS:  We've seen instances like that before where earnings have dipped  negative, but it hasn't been an overall economic recession and that's often  been times where you've had a strong dollar and weak commodity prices.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Do you think -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Liz -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  The market is cheaper or expensive right now? </p><p>SONDERS:  Neither.  I think, the market is sort of in-line with median  valuations on a trailing or a forward PE.  On a Shiller-Case(ph) basis, the  market is expensive, but frankly, it's been above its long term norm for  this entire bull market.</p><p>So, I wouldn't put a lot of weight into that on a short-term timing  perspective.  I think it's neither an opportunity valuation nor is it a  deterrent for the market.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Liz Ann, but in terms of the expectations for next year in  earnings, do you think there's still too high, because if they are, many  people do believe that they're still lofty, then stocks would look a lot  more expensive if they come down.  </p><p>SONDERS:  I think they maybe a little bit high, but I think we are in the  same pattern in games that has been played out quarter after quarter, which  is looking out several quarters, you probably have estimates a little bit  too high.</p><p>Analysts will ultimately lower the bar too far heading into each quarter,  setting up the opportunity for analysts to beat those expectations.</p><p>So, I think we're probably -- real earnings for next year are probably  somewhere in between where estimates are now and where analysts are going  to go.  </p><p>SMITH:  Hey, Liz Ann, we led off this hour talking about this new national  poll out.  How closely are you as somebody who watches the markets so  closely?</p><p>How closely are you watching the changes and the ebbs and flows in the 2016  race for the White House.  How important is that and does it play into your  decisions and your expectations in the market?  </p><p>SONDERS:  It's not really that important at all right now.  In fact, I  think most of the volatility we've seen in the market really has nothing to  do with the presidential candidates.</p><p>There may be a factor of it that's driven by what's going on in Congress  and a potential for a government shutdown.  </p><p>But I think in terms of market impact, I don't think if we even get it,  that happens until we actually have two candidates running against one  another, when we start to see their policy prescriptions put on the table.</p><p>We start to see polling closer to the election that may give a biases to  who is coming in, and therefore, what changes might possibly be up for.   </p><p>But at this stage, I don't think it's a market mover.</p><p>SMITH:  Very interesting, and a part of Jon Hilsenrath's cover article on  the \"Wall Street Journal\", \"Fed strives for clear signal on rate move.\"</p><p>Do you believe that we're going to get any indication, Liz Ann, that there  will be a move on interest rates by the end of the year?</p><p>SONDERS:  I'd be surprise if they did anything terribly bold in this  meeting, this week.  I think it's very likely that they do nothing in terms  of rates.</p><p>And I'm not so sure they adjust the statement.  If anything, they may make  sure that in their statement, they keep the option for a December move  open.</p><p>Which I think they would like to do.  But -- </p><p>SMITH:  Yes -- </p><p>SONDERS:  Beyond that, I think it would be fairly benign this statement -- </p><p>SMITH:  Liz Ann Sonders, thank you for joining us this morning.</p><p>SONDERS:  Thank you.</p><p>SMITH:  Great to have you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have one quick thing.  Chris Low, he's an economist, FTN  Financial, comes on this program very often, here is his e-mail note to  clients this morning.</p><p>\"Jon Hilsenrath's story about Fed communication in today's \"Wall Street  Journal\" is terrific.\"</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Sure -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A reminder of why we all read Hilsenrath in the first place.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Oh, that's nice to hear -- </p><p>SMITH:  And watch him -- and a reminder why you're watching him right now.   All right, thank you.

I look at this, and  I'm like great marketing -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Campaign -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Like here we are -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Only one -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Trying that RBI -- </p><p>SMITH:  Why is that simple? -- </p><p>CASONE:  Yes -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Not everybody else -- </p><p>SMITH:  I mean, that -- this is -- </p><p>CASONE:  They're open --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They did -- </p><p>CASONE:  Marketing -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It's good marketing --   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  To get -- they did it -- </p><p>CASONE:  OK -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  To get us talking about it -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes -- </p><p>CASONE:  Yes -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And we'll do it -- </p><p>CASONE:  Here we are -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And we'll do it, we've been talking about it all morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love it, because what day of the year other than the day after  Christmas, maybe, do you need to have off to go out and exercise.</p><p>And like work all -- </p><p>SMITH:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The day before or the day after Thanksgiving.  </p><p>CASONE:  They have -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get out there, go for a hike -- </p><p>CASONE:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get that blow-down, you know, you wake up, Friday morning, your  eyes -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are swollen -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I bet REI -- I'm sure REI looked at its sales and said, you  know what? We don't do a lot on Black Friday anyway.  </p><p>So, let's just give everybody off and -- you know, people are lining up  outside of Wal-Mart on Black Friday trampling each other.  </p><p>So, they're probably not going to -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  On -- </p><p>CASONE:  Sandra, well -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanksgiving Day now -- </p><p>SMITH:  Well, by the way, they're -- so, they're also closed Thanksgiving  Day.  I guess you can assume that if they're going to be closed the day  after.  They already got more than 35,000 likes on their Facebook page for  announcing this.</p><p>I'm serious, I wonder if you're going to see more companies follow suit --  and by the way, the more we are shopping online --   </p><p>CASONE:  Right, exactly --   </p><p>SMITH:  How many of these stores really need to -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- </p><p>SMITH:  Stuff -- </p><p>CASONE:  Exactly -- </p><p>SMITH:  Their stores -- </p><p>CASONE:  Which would be a good thing.  I rather be -- you know, home in my  BJ shopping the day after -- after that three to four thousand calories  meals they're planning to consume on Thanksgiving Day.</p><p>Then like trucking it out to whatever store at -- you know, 6:00 a.m. -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Most -- </p><p>CASONE:  In the morning --   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Most of your -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's the size -- a lot of people are going to get -- </p><p>SMITH:  What? --   </p><p>CASONE:  Shopping?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Trampling each other on Black Friday.  </p><p>CASONE:  We see it every year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not just Black Friday.  These stores, these discounters are  open on Thanksgiving Day now, many of them -- </p><p>SMITH:  Oh, yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, have started -- </p><p>SMITH:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Opening on turkey day --   </p><p>SMITH:  Oh, believe me, we're just talking to somebody who is worse -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which reduces the stabbings over the dinner table -- </p><p>CASONE:  Yes -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, I'm for that.  </p><p>CASONE:  I just say, you know, Terry Lundgren, the CEO of Macy's was here a  couple of weeks ago and he said, look, he goes, our customers demanded that  we talk to our customers first and then when they started opening  Thanksgiving night at Macy's, he was there physically.</p><p>The CEO of the company physically -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes -- </p><p>CASONE:  There in the New York store, saying, I'm here with you, I'm  working with you -- and somebody walked up to him and said where is the  shoe department?  </p><p>They had no idea who he was.  If the CEO can get behind it, I think it's a  good thing.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right, REI says go outside and play on Black Friday.  All  right, Cheryl -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Build a fort! </p><p>SMITH:  Thank you -- yes -- </p><p>CASONE:  Here we go -- </p><p>SMITH:  Coming up, the U.S. positioning warships right now near China's  territory.  What does this mean for relations between the two countries?</p><p>We're going to discuss that with Fox's Lea Gabrielle, she'll be joining us  in studio next.  </p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SMITH:  A showdown on that sea, the U.S. sending a warship within 12  nautical miles of the sputtered islands claimed by Beijing in the South  China Sea.</p><p>This is seen as a potential challenge to China's territorial claim over the  contested waters.  Former U.S. Navy officer and Fox News correspondent Lea  Gabrielle joins me now and former intelligence official as well.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS:  Oh, thank you -- </p><p>SMITH:  Great to get your insight always on these stories.  What do you  make of this showdown on that sea?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, I actually don't think it's much of a showdown at all to  be honest with you.  And the reason I say that is because, these are  islands that China claims in the South China Sea.</p><p>China claims that the entire South China Sea belongs to them.  But other  countries would argue with that including the Philippines, Malaysia,  Vietnam, a number of others.</p><p>What China has been doing is, they've been building on top of these reefs.   Some of these reefs (INAUDIBLE) reefs they've been building on top of since  2003 to '13.</p><p>Some of them were submerged in high tide and they basically been adding on  to them building ports, building airstrips that are -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>Capable of -- </p><p>SMITH:  Yes -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Of military aircraft and that type of thing.  So, when you look  at this 12 nautical miles, what you're talking about is within a country's  sovereign territory.  </p><p>There's a right of transit passage, meaning, you can navigate through those  waters within 12 miles of a country's sovereign territory.</p><p>By us saying, oh, we're going to -- we're going to go through your 12  nautical-mile area, that's kind of admitting to China that, that's their  sovereign territory. </p><p>So my take on this is, forget about that, let's go do naval exercises.   Let's get, you know, some of these countries like the Philippines involved,  let's invite China to do naval exercises right there within 12 miles of  these islands.</p><p>And not even acknowledge their claims to these islands.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So, what's the U.S. game here? Why -- what are -- what are we  trying to demonstrate by sending our ship in that area?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, what we're demonstrating is freedom of navigation.  You  know, according to the conventional law of the sea, basically, countries  can pass through areas.</p><p>You can look like Strait of Gibraltar, the Strait of Hormuz by Iran,  different straits, different choke points that we call them in the world.</p><p>Where, you know -- where ships need to be able to pass through for trade  and other things.  And this particular area of the world, about 30 percent  of trade passes through here.</p><p>So, we're saying, you know, we are basically saying that there is freedom  of navigation in these waters, and we're going to prove that and we're  going to show that by moving within 12 nautical miles.</p><p>But my issue with this is that 12 nautical-mile rule does not apply to when  a country starts piling sand on top of a reef and calling it their island - - </p><p>SMITH:  Their island.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  When we don't acknowledge that these are China's islands.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But wait, if the longer that we wait to do something about this,  the more heighten the danger -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Right -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the harder it is to actually take power away from China --   </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I absolute agree.  And it's right that we are -- that we are  seaming through these areas, it's wrong that we're making a big deal of it.</p><p>We should just be doing it, and if we do want to make a big deal of  something, which I think we probably should, because China continues to  build these up.</p><p>And what they're doing is, they're basically closing down -- essentially,  they're making a claim that could ultimately close down on freedom of  navigation through that area. </p><p>And I'm saying, do more.  Just passing through, just going through that and  saying we're going through this 12-nautical mile area.  I don't think  that's enough at this point.</p><p>I think that they need a stronger statement and I think what we should be  doing is naval exercises in that area.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  What's the risk of the confrontation or an accident?</p><p>SMITH:  Recap it -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, right now, everyone just making statements.  We're making  statements through our actions, through our words.  China is too.</p><p>But no one wants that to happen.  </p><p>SMITH:  All right, we always love getting your insights, Lea Gabrielle,  thank you.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SMITH:  GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump strikes again, this time  going after women who choose to wear burkas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We want it with the women -- oh, but they don't have to wear the --  you know, what? And then I said, oh, well, that makes sense, that's nice.</p><p>Then I saw women interviewed.  They said we want to wear, we've worn them  for thousand years.  Why would anybody tell us not to -- they want to. </p><p>What the hell are we getting involved for? In fact, it's easy, you don't  have to put on makeup -- look how beautiful everyone looks.  Wouldn't it be  easy if -- right? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Wouldn't that be easy? I tell you, if I was a woman, I don't want a -- I'm  ready, darling, let's go.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SMITH:  All right, this -- we have to get Monica Crowley -- saying, this is  also by the way as we're learning that Dr. Ben Carson is now leading in a  new national polls.</p><p>The CBS/\"New York Times\" poll with 26 percent favorability over Trump. </p><p>Joining me now is Monica Crowley, Fox Business contributor.- </p><p>MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Listen, there are many mornings  where I don't want to put on makeup and I thought, he has have a good  point. God, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. </p><p>Look, Donald Trump can literally say anything and get away with anything.  This remark I think, look, a lot of it was said in jest. He's married to a  supermodel who is once famous for her lingerie shoes. I don't think he  wants his wife wearing a Burke. </p><p>I think he's actually making a bigger point here, which is, you know, about  the invasion of Iraq which he has opposed from the start, and so on. That  when the United States intervenes in certain areas, you know, whether it's  democracy building or trying to change the culture, you know, oftentimes  we're going to fail, especially when it comes to the Muslim world. </p><p>I think he made a very indelicate comment about this, but I think it points  to this bigger issue.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  OK. But a new national poll, Dr. Carson, a four-point lead over  Donald Trump. What do you make of that?</p><p>CROWLEY:  This is the first national poll actually in over 100 days that  has shown somebody actually beating Donald Trump. </p><p>SMITH:  Trump was very quick to point that out.</p><p>CROWLEY:  Yes, exactly. Look, comments like we just highlighted here. They  might actually be starting to wear on Donald Trump's supporters. So, it  might be some Trump fatigued starting to come into play here. </p><p>He's got a very passionate core, a block of support, which I don't think is  going to go away and he has become a better candidate as times has gone by.  So, we have to see how this shakes out. </p><p>I do think as the voters get closer to actually casting their vote or what  I call spending their vote the way they spend money, it's an emotional act  as much as it is an intellectual one, I think people will start to have  second thoughts about not just him but Ben Carson. </p><p>That doesn't mean they won't vote for them, but I think they'll start  getting more serious about analyzing how they are going to spend their vote  and who they would like to see to be the nominee in terms of electability. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  When I hear comments like that I ask myself is that a  candidate or an entertainer? What are the most striking thing about that  berth comment that we just heard, was it the laughter in the background. It  sounded like he was up there trying to be an entertainer and not a  candidate. </p><p>CROWLEY:  Yes. I mean, you hear that and he's doing stick, you know. I  mean, I don't think they're mutually exclusive when they come to Trump. I  do think he is a serious candidate and I also think that he is an  entertainer, which is explains why he's been leading at least until now. </p><p>SMITH:  We haven't got in your take since Joe Biden drop out of the race,  oh, sorry, never entered into the race. He announced that he wouldn't be  entering the race. How does these change things for in your perspective on  the democratic side? </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, I was certainly wrong about this because for months I'd  been predicting that Biden was going to get in the race. And, look, he  didn't entirely close the door. </p><p>SMITH:  He didn't.</p><p>CROWLEY:  Did you listen to that to his announcement in the Rose Garden  with the President; it was more of an announcement saying I am not running.</p><p>SMITH:  Yes.</p><p>CROWLEY:  So, I think they are actually waiting on the FBI investigation.  And if Hillary Clinton had serious grave legal trouble, Joe Biden will be  able to ride in. </p><p>SMITH:  Well, he kind of ended the speech in the Rose Garden with, \"I'm  here if anybody needs me.\" </p><p>CROWLEY; And by the way, on 60 Minutes on Sunday, when he was asked about  Hillary Clinton, he said, if she is the nominee, of course, I will support  her. And I thought that phrase if she's the nominee it leaves a lot of  latitude here. I just -- I may not be entirely wrong yet. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right. I hope Donald Trump works out a better standup  routine, you know, does some works out some material at a chuck hat in  Paramus, New Jersey, if we are going to have to listen to this rather than  low, but, no.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CROWLEY:  Yes, I mean, yes. He can literally say anything and get away with  it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He can but...</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But he's falling in the polls. Can he keep doing that? </p><p>CROWLEY:  It might, and like I said, look, as we get closer to the point  where voters are actually thinking about really spending their votes on  somebody, that it might work against him, then again, it might not. </p><p>The dynamic we're seeing this year is completely unlike anything we have  ever seen before. So, who knows?</p><p>SMITH:  Great thought. Monica Crowley, thank you for joining us.</p><p>CROWLEY:  My pleasure.</p><p>SMITH:  All right. We've got big stories in business and politics on  Mornings with Maria. Here is a look back at some of the best moments from  today's show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  October 30th, Herman Cain was in  first, Mitt Romney was second, Rick Santorum will ultimately won with a 5  percent. So, all this kind of floatation about where the polls are, not  just for us but for everybody, is a bit much.</p><p>SMITH:  You, guys...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Must not be a good tipper, because how can you go to New York  City without a few bucks in the pocket? </p><p>SMITH:  Right. Good point.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That was right.</p><p>SMITH:  All right. John read.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  J.P. Morgan, lean over it. So, what you've said, I was right.  OK. Stay dress. She's about to lose her style. </p><p>SMITH:  OK. Thanks, Dagen. All fair points. </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  We don't need the strategic petroleum  reserve. We have a new reserve, it's called North Dakota. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Didn't we already know that hot dogs and bacon were bad  for you. I thought I grew up seemingly first. </p><p>SMITH:  Show little bit of that. Maybe, no, I didn't grew up eating that. I  mean, Dagen, what's wrong with...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You can eat all the hot dogs you want.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  The cause of your next power outage could be a drone, of all  things. Cheryl Casone has that story and more. Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  Funny how this story came up this morning. That's right, Sandra. A  man flying a drone in Hollywood causing a power outage after he flew the  device into electrical wires. The accident left nearly 700 customers  without power, that power has been restored. </p><p>Jeffrey Katzenberg crediting Tesla's CEO Elon Musk with his survival after  a life-threatening car accident in Hollywood on October 19th. Dream Works  Animation CEO drives an electric Tesla Model-S Sedan, his car van was  totaled, he needed surgery after injuring his arm and his wrist in an  accident. But he's going to be OK. </p><p>And by the latest CBS News, New York Times poll showing Ben Carson has the  lead with 26 percent support. He has a 4-point lead over Trump who has 22  percent. The rest of the field still lagging far behind, all of them in the  single digits. Sandra, back to you.</p><p>SMITH:  All right, Cheryl, thank you. Well, we are about 15 minutes away  now from the opening bell on Wall Street. </p><p>Let's get to Nicole Petallides, she's standing by at the New York Stock  Exchange with some of the big names that we're watching this morning.  Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  We have over 170 S&amp;P 500 companies  reporting throughout this week. So, busy week for earnings. </p><p>Let's take it off with three names you know well, including UPS. So, they  reported a surprise revenue dipped this close, at $106 and change, it's  looking down 2, $3 at least. So, that is coming under pressure and so that  name, UPS will be a lager. </p><p>On the other hand, we're going to see Alibaba here, they got some good  news, their mobile revenue tripled for Alibaba and with e-commerce more of  its revenue it keep closes at $76. It is looking in the $82 range. And last  but not the least, watching Coach. </p><p>And so, as we see Coach, which is looking to the upside, despite the fact  that profit and sales in the latest quarter continued to decline there has  been a turnaround effort underway and the retailer is making progress.</p><p>And so with that rhetoric, the stock closed at $30 and change, it's looking  in the $31 range right now. So, this is just some send to the highlights  from earnings. Back to you.</p><p>SMITH:  Al right. Nicole, thank you. And don't forget to start your day  every day with Nicole on FBN:AM, catch her right here on Fox Business  Network every morning at 5 a.m. </p><p>Well, Jeff Flock he is going wherever the wind takes him. Straight ahead,  we're taking you 200-feet into the air for the first-ever live broadcast  from the top of all wind turbines. You do not want to miss this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  Wind power has been chasing government subsidies for years saying  it can survive without them. </p><p>With more on this, we've got Jeff Flock conveniently standing by in a  first-ever broadcast exclusively on top of 20-storey wind turbine. Jeff  Flock. </p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Sandra, I have always wanted to do  this and my dreams today come true. But it's also a dream for all of you  viewers to see this incredible sight. </p><p>We are 300 -- well, we are 30 story's, about 300 feet in the air, and maybe  you'd this giant turbine here in what is the nation's capital of wind. I've  got Gary Webb with me, EDP, why is Texas the capital of wind? </p><p>GARY WEBB, EDP IN TEXAS:  Well, our prevailing winds come off of the South  of the Gulf. When the wind shifts and come out of the North, we're right  and dense center of those as well, so it's a wonderful production. </p><p>FLOCK:  An incredible view from up here. And maybe, Sandra, you see as we  pan out, how many of these I am looking at this horizon. </p><p>WEBB:  Roughly about 75 to 100. </p><p>FLOCK:  The thing about is if you look at the numbers, last week, actually,  Texas provided in terms of wind power, a third, wind power provided a third  of the power for Texas. Incredible. </p><p>WEBB:  Yes it is. And we're able to -- we have 400 megawatts here which can  power up to 80,000 homes, which is equal to taking about 146,000 cars off  the highway. </p><p>FLOCK:  And, Sandra, I've got to show you what we're dealing with up here.  You can imagine. And thanks to the good folks at EDP for letting us come up  here. We are all tied in with this is harnesses, and I guess these are  designed in case somehow I go over the side. I'm not going there. </p><p>WEBB:  No, you're not. They will hold you up and then we would have to form  an angle and rescue you. </p><p>FLOCK:  An angle rescue. I'm going to leave you with one shot. Go ahead,  Dino, spin around show us, our guys are intrepid crew out here on top of  this, first ever live broadcast from the top of a wind turbine. We are 30  story's in the air. </p><p>And I tell you, look at the, look at that, Din, is that incredible. Coming  up, the moon going down, the sun coming up over Texas, Sandra. Wish you  were here. </p><p>SMITH:  Al right. Jeff Flock. Only you and you only really get like the  massive nature of those turbines until you stand next to one. Over stand  next to one. </p><p>Jeff Flock, amazing reporting as always. Thank you. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And it sounded windy up there, which I guess is a good thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>SMITH:  Like, honestly, you know how he got, he's tethered to a rope up  there, like there is no elevator. Think about how he got up there. He's not  -- he's not doing it for Fox Business. Jeff Flock, thank you. </p><p>All right. Well, the latest CBS News, New York Times poll showing Ben  Carson as the lead with 26 percent support, he's a four-point lead now over  Donald Trump who has 22 percent. </p><p>This latest hit for Trump in the polls comes as he still refuses to  apologize for comments made about Carson's religion. </p><p>Joining us now is Duck commander CEO and star of the A&amp;E show, \"Duck  Dynasty\" Willie Robertson. Welcome to you, sir.</p><p>WILLIE ROBERTSON, DUCK COMMANDER &amp; CEO:  How are you?</p><p>SMITH:  We always like to share our LSU camaraderie, both LSU big fans, go  tigers.</p><p>ROBERTSON:  It's a good year. It's a good year.</p><p>SMITH:  Good year.</p><p>ROBERTSON:  Undefeated.</p><p>SMITH:  Yes, number four. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want Sandra to start sound and southern.</p><p>SMITH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  For the next five minutes.</p><p>SMITH:  That will give you a cocktail. But it's good to see you. I mean,  have you officially supported Donald Trump. I know you've shared your like  for him. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  I've shared my like for him. You know, I'm not a politician,  so, I don't really, I don't endorse people. I'm just a...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  But you're a big businessman. And you're a big businessman. You  employ how many people? </p><p>ROBERTSON:  We got a few people, not as many as Mr. Trump, but there is a  lot of things that Trump says that I really like. I don't agree with  everything he says but there's a lot of stuff he says that makes sense. And  I like the charisma, I like the energy and see what's he end in. </p><p>You know, I've met Ben Carson as well, he's a super nice guy, great guy.  You know, I certainty share his faith. So, only that he's taken the faith,  you've got...</p><p>SMITH:  Back to get Dr. Ben Carson.</p><p>ROBERTSON:  Right. He has taken kind of that which there are other people  you'd probably thought who have thought would have, you know, have that.  Trump does the same thing with the, you know, you saw in your face which is  I kind of thought Christie was going to, you know, a year ago, it was like  Christie was that guy, then Trump just go fast. So, a lot (Inaudible) that  came in that took over these issues. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you say there's a lot of things that Trump says or  believes that appeal to you, walk us through what you like about him  besides the energy, you mentioned the energy. But what is it that really is  one thing that you like.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ROBERTSON:  You know, one of the things, he actually says, you know, people  over there are getting their heads chopped off who are Christians and that  has bugged me, it was like -- I didn't hear a lot of talk about that. </p><p>And as a Christian, I'm going, what is going on in this world? Where  literally is just we're videoing then people getting their heads lopped  off. And he actually said, I mean, when he said, and I thought, I think  it's the first time I heard somebody actually say it, you know, that was  running for president. </p><p>So, those kind of things to me are big, you know, I just heard for these  people all over the world who are getting persecuted.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, he doesn't want to be involved in that stuff. He's  basically wants to watch...</p><p>ROBERTSON:  He's saying he's going to go, well...</p><p>SMITH:  Well, there have been a direct exchanges and attacks on religion  between Donald Trump and Ben Carson. Donald Trump said, And I'm a  Presbyterian, that's pretty much straight down the middle of religion,  right?</p><p>And then he said to Ben Carson, you're not -- you're not really a  Christian.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He was quietly mocking Seventh Day Adventist.</p><p>ROBERTSON:  Well, he didn't say he's not -- I didn't even know that by the  way. I started to realize. </p><p>SMITH:  So, but religion has entered into the conversation, and it is part  of this election but there's a lot going on. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  It's hard, yes. I mean, to me it is about running the country.  I like the idea of running it as a business, you know, it just seems like  if you look at the deaths, it seems that we haven't done our great job of  that, you know, run this time like a business and, you know, kind of like  Giuliani came over in New York, you know, he turned it around and looked at  it as a business. </p><p>And run this thing as a business. So, it's not all, to me, it's not all  about religion. I mean, I am a religious guy but it's all about who has the  competency to run, and I am still, again, I'm learning, I'm still watching  myself, it's too early. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you expect you're going to end up campaigning for somebody?  Because you -- they -- if you get behind a candidate they're going to ask  you to hit the road for some. I's suspect given your popularity.</p><p>ROBERTSON:  Well, once we -- no, I can't. I don't know if I have time, I  have a TV show coming, so.</p><p>SMITH:  Yes.</p><p>ROBERTSON:  So, I don't know if I have the time to run for them.</p><p>SMITH:  You got TV show, you have a new book out today. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Yes. \"American Hunter\" came out today. So, yes, we've got a lot  of things going on. But politics interest me. And, again, I was in Israel  with Mike Huckabee, another great guy. I mean, these are great guys and I  like talking to him, sharing ideas and maybe giving him some of my ideas  and some things that, you know, we believe in and maybe it will help. </p><p>SMITH:  Well, Willie, you live down there in the great State of Louisiana  and you got your ear to the ground, when it comes to what people are  talking about. I mean, what's this conversation that you're hearing with  the people of Louisiana, who are they talking about, what issues are most  important to them in this... </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Well, I ran out of issues.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROBERTSON:  We are playing Alabama in a couple of -- next week. So, it's  also hunting season. But now I think people, you know, you see stories, you  know, that come out and we just kind of wonder and like, what is this  country come to where like the coach in Washington you can't say a prayer,  he's threaten to get fired...</p><p>SMITH:  We've got video of that by the way. The coach that takes to the  field after the games, he prays and he welcomes the players to join him.  And then the school took issue with that. And where do you fall on whether  there is room for prayer? </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Well, I'm kind with the founding fathers of the country who are  strong believers that, you know, that this whole country was founded on our  Christian faith. So, they didn't shy away from it. I won't shy away from  it. And if you get fired you get fired, you know. I mean, that's some  things are worth losing your job over. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Can I say a little bit about -- this is you're talking about  business. How is business right now. What are you seeing, are people  spending money on your product? </p><p>ROBERTSON:  They are. Yes. We still have people -- a lot of people come  down and visit, they want to come to the warehouse and take a picture and  then they'll go in and spend money and we have seen it, you know, 2013 for  us was the high, you know, that was the high mark. </p><p>And so, now we're seeing where it has leveled off and still there is a lot  of people spending. In fact, when the economy is down, we've noticed that  hunting stuff it doesn't miss a lag. </p><p>Guys are going to go hunting, girls are going to go hunting no matter,  they're going to bother. Camouflage and they Duck calls and so...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Is there going to be a good...</p><p>ROBERTSON:  In fact, sometimes even more because, you know, you can go out  and actually get your food and provide. So, you know, sometimes it helps. </p><p>SMITH:  Great point. By the way, you're actually on your Twitter, you're  saying still time to sign up and be entered to go hunting with you. You're  going to enter in your Twitter site, where are you taking somebody on a  hunt? </p><p>ROBERTSON:  We're taking them hunt in Louisiana. Yes, right down there.</p><p>SMITH:  Nice.</p><p>ROBERTSON:  We've teamed up and we're doing some things with adaption which  is where close to our hearts. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sandra said in the break she doesn't like duck hunting. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  You don't like duck hunting?</p><p>SMITH:  It bores me a little but I like duck meat and you know, I cook  everything I hunt and it just bores me a little bit. I've a German  shorthaired pointer and we like to go out in the fields like fuzzy crowd... </p><p>ROBERTSON:  I mean to take to a better spot because it shouldn't be boring.  It should be fun. </p><p>SMITH:  I know, I like to walk in the fields and the trees and the grass. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  You need to talk and cook and...</p><p>SMITH:  All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You got to be careful which ducks you cook because some of them  depending on the duck they can taste like wet garbage. </p><p>SMITH:  You haven't get...</p><p>ROBERTSON:  You get that wet. Yes. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's true. It's what the duck ate.</p><p>ROBERTSON:  You got a -- well, that's true. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  One thing I love about...</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not impossible, I know.</p><p>SMITH:  One thing I love about going to school in Louisiana is all the boys  down there they all know how to cook, they all know how to dance. I mean,  I'm this Louisiana. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  She has lost it. She says Louisiana. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know, I've lost it. </p><p>SMITH:  Willie Robertson, pleasure having you. </p><p>ROBERTSON:  Nice to see you.</p><p>SMITH:  All right. Taking a look at the market. Futures lower ahead of the  open, keep it right here on Fox Business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SMITH:  We're about 30 minutes away from the opening bell, final thoughts  to Dagen McDowell and John -- what do you got?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Read Jon Hilsenrath article on the front page of the Wall Street  Journal today because and John can answer this question. It looks like a  Fed that does not know how to communicate with the press, members that are  maybe arguing with each other. Can they get it together? Or maybe not roll  the market.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  You know, I got to say, Dagen, we got to kind of a rocky  start. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because I want to bring with you typical man. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But I love everything that you're saying right now. I couldn't  really work. </p><p>SMITH:  You called her grumpy when we started the show.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It was really and we didn't have enough caffeine. </p><p>SMITH:  Got it.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  There is the Fed meeting that starts this week and they have  some problems constructing a message while they are trying to make a  difficult decision about interest rates. We don't get any action this week  from the Fed but looking towards the end of the year we got to see Janet  Yellen kind of taking control of this committee and getting a straighter  message out of the Central Bank. </p><p>SMITH:  OK. As far as an actual rate hike the market is still saying as  Mike...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let's talk after the next jobs report. We will have a better  idea then.</p><p>SMITH:  All right. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And go Mets and go with the World Series. I am and ink stain  wretch, so I carry the papers around with me. But go Mets, World Series  starts tonight. </p><p>SMITH:  All right. It's going to be a big night indeed. And by the way it  was fun talking LSU Tigers with Willie. I mean, did you knew that as much  fun as I did in the break?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No. But he is so down to earth it's incredible. </p><p>SMITH:  All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's nice to have some good some southern...</p><p>SMITH:  Very down to earth, very down to earth. All right. Thank you to  Dagen McDowell and Jon Hilsenrath for joining us all show. </p><p>Don't miss our all-star lineup tomorrow on Mornings with Maria. We will sit  down with media mogul Steve Forbes will be here. And we'll continue our  coverage of this earning season with the CEOs of Southern Company and  Athena Health.</p><p>It all begins at 6 a.m. Eastern right here on the Fox Business Network.  \"VARNEY AND COMPANY\", it is next, Stuart, it is all yours, sir.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

They're all fairly sizable spreads, with the most recent from Monmouth University showing Carson with a 14-point lead.</p><p>Meantime, Trump is facing some scrutiny for a couple of comments he made yesterday in New Hampshire. In one of them Trump said it's easy for women to wear burkas because they don't have to wear makeup.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In fact, it's easier. You don't have to put on makeup. Look how beautiful everyone looks. Wouldn't it be easier? Right? Wouldn't that be easy? I tell you, if I was a woman, I don't want to -- I'm ready, darling, let's go. It's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Separately, Sandra, Trump also took credit for Ford's decision to halt production plants truck plans in Mexico and stay in Ohio. However, that was strongly disputed by Ford and Ohio Governor, and presidential candidate, John Kasich. Sandra.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Blake Burman, thank you. Let's bring in former White House advisor to President Bush, Bryan Hook and Democratic Strategist, Richard Goodstein. Guys, I don't know where to begin.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH: Let's first tackle the burka comment. Bryan, to you first, is this going to hurt Trump?</p><p>BRYAN HOOK, former ADVISOR, WHITE HOUSE: You know, historically we try not to view American foreign policy through the lens of the burka. This is a very strange comment to be made when we are talking about a real crisis in the Middle East. It makes him in that entertainer column and less in the commander-in-chief column.</p><p>SMITH: Well, Richard, normally, you know, I think we'd be looking at a comment like that and saying, gosh, every controversial comment he makes he seems to go up in the polls. Now we are talking about him losing ground in Iowa, again, to Dr. Carson. Are things starting to change here?</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Look, they're changing in a pretty fundamental way in this regard, Trump's whole calling card, incidentally so many of his comments are untethered from reality it makes me think he has a political death wish. His calling card is I'm a winner. If he loses, in his book he's a loser and there's nothing worse than being a loser to <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>So, he better turn that around in Iowa because he can't keep -- yes, he's ahead in all the other states, I understand that, but - incidentally, Ben Carson is the Gardner of this race, right? I know, I'm dating myself from the movie, being there, but he says all these inane things and people impute to it commonsense, when its, for the most part, idiocy. If I was a Republican, I would be scared to death, or frankly, somebody on Wall Street, that a major political party could nominate either of these two guys, it's scary.</p><p>SMITH: Bryan, it's hard to really decide where to go from here because it does seem that things are changing now, but at the same time, it seems like the establishment has been trying to figure out what to do with <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>but <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>responding to Richard's comment, has made it clear that he is not going to lose. He has made it clear that the second that he's dropping in the polls or it looks like he doesn't have a shot at winning the GOP primary, he said he's out of the race. He has made that very clear. So what naturally happens next?</p><p>HOOK: We have about a little less than 100 days until the Iowa caucus, and that's a long time in presidential politics. Trump is now down five points in that Monmouth poll since the last one. So we are -- we are seeing Trump lose altitude, and I think because we have what, you know, a few months left now, there's plenty of time for the race to move around. I do expect that you're going to see continual movement, and it's probably going to trend more in the establishment direction.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Can I raise an issue though, Gentlemen, and Rich, I know he's die to go make fun of me because I poo poo'ed when he said -</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELLL: He said Joe Biden was not going to run for president, and I said -- well, he's not. But with Iowa and to the good people of Iowa, how relevant are the caucuses, particularly with the Republicans, you look back, it was Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee were -</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the last two winners and they, well, were not the nominee?</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: Correct. Dagen, so you make a good point. There's even a different point, which is at this point four years ago, and I checked yesterday, on October 30th, 2011 poll, Herman Cain was in first, Mitt Romney was second, Rick Santorum, who ultimately won, was at five-percent. So, all this kind of bloviation about where the polls are, not just to us but everybody is a bit much and I think people have to take it into some perspective. You make a doubly good point, which is Iowa has not being a precursor of how somebody's going to do down the road. Again, for Trump, when your calling card is I'm a winner, and if you lose, that changes everything in people's eyes.</p><p>JONATHAN HILSENRATH, EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Can I jump in here? What struck me about these latest polls is that Ted Cruz is moving up. I want to hear both of you -- what you have to say about Ted Cruz and whether he's ready to make his move and whether such a move is sustainable?</p><p>HOOK: Senator Cruz has been hanging back and taking a very kind of slow and steady approach to the campaign and you know, somebody like Senator Cruz could play very well in Iowa but then when you see the other states that follow, New Hampshire, South Carolina and down the line, it gets a little trickier.</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: I would actually disagree a little bit, Bryan. Can I - if I don't mind. I predicted on your air, Sandra, with Maria, probably six weeks ago, that Cruz was the one to keep your eye on in this regard, I predict that Trump and Carson will crater. I think Cruz has a good shot at gutting kind of the evangelicals, the libertarians when Rand Paul goes away -</p><p>SMITH: If you're predict - if you're predicting that Dr. Carson will crater, we've heard your views on Trump, I'm going to force you to tell me why is Dr. Carson gaining so much in the polls right now.</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: So people say there's this whole outsider thing. That's just among Republicans, right? Democrats aren't showing any affection for outsiders and I think there's -- it's the same reason that tea party people are so angry with Congress. They are living kind of almost in an alternate reality that somehow or another, a guy like Carson, they just want to think that somehow there's something pure about him that's going to fix everything. It's, again, untethered from reality, but that would be my explanation for why Carson has this boom right now, because people just want to believe in those caucuses out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Richard, the democrats are showing benefit quite a bit of affection, in terms of money, at least, to -</p><p>SMITH: Bernie Sanders.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- to Bernie Sanders.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes, that's the socialist. He's a bit of an outside the mainstream in Washington.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No question. No question.</p><p>SMITH: Bryan last word to you.</p><p>HOOK: You're going to see continual movement around here. I also think you're going to see Ben Carson's change, probable quite a lot between now and when the first vote is cast in the Iowa caucuses.</p><p>SMITH: All right, good stuff. Bryan Hook and Richard Goodstein, thanks.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I will just quickly point out that Trump referred to the media as scum and horrible people so that made me feel good.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But meanwhile we spend every segment talking about the guy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly, so where would he be without these --</p><p>HILSENRATH: We love what he's doing for our ratings.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The horrible scum that we are.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH: All right, thank you, Gentlemen. Fox Business is teaming up with the \"Wall Street Journal\" to give you a Republican Debate focused on the economy, business and your money. Be sure to tune in on November 10th when the Republican candidates take the stage in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. You can only see that right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>I want to say thank you, Gentlemen. I was talking to our remote guests. Thank you, Dagen. Thank you, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Are you saying I'm not a gentleman?</p><p>SMITH: Moving on - oh, I can't win this morning. It must be Tuesday. Big tech earnings to look at this morning. Alibaba is scheduled to report before the bell, while Apple and Twitter are set to release results after the bell tonight. Everybody will be watching those. Estimates right now calling for Alibaba to post earnings per share .54 cents on revenues of $3.35 billion. Apple looking to beat Wall Street estimates for the fifth straight time. Investors will be focused on Iphone sales during the quarter and its forecast for the holidays. Twitter earnings puts the spotlight on newly minted CEO, Jack Dorsey. Since taking the reigns permanently this month, Dorsey has cut eight-percent of the company's workforce and donated a third of his stock to the employee equity pool.</p><p>Any big surprises that you're looking for today? Apple is going to be a big one to watch, obviously, and the fact that we are talking about the holidays when we are looking at all the earnings, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I'm certainly looking for Apple because the President of the Atlanta Fed has been saying this too, I want to see how consumers are holding up. There have been a lot of headwinds hitting the American economy. We've had a volatile stock market. We've had a stronger dollar, which is hurting exports. The big question for this economy is are consumers spending money? And we will see that if they're out buying Iphones.</p><p>SMITH: And it's shocking too, -- well, maybe not. As an economist you can tell me if I should be shocked, but here we have these low oil low prices, low gasoline prices and still we are not seeing the consumer spend that money elsewhere.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Not only that but we have unemployment rate coming down to nearly five -percent.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We have in American public that was scared by a very deep recession and slow recovery and people are reluctant to go out -</p><p>MCDOWELL: amazon is going to have record sales this holiday season.</p><p>SMITH: And FedEx says that they're going to have record shipments. So, people are shopping, it's just not necessarily -</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Mickey D's and Starbucks hit new all time highs in the stock market yesterday.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I don't know if McDonald's it's a great barometer for how aggressive Americans are spending.</p><p>[laughter]</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- but the other one I'm looking at is Ford. I think Ford - we are having a car boom right now, a car sales boom.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: That's going to be an important one to watch.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So much that GM has given workers a raise, finally.</p><p>SMITH: All right, we are going to have more on that a little bit. Up next watch out for falling prices and drones. Why Wal-Mart wants to get into the drone delivery. Do you want one of these showing up in your doorstep?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No.</p><p>SMITH: The United States sending a warship near one of China's artificial islands in the South China Sea. Cheryl Casone's following this story and more for us this morning. Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Sandra; good morning. Good morning, everyone. Defense Department officials say that a U.S. Navy Destroyer entered waters near the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea last night. The U.S. Lassen is armed with tomahawk missiles. This move is a direct challenge to China's claims that the artificial island chain is within its territorial boarders.</p><p>More than 300 people are dead after a 7.5 magnitude hit northeastern Afghanistan. Most of the deaths reported were in Pakistan, but tremors from the quake were also felt in northern India and Tajikistan. The death toll is set to rise, as the most severely affected areas are so remote that communications have been cut off.</p><p>Finally, the battle of the drones is heating up. This time it's Wal-Mart. The retailer applying to test drones, home delivery, curbside pickup and checking warehouse inventories. This move is a sign that the retailer plans to go head-to-head with amazon who has been vocal about their plans. Amazon says they're going to be ready to deliver these packages as soon as federal rules allow. That is the question mark because the FAA right, has to, you know, come together with the regulations. They're not even talking about beginning a framework, regulatory framework until 2016, at the earliest. So we can talk about delivery all we want. Are we going to see a drone in our doorstep? It's going to be a while.</p><p>SMITH: Right, so we're waiting on the air traffic control regulations these things, right, so they are not running into each other as they drop of your paper towels on your front door. I don't know, is that the goal?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just can't get my head around this how they would execute this, particularly in a crowded urban area. I don't understand - and growing up in a very rural area, that wouldn't make sense either. I don't under - I don't' get it.</p><p>SMITH: What do you think, Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH: There's a lot of suburb in the middle, and it looks like the FAA is moving towards allowing more and more of this, according to our story today on this, the FAA, it has issued already 2,000 approvals for testing and use of drones and commercial settings in different ways. What do I think of it? I think it's great. I think it's economic progress. It's an example of companies finding new ways to become more efficient.</p><p>SMITH: And it's exciting.</p><p>HILSENRATH: As creepy as it might feel -</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- because -</p><p>CASONE: No, it's dangerous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It just feels, with the volume of packages that some of these businesses ship, I don't understand how they would actually execute it.</p><p>(Cross talk)</p><p>CASONE: This is the war that's brewing though, between pilots, between the FAA, the air traffic controllers and the companies. I mean, it's a great business idea -</p><p>MCDOWELL: The FAA can't keep up as technology develops.</p><p>CASONE: -- but you already have pilots saying, Dagen, that they're seeing these drones and that they are - the minute one goes into an engine this whole story changes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But those are recreational drones that they've had the biggest problem --</p><p>CASONE: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- which now the FAA is requiring to be registered. A commercial drone would be less of a threat.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Dagen, when you look at a company like amazon or Wal-Mart, they have vast logistic organizations, --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- their job is to figure out how to make these things work at a lower cost than how to deal with -</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't want my skies filled with these.</p><p>SMITH: So just to Dagen's point, they're going to test this out in small residential neighborhoods first, that's according to the Wal-Mart, --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well they're also going to test it out in parking lots.</p><p>SMITH: -- and they're going to get permission from those living in the flight path, from the truck to the homes in that area. So it's complicated but it sounds like they --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, test them in parking lots because I'm too lazy to get out of my car and go into the Wal-Mart.</p><p>SMITH: I am.</p><p>HILSENRATH: This is progress.</p><p>SMITH: We have to go. Jon Hilsenrath says this is economic progress. We'll keep watching it. Coming up, investors waiting for the Federal Reserve's first rate hike in nearly a decade. I know somebody we can talk to about that.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>SMITH: We'll show you why you will not need to worry about that. We're keeping it simple for you right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>SMITH: All right, welcome back. Let's get a quick check on markets this morning. Futures right now pointing to a selloff on Wall Street, a small one. We are looking a small fraction of percentage losses across the board there.</p><p>One hot topic investors are watching this week is the Federal Reserve. The central Bank on the verge of raising interest rates for the first time in years, but Jon Hilsenrath is here and he says consumers have nothing to fear because mortgage rates will stay low for quite some time. So you need to break this down for us and keep it simple.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right, so we are paying a lot of attention what the Fed is going to do. I have written a million stories about it this year, but the bottom line is for two reasons interest rates are going to stay low even after the Fed starts raising them. First of all, the U.S. economy and global economy are still fairy weak. They are not going gang busters, and in an environment like that, the Fed can't raise interest a lot. They might push them a little bit but not moving very fast. The other thing is that the Fed has telegraphed, they've already told us that they don't expect to raise aggressively after they do this first move, because inflation is also very low. So we are going into a period where once we get this first move off the Fed's table, there's going to be a very slow progression of follow-up interest rate increases.</p><p>If you look back to the 2004-2006 period, the last time Fed raised interest rates, we actually didn't see much movement in mortgage rates. In fact, we got a housing boom while the fed was raising rates.</p><p>SMITH: I was going to say, so that first interest rate hike, might it take some that are on the sidelines, might it bring in some of that pent up demand, where they're going to fear interest rates going higher so they'll jump in on the first hike?</p><p>HILSENRATH: I don't think it's going to be fear. I think what's going to happen is that when the Fed does this, people are going to say, hey, the world didn't end. I can get on with my life. I can go out and refinance my mortgage or take out a mortgage for a home -- particularly in the markets, you know. I think the markets are going to realize that the world didn't end when the feds does this and they're going to get on with the party.</p><p>SMITH: It's a good time to refinance right now?</p><p>HILSENRATH: You should refinance when it's right for you. If it's an opportunity now, you should go ahead and do it.</p><p>SMITH: All right, Jon Hilsenrath, thank you for keeping it simple. We will be right back.</p><p>SMITH: Good morning, everyone. I'm Sandra Smith, Maria Bartiromo is off this morning. It is Tuesday, October 27, and with me this hour fox Business', Dagen McDowell, and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He said I was cranky this morning.</p><p>SMITH: He did?</p><p>MCDOWELL: He did. He's like, what's wrong with you? You're cranky. I said, no, I'm just disagreeing with you.</p><p>HILSENRATH: She's hating on drones.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I disagreed with you, there's a difference.</p><p>SMITH: Who said Tuesdays aren't fun? All right, these are your top stories at 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news: a debt deal on Capitol Hill.

Alibaba scheduled to report earnings before the bell. Apple and Twitter are said to release results after the bell. We will also get September's Durable Goods orders which are expected to drop 1.2 percent as well as look at the housing market. Case-Shiller home price index will be out. Joining us to break all this down is Vining Sparks' Chief Economist Craig Dismuke. Welcome to you, Craig.</p><p>CRAIG DISMUKE, VINING SPARKS CHIEF ECONOMIST: Good morning.</p><p>SMITH: Alright, so, what are we looking for this morning? What is hot on your agenda?</p><p>DISMUKE: There are important reports, but right now everything is secondary to the inflation data. That is the real big elephant in a room kind of thing. Especially, with Fed policy and what is the Fed going to do. But in the durable-goods report, I expect we will see headline level orders expected to be down because of aircraft. Below that at the core level they're expected to be flat. What is most important will be the Capital goods orders report and specifically not a month over month basis because you get a little of noise on quarter over quarter basis. Orders have been pretty good. They're up 9.75 percent. That is their tracking for the quarter. Pointing for business investment being stronger in the future so that is good news. It's a good sign a business investment is stronger. If you look at the shipment of those items, they're up 2.75 percent quarter over quarter which point to business investment being of 2.75.</p><p>SMITH: Well, you obviously looked at these numbers closely. Much closer than any of us. Broadly speaking, where are we as far as economic progress in this recovery? Are we strengthening? And if we are, how slow or fast is it?</p><p>DISMUKE: I don't think we are strengthening. And John's point earlier, he mentioned the consumer is so key right now. This has been about the consumer driving economic growth and there have been phases to this recovery/expansion where different parts of the economy are driving activity. Right now, business investment has been weak, so it's down almost 5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. It was flat in the second quarter of this year.</p><p>Business investment has been up and down but overall, it's been weak. It is good news that business investment is a little bit better. That's positive. But at the end of the day, the consumer is what is key and it is an important report but I think it's secondary to what is happening with the consumer and then again with inflation.</p><p>JOHN HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Craig, I need you to settle a friendly disagreement between Dagen and me here about the housing market. We're getting home price data coming up. I say the housing market is strong and getting stronger. And she says it is garbage outside a few metro areas. What is your verdict and what are we going to see in the home price data that come out later today? Did I characterize your point of view?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST: Yes. And you used the word garbage (inaudible).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DISMUKE: It is home prices have been fairly strong, very little inventory. There's construction costs going up. Labor costs going up a little bit in housing. Lumber prices are down. Prices are generally going up. It is very -- the housing data is enigmatic right now. We are getting some weak data. Existing home sales better than expected last month. New home sales down 11.5 percent.</p><p>We keep getting this up and down activity. So, I would say in general housing market is trending better. But, there is that challenge and the challenge is if you look at 2013 when mortgage rates rose 90 basis points, housing total sales fell 13 percent. So, that was unusual. To see that drop from a 90 basis point increase. So, you look at what is different in the housing market today than in previous cycles. The biggest difference today is when you look at the number of owner occupied units which are down $2 million in 2005 and rent occupied units which are $10 million since 2006. Which is not good because people who rent cars don't wash them. I have never washed one.</p><p>Some people who rent houses or rent multifamily places aren't going to make a capital investment where they are living that we had when we had more of an ownership society so long term as a challenge.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We saw in the Glass-Steagall people over invested in those homes and wasted capital in the process. And a lot of other countries you don't have as much emphasis on home ownership. And they have perfectly civil society.</p><p>DISMUKE: Sure, but their economic growth is not as strong as we saw when we had more of a homeownership society. When you own something you take more pride in it and you're going to invest in it. And so, I think, in long-term it will be a different housing market. The peak housing was 6.2 percent.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Also, demographics at play here.</p><p>DISMUKE: That's a big one. The aging population is a demographic issue. It doesn't get enough focus at this point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like buying homes and selling it though.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: I don't think seniors are going to start trashing their homes. It's a different dynamic.</p><p>SMITH: Almost like those houses are maintained to higher standard because they are turned over so often and have to be maintained. That is the discussion for another day. Craig, great stuff. Thank you. Interesting perspective. John, you win.</p><p>MCDOWELL: John just leaned in and said I was right</p><p>SMITH: Alright. JP Morgan with its own mobile payment platform to rival existing services like Apple Paid. Nicole Petallides has that story this morning. Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST: That's right. The country's largest bank is stepping into the ring with the world's most valuable company. JP Morgan is the latest investor in the mobile payments based announcing Chase Pay, a platform that will allow Chase customers to make retail purchases using their smart phone. Creating a direct competitor to Apple Pay. JP Morgan says it has already won the endorsement of a major group of merchants giving it a leg up on the tech savvy rivals. So, the question is are consumers ready to use their phones, smart phones, ditch the credit cards and what happened to cash is king?</p><p>SMITH: Anybody use Apple Pay?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have signed up for it but I don't know how to use it in stores.</p><p>PETALLIDES: Using your smart phone will be the preferred method of payment. I mean, I just got used to using my debit card in the taxi. Just got out of using cash. This is the wave of the future and there is Apple Pay, Chase Pay credit cards.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: A total shift back to cash because everyone is afraid of the paper trail using credit cards and people accessing their data and now, we're going to be even more exposed with all this going on to our smart phones.</p><p>HILSENRATH: There isn't going to be. We see where it is going. People moving more towards mobile payments. And cash. I could go weeks without using my cash.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's why I use a credit card over cash and smart phones. Because I use cash. If I have more than $20, I will drop it and lose it. HILSENRATH: I call it bonus bucks when I discover cash.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If I lose it, it usually comes back. I have a tendency to drop it. And with a credit card I keep one credit card in my pocket.</p><p>SMITH: You guys must not be good tippers. How can you go through New York City without a few bucks in your pocket? Not that kind.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You add the tip. You don't have to worry about signing a form.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: This is just to bring it back to drones. This is like drones. This is progress when we see new ways of making payments.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I fully believe (inaudible)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETALLIDES: Be honest here. It's unbelievable. This is the wave of the future. Kids staying with babysitters and nannies demand it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: Alright.

Discussions are reportedly under way between the two sides and how Bill De Blasio backing Clinton will be announced.</p><p>And according to a recent survey, 49 percent of streaming on demand users ages 8 to 29 share at least one account with someone outside of their home.</p><p>HBO and other video providers might not encourage password sharing, but they also don't track it. And we know it happens all the time. You give your log information to a friend of a friend or your parents, your neighbor and they use the service. They can't track it. This proliferates.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So, how is that different from me leaving my newspaper at the airport and someone picking it up and reading it?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's one newspaper. Not thousands of movies.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But you're only sharing a password with one friend.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How much revenue if they get shared around a lot more. Netflix, they have subscriptions where you get the family plan or two log ins.</p><p>CASONE: This really hurts HBO and Showtime and HULU. And they don't have a way to know your giving your password to whether people. For all they know you have the computer going in one room and your TV going and it is you. The same as if you have a wall street journal log on and share it with somebody.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: You will always get leakage and you have to live with it. To the extent that it makes your friend or your relative that much more interested than your Hulu (inaudible)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Leakage in the digital world is much greater than in the paper world.</p><p>HILSENRATH: It has always been there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's always been there, but Sandra. She is about to lose her stuff.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SMITH: Thanks Dagen.</p><p>CASONE: All fair point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: I don't share my password with anyone. (CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The word retailers use to describe the thievery or shoplifting.</p><p>SMITH: Alright. Athletes and parents beware the artificial turf at thousands of schools and parks around the country could be dangerous. The New York Times did this story a year ago. A lot of people still talking about it and surprised by it. Find out what is behind the latest health scare on this turf. Straight ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Top headlines in the Wall Street Journal. After years of decline, U.S. imports on the rise as low oil prices forced domestic producers to scale back supplies. Phil Flynn and the CME group. So, Phil, long story short, we are not producing as much here so we are having to buy it there and bring it in. Is that what is happening?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, CME GROUP: Well, that's exactly what is happening and we are losing the OPECSaudi Arabia started. What we are seeing is these other OPEC oil producers, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia are cutting prices, driving our guys out of business. This is what Saudi rate wanted to do. Can they sustain this price war? We know they are having big financial problems in these countries.</p><p>They can't continue to cut prices below our producers. The quality of the oil they are getting. Our refiners are used to refining Saudi oil and Nigerian oil. The shale oil is a little more difficult for them to refine because it is such a high-quality type of oil. They are not used to doing it, better off to export.</p><p>The other big story, natural gas, lowest price in three years. We broke below $2, 1 million metric BTUs. Winter might have been canceled because warm weather forecasts driving prices lower.</p><p>SMITH: This is part of the deal that was reached late last night. U.S. is planning to sell millions of barrels of crude oil from our strategic petroleum reserve from 2018 through 2025 under the budget deal reached last night. This is the second time the U.S. has raised cash from the reserve. Notable event?</p><p>FLYNN: It is a very notable event. It's basically showing we don't need the strategic petroleum reserve. We have a new reserve called North Dakota. The global energy market is changing. The other thing when you look at selling oil from the reserve, from the policy when we were worried about peak oil and the Middle East cutting off power supply. Now they're burying us with supplies.</p><p>SMITH: And the report shows a link with green artificial turf and cancer. Questions have been raised about synthetic fiber and scrap tire that makes up the surface. There's the belief that the tiny black rubber crimson the surface which have been known to contain carcinogens and chemicals can make people sick. However, there is no scientific data to prove the connection between the two. Okay, John. Your son plays football and lacrosse on turf.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Plays on turf all the time. My two sons and my daughter play on turf all the time. Frankly, there are a lot of other things that happen on those fields I worry about a lot more. When there's no scientific evidence to back it up. You worry about concussions and other injuries. I want to see some hard evidence before I put this on the list of things to worry about.</p><p>SMITH: We were living on asphalt green, so fun to play on it but it made you think all the little black or brown pellets in the turf. You get up and it's all over you. Amazing. It gets in their mouths, makes you wonder.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have bruises, doing a workout in the last few days. I think maybe you ought to worry about feeding your kids bacon and hot dogs if you are worried about cancer before you worry about artificial turf. Based on the Wall Street Journal today. That is the big deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Red meat tied to cancer. Pay a little more attention because there is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: Most of these reports is more correlation than causation.</p><p>HILSENRATH: The health organizations study is more scientific and I haven't looked at it but I would think they're close it to causation and correlation. The other problem here is every couple of weeks there is a news story telling us you need to worry about this or that. Americans are over worried with worried lists.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You ought to worry. Women getting lung cancer who never smoked is on the rise. Even as the numbers of people who are not smoking in this country are declining. And yet, they have to figure out what it is called.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But, you can stop doing everything. You got to figure out what is causing it and respond to that. You can't stop going on artificial turf.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: Russell investments Steven Wood joins us to weigh in on a big day of tech earnings. Plus, former treasury secretary David Malpass with his thoughts on a potential budget deal. We have a great couple hours coming up. Stay tuned.</p><p>SMITH: Sandra Smith in for Maria Bartiroma. With me is Fox Business's Dagen McDowell and Wall Street Journal Chief Economic Correspondent Jon Hilsenrath. But, first your top stories breaking news. A debt deal on Capitol Hill and congressional leaders reaching an agreement on a two- year budget deal that also extends the debt limit. But it could be problematic for his likely replacement congressional Congressman Paul Ryan over concerns from conservatives who will not support raising the debt limit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DARRELL ISSA, CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN-REPUBLICAN: We are about the transition to a new speaker. It is important that we have the speaker to be Ryan, what leadership role. It was the combination of the majority but you need to to have the new speaker in the lead in this process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: <person><nameText>Donald Trump

WASHINGTON -- Powerful technology compa...</p><p>By John D. McKinnon and Ryan Tracy   This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (September 18, 2020).    WASHINGTON -- Powerful technology companies are expected to face increased scrutiny no matter who wins the Nov. 3 election, but President Trump and challenger Joe Biden differ on some of the problems posed by Big Tech and how to solve them.    In a second term, Mr. Trump and his appointees likely would maintain -- and possibly accelerate -- the broad-scale regulatory scrutiny of technology companies that marked his first term. That effort has included allegations of anticonservative bias online, antitrust investigations of internet giants such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc., and actions against Chinese-owned apps such as TikTok and WeChat.    Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee, has also been critical of Big Tech's market power. He and running mate Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) say they would support stricter antitrust oversight and online privacy rules. But the Biden camp has emphasized forcing social-media companies to better police their sites against false information, and taking government action to help workers under threat from innovations such as self-driving cars.    With Congress also focused on Big Tech, both candidates are likely to take a hand in legislative efforts to increase competition in digital markets, expand broadband access and protect consumers' privacy.    \"The hands-off approach is gone, regardless of who wins the election,\" said Gene Kimmelman, a former Obama administration antitrust official who recently co-wrote a paper calling for a new agency to regulate large digital platforms.    Antitrust    The Obama administration -- in which Mr. Biden served as vice president -- developed a tech-friendly reputation, hiring Silicon Valley veterans for key posts and declining to pursue antitrust complaints against Google and others. Some conservative and progressive tech critics alike worry that a Biden administration would take up that stance again, settling any antitrust cases brought by the Trump administration on lenient terms.    Biden campaign spokesman Matt Hill declined to comment on the prospect for settling antitrust cases, but suggested Mr. Biden would be tough.    \"Joe Biden has long said one of the greatest sins is the abuse of power, \" Mr. Hill said. \"Many technology giants and their executives have not only abused their power, but misled the American people, damaged our democracy, and evaded any form of responsibility. That ends with a President Biden.\"    The Trump campaign says leniency ended with the incumbent's 2016 election. The Justice Department in the Trump administration has been investigating Google for potential anticompetitive conduct in its search and advertising business, and is expected to file a case before the election that likely would carry over into 2021 and beyond. The Federal Trade Commission is also investigating tech companies for potential antitrust violations, including preparing a possible lawsuit against Facebook.    During the Democratic primary, Mr. Biden didn't join progressives calling to break up Big Tech firms, saying it would be premature to do so before a formal investigation. This summer, a policy task force Mr. Biden created with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, his final Democratic primary opponent, recommended breaking up companies for anticompetitive behavior \"as a last resort.\"    Nevertheless, Mr. Biden has said that antitrust enforcement hasn't been strong enough and that tech firms deserve a hard look from the federal agencies that oversee competition.    Mr. Trump hasn't called for tech breakups either, though that is one possible outcome of the continuing antitrust investigations.    Tech's liability shield    A particular focus for a second Trump term would be legislation to scale back protections social-media companies enjoy under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which gives them broad legal immunity for posted content and their efforts to moderate it. Mr. Trump says the law has been used to censor conservative viewpoints.    Mr. Trump called for repeal of Section 230 in a Sept. 8 tweet, echoing a position Mr. Biden took earlier this year with a very different motivation. Even so, the law is considered foundational to the internet and has bipartisan support.    Mr. Trump ordered regulatory agencies this year to consider tougher oversight of online companies under Section 230 when they don't moderate users' speech fairly or fail to live up to their promises relating to free speech.    \"It's become evident that Big Tech believes they are the arbiters of truth online -- but they have a clear blind spot when it comes to their bias against conservative voices,\" said Samantha Zager, a Trump campaign spokeswoman. \"President Trump will continue to advocate for an internet that embraces free speech over censorship.\"    As a sign of the issue's importance to the White House, Mr. Trump recently withdrew the renomination of a Republican commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission after he expressed concern about the legal basis for Mr. Trump's tougher line on Section 230. The White House has also pressured the Republican chairman of the FTC, Joseph Simons, to take more action to support the effort, according to people familiar with the matter.    Mr. Biden surprised the tech world when he called for revoking Section 230. But unlike conservatives, Mr. Biden says some social-media platforms do too little policing, not too much.    His campaign website devoted an entire page to criticizing Facebook and its relatively hands-off policy when it comes to policing political speech. Some critics say that policy benefits Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden has termed the company irresponsible.    Mr. Biden hasn't outlined what new policy might replace Section 230, but he appears to want social-media companies to be more active, not less, in taking down content -- especially what the Biden campaign views as false information promoted by pro-Trump groups. Facebook says it is important to allow voters to see the statements of political candidates.    Mr. Trump and other Republicans have their own frustrations with Facebook, which has removed some Trump campaign ads and some of the president's statements about the coronavirus.    But they have also at times praised the company's decisions, such as when it declined to join rivals such as Twitter Inc. in labeling and shielding from public view a post from Mr. Trump about violent protests.    Job protections    Mr. Biden has expressed concerns about the potential impacts of many tech innovations, such as self-driving vehicles, on people with middle-class jobs. \"Whether your predictions are true about automation and self-driving trucks, these folks aren't stupid,\" he said in a speech in 2018 at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \"They listen, they understand and they're scared to death.\" Among Mr. Biden's proposed solutions are such ideas as providing extra government aid to help workers who have been dislocated by tech.    The former vice president has also been outspoken about using government regulation to force \"gig economy\" businesses to pay benefits to their independent contractors, by reclassifying them as employees.    California adopted such a law last year and debate continues about its efficacy. Ride-hailing companies have said their drivers aren't covered, while state legislators modified the law in response to job losses in other industries.    In a New York Times interview early this year, Mr. Biden described meeting as vice president with tech leaders -- \"little creeps,\" he called them -- touting their industry's economic benefit.    \"'You have fewer people on your payroll than all the losses that General Motors just faced in the last quarter, of employees. So don't lecture me about how you've created all this employment,'\" Mr. Biden said he responded.    The Trump campaign said policies like California's gig-worker law \"take away workers' opportunity to make their own schedules and participate in a free and open gig economy.\"    The Labor Department, which is led by a Trump appointee, last year said people offering services on online sites or apps should be considered employees of the consumer who hires them, not the virtual marketplace. That policy could make it harder for gig workers to win labor disputes.    The Trump administration has also sought to expand the availability of worker training through apprenticeships, in part by making it easier for businesses to run their own apprentice programs.

Continue reading Both parties are mad about a proposal for federal anti-bias certification</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yesterday, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) unveiled legislation called  Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act,  which would shake up the legal foundation of the internet in an effort to root out online bias. Under the proposed law, companies like Facebook and Twitter would be required to obtain a government certification that they are not making politically biased decisions about content moderation, in exchange for liability protections they currently receive automatically.</p><p>Hawley's bill would amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives companies legal protection from what users post on platforms. That provision is often seen as a fundamental part of the internet, and has been described as the law that allowed social media as we know it to flourish. The law has taken a beating lately, however, as some lawmakers, like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), call for overhauling 230. Democrats like Nancy Pelosi have also questioned the law, with the House speaker recently saying it's  in jeopardy. </p><p>But if Hawley hoped to tap into some of that discontent with his bill, it hasn't happened. Lawmakers in both parties, as well as liberal and conservative groups more broadly, largely slammed the idea, calling it a dystopian plan to regulate speech online and an unworkable act of government overreach. Here's a rundown of the responses from the past day:</p><p>The senator who wrote 230</p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) was one of the original authors of Section 230, and defended the law against Hawley's plan. In a statement, the senator said the plan  will turn the federal government into Speech Police, flagrantly violating the First Amendment,  and  would force every platform to become 4chan or 8chan rather than maintain some basic level of decency.  He went on to say that  Trump's Republican party seems to believe that lawyers and bureaucrats should tell private companies how to make clearly private business decisions. </p><p>Ron Wyden</p><p>@RonWyden</p><p>.@HawleyMO s bill to require government oversight of online speech will turn the federal government into Speech Police, flagrantly violating the First Amendment.

Joshua Wright, a former Republican commissioner who left the agency in 2015, said in a series of tweets that  the bill quite literally injects a board of bureaucrats into millions of decisions about internet content.  He called the idea  central planning. </p><p> But the truth is that there is a ton of consumer surplus here arising from voluntary exchange in social media platforms,  Wright wrote.  I'm old enough to remember conservatives being into that kind of thing. </p><p>Joshua Wright</p><p>@ProfWrightGMU</p><p>\u00b7 Jun 19, 2019Replying to @ProfWrightGMU</p><p>Both approaches are remarkably short sighted in my view. The antitrust  break up  approach requires both undermining markets, consumer sovereignty, and the rule of law to achieve some political end.</p><p>Joshua Wright</p><p>@ProfWrightGMU</p><p>The Hawley Bill similarly offers the choice of death by bureaucratic board or the plaintiffs' bar. Yes, this will impose big costs on social media. That might feel good to some conservatives politicians.

I get that conservatives are frustrated about bias shown in decisions to ban or suspend users,  Klein writes,  but this response would only lead to a more restrictive speech code. </p><p>Tech think tanks</p><p>The nonprofit Open Technology Institute, part of the left-leaning think tank New America, said there are reasonable concerns about tech industry moderation practices, but that Hawley's bill wasn't the way to handle them. The group said  the concept of a  politically neutral' platform is a broad, undefined one that creates an artificial, unmeasurable standard for platforms to meet. </p><p>Industry groups</p><p>While tech companies have largely stayed silent on the proposal, industry trade groups came out in force against the plan. The Internet Association, which represents major platform companies like Facebook and Google, said in a statement that the bill  forces platforms to make an impossible choice: either host reprehensible, but First Amendment protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal content like human trafficking and violent extremism. </p><p>NetChoice, an e-commerce association that also includes major tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon, said the bill would turn the internet into  a hub of extremism,  and  embolden extreme political movements, such as the KKK.  The Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association called the plan  ludicrous,  comparing it to 1984.</p><p>Conservative groups</p><p>Right-leaning groups also slammed the legislation. The libertarian group TechFreedom said  the bill would give politicians a gigantic regulatory hammer to use against Big Tech,  and giving the FTC certification power  would set up a partisan bloodmatch every other year. </p><p>The Koch brothers-funded political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity was also critical of the plan, calling it  misguided  and saying it potentially  creates a scenario where government has the ability to police your speech and determine what you can or cannot say online. </p><p>The Media Research Center, a conservative group set up to combat a perceived liberal bias in the media, was one of the few right-leaning organizations that threw support behind the plan, saying it was  the first major step toward holding tech giants like Facebook, Google and Twitter accountable. </p><p>Tags:<url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/373164/\">\u00a0</url></p><p>See Campaign:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18692829/section-230-hawley-bill-response-anti-bias-certification\">https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18692829/section-230-hawley-bill-response-anti-bias-certification</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Colin Lecher<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/artificial-intelligence-newswire/\">Artificial Intelligence Newswire</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp1549552</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WD3-14G1-F08D-540F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1514\"/><timeReceived>5:40 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 21, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Big Tech is about to learn this lesson, if it hasn't already.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elizabeth Warren is out with a headline-grabbing proposal to break up Big Tech companies, the sort of overly ambitious government plan that once would have engendered knee-jerk Republican opposition. Not anymore. Who says we all can't get along?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When the senator tweeted her (understandable) objection that Facebook had taken down her ads attacking Facebook and other tech companies, Ted Cruz agreed that the companies have too much power.</p><p>Tech is caught in a right-left pincer. Conservatives don't like these companies because they are owned and operated by sanctimonious Silicon Valley liberals subject to the worst sort of groupthink. Progressives don't like them because they are colossal profit-making enterprises.</p><p>That's why there is some chance Washington might get together and, along the lines Warren proposes, effectively outlaw the business models of some of the most successful and iconic American companies.</p><p>Warren's idea to cleave off the platforms of the tech companies and have them run as \"platform utilities\" separate from the rest of their business is unworkable and is justified by a series of errors and misjudgments.</p><p>It's not true, as Warren asserts, that the antitrust suit against Microsoft in the 1990s opened up the space for Google and Facebook to thrive. Microsoft never got the internet and left the space open for Google and Facebook all by itself, as often happens with a large incumbent wedded to its business model.</p><p>She charges that tech companies use mergers to limit competition and cites Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp. It's hard to discern the harm here. When the social network bought it, WhatsApp was available for a fee. Now it's free, and more people use it than ever. What's the problem?</p><p>She calls out Google for allegedly killing off its competitors by burying them in its searches. It's not obvious that Google actually does this, although its search business inherently involves constantly making choices to try to best serve what people want to see. No government regulator is going to improve Google's searches, or is qualified to even try.</p><p>Warren's proposal is obviously formulated without taking any account of the interests of consumers, who are the ones who made the tech companies so large.</p><p>Why does Google provide for free a tool without which it's impossible to imagine contemporary life? Because it can monetize it with advertising. Without the advertising, which Warren insists should be a separate business, Google has no incentive to devote engineers to improving its search engine.</p><p>By the same token, no one will welcome iPhones that no longer come with or sell Apple apps. And would people really appreciate having to go to two different Amazons, one just a platform, one selling Amazon products?</p><p>This is all silly, as are the mergers that Warren pledges to reverse, including Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods. Amazon doesn't have anything close to a monopoly in food retail. Rather than taking over the sector, it's spurring investment and innovation. The nation's largest supermarket chain, Kroger, was slated to increase its spending on investment 200 percent in 2018.</p><p>The tech giants aren't stand-pat companies. Amazon alone spent more than $22 billion on investment in 2017. The development of autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and voice recognition wouldn't be nearly as advanced if it weren't for the research of the tech companies. The behemoth of yesteryear, General Electric, isn't making these investments.</p><p>None of this is to deny genuine concerns about tech companies. They need rules for content that honor the spirit of the First Amendment, and perhaps there should be tighter regulations around privacy. But any real offenses should be addressed with fixes directed at specific conduct, rather than with a massive politically imposed reorganization.</p><p>That's a very bad idea, and if you had any doubt, watch it get a respectful hearing from both sides in Washington.</p><p>Rich Lowry is editor of National Review.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5c8bf6421af0cimage\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FILE - In this Nov. 13, 2018, file photo, employees walk through a lobby at Amazon's headquarters in Seattle.

Hertzberg's hatred of bots is personal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hertzberg is a state Senator from California and last year, after he introduced a bail reform bill, he noticed that automated accounts on Twitter and Facebook were attacking him and his position. He is currently seeking re-election and one of his opponents in the Democratic primary was a bail agent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The bail agents against me had hundreds of bots working in order to create the false impression that there were people against me,\" Hertzberg said in a recent interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For example, he said, one account rapidly responded to tweets about the bill in real time with the message: \"Unconstitutional bail reform doesn't work and is racist.\"</p><p>So Hertzberg introduced another bill this year, the first of its kind in the United States, that would compel automated social media accounts to identify themselves as bots \u2014 in other words, to disclose their nonpersonhood.</p><p>Because bots are only effective if they seem convincingly human. Right?</p><p>Depending on how you define them, bots have been around since before most of us were using the internet. Their presence online was considered fairly benevolent, if considered at all, until 2016, when they were among the host of factors used to explain away the election of President Donald Trump.</p><p>Pranks</p><p>Since then, bots have become, for many people, a digital bogeyman, a viral weapon that can be wielded to influence political opinions, fool advertisers, prank unknowing social media users and get bad hashtags to trend. (They are also the lifeblood of many users we call influencers.)</p><p>Last week, Twitter announced it would remove tens of millions of suspicious accounts to crack down on the bots that can be bought (through third parties) by users who want to inflate the number of their followers. The company also said last month that it has been \"locking\" almost 10 million suspicious accounts per week and removing others for violating anti-spam policies.</p><p>Still, bots are easy to make and widely employed, and social media companies are under no legal obligation to get rid of them. A law that discourages their use could help, but experts aren't sure how the one Hertzberg is trying to push through, in California, might work.</p><p>For starters, would bots be forced to identify themselves in every Facebook post? In their Instagram bios? In their Twitter handles?</p><p>The measure, SB-1001, a version of which has already left the Senate floor and is working its way through the state's Assembly, also doesn't mandate that tech companies enforce the regulation. And it's unclear how a bill that is specific only to California would apply to a global internet.</p><p>Altering reality</p><p>Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, applauded the spirit of the law but was not as sold on its letter. \"This is groundbreaking legislation,\" he said. \"We are on a trajectory where reality, the very fabric of the information we see, can be altered in an unprecedented fashion. When that's done, as the law says, with an intent to mislead, that's a huge problem.\"</p><p>But \"you don't want to measure twice, regulate once,\" he said. \"You don't want to put the wrong laws on the books and have unintended consequences.\"</p><p>Jeremy Gillula, a technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who has been critical of the bill since its inception, said the first version was \"a little like trying to treat the flu using chemotherapy.\"</p><p>\"Not only will it not fix the thing you're trying to fix,\" he said earlier this month. \"It'll cause a lot of collateral damage at the same time.\"</p><p>The bill was drafted by Common Sense Media, a non-profit that provides consumer ratings about the age-appropriateness of movies and TV shows, in collaboration with the Center for Humane Technology, a group of former employees of big tech companies including Google and Facebook who have banded together to regulate their former employers.</p><p>Neither Hertzberg nor Jim Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, was overly concerned with criticism when interviewed about the bill in June. The senator called scepticism \"the drivel of people who want to stop progress.\" He said that the analysis he had seen had been influenced by lobbyists and was flat out wrong.</p><p>But after they were interviewed and the bill moved through the Assembly's committees, the content of the proposed law changed substantially. The definition of bot grew more precise (from \"online account\" to \"automated online account on an online platformem&gt;\"), /em&gt;and language that recommended an online platform for reporting bots was scrapped. Furthermore, the bill now asks only bots that are hoping to sell consumers good and services, or to influence votes in an election, to identify themselves as bots.</p><p>But even with the changes, the bill summons significant constitutional questions, said Ryan Calo, a co-director of the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington, and Madeline Lamo, a former fellow at the lab.</p><p>Lamo said that language in the bill about bots \"influencing a vote in an election\" ran into a problem that has plagued campaign finance regulations and election-related speech laws: It can be difficult to distinguish speech about political issues from speech explicitly intended to influence voters.</p><p>Furthermore, she noted, the bill was simply not crafted to address the problem it had in mind. Insofar as bots have had sway over political views, they have acted at scale, with thousands of automated accounts working to spread a diverse array of messages. It's hard to imagine, she said, that requiring individual accounts to identify themselves in a single state would do much to sap the strength of bot armies.</p><p>Lawmakers understanding of technology</p><p>All parties agree that the bill illustrates the difficulty that lawmakers have in crafting legislation that effectively addresses the problems constituents confront online. As the pace of technological development has raced ahead of government, the laws that exist on the books \u2014 not to mention some lawmakers' understandings of technology \u2014 have remained comparatively stagnant. And, as Twitter's action last week demonstrates, technology companies have the power to change dynamics on their platforms directly and at the scale that those problems require. Turning a bill into a law can take a long time. And then the law runs the risk of being inexact.</p><p>Calo cited as an example a driverless car law passed by Nevada in 2012, which met with protest from luxury carmakers. They were miffed that the technologies in their cars fell under the loosely drawn definition of autonomous vehicles. The bill was revised and passed the following year.</p><p>\"Embarrassingly it was the first definition of artificial intelligence I've ever seen in a state statute, and they had to strike it out and rewrite it,\" Calo said.</p><p>With the bot bill, he said, similar issues could crop up.</p><p>\"Political commentary comes in different forms,\" he said. \"Imagine a concerned citizen sets up a bot to criticise a particular official for failing to act on climate change. Now say that official runs for re-election. Is the concerned citizen now in violation of California law?\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Gillula said that the bill sought to address a problem that may have been somewhat overhyped.</p><p>\"I haven't seen anyone say conclusively that Russian bots swung the election,\" he said, noting that he was not an expert on US political discourse. \"Given that people are concerned but there is no conclusive smoking gun proof of concrete harm, I really hesitate to jump to 'let's get something because its such an emergency.'\"</p><p>But Hertzberg, who also has bills in the works addressing blockchain technology and cannabis banking, is undeterred. He said that his bot bill could have a big impact if passed in California, where so many tech companies are based.</p><p>\"The political industrial complex is designed to protect the status quo, not to invent the future,\" he said. \"Inventing the future means you have to think differently, be more inventive, be more creative.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-121372237</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SV3-BJF1-JDJN-6195-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1358\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

But how?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Robert M. Hertzberg\u2019s hatred of bots is personal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Hertzberg is a state Senator from California and last year, after he introduced a bail reform bill, he noticed that automated accounts on Twitter and Facebook were attacking him and his position. He is currently seeking re-election, and one of his opponents in the Democratic primary was a bail agent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThe bail agents against me had hundreds of bots working in order to create the false impression that there were people against me,\u201d Mr. Hertzberg said in a recent interview. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For example, he said, one account rapidly responded to tweets about the bill in real time with the message: \u201cUnconstitutional bail reform doesn\u2019t work and is racist.\u201d </p><p>So Mr. Hertzberg introduced another bill this year, the first of its kind in the United States, that would compel automated social media accounts to identify themselves as bots \u2014 in other words, to disclose their non-personhood. </p><p>Because bots are only effective if they seem convincingly human. Right? </p><p>Depending on how you define them, bots have been around <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abusix.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-bots-and-how-theyve-shaped-the-internet-today\">since before most of us were using the internet</url>. Their presence online was considered fairly benevolent, if considered at all, until 2016, when they were among the host of factors used to explain away the election of President Trump. </p><p>Since then, bots have become, for many people, a digital boogeyman, a viral weapon that can be wielded to influence political opinions, fool advertisers, prank unknowing social media users and get bad hashtags to trend. (They\u2019re also the lifeblood of many users we call <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html\">influencers</url>.)</p><p>Last week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/technology/twitter-fake-followers.html\">Twitter announced</url> it would remove tens of millions of suspicious accounts to crack down on the bots that can be bought (through third parties) by users who want to inflate the number of their followers. The company also said last month that it has been \u201clocking\u201d almost 10 million suspicious accounts per week and removing others for violating anti-spam policies.</p><p>Still, bots are easy to make and widely employed, and social media companies are under no legal obligation to get rid of them. A law that discourages their use could help, but experts aren\u2019t sure how the one Senator Hertzberg is trying to push through, in California, might work.</p><p>For starters, would bots be forced to identify themselves in every Facebook post? In their Instagram bios? In their Twitter handles?</p><p>The measure, <url normalizedValue=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1001\">SB-1001</url>, which has already passed the Senate and is working its way through the state\u2019s Assembly, also doesn\u2019t mandate that tech companies enforce the regulation. And it\u2019s unclear how a bill that is specific only to California would apply to a global internet. </p><p>Oren Etzioni, the chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, applauded the spirit of the law but was not as sold on its letter. \u201cThis is groundbreaking legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are on a trajectory where reality, the very fabric of the information we see, can be altered in an unprecedented fashion. When that\u2019s done, as the law says, with an intent to mislead, that\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d</p><p>But \u201cyou don\u2019t want to measure twice, regulate once,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to put the wrong laws on the books and have unintended consequences.\u201d </p><p>Jeremy Gillula, a technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who has been critical of the bill since its inception, said the first version was \u201ca little like trying to treat the flu using chemotherapy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot only will it not fix the thing you\u2019re trying to fix,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019ll cause a lot of collateral damage at the same time.\u201d </p><p>The bill was drafted by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that provides consumer ratings about the age-appropriateness of movies and TV shows, in collaboration with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/04/technology/early-facebook-google-employees-fight-tech.html\">the Center for Humane Technology</url>, a group of former employees of big tech companies including Google and Facebook who have banded together to regulate their former employers.</p><p>Neither Senator Hertzberg nor Jim Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, was overly concerned with criticism when interviewed about the bill in June. The senator called skepticism \u201cthe drivel of people who want to stop progress.\u201d He said that the analysis he had seen had been influenced by lobbyists and was flat out wrong. </p><p>But after they were interviewed and the bill moved through the Assembly\u2019s committees, the content of the proposed law changed substantially. The definition of bot grew more precise (from \u201conline account\u201d to \u201cautomated online account on an online platform\u201d), and language that recommended an online platform for reporting bots was scrapped. Furthermore, the bill now asks only bots that are hoping to sell consumers good and services, or to influence votes in an election, to identify themselves as bots.</p><p>But even with the changes, the bill summons significant constitutional questions, said Ryan Calo, a co-director of the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington, and Madeline Lamo, a former fellow at the lab. </p><p>Ms. Lamo said that language in the bill about bots \u201cinfluencing a vote in an election\u201d ran into a problem that has plagued campaign finance regulations and election-related speech laws: It can be difficult to distinguish speech about political issues from speech explicitly intended to influence voters.</p><p>Furthermore, she noted, the bill was simply not crafted to address the problem it had in mind. Insofar as bots have had sway over political views, they have acted at scale, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html\">thousands of automated accounts</url> working to spread a diverse array of messages. It\u2019s hard to imagine, she said, that requiring individual accounts to identify themselves in a single state would do much to sap the strength of bot armies.</p><p>All parties agree that the bill illustrates the difficulty that lawmakers have in crafting legislation that effectively addresses the problems constituents confront online. As the pace of technological development has raced ahead of government, the laws that exist on the books \u2014 not to mention, some lawmakers\u2019 understandings of technology \u2014 have remained comparatively stagnant. And, as Twitter\u2019s action last week demonstrates, technology companies have the power to change dynamics on their platforms directly, and at the scale that those problems require. Turning a bill into a law can take a long time. And then the law runs the risk of being inexact.</p><p>Mr. Calo cited as an example a driverless car law passed by Nevada in 2012, which met with protest from luxury carmakers. They were miffed that the technologies in their cars fell under the loosely drawn definition of autonomous vehicles. The bill was revised and passed the following year.</p><p>\u201cEmbarrassingly it was the first definition of artificial intelligence I\u2019ve ever seen in a state statute, and they had to strike it out and rewrite it,\u201d Mr. Calo said.</p><p>With the bot bill, he said, similar issues could crop up.</p><p>\u201cPolitical commentary comes in different forms,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine a concerned citizen sets up a bot to criticize a particular official for failing to act on climate change. Now say that official runs for re-election. Is the concerned citizen now in violation of California law?\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr. Gillula said that the bill sought to address a problem that may have been somewhat overhyped.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone say conclusively that Russian bots swung the election,\u201d he said, noting that he was not an expert on American political discourse. \u201cGiven that people are concerned but there is no conclusive smoking gun proof of concrete harm, I really hesitate to jump to \u2018let\u2019s get something because its such an emergency.\u2019\u201d</p><p>But Senator Hertzberg, who also has bills in the works addressing blockchain technology and cannabis banking, is undeterred. He said that his bot bill could have a big impact if passed in California, where so many tech companies are based.</p><p>\u201cThe political industrial complex is designed to protect the status quo, not to invent the future,\u201d he said. \u201cInventing the future means you have to think differently, be more inventive, be more creative.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Illustration by The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000005964668</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5STK-90D1-DXY4-X3WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1344\"/><timeReceived>06:12 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 16, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Hertzberg, Robert M</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Computers and the Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hertzberg, Robert M</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Common Sense Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Center for Humane Technology</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X84</classCode><className>US STATE GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>State &amp;

(They're also the lifeblood of many users we call influencers.)</p><p>Last week, Twitter announced it would remove tens of millions of suspicious accounts to crack down on the bots that can be bought (through third parties) by users who want to inflate the number of their followers. The company also said last month that it has been \"locking\" almost 10 million suspicious accounts per week and removing others for violating anti-spam policies.</p><p>Still, bots are easy to make and widely employed, and social media companies are under no legal obligation to get rid of them. A law that discourages their use could help, but experts aren't sure how the one Senator Hertzberg is trying to push through, in California, might work.</p><p>For starters, would bots be forced to identify themselves in every Facebook post? In their Instagram bios? In their Twitter handles?</p><p>The measure, SB-1001, a version of which has already left the Senate floor and is working its way through the state's Assembly, also doesn't mandate that tech companies enforce the regulation. And it's unclear how a bill that is specific only to California would apply to a global internet.</p><p>Oren Etzioni, the chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, applauded the spirit of the law but was not as sold on its letter. \"This is groundbreaking legislation,\" he said. \"We are on a trajectory where reality, the very fabric of the information we see, can be altered in an unprecedented fashion. When that's done, as the law says, with an intent to mislead, that's a huge problem.\"</p><p>But \"you don't want to measure twice, regulate once,\" he said. \"You don't want to put the wrong laws on the books and have unintended consequences.\"</p><p>Jeremy Gillula, a technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who has been critical of the bill since its inception, said the first version was \"a little like trying to treat the flu using chemotherapy.\"</p><p>\"Not only will it not fix the thing you're trying to fix,\" he said earlier this month. \"It'll cause a lot of collateral damage at the same time.\"</p><p>The bill was drafted by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that provides consumer ratings about the age-appropriateness of movies and TV shows, in collaboration with the Center for Humane Technology, a group of former employees of big tech companies including Google and Facebook who have banded together to regulate their former employers.</p><p>Neither Senator Hertzberg nor Jim Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, was overly concerned with criticism when interviewed about the bill in June. The senator called skepticism \"the drivel of people who want to stop progress.\" He said that the analysis he had seen had been influenced by lobbyists and was flat out wrong.</p><p>But after they were interviewed and the bill moved through the Assembly's committees, the content of the proposed law changed substantially. The definition of bot grew more precise (from \"online account\" to \"automated online account on an online platform<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"), </emphasis>and language that recommended an online platform for reporting bots was scrapped. Furthermore, the bill now asks only bots that are hoping to sell consumers good and services, or to influence votes in an election, to identify themselves as bots.</p><p>But even with the changes, the bill summons significant constitutional questions, said Ryan Calo, a co-director of the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington, and Madeline Lamo, a former fellow at the lab.</p><p>Ms. Lamo said that language in the bill about bots \"influencing a vote in an election\" ran into a problem that has plagued campaign finance regulations and election-related speech laws: It can be difficult to distinguish speech about political issues from speech explicitly intended to influence voters.</p><p>Furthermore, she noted, the bill was simply not crafted to address the problem it had in mind. Insofar as bots have had sway over political views, they have acted at scale, with thousands of automated accounts working to spread a diverse array of messages. It's hard to imagine, she said, that requiring individual accounts to identify themselves in a single state would do much to sap the strength of bot armies.</p><p>All parties agree that the bill illustrates the difficulty that lawmakers have in crafting legislation that effectively addresses the problems constituents confront online. As the pace of technological development has raced ahead of government, the laws that exist on the books - not to mention, some lawmakers' understandings of technology - have remained comparatively stagnant. And, as Twitter's action last week demonstrates, technology companies have the power to change dynamics on their platforms directly, and at the scale that those problems require. Turning a bill into a law can take a long time. And then the law runs the risk of being inexact.</p><p>Mr. Calo cited as an example a driverless car law passed by Nevada in 2012, which met with protest from luxury carmakers. They were miffed that the technologies in their cars fell under the loosely drawn definition of autonomous vehicles. The bill was revised and passed the following year.</p><p>\"Embarrassingly it was the first definition of artificial intelligence I've ever seen in a state statute, and they had to strike it out and rewrite it,\" Mr. Calo said.</p><p>With the bot bill, he said, similar issues could crop up.</p><p>\"Political commentary comes in different forms,\" he said. \"Imagine a concerned citizen sets up a bot to criticize a particular official for failing to act on climate change. Now say that official runs for re-election. Is the concerned citizen now in violation of California law?\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr. Gillula said that the bill sought to address a problem that may have been somewhat overhyped.</p><p>\"I haven't seen anyone say conclusively that Russian bots swung the election,\" he said, noting that he was not an expert on American political discourse. \"Given that people are concerned but there is no conclusive smoking gun proof of concrete harm, I really hesitate to jump to 'let's get something because its such an emergency.'\"</p><p>But Senator Hertzberg, who also has bills in the works addressing blockchain technology and cannabis banking, is undeterred. He said that his bot bill could have a big impact if passed in California, where so many tech companies are based.</p><p>\"The political industrial complex is designed to protect the status quo, not to invent the future,\" he said. \"Inventing the future means you have to think differently, be more inventive, be more creative.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000005964668</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5STN-WWM1-JC85-N1D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1353\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 17, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Customers should know how their data is being accessed.They should have some degree of a right to revoke access.There should be limits to how third parties can access that data.Companies should probably be required to provide some level of auditing or reporting to the federal government. What he's saying: \"It's a very blurry image but you can start to see the contours of what a global privacy set of laws might look like.\" \"We're probably 5 years out from this being anything that gets standardized. But I think it is not unrealistic that things could start to converge more on this stuff.\" Meanwhile, Levie expects big companies to largely adopt the California rules[1] that go into effect in January, just as most companies adopted the EU's GDPR requirements globally. Google, for example, committed Thursday[2] to doing just that. \"It's just how you will build your systems,\" he said. The bottom line: Increased regulation is good for Box's business. \"The more complex the world gets from a data privacy standpoint,\" Levie said, \"the more companies want partners that can abstract that.\"Go deeper: The global shortage of privacy professionals[3] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/california-privacy-law-national-impact-8e86bffe-af22-4966-92ff-f44e12aae9d6.html\">https://www.axios.com/california-privacy-law-national-impact-8e86bffe-af22-4966-92ff-f44e12aae9d6.html</url> [ 2]: https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/putting-you-in-control-privacy-2019 [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/privacy-expert-shortage-202eda9b-c8fa-4bd4-b1c1-11844812ab3e.html\">https://www.axios.com/privacy-expert-shortage-202eda9b-c8fa-4bd4-b1c1-11844812ab3e.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO10009544157686004220325876100021</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSS-XTJ1-F03R-N166-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"350\"/><timeReceived>4:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 20, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It's more like a bare-knuckles cage match over the future of access to video.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On one side are the MVPDs, who argue the marketplace is already opening up access to video programming without the FCC forcing providers to disaggregate their programming for reassembly by others.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The FCC - pressed by Silicon Valley giant Google, TV-maker Vizio, digital video recorder maker TiVo and others - stands on the other side, saying it's time to break the MVPDs' leased lockbox on programming and prices.</p><p>What's at stake is nothing less than the future of television and how its viewers will consume it - and who can access the reams of valuable data MVPDs now use to sell to advertisers. The question of who can access that information also poses huge privacy and security issues for TV watchers.</p><p>In December, the Consumer Choice Video Coalition (CVCC) - backed by Silicon Valley giants including Google, TiVo, Vizio, Public Knowledge, the Writers Guild of America, competitive telecom carrier trade group INCOMPAS (formerly COMPTEL) and others - demonstrated a new set-top box for FCC staff ers, hoping to convince the agency to crack open leased cable boxes for competing over-the-top providers. Of the 21 coalition members present, one-third were from Google.</p><p>Fast-forward to two weeks ago, and Google- which just topped Apple as the world's most valuable company, at half a trillion dollars in valuation - hosted a similar demonstration of the coalition's \"competitive Navigation device solution\" for Capitol Hill staffers. The proposal's mere existence is a game-changer for third-party devices, and a potential huge victory at the FCC that cable operators and studios say would hurt their businesses, as well as consumers.</p><p>The FCC has proposed to require cable operators to make their programming available to third parties in a way that cable operators say would force them to re-engineer their networks and strip away copyright and consumer protections.</p><p>Googleand others in the coalition said the proposal creates a \"virtual headend\" so that an MVPD's signal can be viewed along with over-the-top offerings on a competitive device. That device could be a box, phone, tablet, smart TV, dongle or even a leased cable box.</p><p>The idea is that the device allows access not only to the MVPDs' programming, but to content from the Internet, including Netfl ix, Amazon Instant Video and YouTube.</p><p>More worrisome for cable operators, it could allow these third parties access to the most precious of all screen space: the fi rst thing viewers see when they turn on the TV. Might it be an ad from Google?</p><p>Cable operators, movie studios and others have formed the Future of Television Coalition to fi ght the proposal. It's not that they don't want their content side by side with OTT, they said (and that's already happening in the marketplace without FCC intervention). Rather, they see the FCC's move as an unnecessary thumb on the scale for the Googles and TiVos of the world.</p><p>\"It disaggregates the provider of the service from their customer, which no business is really going to like,\" one coalition source said. \"And it gives third parties a way to come in and get revenue out of the ecosystem that devalues the content.\"</p><p>Coalition co-chairman Alfred Liggins, the president and CEO of cable network TV One, said, \"The 'AllVid' proposal is a brazen money grab by Big Tech companies that would do severe damage to the programming ecosystem, and in particular, niche and minority-focused networks.\"</p><p>Cable operators argue that the proposal is essentially a revival of the AllVid proposal the FCC off ered up in 2010. Wheeler and FCC officials, though, say the new plan is far from that.</p><p>Wheeler has pushed the plan with tough talk about the skyrocketing price of set-tops and the lack of competition. He went so far as to use a Public Knowledge/Consumer Federation of America chart at a press conference to illustrate why it's necessary to \"unlock\" the box for edge providers and consumer groups. (Gigi Sohn, a top adviser to Wheeler, is the co-founder of Public Knowledge.)</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"tivoroamio\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>The goal of the rule-making is to open up MVPD platforms to retail devices such as TiVo's Roamio DVR (pictured).</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"fccchairman\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>FCC chairman Tom Wheeler used a chart from Public Knowledge and the CFA to make a case for \"unlocking\" the set-top at a press conference.</p><p>At press time, cable operators and other members of the Future of Television Coalition hadn't seen Wheeler's notice of proposed rulemaking, so all they had to go on in formulating reasons why the FCC was on the wrong track were the painful (for them) memories of AllVid and the CVCC proposal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Multichannel News</emphasis> talked to senior FCC officials who have seen the NPRM to get their responses to the cable operators' key concerns - and they have a ton of them.</p><p>So, in one corner, from an NCTA filing with guidance from Future of TV Coalition sources, are the perceived blows the chairman's proposal would inflict on a video-access marketplace if it unfolds along the lines of the proposal put forth by Googleet al. In the other, top FCC officials, speaking not for attribution, weigh in with their responses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Would this turn the \"opening screen\" - what viewers see when they turn on their TV sets - over to a third party?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MVPDs:</emphasis> The first screen could be \"Welcome to Google\" only, with ads down the side. How would a Cox Communications or Comcast subscriber get directly to their channel lineups (on the same channels) on that opening screen as well?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FCC:</emphasis> \"While we cannot predict the design or interface that device makers and software developers may come up with, they will be required to pass through all of the content the consumer is entitled to receive. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking asks how that should be defi ned,\" an FCC source told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Multichannel News.</emphasis> \"This proposal is intended to introduce competition in devices and apps available to consumers. If a consumer does not like the interface or user experience available on one off ering, they could look for an alternative off ered by a competitor.\" In other words, what that opening screen will show is yet to be determined.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"What happens to programming agreements?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MVPDs:</emphasis> Retail devices would have access to parts of the MVPD service from which they could create their own service off erings, without responsibility or compensation to programmers or MVPDs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FCC:</emphasis> \"The CableCard works the same way,\" an FCC source said. \"It gives an independent vendor such as a TiVo access to the MVPDs' programming and guide information. And none of these things have happened.</p><p>\"And on the compensation issue: If you think about this logically, if I'm a Comcast subscriber, I'm paying Comcast whether I'm using their box or whether I use a TiVo box,\" the agency source added. \"Comcast is then passing that money on to the programmers, based on the fact that I count as one of their eyeballs. They are also able to sell advertising based on the fact that I count as one of their eyeballs. Nothing that our proposal would do would change any of that. They keep their subs; they keep their subs's money. We're just saying you should be able to get a box or view it with an app on any device you want without disrupting any agreement between the programmer and the MVPD.\"</p><p>Under the CableCard regime, third parties are not required to display the guide in the same manner as MVPDs, but they are required to pass through a channel lineup, and that won't change, the official said. \"Any package that the consumer has paid for shall be passed through in full and displayed in full by the third party,\" the FCC source said.</p><p>In addition to those channels being available in order, they can also be searched by category in a similar way as can be searched today. \"If an MVPD can do that today and be in compliance with a third-party programming agreement, why wouldn't a third party be able to do that?\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Would this proposal infringe on copyrights?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MVPDs:</emphasis> Device manufacturers would be allowed to infringe on programmers' copyrights by displaying and copying protected works through manufacturers' own services without permission or compensation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FCC:</emphasis> \"Nothing we are doing undoes any copyright protections that exist today.</p><p>\"As part of our proposal, we would require that the copy-protection information be transmitted from the MVPD to the device or app, and that the device or app must honor that copy protection mandate from the programmer.\" If the device doesn't honor copy-protection rules, programmers would have the same redress as they do under copyright, the official pointed out, though that is not the FCC's purview.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Would consumers lose modern features off ered by the box, like Time Warner Cable's \"Start Over?\"</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MVPDs:</emphasis> Consumers would be denied access to many modern MVPD service features like voice search, starting a show in progress at the beginning and other interactive enhancements, which MVPDs rely on to ensure the quality of their user experience and to provide value to their customers and stay competitive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FCC:</emphasis> If viewers want such enhancements, they can keep them. \"We're not telling anyone they have to give up their cable box. All we are saying is that, as a consumer, if you want to buy somebody else's box, you should be able to. And who's to say that new box won't have those features or a diff erent feature that consumers want?\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Wouldn't the proposal require some sort of in-home adapter, not to mention added costs for consumers?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MVPDs:</emphasis> MVPDs must provide customers with a government-designed in-home, leased device in order to receive MVPD service on a retail device, raising equipment and energy costs for consumers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FCC:</emphasis> Officials said that sounded like AllVid, which they said was not the chairman's proposal. \"We are not designing a device. In fact, we are not even mandating a device. We are very pro-app, and software and competitive devices [in] whatever format these innovators want to develop in. We are just trying to encourage that. AllVid was two boxes. We were telling people we are going to design a box and you have to have two boxes to get your cable programming. But that's not what we are doing here.</p><p>\"In fact, we would love it if our proposal resulted in no boxes. The way of the future is not the box. Wouldn't it be great if you could just hook up your MVPD service to your Smart TV and you could see everything?\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Would this complicate issues like privacy, and perhaps thwart emergency alerts? MVPDs:</emphasis> Device manufacturers are not obligated to abide by Title VI consumer protection regulations such as, among others, privacy protections and emergency alert requirements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FCC:</emphasis> \"Our proposal specifi cally seeks comment on maintaining emergency alerting. The safety of the public is very important to the commission. Nothing that we do in our proposal to create a competitive marketplace will undermine emergency alerting.\"</p><p>As to consumer-protection regulations, the official said that MVPDs do have different obligations under the Cable Act than device manufacturers. \"Title VI applies to MVPDs only.\" But the official said that those device manufacturers are already subject to some pretty strict privacy laws and regulations of their own, enforced by the Federal Trade Commission - citing a \"ton\" of consent decrees against app and device manufacturers and the fact they are subject to strict California laws on privacy, as well as strict European Union privacy regulations for any device or app sold in member countries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\" Can this make it easier for hackers since there's now a single point of attack? MVPDs:</emphasis> Cable operators and other providers would have to use a common content encryption technology (DTCP-IP), creating a single point of attack for hackers. DTCP-IP also does not support today's rapidly evolving video business models. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FCC:</emphasis> That is a reference to what CVCC is asking, said one official, and the chairman's proposal \"is not that.\" He said the chairman's proposal \"recognizes there are a wide variety of methods for protecting content from theft and misuse, and TV providers ought to use multiple systems,\" and so the proposal \"does not prescribe any particular content-protection system\" so those can evolve. But the proposal does recognize that third parties need access to those content protection systems, whatever they wind up being, so the proposal requires that a pay TV provider license at least one such system on reasonable terms. \"There will be no government standard that we select, or even that we approve\" and the FCC remains \"tech-neutral\" on hardware vs. software.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\" Doesn't this force MVPDs to essentially give away their guide data? MVPDs:</emphasis> MVPDs would be required to provide program-guide data, which they do not own, to retail devices, thereby exceeding their licenses with guide data suppliers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FCC:</emphasis> The FCC will seek comment on the \"exact level\" of information that is needed to pass through from an MVPD to a third party in order to maintain all of the rights the consumer has paid for.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Could this focus on box-vs.-no box stifl e innovation in next-generation technologies, not to mention the growing demand for apps?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MVPDs:</emphasis> Providers would have to support an expensive legacy technical solution, thereby interfering with plans to deploy next-generation systems and technologies (e.g., IP cable and IPv6).</p><p>Moreover, this would force cable operators and others to implement an infl exible, one-size-fi ts-all technology mandate that ignores the video marketplace transition to apps and creates a drag on innovation in the highly dynamic video-device marketplace.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FCC:</emphasis> \"That, again, sounds like AllVid. This isn't AllVid.</p><p>\"It's very clear by everything we have put out that we are very supportive of apps. We think apps are the way of the future and what we are proposing to do is tech-neutral. It does not mandate a box. If people want to develop a box and consumers are happy with boxes, they are welcome to them. But what we are trying to do here is let people innovate, whether they want to do boxes or something that is like the Amazon Fire stick or if they want to do an app. All options are open in the proposal.\"</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"cableoperators\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>Cable operators argue that the market is already pushing them to add cross-platform functionality to platforms such as Comcast's X1 (pictured).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"How would technology standards be decided for this new sharing arrangement?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MVPDs:</emphasis> The proposal relies on standards not yet invented or implemented and would take years to develop - by which time the \"solution\" will likely have become outdated.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FCC:</emphasis> On the one hand, the official said, cable operators have consistently said they don't want the agency setting a standard and \"now they aren't happy with us wanting to let a standards body set the standards, a body we think they should be a part of. It is tough to have it both ways.</p><p>\"We are requiring the standards be set by an open standards body with participation from MVPDs, CE manufacturers, app developers and generally following the executive guidance on open standards bodies. We don't want to be in the middle of it. It is not a government-mandated standard.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"How does this proposal change what is already happening in the marketplace, with viewers accessing cable and over-the-top side-by-side without the FCC stepping in?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MVPDs:</emphasis> This is a solution in search of a problem.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FCC:</emphasis> \"It is very true that some of the larger MVPDs make apps available to certain devices where they entered into contracts with those devices.</p><p>\"The problem is, today if I open up, say, a Comcast app on my Smart TV, I can't search what is available to me through my Comcast subscription versus what is available to me from Netfl ix. I have to go into each app, search inside that app, get out, go to the next screen if I want to go to Hulu after that.</p><p>\"The nice thing about being able to let unaffiliated vendors develop apps for devices is that we anticipate functionality very similar to what TiVo does today, allowing consumers to search across all the sources of programming that they have access to because they pay for many of these things. It will be easier for consumers to fi nd the programming they want at the price they want to pay for it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCHNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCHNWS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J1D-BWN1-JBPF-90JN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241792</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 NewBay Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Multichannel News</publicationName><volume>Vol. XXXVII</volume><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>February 8, 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

So welcome, Dylan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DYLAN SMITH, CFO, BOX, INC.: Thanks, [Carl]. So I did just want to spend a few minutes to kick off just given an overview of earnings announcements, some of the things we've been up to. We had our Q2 earnings announcement a week ago today. And this presentation and our Q&amp;A may contain forward-looking statements, which probably isn't too surprising.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But just to give a bit of an overview, so in Q2 when we are on a January 31 fiscal year-end, so this is the quarter that ended on July 31, we surpassed 50,000 paying businesses. Revenue in the quarter was close to $75 million, so approaching a $300 million annualized run rate and growing at 43% year on year. Billings were right around the same growth rate, up 45% year on year, and we also disclosed an adjusted billings metric that sorted through some of the payment terms and payment duration variability that we see, and that was also 45% year on year. So adjusted billings and calculated billings up 45%.</p><p>Continue to show progress on cash flow from operations. So over the first half of the year, cash flow from operations was negative $29 million. Versus last year in the first half, that was about negative $50 million. So both in terms of dollars as well as a percentage of revenues showing pretty significant progress in terms of our overall operating profile as we continue to march down and look to achieve our commitment of positive free cash flow by the end of next year, so five quarters from now or Q4 FY 2017.</p><p>And then our customer economics continue to be very strong. So retention rates dollar weighted of 121% over the last 12 months, which means that had we not signed up a single new customer, we would have grown revenue by 21% year on year. And that's a result of primarily fee expansions driving the net expansion rate of 25% year on year, less only 4% customer churn, so very, very strong economics there.</p><p>And then not going to go down the full list, but just wanted to highlight we've made a bunch of progress on both new products for the first time since going public just this past January. So that includes Enterprise Key Management, which you may have heard of as one of the big security initiatives that allows our customers to manage their own keys. So that we launched early in this year and have been really -- early this year. And then in Q2 we also released Box Governance for retention management and just deeper compliance and things like that. We've also made a couple of acquisitions in the endpoint security space in 3-D viewing and editing, and we've announced a number of new industries from government to financial services which are going to be big initiatives for us going forward.</p><p>And then most recently, we signed a big partnership and what we have called the most meaningful partnership we've ever signed in our history with IBM back in June. And we will talk a bit more about that. And then we continue to see the message resonating and really strong validation in the market from Gartner and Forrester in terms of the technologies built and just the leadership position that we are building as well. And then last month, we also announced that we brought in Jeetu Patel to run our platform business and as our Chief Strategy Officer, and that really just shows the importance of the platform business going forward and a lot of the bets we are making in that space.</p><p>And just at a very high level with IBM, it really is something where we are spending most of this year really aligning our go-to-market efforts, building out the technology, and building these joint roadmaps. So a lot of deep integrations on the mobile app development front, so tying in really nicely with our respective partnerships with Apple to just think about all the different ways to drive productivity to the enterprise and then really a great way to expand our global markets opportunity and for a way for IBM to take FileNet and some of our other core content assets and extend that into a cloud and mobile environment.</p><p>So we're really excited about that relationship. And although it is very early and they are a big company, we've been really pleased with the early progress and have dozens of active customer conversations across the globe.</p><p>And the relationship does extend to a whole bunch of the different properties. We focused on enterprise content management. I mentioned FileNet, but it also is everything from analytics with Watson and all the initiatives they have there to some of their security, collaboration, and mobile offerings as well. So a lot of the technology operations that we will be building over the next couple of quarters and go into market with.</p><p>And I think we will have time for Q&amp;A at the end, but I will now make my way over -- (multiple speakers)</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: You're welcome to stand there if you'd like. So maybe, Dylan, I will start off the Q&amp;A. Just given that you just talked a little bit about the quarterly results, do you want to elaborate a little bit on the mid-[40s] billings and revenue growth rate? Was there anything that you saw on the quarter, even nuanced shifts in demand that surprised you and Aaron?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: So there wasn't anything too surprising with respect to the quarter. We have -- just because of the model a lot of visibility, especially into the revenue side, and we are seeing more stability in terms of those payment frequencies. So had pretty good visibility into the outcome, and a lot of that growth was really just driven by strong continued traction in some of our larger enterprise customers. So we give out a $100,000 plus deal metric, and we had more than 50% growth in that category of deals. So that was one of the drivers of our growth.</p><p>But really in terms of anything it surprised was just the early traction that we've seen with Enterprise Key Management and with Box Governance. So having not just a number of deals actually close in Q2, but dozens of conversations ongoing with prospects for both of those products, so we've been really pleased with the initial response of some of those new areas.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That make sense. And in your opening comments, you highlighted the big IBM deal. So I think that's worthy of a couple of questions. So I think one question that I have is while the frenemy concept is quite common in Silicon Valley, here you've got a big partnership with a company that itself has a very large enterprise content management business in FileNet. So what are the some of the puts and takes around the partnership vis-a-vis Box and FileNet?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: IBM is less of at this stage a frenemy and a true partner, whereas they started to build out over the past couple of years a content Navigator in the cloud as a way to extend a lot of the content capabilities they have into a mobile environment, into a cloud environment, but pretty quickly realized that it would be a massive undertaking based on the complicated and deep needs of their enterprise customers to replicate what we've done.</p><p>And so what they decided to do was still keep, of course, the core content that they have in place, but completely shut down all of the content navigator pieces and instead partner with Box.</p><p>So at this stage, there's not a lot of conflict, unlike some companies like Microsoft where we have I think a frenemy relationship in a very real way with IBM. They have made a very big bet to go with Box and recommend that and drive that across their organization in terms of the way to extend the content capabilities of FileNet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That make sense. And for those in the audience sharpening their pencils on the billings estimates for Box, Dylan, can you talk a little bit about how that relationship trickles down into your own billings numbers going forward?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Sure. So I would say that we expect just because of all the things we're doing together and everything we want to build to really make a partnership come to light is we would expect the majority of that impact to really start to take -- to kick off in billings next year or FY 2017, just especially because of some of the deal cycles that we see in these larger enterprises.</p><p>That said, we have been really pleased with the engagement as I mentioned. We were at their global sales kickoff. Just happened to happen about a week after we signed the deal, so we got center stage and have been able to get in front of thousands upon thousands of IBMers across the globe. And so we could see some impact as soon as the end of this year in our Q4, but would expect the bulk of it to start coming in billings and revenue next year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. And maybe one other aspect of the Box-IBM deal that at least caught my attention is that Box is getting integrated with their mobile device management to mobile first. To me that's interesting because I was also the other day glancing at the Box Works agenda, and I noticed that a fellow named Tim Cook is scheduled to attend. So there seems to be a little bit more of a mobile angle to the Box story. Do you mind elaborating on that?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Sure. So we've been a mobile focused company for a very long time actually. So I think back in 2006 or 2007 is when Aaron -- my co-Founder, our CEO and I were declaring it, this is the year of mobile. And year after year after year, we were wrong for a number of years until the iPad came out, and Apple really gave a reason for enterprises to be bringing mobile in productivity use cases. And that's when we really started to see an uptick, and that was a huge catalyst for our business back in the 2011/2012 timeframe as CIOs were grappling with the way to give these tools to their employees, and Box very quickly built native applications. So we were almost the only game in town to do that, and that was very basic productivity enablement use cases.</p><p>Now where we are seeing the evolution with Apple and with our partnership, as well as with IBM is, it's much more focused on these targeted use cases that are going to drive much more business value. So whether that is building custom content applications for your field sales team, whether that is point-of-sale applications, so your retail associates or Disney employees in a theme park can have access to the latest information that they need to serve customers or even to a patient application for a major -- a hospital to be able to access information in real time or more seamlessly sign in, get the information -- those are the types of things that we're building with Apple and with IBM that is very different from what mobile meant to us even just a couple of years ago.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. And maybe before I go on, just because this IBM-Box deal is very big for you, does anybody in the audience want to press Dylan a little bit more on the IBM partnership before we move to some other questions?</p><p>No? Okay. So let's keep going.</p><p>Another big partner obviously is Microsoft. So I would love to understand that a little bit better. Obviously they've got share points. They are integrating it with Office 365, too. So where is the angle where Box can play a part with Microsoft?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Yes, so Microsoft is definitely more in that frenemy category, and they are very motivated to sell as many Office 365 licenses as possible. That's a huge strategic initiative/imperative for them. And I think what they found is to do that, it serves their interest, as well as this more open approach that they are taking under [Satcha] to be able to provide a best-in-class content management and file sharing and collaboration experience for their customers.</p><p>And so we actually see -- while SharePoint is something that they have really been deemphasizing over time and rolling that into broader -- the broader Office 365 piece, what they've done more recently and what gets us really excited is they are treating us as a first-class citizen as it relates to content.</p><p>So when you look and you are in Outlook or your in Office Online, both from a save to and an open from standpoint, Box is right there side-by-side with OneDrive. And I think the reason for that is they want to make sure they are giving their customers' options to be credible and to drive as many workloads and as much stickiness from Office 365 as possible. And more and more as we scale and become an important player in the enterprise, they are hearing from customers that are very, very important to them like Eli Lilly and Toyota and GE that we have made a major bet on our content strategy on Box, and if Box and Office 365 don't work together well, that's going to create some pretty big challenges for us.</p><p>And so I think that combination of factors, both the sort of experienced self in creating these seamless content experiences, as well as market pressures, have really caused Microsoft to want to open up the platform. And so, of course, all else equal, they are still going to want to put all of the storage and everything on OneDrive, but they've definitely changed their tune over the last couple of quarters and given us a great opportunity to work with Office 365, as well as Outlook, their mobile applications, etc.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Got it. Okay. And just working through the other big tech players that in various ways bumped into Box, EMC is another one. And on the surface, they should be a formidable opponent given that A, they are making a big push into cloud, and B, they've got a very big ECM franchise. I think in the recent news, they sold their simplicity unit to a consortium of private equity firms, and I'm wondering why did they bail from the space, and does their elastic cloud storage offering still compete with Box at all?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: So I think it's the same reason that we've seen a lot of players either deemphasize or look to evolve their strategy in this space. Over the last few years, we've seen -- I don't think it's an exaggeration to say dozens of new entrants. But over the past 12 months, I think we are starting to see some folks leaving the play -- the space. A lot of independent players are now kind of looking for buyers, and I think it's really because as much as EMC has every right to be in the space, I think it's just not interesting for them to have a 4% market share, something like that. And so they think about -- especially as it's a very different model for them with respect to the cloud is it probably makes more sense to double down on the core things that they do really well and leave this to partnerships and other players to be able to meet those needs for their customers.</p><p>I think we will see more of that in that consolidation and divestitures over time. But today, to answer the second question, we don't really compete directly with EMC's elastic cloud services. Occasionally, there will be use cases where, I am thinking about the ROI use case as large enterprises are moving more and more content onto Box, that might allow them to buy less from an EMC or a NetApp or something like that on the pure storage side. But in terms of a head-to-head competitive situation, we don't really run into EMC very often.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Got it. And my last question, filling out the competitive discussion is on Citrix. They have obviously got a rival product, but as everybody knows, Citrix has gone through a significant restructuring of late, and I am wondering if Citrix is popping up anymore, any less on your radar, let's say, in the last six months or so. Any change worth calling out?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: No major trajectory change as it relates to Citrix. ShareFile is the competitive product that they have in this space, and we still do see them from time to time, typically not in the large enterprise conversations that we are focused on. That's where it does tend to be more off in a Microsoft conversation. So we will see them from time to time, but I would say the trajectory is probably flat or possibly slightly down in terms of how often we see those guys.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. And I would love to ask you next, Dylan, about a comment you made on the recent call about pricing being relatively stable. So to me that's a positive given that you've got a number of big companies that want to be in this space. So the fact that you have kept the pricing stable to me is strong, and could you talk a little bit about what some of the puts and takes are that end up with a relatively stable pricing environment?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Yes, I would say the biggest thing is just the investments that we've made over the last few years in building more and more functionality and differentiating in our product. And more often -- I mean we still will see the use cases of pretty basic enterprise file sync and sharing. But more and more, we are seeing people understand the value they can get out of a service-like box, and in those situations, especially in the enterprise, there just aren't a lot of other options out there that go as deep. And that's why although we are selling to larger customers and with large deployments, we give volume discounts, we have still been able to maintain stable pricing even in the face of that because, on an apples to apples basis, if we are selling 1000 seats two years ago versus today, we actually commanding a higher price point.</p><p>And so it really comes down to just building on our leadership position in the enterprise, as well as building out more and more technology. And it's not been through some of these new products that I mentioned that are really starting to come to market for the first time. So it is Enterprise Key Management, Box Government, the Box Developer Edition that we announced, and will be generally available in Q3. All of those things represent even additional upside as we think about the pricing strategy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. And Dylan, as you just described Box moving into large enterprise, bigger deals, one key part of the story that is enabling you to pull that off is this verticalization approach. And I think you've announced that so far there's been a push around three verticals. I think it's healthcare, media entertainment, and retail. If I am right, could you talk a little bit about why those three verticals to start and what the roadmap to add new verticals looks like?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Yes, so when we tend to think about our vertical strategy, it's really -- usually we will start with what are the major markets for us? We're already seeing success and so focus a lot on the professional services space as well. But in many cases is we look in the areas where there are either industry-specific workflows and use cases that we can go after from a platform standpoint and areas where our focus on compliance and security are going to be differentiators as well. So in some of the spaces you mentioned, you are really opening the door and making that push possible where our investments and achieving HIPAA compliance and PCI compliance for healthcare and retail respectively, now a major focus, especially going forward on financial services.</p><p>We've talked about government as well, so it tends to be that combination of areas where by really building these relationships with customers, we can add an extra layer of value where it's not using just the horizontal capabilities of Box, but setting ourselves apart by understanding and building some of those workflows, as well as the compliance side are really what we look at. But now we have either launched or announced really the major verticals we think are going to allow us to accelerate our growth.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. And just to press you a little bit on the healthcare side, some of those in the audience follow a company, Viva, which is really the CRM SaaS play, but they've expanded their offering into the content management space attacking big pharma particular. Is that part of your definition of healthcare, or are you going after other components to that pretty broadly defined vertical?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Yes, so we tend to think about our push -- while pharma is a part of it and we have some very large pharmaceutical companies, I think they just may only do really well a specific part of that lifecycle and where the content really matters, and we take a more general approach around -- might be a pharma company, but how do we solve the content management collaboration needs across the entire firm?</p><p>So that might be things where it is the field sales enablement I mentioned briefly where you are giving iPads to thousands of pharmaceutical reps to go out and sell their customers in areas like that. So really just I think a broader part of the lifecycle, but we don't go quite as deep into some of those pieces. So we really rarely see Viva in competitive situations.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. And you had mentioned that financial services will likely be a big push. I think you just opened up a big New York office. You hired Adam Ross I think to run that vertical, right? Maybe you can talk a little bit about the challenges of convincing a big bank like Deutsche Bank to embrace Box. Obviously it's a different beast. There are compliance and regulatory issues to deal with. What makes cracking the financial services market so attractive to you, and what are some of the challenges?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Yes, I think -- what's attractive to us is just some of the challenges and the state of technology in a lot of different areas, and I would say that Adam is really going to be tasked with identifying what are the biggest opportunities that we can focus our efforts in the highest value use cases, and a lot of it if we're looking at a opportunity like Deutsche Bank. First, we want to understand where are the biggest pain points and where they are not able to meet the business needs, whether that's on the investment banking side or retail banking, wealth management, etc., and really go in there and see where are the gaps.</p><p>But I would say that some of the challenges that are pretty unique are large banks tend to have not just in terms of being able to get our foot in the door, compliance and regulatory challenges. That's where FINRA compliance, everything that the SEC requires, etc. are really important and investments that we've made to enable this.</p><p>I would say large banks also have quite a bit of focus on both the security side of things, deeper than most verticals as you know and would imagine, as well as controlling their own information and really giving differentiated customer experience. And so they are customers.</p><p>So on the first one on the security front, that's really where this Enterprise Key Management comes in, and that's been really helpful in terms of allowing us to have some of these conversations. It really was a nonstarter because there's still a lot of large banks who are a little bit hesitant to go all in with the cloud, and so the ability to actually manage their own encryption keys is another layer of security that's been really helpful.</p><p>As it relates to these specific customer experiences, that is really where we think we have a huge opportunity with the Box Developer Edition where we can work with these financial services customers and work with a Deutsche Bank to say, okay, what is really important for this process and for these customers? You can actually build those custom content experiences on top of the Box platform, fully customizable for what you need, own that IP, own that experience end to end, but have with that, all of the permissions, security, content management, collaboration capabilities that you get with our core platform. And so that's really the way we think about it is that combination of compliance, security, and ownership are some of the challenges that we think we are really well positioned to solve for our customers and why we get so excited about the opportunity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And Dylan, does the new Box Governance feature play to that focus on security, data access -- ?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Absolutely. Both security, as well as compliances, and everything around information rights management to be able to set retention policies where, for example, you might not be able to delete information for seven years and where that might have normally been what would be -- you use a write once, read many or WORM drive to be able to put that information on. We have now architected those same capabilities into our software so it becomes a much easier to manage and less expensive proposition that fulfills the same compliance needs but using the Box platform.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. And just a minute ago, you talked a little bit about the Box platform? Do you mind elaborating on that? How that will be differentiated from some of the other SaaS companies that are trying to build out platforms? I think you just hired actually, if I'm not mistaken, from EMC a new individual to head up that unit. How will you differentiate yourself, Dylan, and how big could that platform part of the Box story end up being five years from now?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Yes, so that's where really driving that strategy and -- both from a product standpoint and go to market standpoint, that's what Jeetu Patel, who is the CEO of Simplicity over at EMC, is going to be tasked with. But the way we think about it, there's really -- the most interesting opportunity is using a platform to extend our market opportunity into these B2B2C use cases. So where we might have a customer who is already using Box for their corr employee or external collaborator content management collaboration. But now saying how do we provide and power these new digital experiences for their customers? And that's where we see both within regulated industries, as well as within even nonregulated businesses, a huge opportunity to change the content experience and just to make a much better experience for close to the value chain to our customers' customers.</p><p>And that's really the main focus of our platform initiative, which is something that most other platform companies haven't done in the past. There's also going to be an IFV component, so that's where you can think about something similar to a force.com. So I think that's a pretty big corollary there in terms of the way that we want to give all the tools for these developers to build their businesses with Box at the back end and make sure they don't need to rebuild everything around security and permissions and things that we've already done. And so that's another big piece of it. And both are going to be under Jeetu's purview going forward.</p><p>And I would also just note that that is going to be a big focus of ours at BoxWorks, which is our annual user conference coming up in just a couple of weeks in San Francisco. So we're going to talk a lot more about the evolution of the platform and what that means going forward.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And Dylan, it sounds like your -- Box is bulking up on the leadership front and adding a lot of terrific people. I think another individual you added recently was Paul Chapman, the former CIO of HP Software, correct?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: That's right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So maybe talk a little bit about when he comes aboard, what will he and the team focus on in terms of changing Box's underlying data infrastructure? What's the vision?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Yes, so I'd say that already as you might imagine, we've taken a cloud first approach to our internal technology stack. So Box at the center and what would be a number of best-of-breed applications. And we do manage our own data center infrastructure, and he is going to be very focused on especially the networking, the collaboration, and the connectivity across our sites is not going to be specifically running the production infrastructure, but is going to be more focused on our internal applications and all of the things we can do to really show to our customers the gold standard of a cloud-based environment at scale, especially as we grow with Box at the center.</p><p>And so one of the things that I think is a huge opportunity both for Box and for our customers over time as we build out these platform initiatives is all of the different workflows, use cases, and really bleeding edge things that we can do with the Box platforms. That's something that Paul is going to be very focused on, as well as hardening the overall data strategy and showing what we can do.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. Why don't I take a quick break and see if anybody in the audience -- I know everyone is still waking up. Any questions for Dylan you would like to ask?</p><p>I will keep powering through then.</p><p>Let's turn to one question on the financials. Not so much on the revenue and billings line, which I opened with, but more on the bottom line. Everyone always wants you to get to break even faster. I'm sure you have taken that question a lot over the last year. So I think you have communicated some cash flow breakeven guidance, correct? Maybe you could repeat that for the audience, talk a little bit about the path to get there, and if you can say anything about earnings, non-GAAP operating margin breakeven, that would be great, too.</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Sure. So we would say we are very committed to achieving positive free cash flow by the end of next year. So in Q4 of fiscal 2017, which is about five quarters from now, is when we are committed to hitting that breakeven point and then being free cash flow positive in the following year. So our FY 2018 or effectively, calendar 2017, and every year thereafter. So that's a really important, I think, milestone and commitment for the Company.</p><p>And we've shown pretty strong progress just as we scaled and as we've really managed the spending and driven leverage especially on the sales and marketing side is how we plan to get there is just continued execution on those fronts. And I mentioned briefly that we've seen pretty strong progress and pretty solid progress over the first half of this year, producing our overall operating cash flow consumption pretty noticeably and as a percentage of revenue going from negative 51% to negative 21% year on year. And so just continuing to do those things is how we're going to drive the cash flow.</p><p>Breakeven -- with respect to the operating income breakeven, that's going to be still trailing that by at least a couple of years. And some of it we've not talked about as explicitly for that breakeven point, but would say that over time can expect us to continue to drive leverage in all the line items of the P&amp;L.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Got it. Okay. And maybe my last one is you touched a little bit on this, but you've got your big BoxWorks event coming up in a couple of weeks as you said in San Francisco. I think you're going to do an analyst day there as well. Can you give Deutsche Bank's clients a little sneak preview of what's coming? I don't think you want to open the kimono too much, but what are the big themes that you are going to be pressing on at BoxWorks this year?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Yes, so I don't want to steal too much of Aaron's thunder, but I would say that a big focus is going to be this platform business. So everything around the Box Developer Edition, what that means, and how we're thinking about the evolution of the business going forward. We see just going back to the size of the opportunity that four or five years from now in terms of our new bookings, it could literally be 50% on what people consider core and what Box is today on the content management collaboration side and 50% on the platform side. And so we do see it as a huge opportunity, and I don't think it's something that we've talked as much about or that people really appreciate about the Company's potential. So that's going to be a big focus area, as well as just continuing to talk about all the things we are doing on the partnership front, with mobility, etc. without getting into the specifics.</p><p>And then I would say as it relates to Analyst Day specifically, which is going to be on 30 September, is we are going to really dive much deeper into that path to becoming cash flow positive and how we think about that and some of the levers there, as well as some of the trends we're seeing from a competitive standpoint, and we will also get an opportunity to sit down with Adam Ross and (technical difficulty)</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

So, very timely to have you guys here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>AARON LEVIE, </nameText></person>CEO, CO-FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN, BOX, INC.: Yes, to talk about the Snapchat IPO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MELISSA GORHAM: (laughter). No.</p><p><person><nameText>AARON LEVIE</nameText></person>: I thought that was half the questions. Is that not the case?</p><p>MELISSA GORHAM: That's for later. No, but it's timely because you reported Q4 earnings last night, and so I guess maybe a good way to start is, Aaron, if you can maybe just recap what you thought the highlights were for Q4, and then we can get into some of the details.</p><p><person><nameText>AARON LEVIE</nameText></person>: Yes. So it was a record quarter for us on a bunch of accounts. We generated and reported $110 million in topline revenue. We closed the year at about $399 million in revenue. We generated $10 million in free cash flow. That was something that we told the investors about two years ago when we were going public that at the tail end of FY17, that's when we'd be able to hit the free cash flow positive. So we had been on a march for a couple years driving the business to ensure that we could both grow pretty significantly on the topline, as well as achieve that free cash flow positive point.</p><p>We reached over 71,000 customers globally. It was also a record quarter in terms of all of our big deal segments, so 64 deals over $100,000 so that's our -- we track sort of annual contract values of large customer segments, so 64 deals with over $100,000. Record deals over $500,000, record deals over $1 million.</p><p>And ultimately, what we're seeing in the market is that the past 10 years of all the product that we've been building, the organization that we've been building, has led us to be able to build a leading position in cloud content management, and more and more enterprises are actually going out and deploying our overall set of solutions and capabilities. Box Governance, which is a product that we launched about a year and a half ago, has now been sold over 700 times into the customer base, and with new customers, it was also a record quarter for the number of customers of Box Governance.</p><p>So overall, a very, very strong quarter, significant improvements on things like sales and marketing, spend as a percentage of revenue, 14 points of improvement year over year, and so just very happy about the topline results of the business and then generating cash, obviously, was a very important milestone for the Company.</p><p>MELISSA GORHAM: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Maybe if we can just start on the partnerships, because I think that was maybe one of the notable pieces coming out of the quarter. And, obviously, IBM is a big part of that. I think you said 18 out of 64 large deals are coming from IBM, so it seems like it certainly is ramping well, but I'm just wondering if you can maybe talk about where you are in the maturity of that relationship. And then, is that -- this kind of traction, is this what we're going to expect throughout FY18?</p><p><person><nameText>AARON LEVIE</nameText></person>: So our partnership strategy overall, if you think about where we sit in the ecosystem, our mission is to make sure that we can help companies manage, secure, govern all of their content, all of their information in one place, and then extend that out into any application or service that they are using.</p><p>So inherently in our business model, we're already very, very partner centric. We work a lot with Microsoft. We announced a partnership at the tail end of last year with Google. We work with Facebook with their enterprise product, with Slack, and many other services, and so the core value proposition of Box is that we are going to be a neutral, agnostic player that plugs into the rest of your technology environment and helps you secure and manage your information.</p><p>IBM has been a really significant partner for us in both building on top of our platform, building applications and services for their customers, as well as reselling Box into their customer base. And if you kind of think about where IBM is biggest, when you think about governments all around the world, banks, large industrial businesses, healthcare providers, these are the areas where we're seeing traction through the IBM partnership, so customers in either industries or geographies where we don't necessarily have as many feet on the ground.</p><p>And so throughout all last year it was really kind of a ramping period for us in building the partnership, culminating in really strong performance in Q4 where they did close -- where we closed with them 18 deals over $100,000. And then if you kind of zoom out to the broader partner landscape, nearly half of our $100,000 deals or above came through our channel partners. So, if you look at the overall channel model broadly, whether it's with telco partners like AT&amp;T, technology partners like IBM, or even system integrators and resellers like Macnica in Japan, all of these partners are actually contributing and driving more growth of our business in both regions and industries where we don't necessarily have as much of a direct sales force.</p><p>So we think that the IBM partnership is a really great template for how we can do large partnerships at scale with big tech companies, big telcos, system integrators, and we're not only going to continue to scale the IBM partnership this coming year, but ultimately try and repeat that success with many other partners in our ecosystem. So we're really happy about the level of investment that we made this year, the return that that created, and also the kind of proof point of what we can do from a partnership standpoint.</p><p>I'm going to say one more thing, but the -- I think if you look at SaaS generally, you rarely see as much of a partner-centric or channel-centric or even system integrator-centric approach that we can deliver, and the reason for that is customers are looking for partners to be able to help them retire legacy systems, to be able to migrate their data to the cloud, deliver solutions through mobile environments, and so we happen to have a very -- a type of product and a platform that naturally fits within an ecosystem of so many different players, and that's why you're going to see a pretty significant ramp in growth, due to our partnerships.</p><p>MELISSA GORHAM: Right, okay. So I guess kind of related to that and just taking it one step higher, Aaron, I believe you describe Box as a modern cloud content platform, but if you go back, let's say, five or even 10 years, everyone thinks of Box or your competitors as file, sync, and share. To what extent --</p><p><person><nameText>AARON LEVIE</nameText></person>: We still think of our competitors as file, sync, and share.</p><p>MELISSA GORHAM: To what extent has the customer conversations changed such that they are coming to you for this content platform or is this just plain file, sync, and share?</p><p><person><nameText>AARON LEVIE</nameText></person>: So 12 years ago when we started Box, the first use case we had was how do you share files from any device with anyone, anywhere. That was the core use case we had.</p><p>What we didn't even realize was there was this multibillion-dollar market for companies that were spending so much time, energy, and resources on traditional forms of content management. The reason we started Box was because we were running into this end-user problem that was very akin to what the market thinks of as enterprise file, sync, and share.</p><p>But very quickly, enterprise file, sync, and share functionality reached a plateau. Within a couple years of us existing, we had built all of the major capabilities that we would think of as enterprise file, sync, and share, and so the big opportunity that we recognized eight, nine years ago was as companies began to move their information and their content to the cloud, they would need modern ways of securing, governing, controlling, and ensuring compliance around all of their content.</p><p>And when we looked at that industry, that was the traditional domain of enterprise content management, of storage infrastructure, of security technology, of some of the system integrators or consulting teams that were working on compliance for your information. And so we saw this disruptive opportunity where if we took those capabilities, built them in a modern cloud-first, mobile-centric, end-user-centric kind of way, we would actually be able to go and disrupt this multi-tens of billions of dollars industry.</p><p>Now customers, though, have had to take a bit of a journey to be able to actually see Box in that way, for us to be able to sell Box in that way, and be able to actually kind of move customers through the maturity of their lifecycle. And so, if I go back -- if we go back five or six or seven years ago, most of the early adopters of Box in large enterprises, whether it was Procter &amp; Gamble or General Electric or Eli Lilly, they were using Box as a modern sort of file, sync, and share product across their enterprise, but the reason they chose us was due to this longer-term vision.</p><p>When we fast forward to today, most of our large enterprises, especially those that are deploying this enterprisewide, are buying us because what they are trying to do is have one system of record for their content management in the cloud. When we look at all of our transactions that are in the $500,000 segment and above or $1 million segment and above, these are companies that are often using Box to retire legacy systems. We had one financial services customer that was able to retire -- will be retiring a Documentum deployment, as well as consolidating their EFSS capabilities, so file, sync, and share capabilities, into Box.</p><p>So we want to solve that entire spectrum of use cases, everything from that end user, that first use case we saw 12 years ago, the end user that wants to be able to share files and collaborate, all the way to being the system of record where your legal team is going to manage their contracts or your marketing team is going to manage their digital assets or the insurance claims team is going to be able to manage all the insurance claim documents. That's really where the ultimate spend is, and we're the only company in the cloud that has built all of the sort of modern core capabilities to be able to solve that and we still have a very expensive roadmap to build an even stronger position in this market going forward.</p><p>DYLAN SMITH, CFO, CO-FOUNDER, BOX, INC.: And just to go on that a bit, I think we've been talking about and building this vision for many years now, but it is a pretty notable change. Just over the past few quarters, as you have Box zones and our governance capabilities and a lot of our compliance capabilities really coming together, so for customers is actually the reality that they can retire some of these legacy systems, we think that's going to provide a pretty meaningful catalyst for us to be able to rip and replace more of their systems and increase our contract value.</p><p>So in addition to the firm Aaron mentioned, we had a large energy company in the Asia-Pacific region retiring OpenText, a very large life sciences company based in the UK who is going to be retiring Documentum as well. And so realizing that time to value now by deploying Box not just for end-user productivity and collaboration, but to have pretty meaningful cost replacement as well is something that we are now able to deliver to customers and we're pretty excited about.</p><p><person><nameText>AARON LEVIE</nameText></person>: And I think, just one more build on that, if you look at sort of the best in class or best of breed categories of technology, I think if you go talk to customers it's very clear that the world is moving to the cloud for CRM. It's very clear that the world is moving to the cloud for HCM or HR/IS. It's very clear that the customer is moving to the cloud for IT service management.</p><p>There hasn't been a company or a product that's been able to take all of the capabilities or all the use cases that a Documentum and OpenText, traditional content management systems, have been able to solve for and have a cloud-first model to be able to deliver that, and that's what we've been building over the past, again, five, six, seven, eight years.</p><p>And so, we're at a point where the product is mature enough where we can go attack some of these more regulated use cases, these more extensive, complex use cases, and the good news is we already have a number of the customers, so we're in over 60% of the Fortune 500 today. And so, our opportunity is to go after all those customers and have them start to use Box more as a system of record for their information, not just as an end-user collaboration and sharing tool.</p><p>MELISSA GORHAM: Okay. So over the past year, you've been able to execute well to this large opportunity. You are definitely winning large deals. You are increasing the upsell opportunity, while also at the same time really keeping sales and marketing expense relatively low in terms of growth, in the most recent quarter 2% growth in sales and marketing.</p><p>I guess two questions on that. The first is what's enabled you to sustain 30%-ish topline growth, but also only growing sales and marketing low single digits? But then moving forward, your guidance, I think, is assuming an acceleration, so why do you feel as though you need to pump the pedal on the sales and marketing expense in 2018?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Sure. So, really pleased with the leverage we've been able to drive over time. The majority of that both historically and then going forward is in sales and marketing line, so our operating margin this past quarter was negative 12% versus negative 37% Q4 the year prior.</p><p>A few things that are driving that. So one of the things we've been really pleased with the results in is the growth in our self-serve, online sales engine. So that channel nearly doubled its contribution to the business this past year, and we're also moving more and more customers through that channel, which has allowed our sales force to move upmarket, so that's allowed us -- while we only grew actual rep headcount by about 10% over the past year, that understates the actual capacity and reach that we've been able to drive, and I think a lot of the growth and maturation of our channel relationships have also helped to extend the sales force to, again, drive the amount of pipeline we are able to build and conversations we are able to have at a much faster rate than the actual growth in our sales headcount.</p><p>Another driver of this has been our continued focus on serving customers more efficiently, so our free user base and the cost for all of those users, which is a sales and marketing expense, was 5% of revenue this past quarter. That's down from 10% the year prior. And then, just continuing to drive rep productivity improvements as well has been a big focus. So, we increased billings per rep by about 12% this past year and saw similar improvements the year prior.</p><p>And then as we move forward, we still think a lot of these same trends are going to play out over time. Would say that while we are not going to be moving that self-serve line again this year, so we won't expect to see the same sort of step function leverage in the coming year, we do think we have the opportunity to continue expanding that universe of customers as we go forward. So we wouldn't describe that as sort of a one-time improvement, but something that we'll continue to work on over time.</p><p>We also this year, to speak also on the investment side of things, are going to be making some pretty core investments in our marketing infrastructure and technology stack to be able to scale more efficiently over time. And then on the sales front, we think about that and it really is a balance between growth and profitability and make those decisions really based on the opportunity we're seeing in the market, the pipeline that's building, et cetera, and that's what gives us the confidence to grow our quota-carrying headcount by about 25% in the coming year.</p><p>And part of that is seeing some new opportunities open up, partly through some of the products that Aaron has been talking about, but internationally, in particular our Japan business has been growing really nicely. Now that we have this sort of core compliance capabilities and products to go after the German market, we're going to be making some investments there. So we're very, very focused on continuing to drive rep productivity improvements, sales efficiency improvements, and you can get a sense of that in terms of how we're thinking about the longer-term growth if you look at the model that we put out a couple of quarters ago at our analyst day where, when we are at $1 billion in revenue, we expect to have operating margins just north of 10%. But it's not necessarily going to be a completely linear path to get there, particularly given the size of the market and the opportunity that we're seeing at this moment in time.</p><p>MELISSA GORHAM: Got it. That's helpful. So you noted improved sales productivity. You said 12% increase in billings per sales rep, I believe. You are guiding to 25% growth in quota-carrying sales heads and you're also guiding to revenue up about 25%-ish year over year. Why wouldn't revenue grow faster if you're seeing improved sales productivity?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: So we know certainly from an initial guidance point of view, we do see, if we are able to execute on some of these opportunities and there's upside we've talked about, could see that higher.</p><p>The only thing I'd note is most of these reps will be a largely, ideally frontloaded plan from a hiring standpoint. It does take us about nine months to fully ramp an inside sales rep, about a year to fully ramp our field reps, so even the reps that we're hiring today we wouldn't expect to really start contributing until the back half of the year, and most of that is not going to show up in revenue for this year, but rather on a go-forward basis.</p><p>MELISSA GORHAM: Okay, got it. I just want to shift to competition and make sure that we address that because that's definitely an area that investors focus on because your competition are the largest vendors in the tech world, Microsoft, Google. It sounds like Microsoft, you certainly have a good relationship from a partnership perspective, and one of the areas that you talk about is just your security and enterprise capabilities that distinguish you. Why can't Microsoft catch up on those capabilities and why are they playing so nice with you when they actually compete directly with you?</p><p><person><nameText>AARON LEVIE</nameText></person>: So let me do the last question first. I think when you look at the state of enterprise software today, it is breeding out of necessity, in some cases, more than anything it's breeding the need for players to be able to interoperate and begin to work together.</p><p>We're in a multiplatform, multi-stack world that's not like it was in the 2000s or the 1990s where Microsoft or Oracle or SAP could sort of own the entire stack. And so when you're Microsoft today, and if you even look around this room, you have iPads, you have Android devices, you have Windows PCs, you have MacBooks, and so they are in a completely different world than they were when they could control the whole stack.</p><p>So they recognize that, to be able to serve their customers successfully, they have to partner with third-party solutions and external companies. That's the first thing that's sort of happening from a culture change at Microsoft and within the industry.</p><p>For us specifically in terms of competing with Microsoft, I think first and foremost our customers actually want a neutral provider to be the backbone of how they manage their information and their content. If you put all of your data in just one of these vendors, it reduces your ability to have a futureproof solution that can integrate with all the different applications that you're using. Maybe one day you are going to use Slack, maybe the next day you are going to use Facebook at work, maybe the next day you are going to use Gmail. You want to be able to have a solution that can connect to any of the applications that are in your environment without having to worry about will that content management system successfully integrate with those solutions.</p><p>So actually in this area, being agnostic and being a neutral independent player is actually an advantage for our customers, which is where they see us in the stack as being that open platform that they can leverage.</p><p>Competitively and from an innovation standpoint, I think when you look at the architecture of Microsoft solutions, this is also a point of advantage. So Microsoft is competitive with us, yes, but they actually have multiple solutions that they are trying to use to help customers be able to share and manage their information.</p><p>We think that's architecturally the wrong approach for this industry. So they have a product that you might be familiar with called OneDrive; that's their end-user sort of file, sync, and share solution. They also have a traditional service called SharePoint, which is their traditional content management and collaboration system.</p><p>We think that the future architecture actually demands that those aren't two different systems, so there is actually one platform, there's one cloud content management system that companies can have to be able to manage their data because you actually don't want to fragment your data, depending on whether you are trying to access content from a mobile device or trying to collaborate externally.</p><p>And so architecturally, we have a fundamentally different point of view around the future of this market, which gives us a decade-long headstart in terms of the category that we're building out in. So it's not a matter of building out more features to replicate Box. In fact, the more features they build out, actually the more they make the challenge harder for their customers.</p><p>So we think that due to the openness that Microsoft is driving, that leads to a really strong partnership. We think that we have a number of integration points that our customers value, so we're integrated pretty deeply into Office 365. We're integrated into some parts of Outlook. You can imagine that we're exploring ways of looking at Azure, just as we work with other major cloud providers. We integrate very deeply into Windows. So when you look at the total tie of the services that Microsoft cares about, we're actually a very strong partner or complement to probably 90% to 95% of their technologies and only competitive in a very limited area for them.</p><p>MELISSA GORHAM: Got it. Okay. That's helpful.</p><p><person><nameText>AARON LEVIE</nameText></person>: And maybe the only other final point is when you look at any of our large customers, if we look at the 64 deals above $100,000 last year -- last quarter, sorry, the majority of those will be enterprises that either have or will be deploying Office 365. So it's not as if when you buy Box, you don't buy Office 365, or vice versa. We're deploying alongside Office 365 in most large enterprise environments.</p><p>MELISSA GORHAM: Got it. Okay. Let me just ask one on the upsell opportunity and then I'm going to open it up to the audience for questions. So, you've been broadening the platform around Box. You have enterprise key management. You have governance, which you talked about yesterday, really ramping well, platform. The average price per seat has stayed relatively stable at $100 per user, so when are we going to start to see the average selling price move up on a per-seat level as you are penetrating that upsell opportunity?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: So we've seen stability over the past several years and feel pretty good about continuing to drive at least stable pricing at $100 per user per year.</p><p>There's a little bit of a dynamic of puts and takes here where we've been able to maintain price per seat, and that's been partially helped by the traction we're seeing with some of these newer products, but at the same time you're seeing much larger deployments, typically a pretty steady and meaningful increase in the number of large deals that we're selling and typically we tend to give volume discounts for those larger deals. And that $100 per user per month is a -- sorry, per year -- is a weighted average, so you're seeing a lot of these larger deals that might come in in the mid single-digit range per user per month for selling 100,000-plus users, for example, but you'll get some benefit from the additional products as well.</p><p>So, I think it will be a little bit of a function of how quickly we can sell larger deals with more seats, as well as the traction that we see from some of these products that's ultimately going to determine kind of the balance of those puts and takes, but that's the dynamic, which is why, despite increased traction with the products or because of that, we've been able to hold very stable pricing.</p><p>MELISSA GORHAM: Okay. And when you're talking about your longer-term outlook that you laid out at the analyst day, are you assuming significant ASP increases or is it just penetration in the number of seats?</p><p>DYLAN SMITH: Yes, so from a price per-seat basis, we expect that to be pretty stable going forward as well because of the dynamics, but overall would expect to see higher average contract values not just because of the increased penetration of some of these newer products, but also as we increasingly go after the heart of the legacy enterprise content management market, those are much more valuable use cases and will typically have larger deals than maybe a departmental enterprise file, sync, and share deployment, for example.</p><p><person><nameText>AARON LEVIE</nameText></person>: And I think, just to add on that, when you look at a sort of like-for-like customer, when you do add a product like Box Governance or KeySafe, you see a 30% or so uplift in price per seat, and so comparing customers that actually have deployed or purchased those solutions, you do get a pretty material price per-seat uplift. But at the same time, we're doing much larger deployments to much larger customers, which obviously gives the volume discount that Dylan mentioned.</p><p>MELISSA GORHAM: Got it. Okay. We have time for one question, if there's any in the audience. I have more, but okay.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks, good morning. Can you discuss how your -- your two new products, Box Notes and Box Relay, help us understand how you are positioning those two products in their respective markets and what's the go-to-market strategy?</p><p><person><nameText>AARON LEVIE</nameText></person>: That actually is -- they represent kind of two ends of the spectrum of our strategy. So when you think about Box and when you think about cloud content management, we think there's three really important variables to keep in mind.</p><p>The first is you have to have the best product for end users who want to be able to share and collaborate and be able to get their work done. You need to be able to have all of the right security, compliance, governance, and control features at the enterprise layer to be able to help companies have a system of record for the data, and then you need an open platform that integrates into all the different applications that our customers use. So those are really the three key focus areas of Box and our product strategy.</p><p>Box Notes is really the -- at the end-user level spans the entire spectrum of use cases that we solve. So Box Notes -- I'm sorry, Box Notes and Relay span that entire spectrum. So Box Notes is really for end users that want to be able to share and collaborate and be able to have a knowledge repository for all of the work they are doing with teams.</p><p>It's a completely free product. It's available to 100% of our customers. It drives stickiness, it drives active user engagement, and then, ultimately, it becomes a way of helping customers put more and more of their information into Box and providing a secure way for them to manage that data. So we want as many users as possible to put as much information as possible into that product.</p><p>Box Relay, on the other hand, is really about powering intelligent workflows for end users and for teams and for the overall business, and that takes us much more into some of the traditional HCM use cases, but done in a much more modern cloud-first or cloud-centric way.</p><p>So we're leveraging the workflow technology from IBM, using our sort of design ecos and end-user interface, and we've built and co-designed an end-user process management or workflow solution that lets you do complex process automation for content use cases, so that could be invoice automation, it could be HR document reviews, contract reviews, and so a lot of the traditional workflow that you would have expected in the enterprise content management space, but done in the cloud.</p><p>So, both of those products really kind of support the two ends of the end-user spectrum, and Relay will be coming out later this year. We're starting to roll that out with some data customers, and the one thing I would just add is the feedback from customers around us entering this space has been unbelievable. So both Relay specifically, but Workflow broadly, we have had an overwhelming response from customers saying this is exactly what we've been looking for from Box to help us move beyond being able to do end-user file sharing and collaboration, but ultimately to be able to power important and critical business processes on Box.</p><p>So I would say that Relay is our first foray into Workflow with enterprises, but you are going to see more capabilities over time both in the Box core product, as well as additional services that allow us to address use cases in the Workflow space.</p><p>MELISSA GORHAM: Okay, great. Unfortunately, we're out of time, but thank you so much.</p><p><person><nameText>AARON LEVIE</nameText></person>: Okay. Thank you. Cool.

Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues. Q1 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[2] Although the S...00 started out 2018 by continuing its steady upward climb, that trend ended abruptly in late January and early February, when it declined by over 10% in just nine trading days. On February 8th, the index officially entered correction territory for the first time in two years (a stock market correction is defined as a decline of 10% from the market's previous high). Pundits blamed the pullback on the potential of both rising interest rates and inflation (as well as a host of other reasons). Despite the S...00 partially recovering from its February lows, it still ended the quarter in the red despite being up over 6% at one point in January. </p><p>All sectors, except technology and consumer discretionary, declined for the quarter. In early February, during the height of the sell-off, investors withdrew $22.9 billion from U.S. stock funds, according to EPFR Global. Whether these investors reentered the market in time for the subsequent rebound is impossible to ascertain, but knowing investor psychology, we highly doubt it. Prior to the first quarter, the stock market has been devoid of volatility. At one point, the S...00 had 404 consecutive trading days without a 5% correction: the longest such streak since 1959, according to Bianco Research. Many investors seized on this trend and made bets that the low volatility environment would continue unchecked. This trade was quite profitable and lulled market participants into a false sense of security. However, the sudden rise in volatility that began in early February caught many investors flatfooted and caused such massive losses that some funds were forced to close. The ProShares Short VIX Fund, which investors purchase to wager against a rise in volatility, at one point declined by 97% from its high the previous month. In addition, Credit Suisse shut down a volatility-linked fund after it lost most of its value in a single trading session. Before imploding, this fund had increased by 585% over the past two years! <url normalizedValue=\"https://mk0valuewalkgcar7lmc.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Boyar-Value-Group-1.jpg\">https://mk0valuewalkgcar7lmc.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Boyar-Value-Group-1.jpg</url> We believe that the sudden spike in volatility was exacerbated by the rise of certain types of passive investment strategies. After propelling the market to historic highs, these strategies (which follow a set of rules enacted by sophisticated computer programs with no human intervention) led the market downward during the first quarter of 2018. Passive strategies in aggregate, which include both the aforementioned strategies as well as plain vanilla index funds, now own close to 40% of U.S. stocks, according to research by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. This new investment landscape may bring with it increased volatility going forward. Since 2009, ETFs and index funds have pumped trillions of dollars into the stock market. Although it is impossible to say how much these inflows contributed to the outperformance of passive versus active managers, it was likely a sizable amount. Logic would dictate that when investors choose to exit these investments, the major indices will be adversely affected. Perhaps we are entering an environment when good old-fashioned stock picking will outperform the major averages for a prolonged period; only time will tell. Some Thoughts About the Market The technology sector represents ~25% of the S...00, its highest weighting since just months before the bursting of the dotcom bubble. The valuations for the sector at 29.5x trailing earnings (their 20-year average is 25.7x) are much lower now than they were then. However, the technology sector sells at a significantly higher multiple than the S...00, which, as of the end of the first quarter, sported a 21.2x trailing P/E ratio. Technology shares' elevated valuations, coupled with their large weightings in the index, will most likely prove to be a performance headwind in the not-so-distant future.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mk0valuewalkgcar7lmc.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Boyar-Value-Group-2.jpg\">https://mk0valuewalkgcar7lmc.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Boyar-Value-Group-2.jpg</url> Although it would be premature to proclaim that the market leadership has changed from a largely technology-fueled rally, we are seeing preliminary signs that the leadership may be starting to rotate. The FAANG stocks shed more than $200 billion in market value from mid-March to mid-April. In addition, as of April 23rd, the technology heavy NASDAQ Composite has underperformed the S...00 by 1.35% over the past month. As we mentioned in our last quarterly letter, which is worth repeating below: During our respective investment careers (which, for one of us, has been for almost half a century), we have learned that when a particular investment style has caught the attention of a large group of market participants by capturing outsized gains, investors should exercise extreme caution. For example, during the 1960s and 70s, a group of stocks, affectionately dubbed the 'nifty fifty,' were in high demand. Companies like Polaroid and Xerox were considered one-decision stocks\u2014in other words, investors could buy them and hold them forever\u2014because they would be able to grow earnings regardless of economic conditions. The valuations of these companies soared; in fact, Polaroid was the first major company to command a P/E multiple of 100. When the U.S. economy entered a severe recession in the early- to mid-1970s, the nifty fifty's profit growth faltered, and these stocks lost, on average, ~75% of their value. In addition, at the height of the dotcom mania, value-oriented investors were considered to be dinosaurs and underperformed the market for several years. However, they were eventually vindicated when the vast majority of dotcom companies crashed and burned, causing the tech-heavy NASDAQ to lose almost 80% of its value after peaking in March of 2000. In the era following the dotcom implosion, value investing once again regained its luster and handily beat growth stocks for a prolonged period of time. We are confident this will eventually reoccur; we just cannot accurately predict the timing. Potential Problems in Corporate Debt? Many of America's best-known firms have taken advantage of the prolonged low interest rate environment to load up on cheap debt. Some have used this cash wisely to invest in their business (or purchase other businesses at reasonable prices) to help generate future growth. Some have used the debt proceeds to buy back their shares at attractive prices. However, others have used them for less profitable pursuits such as ill-advised acquisitions or buying back their shares at undesirable prices. Many of these organizations, prior to their debt binge, had highly rated corporate debt. However, according to an article that appeared in The Wall Street Journal written by Ben Eisen ...m Goldfarb, many of these companies are now rated BBB, which is a notch above junk status. Outstanding U.S. debt, rated BBB, currently amounts to $2.2 trillion according to Morgan Stanley (up from only $686 billion only a decade ago). BBB-rated bonds now account for 50% of the investment-grade corporate debt market. So, why should equity investors be concerned? It appears as if we are entering a rising interest rate environment, and the amount of maturing investment-grade bonds is set to double in the next two to three years according to Bank of America (this includes investment grade bonds other than BBB). If the economic backdrop becomes negative, these firms could have trouble refinancing their debt or, at a minimum, have to pay significantly more in interest expenses. Either scenario would have a negative impact on the common shares of these businesses. This is something certainly worth monitoring. Elevated Margin Loans: A Potential Warning Sign? William Shakespeare is credited with writing 'neither a borrower nor a lender be.' Perhaps investors should heed the Bard's advice. According to an article written in The Wall Street Journal on February 25th by Michael Wursthorn and Chelsey Dulaney, U.S. investors currently have borrowings of $642 billion against their stock portfolios. According to Goldman Sachs, the amount of money on margin was worth 1.31% of the total value of all stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. The previous peak was 1.27%, which occurred prior to the tech bubble bursting in 2000. When an investor accepts a margin loan, they borrow money from their broker and pledge the stocks in their account as collateral. If the stocks in their portfolio decline significantly, the broker gives the investor a margin call; if the investor does not quickly post additional collateral, the broker will sell the investor's pledged shares to ensure they will be repaid. Margin loans are excellent for investors in an upward-moving stock market because gains in their stock portfolio are magnified by the magic of leverage. However, leverage cuts both ways, and during periods of extreme volatility or a bear market, it can cause investors to sell shares at the worst possible time. While we are not predicting the end of the bull run, investors should be highly cautious of leveraging their investments. In addition, the fact that margin loans are at an all-time high is concerning because, historically, a high level of margin debt has been a terrific contraindicator of future stock market performance. Bitcoin Had its Worst First Quarter in History Last November, when Bitcoin hit ~$20,000, everyone was talking about it and had Bitcoin envy. So, when you look at your stock portfolio and bemoan your modest stock market loss for the quarter, think about how lucky you are for not buying Bitcoin. The currency fell from $13,412.44 to $6,928.85 for the three months ending March 31, a decline of 48%, according to industry website CoinDesk. Should you have any questions, we are always available.

Over the same period, U.S. stocks overall fell 8%. At first, the drop in big tech stocks seems driven by bad news that is bound to worsen: Facebook improperly sharing personal data, President Trump criticizing Amazon, European regulators investigating potential antitrust violations. Or could this just be a stumble? Have big tech companies developed an unstoppable business model?... Traditionally, the bigger companies have gotten, the harder it has become for them to keep growing at the same rate. For today's leading innovators, however, growing might not have to mean slowing. Unfettered by the costs of raw materials or the burdens of manufacturing, distribution and advertising, these companies plan decades ahead, rather than fixate on hitting Wall Street's quarterly earnings targets. Consider Amazon. Over the three years ending Dec. 31, 2011, its revenues more than doubled, to $48 billion. Over the next three years, its sales nearly doubled again, to $89 billion. Then, over the three years ending Dec. 31, 2017, Amazon's revenues doubled yet again, to $178 billion. Investors don't know exactly how to price such rapid growth. Although the cash Amazon generated from operations grew more than tenfold from 2008 through 2017, the company plowed most of it back into expanding the business. So net income grew only less than fivefold, with enormous fluctuations along the way. James Anderson, head of global equities at Baillie Gifford .... in Edinburgh, thinks Amazon, along with some other giants including Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings, 'live in a permanent state of revolution.' They have 'a profound distrust of the idea that scale has to impinge on a business's ability to grow and keep disrupting' Of course, history also suggests that every firm that was expected to dominate indefinitely \u2014 from RCA in the 1920s to IBM in the 1980s to Nokia in the 1990s \u2014 has ended up slipping. And the idea of virtually limitless growth flies in the face of much of human experience. Trees can't grow to the sky because they would be bent and crushed under their own weight first The twin beliefs that high-fliers must fall to earth and that underappreciated stocks should rise again are at the heart of value investing. It's conceivable that those principles may be less relevant today, when powerful technology companies can pulverize entire industries. In a classic article, 'Growth Stocks and the St. Petersburg Paradox,' finance scholar David Durand warned that at ultra-high growth rates over long horizons, even slight shortfalls lead to enormous differences in end results. That makes the shares of such companies extraordinarily volatile.With Amazon and Netflix trading at more than 200 times their net profits, and many of the other new tech giants at more than 40 times earnings, they aren't exempt from that iron law. It's impossible to know for sure whether companies like Amazon have broken free from the traditional limits to growth. Unless you can hold them for a decade or more, as Mr. Anderson likes to, you probably will get shaken out before you can even find out. \u2014Excerpt from an article that appeared in the Wall Street Journal on April 6th, 2018 by Jason Zweig The So-Called Smart Money Has Started to Sell at the End of the Trading Day, a Bad Sign for This Bull Market The so-called smart money has recently started to bail on the stock market at the end of the trading day, a leading indicator the bull run may be over.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mk0valuewalkgcar7lmc.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Boyar-Value-Group-3.jpg\">https://mk0valuewalkgcar7lmc.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Boyar-Value-Group-3.jpg</url> Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth, explains: The Smart Money Index (SMI) takes the first half hour of trading, which is dominated by retail investors ('dumb money'), reverses its sign and adds it to the last half hour of trading, which is typically dominated by institutional investors ('smart money'). The index is down more than 18 percent since hitting an all-time high in January, according to Ablin. The S...00, meanwhile, is down just 5.5 percent since reaching a record on Jan. 26, suggesting it may have further to fall to catch up with this leading indicator. \"The Smart Money Index turned downward as early as June 2008, long before the September market swoon, and bottomed in October of that year, five months before the S...ebounded,\" added the strategist To be sure, in this age of sophisticated computer trading with large funds spreading orders out throughout the day using algorithms, this indicator's predictive ability may not be the same as it once was. And Ablin does not believe you should base your whole market forecast on it. The indicator is \"better characterized a spice rather than a key ingredient in the outlook mix,\" he wrote. \u2014Excerpt from CNBC.com written by Fred Imbert April 18, 2018 What It Takes to Build a $100 Million Art Collection A hundred years ago this week, the most influential economist of the 20th century began assembling what became one of the best collections of modern art then in private hands. Every investor hoping to diversify a conventional portfolio with nontraditional assets can learn from the collecting career of John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946)  The returns on so-called emotional assets aren't directly comparable to those on financial assets: Dealers, auction houses and private transactions can price the same work of art at drastically divergent prices. Commissions and markups can exceed 20% \u2014 often by a lot. So, three leading finance professors, David Chambers and Elroy Dimson of Judge Business School at Cambridge University and Christophe Spaenjers of HEC Paris, have done a service by analyzing the financial returns of Keynes's art collection over the past century. In his three decades of collecting, Keynes paid a total of 12,847 for his holdings, roughly 600,000 ($840,000) today when adjusted for inflation. Based on appraisals in 2013 by five independent experts, Keynes's collection is worth more than 70.9 million, or $99 million. That's an average return of 10.9% annually, barely a tenth of a percentage point below the return on British stocks over the same period. Beneath that spectacular return lie several important lessons Of the 135 works in Keynes's collection, two account for more than half its total value and 10 constitute 91%. Simulating 1,000 randomly chosen art portfolios sold at auction from 1980 through 2015, Profs. Chambers, Dimson and Spaenjers found their returns varied wildly, with most of them severely underperforming the stock market. For investors in art and stocks alike, all this shows how important it is not to put all your eggs in one basket \u2014 in case the basket you pick turns out to be the wrong one. Only by diversifying can you be sure of ending up holding winners Still, the history of Keynes's collection shows the importance of luck. He assembled much of his art in 1918-19 and again in the 1930s. Keynes thus had rare opportunities, as the investing proverb goes, to 'buy when blood is in the streets.' Unlike stocks, whose prices don't vary significantly depending on where they trade, art doesn't sell on centralized exchanges. 'In illiquid asset markets, like that for art, you may be able to buy an asset cheaply if you're lucky,' says Prof. Spaenjers \u2014 for example, at a sparsely attended auction. In 1918, with German artillery shells shaking Paris, Keynes attended the auction of the estate of the artist Edgar Degas and bought a Czanne still life for 370.50. To put that price in perspective, a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost cost roughly 1,200 to 1,450 around the same time, according to Amii Errington, archivist at the International Club for Rolls-Royce ...ntley Enthusiasts For all his advantages of expert advice and uncanny fortune, even Keynes \u2014 one of the shrewdest investors of the 20th century \u2014 ended up with a collection in which most of the artworks barely went up in value at all. To be realistic, investors in art should recognize the importance of luck and the risk that, in the end, the psychic return is the only thing they can count on.

So it is not surprising that each time I discuss the democratic dangers of Facebook, Amazon, or Google, people always bring up personal consumer choice. Instead of policy (antitrust, data rules, outlawing arbitration), the conversation veers quickly into pride or guilt. One woman worries she can't leave Facebook without leaving her social life. One man sheepishly says he quit Facebook for a few weeks and crept back when he missed his friends. At the heart of this conversation is a thesis: Using a service is an endorsement of its business model. Or more pointedly: If someone is not strong enough to boycott, she lacks standing to object to the behavior of lawmakers and petition them for change.</p><p><br/>This belief is wrong, bad strategy, and dangerous for democracy. It is based on a confused idea of our obligations as consumers. This belief does not lead to more boycotts, but radically dampens activism: Guilt gets in the way of protest, and complicated chains of self-justification take the place of simple chains of democratic demand. This consumer model is most problematic when it comes to the biggest monopolies. Most people can't boycott them, precisely because they are governmental and provide infrastructure services. We don't ask people to boycott libraries in order to change library rules; we don't ask people to boycott highways to ask for them to be safer; we don't demand that you buy only bottled water while protesting water-utility governance.<br/>Of course, a strategic, organized, well-thought-through boycott with political goals can be transformational. And there is nothing wrong with people personally quitting products when they can. However, ethical consumerism has taken too central a role in progressive thinking, and we shouldn't require people to boycott essential communications infrastructure such as Facebook and Google in order to demand that they be broken up. The railroads were regulated by anti-monopoly protesters who depended on the railroads, and the same can be true for the next generation of trust-busters. Boycotts can play a crucial role in political change, but not when they serve only as tests of individual integrity.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/tech-giants-are-dangerous-and-congress-knows-it/614740/?utm_source=feed\">Franklin Foer: The tech giants are dangerous, and Congress knows it</url>]<br/>The reason for this is that boycotts replace tension in the political sphere with tension in the private sphere, putting the central axis of tension between the firm and the activists. Will they or won't they change practices? As such, boycotts can lead to small changes, or tangential promises to provide other kinds of community support that are not in line with the initial purpose of the boycott. As author Nicole Aschoff <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/free-market-conscious-capitalism-government/\">recently argued</url> in Jacobin magazine, \"When consumers and environmental NGOs channel their desire for environmental justice through the firm, their desires get absorbed into business strategies for growth and expansion.\" In this way, ethical consumerism relies too heavily on partnerships with corporations to make change rather than challenging the leverage they have in our monopolized economy.<br/>This post was excerpted from Teachout's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250200891\">recent book.</url><br/>Boycotts do have widespread appeal. The Vox columnist Matthew Yglesias has taken a look at why, <url normalizedValue=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/144418/left-cant-rely-boycotts-alone\">writing,</url> \"Consumer brands are a leverage point for progressive politics because there's no gerrymandering &amp;amp; marketers care more about young people. Consumer marketing is almost the exact opposite of voting and a younger, more urbanized, and more female demographic carries more weight.\"<br/>This logic may lead to a short-term sense of empowerment, but to longer-term disempowerment-the more progressives lean into their consumer power as the key point of leverage, the less they focus on exercising their political power, the less long-term collective power they will amass. In other words, boycotts allow people to import virtuousness into their life without the struggle of organizing and building a coalition.<br/>Additionally, consumer politics is certainly less complicated than actually wielding power. The University of North Carolina sociology professor and Atlantic contributing writer Zeynep Tufekci <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_online_social_change_easy_to_organize_hard_to_win/transcript\">argues that</url> people \"want to stay out of politics because they fear corruption and co-optation. They have a point. Modern representative democracies are being strangled in many countries by powerful interests.\" But, she points out, the long-term impact of dropping out of politics may be to make individuals cleaner and the system dirtier.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/pandemic-making-monopolies-worse/614644/?utm_source=feed\">David Dayen: America's monopoly problem goes way beyond the tech giants</url>]<br/>Today, there are hundreds of boycotts every year, and most do not have any appreciable impact. People lose interest, don't maintain a public presence around a boycott, and the number of people involved is typically too small to make a market difference. What difference is made typically revolves around \"the more modest goal of attracting media attention,\" not the loss of income, the University of Pennsylvania professor Maurice Schweitzer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-boycotts-history-20180228-htmlstory.html\">says</url>.<br/>The Chick-fil-A boycott, one of the largest in recent memory, came about when the Chick-fil-A CEO made anti-gay marriage comments. Organizers staged kiss-ins, and mayors said Chick-fil-A was not welcome in their towns. But Chick-fil-A ignored the protests, people forgot the comments after a few years, and little changed. As one commentator put it, \"It is hard to stay mad at a ubiquitous and powerful brand.\" While, in theory, people did commit to stop eating at Chick-fil-A until it changed its posture on marriage equality, the company outlasted the protest; it still rates a zero on the Human Rights Campaign's Buyers Guide, and LGBTQ people are not included in its nondiscrimination policy.<br/>Ethical consumerism-and its close relatives corporate accountability and corporate social responsibility-is especially poorly suited to monopolized economies, and a tragic misfit for disciplining companies that play a quasi-governmental role. By accepting big corporations as partners, and not challenging their legitimacy as our rulers, the consumer-boycott model allows for short-term victories that appear to be progressive, while the partner corporation is building sufficient power to become boycott-proof.<br/>If Chick-fil-A was hard to boycott, think about what boycotting Google would mean. First, imagine a one-person boycott, someone angry about, say, Google-enabled job discrimination. He would have to get rid of his Android phone and switch from Gmail. He'd have to stop using Google Search and Google Maps. He'd have to refuse to watch anything on YouTube. He'd have to get rid of Nest. If he owned a business, he'd have to avoid Google ads, which he might rely on to reach customers. He'd have to refuse to use municipal Wi-Fi in cities where Google is behind \"free\" Wi-Fi. If he had children, he would have to tell them to refuse to use the technology required to interact with their teachers.<br/>And even if he succeeds in doing all these things, Google will not boycott him. If he uses the internet, he will necessarily see Google-served ads, and his responses and nonresponses to those ads will feed into Google's data bank. Google will still collect information about him when he walks by a LinkNYC kiosk. Google will still collect his tax dollars in subsidies.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/07/antitrust-hearing-tech-pandemic-inescapable/614749/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The tech companies already won</url>]<br/>Now try imagining an effective organized boycott of Google, large enough to actually dent the company's profits. There are more than 5 billion Google searches a day. Can we really imagine enough people switching to an alternate search engine or going without asking their question? Google will continue collecting information on those people regardless, and Search is just one part of the Google behemoth. As if that weren't daunting enough, imagine a sector-based boycott of the data-collection practices of all the big tech companies-Facebook, Google, Amazon-for their shared behaviors.<br/>In a comic <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/business/boycott-facebook-apple-google-failed.html\">New York Times article,</url> one reporter chronicled the social-media accounts that pushed boycotts using products from the companies they were boycotting. A quarter of the people who tweeted #boycottGoogle (a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/google-fires-employee-who-wrote-10-page-anti-diversity-manifesto\">campaign organized</url> to protest Google's firing of the engineer James Damore) did so from Android phones. And people boycotting Amazon kept shopping at Amazon-owned Whole Foods. Cher protested Facebook's role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal by leaving Facebook but remaining active on Facebook-owned Instagram. \"I don't know if I can get out of the ecosystem,\" said one activist. \"Where am I supposed to go?\" said another. \"I wish there was something else.\"<br/>In 2019, the city of Richmond, California, ended its contract with Vigilant Solutions, a data-analytics company that does business with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The city of Berkeley, following suit, debated boycotting all companies that provided services to ICE and Customs and Border Protection, including Amazon, because these federal agencies rely on Amazon Web Services. The Berkeley city manager, Dee Williams-Ridley, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/california-today-berkeley-boycott-amazon.html\">argued against</url>boycotting Amazon, because it \"would have a huge negative impact to the citywide operations.\" Amazon helps manage city documents, and hosts housing and mental-health programs, and Amazon servers host many other tech companies that provide services to the city. People unwittingly using the thing they are supposedly boycotting to advertise their boycott can seem funny. But the lack of choice facing all boycotters actually represents a serious narrowing of the window of moral political behavior.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/is-there-a-constitutional-right-to-boycott/552077/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The constitutional right to boycott</url>]<br/>The change in effectiveness can be confusing for people who remember the successful boycotts in the 1980s and '90s of companies such as Nike, which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2012/jul/06/activism-nike\">came under fire</url> for using sweatshops. Companies have reorganized their supply chains in a way that insulates them from liability and protest. Garment manufacturers no longer have direct relationships with big companies, who build systems of deliberate ignorance into their purchasing. According to Professor Richard Locke's research on Nike, workplace conditions in almost 80 percent of its root suppliers remained either the same or worsened between 2001 and 2005, though the company's records <url normalizedValue=\"https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/the-myth-of-the-ethical-shopper/\">may appear better</url> on paper. Most important, every part of Nike's supply chain is monopolized, with just a few major players, so boycotters have nowhere else to go. A serious boycott would involve buying no foreign-manufactured garments, rather than targeting particular companies.<br/>Growing consolidation of power interacts with the rise of social media, leading to more boycotts that are less effective and shorter-lasting. As Tufekci has argued, these actions tend to the ephemeral and episodic, instead of the effective and persistent. The result is a combination of hyperactivity online and decreased power. Boycotts gin up social-media presence on an almost daily basis. Unlike a demand for legislative action-where inaction by a lawmaker grows in meaning over time-the longer a company does not change in the face of protests, the more powerful it gets. The lawmaker becomes vulnerable to a primary challenger; the company has proved that it is strong.<br/>There are also strong class and social elements to boycotting something like Facebook. It may not be essential for an upper-middle-class man living in New York, with an existing strong network of friends who appreciate his eccentricities, to use Facebook or Instagram. But a young person looking for work, let alone friendship, might find it hard to check out of all Facebook-owned properties, because they are so central to social life, and the web of job connections. The human cost of social isolation is enormous, and while some people may have sturdy offline social networks, many people do not. I met one anti-monopoly activist who guiltily confessed that she stayed on Facebook because she wanted to check on her grandmother's health.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/people-who-hated-web-even-before-facebook/584932/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The people who hated the web even before Facebook</url>]<br/>Yet we have somehow inculcated a belief that if someone fails to boycott a company, she lacks standing to object to political behavior or to petition Congress for change. People feel guilty about not boycotting, and that guilt gets in the way of full-throated political protest. In law, there is a doctrine called \"exhaustion of remedies.\" It prevents a litigant from seeking a remedy in a new court or jurisdiction until all claims or remedies have been pursued as fully as possible-exhausted-in the original one. In politics, consumer supremacy has led to a kind of exhaustion-of-remedies thinking, through which people adopt a hierarchy of modes of resistance, and feel they must first boycott, and only then ask lawmakers for change. It places consumer obligations over civic ones.<br/>We need to change the current habits of protest in a way that places public, electoral politics at the heart of how we interact with corporate monopolies. If your local pizza parlor starts treating workers badly, sure, boycott it. But when a monopolistic drug company hikes up prices, or a social-media goliath promotes political lies to make more money, the right response is not to beg Google or Facebook for scraps, but to march to Congress and demand that the practices be investigated and the power of these companies be broken up. And if your representative fails to act, don't boycott her. Replace her.<br/><br/>This article is adapted from Teachout's recent book, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250200891\">Break 'Em Up: Recovering Our Freedom From Big Ag, Big Tech, and Big Money</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-boycottscantbeatestofmoralpurity614821</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HB-D691-DYY9-J17W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2261\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

And I'm calling on everyone else in the movement - organizations, individuals and politicians - to do the same.</p><p>Stop taking money from Big Tech.</p><p>That's it. And if you keep taking the cash, at least be transparent. (None of this stuff where you hide the donation either. We know how that game is played.) Don't take a penny going forward without owning up to it. Put a note prominently on your website that you support Big Tech censorship of free speech. And you get paid to do it.</p><p>Big Tech is a threat to our freedom. It's no longer a haven for free speech. The dangers that companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok pose to ordinary Americans are getting difficult to hide, even for them. To fend off critics, they are doing what companies always do - buy friends.</p><p>TikTok, owned by the Chinese firm ByteDance, is the latest of a long line of tech companies raining money on D.C. It \u201chas hired a small army of more than 35 lobbyists to work on its behalf, including one with deep ties to President Trump,\u201d according to\u00a0The New York Times.</p><p>Ordinarily, a lot of that money would land in the bank accounts of some conservative organizations. Opposing government regulation is in our DNA. But the status quo isn't working. It ends up dividing conservatives on an existential threat to our existence.</p><p>I've been running a conservative nonprofit for 33 years. I know all about the need to bring in donations and to make payroll. I'm not criticizing anyone who has done so.</p><p>But, times have changed. Big Tech no longer pretends to be a friend or ally to the conservative movement. Instead, it poses a threat to the right and to democracy itself.</p><p>It's essential for conservative organizations to put their money where their mouths are.</p><p>Good organizations don't accept funding from their enemies. And that's what Big Tech is. Some of those companies - like Twitter, Google and Paypal - are already allied with the left. Others, like Facebook, are being dragged further and further out of the mainstream by woke employees intent on silencing free speech.</p><p>Our speech.</p><p>The result adds up to the same thing. Don't work for the enemy. We have to rein in their influence - even if it means taking drastic measures.</p><p>Even Congress is worried about the size and influence of the biggest of Big Tech companies. The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is having a major hearing on the dangers of that industry Wednesday. CEOs of four of the most important companies in the world are being called on the congressional carpet.</p><p>They represent Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Collectively, these companies have a market cap of more than $4.5 trillion. Only three nations - the U.S., China and Japan - have a GDP larger than that.</p><p>It's the sixth hearing about \u201cOnline Platforms and Market Power,\u201d going back to June last year. Meanwhile, those online companies have grown contemptuous of our republic. Heading into the presidential election, the most powerful companies in human history are making it almost impossible to hold a fair vote.</p><p>The more Congress talks antitrust or other solutions to Big Tech, the more the companies will drop pallets full of cash on Washington like Obama did with Iran. We have to say no to every dollar.</p><p>At the same time, they keep up their leftist agenda. This past week, Google knocked more than a dozen prominent conservative sites off of its main search. The company claimed it had been a\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/google-says-technical-error-responsible-for-some-news-sites-homepages-not-showing-up-in-search-results\">\u201ctechnical error,\u201d</url>\u00a0not that anyone believes it. Former Google engineer Mike Wacker wondered if the company had a \u201csecret blacklist\u201d of conservative sites.</p><p>Even if it were an innocent mistake, it's still a reminder of just how much power Google has to shut all of us down. No company should be able to do that.</p><p>Facebook, which has 2.6 billion customers around the globe, has moved rapidly to censor the president and his ad campaigns. The company's latest insane move is to tag all politician posts that mention mail-in voting with links on how to sign up - even if the posts are against mail-in voting. Amazon, owned by\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0owner Jeff Bezos, and Apple, led by CEO Tim Cook, are nearly as bad.</p><p>Those four power-brokers will be testifying Wednesday. Congress must demand to know why companies that enormous are allowed to control our lives and now our elections.

The moratorium on Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approvals would provide Congress time to close the ILC loophole and ensure ILCs and their parent companies don't pose unnecessary risks to consumers and taxpayers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"ILCs offer banking products and services that are functionally indistinguishable from those offered by banks, but the ILC loophole allows the parent companies of ILCs to avoid oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and to engage in commercial activities, thus introducing risk to the banking system and to taxpayers,\" the groups wrote. \"Legislative action to close this loophole is necessary to eliminate these risks.\"</p><p>ILCs are FDIC-insured, state-chartered institutions that can generally engage in the full range of banking activities, such as taking deposits and making loans. But unlike banks, their parent companies are not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act, which means those companies are not subject to any federal supervision, regulations or standards. For this reason, there has historically been considerable opposition to the charter, and both Congress and the FDIC have placed temporary moratoria on ILCs.</p><p>Big Tech company ownership of an ILC introduces a new concern: that consumer data, including sensitive personal financial information, will be inadequately safeguarded and used in inappropriate and unauthorized ways. With global e-commerce giant Rakuten recently joining tech firms such as Square and Nelnet in applying to form ILCs, the risk associated with this legal loophole is greater than ever.</p><p>\"In the era of dominant Big Tech, we should be cautious before giving technology companies even greater reach into the economic life of Americans by allowing them to own banks,\" the groups wrote. \"The integration of technology and banking firms would not only result in an enormous concentration of financial and technological assets but also would pose conflicts of interest and privacy concerns to our banking system.\"</p><p>The groups further noted, \"A growth in ILCs poses broader consumer protection risks as well, because non-bank lenders, including very high-cost lenders, view the ILC charter as a far easier way to obtain banking privileges than obtaining a traditional bank charter and, consequently, becoming subject to consolidated Federal Reserve supervision.\"</p><p>In March, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking related to parent companies of industrial banks and industrial loan companies. BPI, CRL, ICBA and a coalition of civil rights groups wrote to the FDIC requesting that the FDIC not approve ILC deposit insurance applications until its ILC rulemaking is final. However, in recent months, the FDIC has approved some ILC applications and is reviewing others, including some whose parent companies engage in commercial activities.</p><p>About Bank Policy Institute.</p><p>The Bank Policy Institute (BPI) is a nonpartisan public policy, research and advocacy group, representing the nation's leading banks and their customers. Our members include universal banks, regional banks and the major foreign banks doing business in the United States. Collectively, they employ almost 2 million Americans, make nearly half of the nation's small business loans, and are an engine for financial innovation and economic growth.</p><p>About The Center for Responsible Lending.</p><p>The Center for Responsible Lending (CRL) is a nonprofit, non-partisan research and policy organization dedicated to protecting homeownership and family wealth by working to eliminate abusive financial practices.</p><p>About ICBA.</p><p>The Independent Community Bankers of America creates and promotes an environment where community banks flourish. With more than 50,000 locations nationwide, community banks constitute 99 percent of all banks, employ nearly 750,000 Americans and are the only physical banking presence in one in three U.S. counties. Holding more than $5 trillion in assets, nearly $4 trillion in deposits, and more than $3.4 trillion in loans to consumers, small businesses and the agricultural community, community banks channel local deposits into the Main Streets and neighborhoods they serve, spurring job creation, fostering innovation and fueling their customers' dreams in communities throughout America.

Vodafone M-Pesa, en el este de \u00c1frica, Egipto e India y Mercado Libre, en Argentina, Brasil y M\u00e9xico. </p><p>Google, Amazon, PayPal, que es propiedad de eBay, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft y Groupon operan en todo el mundo. </p><p>Los servicios de pago de las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas en China representan un 16 % del producto interior bruto (PIB), una cantidad muy elevada porque otras formas de pago no efectivo, incluidas las tarjetas de cr\u00e9dito, es baja. </p><p>La irrupci\u00f3n ha sido mayor en pa\u00edses donde la provisi\u00f3n de pagos es limitada y gran parte de la poblaci\u00f3n tiene tel\u00e9fonos m\u00f3viles, pero no tiene cuentas bancarias o acceso a servicios financieros esenciales, seg\u00fan el BPI. </p><p>Adem\u00e1s, de servicios de pagos, tambi\u00e9n ofrecen fondos del mercado monetario, como inversiones a corto plazo, y seguros. </p><p>En China han crecido r\u00e1pidamente los fondos del mercado monetario ofrecidos a trav\u00e9s de plataformas de grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas, aunque todav\u00eda son peque\u00f1os en comparaci\u00f3n con otras formas de ahorro. </p><p>El fondo Yu'ebao ofrecido a los usuarios de Alipay, con unos 350 millones de clientes, tiene activos por valor de m\u00e1s de 1 bill\u00f3n de yuanes, unos 150.000 millones de d\u00f3lares, por lo que en cinco a\u00f1os se ha convertido en el mayor fondo del mercado monetario del mundo. </p><p>A finales de 2018 los balances de fondos del mercado de dinero relacionados con las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas contabilizaron 2,4 billones de yuanes, unos 360.000 millones de d\u00f3lares, cantidad que representa un 1 % de los dep\u00f3sitos bancarios o un 8 % de productos de gesti\u00f3n de patrimonios. </p><p>El 30 de junio el BPI celebra su Asamblea General y publica su Informe Econ\u00f3mico Anual completo y el Informe Anual 2018-2019.

Office workers stuck at home are more inclined to do their place up, and many will have more time to do fiddly jobs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even so, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/22/b-and-q-owner-sales-surge-on-back-of-lockdown-diy-boom-screwfix-kingfisher-coronavirus\">sales at Kingfisher</url>, owner of B&amp;Q and Screwfix, aren't simply strong, but are spectacularly so. Like-for-like sales in June were up 26% in the UK and Ireland and the pace has only slackened slightly in July. Over in France, where the group owns the Castorama and Brico De\u00b4po^t chains, the numbers are even higher.</p><p>It is why Kingfisher, even with stores limited to selling essential items for a few weeks, is confident that its half-year profits, for a period ending in July, will beat last year's \u00a3337m. The shares rose 15% on Wednesday and, after initially slumping with the lockdown, are now in positive territory for 2020.</p><p>So what happens to the furlough money that supported the wages of 16,000 staff in the UK during the lockdown weeks? Can the Treasury have a few quid back?</p><p>That is where Kingfisher's script became blurry. The group intends to decline the \u00a31,000-per-employee return-to-work bonus next January, but the bigger sums relate the furlough scheme itself. On that score, the group muttered about keeping things under review \"given uncertainty over a Covid-19 resurgence and the wider economic outlook\".</p><p>Sorry, but that's a fudge. The right answer should be easy: if you are a FTSE 100 company enjoying a boost to profits, even a modest one, from the pandemic, you should do the decent thing and return your furlough payments.</p><p>                   Melrose still keeping the wheels turning                   </p><p>The aerospace and automotive industries are two to avoid during a pandemic. Melrose is stuck in the middle of both thanks to its \u00a38bn purchase of GKN in 2018, a bitterly fought contest that seemed at the time to have delivered a bargain to the buyer. Nobody is talking about brilliant timing now. A share price that was 240p in February is now 103p. For the time being, Melrose's manta of \"buy, improve, sell\" seems to have been replaced by something more like \"cut, stabilise, keep going\".</p><p>But the approach seems to be working. The board crowed about how cash was still generated in the first half, allowing \u00a390m of debt to be repaid. Yes, that's impressive in the context of a 27% plunge in revenues, even if more heavy job losses look inevitable. One suspects an independent GKN would not have been so resilient.</p><p>The cash performance should allay worries about debt. A \u00a33.2bn debt looks towering but Melrose also has its pre-GKN operations available for sale. The biggest operation is Nortek, an air-conditioning business enjoying a fillip from big tech's need to cool its sweaty data centres. Nortek may be worth \u00a32.5bn. A cash sale next year would transform the balance sheet, which helps to explain why Melrose's bankers are behaving nicely.</p><p>None of which alters the fact that the original GKN turnaround plan will be severely delayed. The aerospace division, supplying Airbus, Boeing, Rolls-Royce and defence contractors, is likely to see sales fall by at least a quarter over the full year and the rate of recovery is anyone's guess. The automotive division, big in powertrains, should pick up more quickly but, again, expectations will have to be reset.</p><p>Melrose expects a \"small adjusted operating profit\" this year, quite a comedown from the \u00a31bn-plus the City had expected pre-Covid. In this climate, though, the job is to keep the wheels turning; Melrose is clearly managing to do that.</p><p>                   New FCA boss can make mark by circumventing City lip service on diversity                   </p><p>Nikhil Rathi, incoming chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, wants boards of City firms - banks, insurers, fund managers and so on - to be more diverse, meaning more women and minority ethnic candidates should be appointed to senior roles.</p><p>The surprise, though, is how Rathi thinks this excellent goal could be pursued. If progress doesn't happen, he told MPs, \"then at some point it becomes a supervisory matter\". In other words, the financial regulator could use its power to block appointments.</p><p>Rathi was probably issuing the mild threat in the expectation that it will not have to be executed. But, if he wants to make his mark, he should go for it. The City pays a lot of lip service to diversity, but actual action on appointments is notoriously slow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-64638549</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DM-FK51-JCJY-G39D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><timeReceived>8:08 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER,  MICROSOFT, IS INTERVIEWED ON BB TV</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> APRIL 17, 2018</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SPEAKERS: BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF  LEGAL OFFICER, MICROSOFT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> [*] EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Joining us now to discuss, Brad Smith,  Microsoft's President and Chief Legal Officer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Brad, first of all, you know, part of this pledge you're saying you won't  help governments protect or perpetrate cyberattacks.  You know, talk us  about why there is a need for such an accord.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER, MICROSOFT:  I think our  industry really needs to come together on a global basis to strengthen  cyber security.  We need to be principled as we do that.  And there's  fundamentally two principles that are part of this pledge.</p><p> The first is that we will step up our work to protect every customer  everywhere from the cyberattacks.  And the second is that we won't help  governments launched cyberattacks against innocent citizens or enterprises.   And we'll use those as two north stars and there are a number of concrete  steps we can and we'll take to make those affective.</p><p> CHANG:  So, our government is asking you for help for them --</p><p> SMITH:  Absolutely.</p><p> CHANGE:  -- to perpetrate cyberattacks.</p><p> SMITH:  First of all, we get most importantly requests from governments  every day to help defend against customers and we are doing more in that  space.  In the world today, I think if your principles are unclear, you do  run the risk that you'll be asked by governments to do things that you're  going to look back at in hindsight and regret having done.</p><p> And we've seen that over the last 15 or 20 years.  And I think by being  clear about what we will and will not do, we in effect give governments  guidance so they don't have to ask us.  They know where we stand.</p><p> CHANG:  So, you referred to this as the digital Geneva Convention, yet  Apple, Amazon, Twitter, Google, they're not signed up.  Why not?</p><p> SMITH:  Well, I think we're going to see more companies signing up in the  coming weeks and months.  A lot of people have been very focused on a wide  variety of privacy and security issues.  Recently, we have 34 major  companies with us today for this tech accord.</p><p> And then what we are also doing is calling on governments to sign up for a  digital Geneva Convention, in effect that new convention that would put new  rules of the road in place so that governments understand that they can't  attack civilians the way we're seeing in the world today.</p><p> CHANG:  Facebook has been in the spotlight for inadvertently allowing state  actors to meddle in elections, in U.S. elections.  Why should we think of  this as any more than an empty promise or a marketing ploy?</p><p> SMITH:  Well, first of all, I think that in the world today it is important  for companies to be principled.  You can't be principled unless you define  clearly and in a transparent way what you're going to do and what you're  going to standup for and we're doing that.  But I also believe that you are  making a fundamentally important point.</p><p> At the end of the day, people should not judge us by our words alone.  They  should judge us by our deeds.  This gives people a clear standard against  which they can judge us.  I think we should welcome that.  Now it's up to  us to prove every day that we can live up to this pledge.</p><p> CHANG:  Facebook also under fire for data privacy.  And I'm curious where  you think Facebook went wrong, and whether you think more regulation is  necessary in big tech, since that could ultimately impact Microsoft as  well.</p><p> SMITH:  Well, I think it's the broader question that is the most important.   It's the question for all of us.  We at Microsoft called for National  Comprehensive Privacy Legislation.  We did that in 2005, 13 years ago.   This whole privacy issue does not get better with age.</p><p> We do need to come together as a country in our view, and we will benefit  from having good laws in place.  We'll benefit because it will be a  consensus nationally about what companies should do, and we'll benefit  because that I believe can play an important role in sustaining the trust  and confidence of the public.</p><p> CHANG:  You've also announced a new defending democracy program to help  prevent campaigns from being hacked, to defend against disinformation,  misinformation.  Can you give us some specifics about how you intend to do  that?  Are you working with particular campaigns or particular states or  working to secure voting machines, for example, ahead of the midterm  elections?</p><p> SMITH:  The answer is basically going to be yes to all of that.  We have  identified four specific areas on which we want to focus with this new  defending democracy project.  The first is protecting candidates and  campaigns from hacking.  The second is protecting voters and voting from  tampering or hacking.  The third is really supporting measures to ensure  integrity in political advertising, including on social media platforms.   One of the things the Honest Ads Act will do.  And the last, there is  really -- in some ways the hardest, it is the job we all need to do to try  to address the willful disinformation campaigns we're seeing even from  foreign sources.</p><p> And so in some of these areas we have fast steps that we can take right  away in other areas.  I think we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but  we need to get started.</p><p> CHANG:  So also last quick question, you're announcing a new micro device  product, a teeny-tiny little IoT product that are secured end-to-end could  be an anything from toys to remote controls, works with AWS, works with  Google Cloud.  What are the dangers here that you're trying to protect  against?</p><p> SMITH:  Well, this I believe is a fundamentally important problem for the  country and the world because this year there will be a shift in the world,  9 billion of the small chips that are increasingly are going into toys,  refrigerators, thermostats, certainly in cars and alike, and they're all  going to be connected.  And if they're connected without being protected,  then we have a much bigger cybersecurity problem than we do today.</p><p> What we launched yesterday here in San Francisco is a new offering, we call  it Azure Sphere, and with a new and more powerful and more secure hardware  chip, and a new and more secure operating system, and a new security cloud  service.  We really for the first time --</p><p> CHANG:  OK.</p><p> SMITH:  -- have a holistic solution.</p><p> CHANG:  Microsoft President Brad Smith in San Francisco.  Brad as always,  thank you so much for stopping by.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER,  MICROSOFT, IS INTERVIEWED ON BB TV</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">APRIL 17, 2018</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF  LEGAL OFFICER, MICROSOFT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Joining us now to discuss, Brad Smith,  Microsoft's President and Chief Legal Officer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brad, first of all, you know, part of this pledge you're saying you won't  help governments protect or perpetrate cyberattacks.  You know, talk us  about why there is a need for such an accord.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER, MICROSOFT:  I think our  industry really needs to come together on a global basis to strengthen  cyber security.  We need to be principled as we do that.  And there's  fundamentally two principles that are part of this pledge.</p><p>The first is that we will step up our work to protect every customer  everywhere from the cyberattacks.  And the second is that we won't help  governments launched cyberattacks against innocent citizens or enterprises.   And we'll use those as two north stars and there are a number of concrete  steps we can and we'll take to make those affective.</p><p>CHANG:  So, our government is asking you for help for them --</p><p>SMITH:  Absolutely.</p><p>CHANGE:  -- to perpetrate cyberattacks.</p><p>SMITH:  First of all, we get most importantly requests from governments  every day to help defend against customers and we are doing more in that  space.  In the world today, I think if your principles are unclear, you do  run the risk that you'll be asked by governments to do things that you're  going to look back at in hindsight and regret having done.</p><p>And we've seen that over the last 15 or 20 years.  And I think by being  clear about what we will and will not do, we in effect give governments  guidance so they don't have to ask us.  They know where we stand.</p><p>CHANG:  So, you referred to this as the digital Geneva Convention, yet  Apple, Amazon, Twitter, Google, they're not signed up.  Why not?</p><p>SMITH:  Well, I think we're going to see more companies signing up in the  coming weeks and months.  A lot of people have been very focused on a wide  variety of privacy and security issues.  Recently, we have 34 major  companies with us today for this tech accord.</p><p>And then what we are also doing is calling on governments to sign up for a  digital Geneva Convention, in effect that new convention that would put new  rules of the road in place so that governments understand that they can't  attack civilians the way we're seeing in the world today.</p><p>CHANG:  Facebook has been in the spotlight for inadvertently allowing state  actors to meddle in elections, in U.S. elections.  Why should we think of  this as any more than an empty promise or a marketing ploy?</p><p>SMITH:  Well, first of all, I think that in the world today it is important  for companies to be principled.  You can't be principled unless you define  clearly and in a transparent way what you're going to do and what you're  going to standup for and we're doing that.  But I also believe that you are  making a fundamentally important point.</p><p>At the end of the day, people should not judge us by our words alone.  They  should judge us by our deeds.  This gives people a clear standard against  which they can judge us.  I think we should welcome that.  Now it's up to  us to prove every day that we can live up to this pledge.</p><p>CHANG:  Facebook also under fire for data privacy.  And I'm curious where  you think Facebook went wrong, and whether you think more regulation is  necessary in big tech, since that could ultimately impact Microsoft as  well.</p><p>SMITH:  Well, I think it's the broader question that is the most important.   It's the question for all of us.  We at Microsoft called for National  Comprehensive Privacy Legislation.  We did that in 2005, 13 years ago.   This whole privacy issue does not get better with age.</p><p>We do need to come together as a country in our view, and we will benefit  from having good laws in place.  We'll benefit because it will be a  consensus nationally about what companies should do, and we'll benefit  because that I believe can play an important role in sustaining the trust  and confidence of the public.</p><p>CHANG:  You've also announced a new defending democracy program to help  prevent campaigns from being hacked, to defend against disinformation,  misinformation.  Can you give us some specifics about how you intend to do  that?  Are you working with particular campaigns or particular states or  working to secure voting machines, for example, ahead of the midterm  elections?</p><p>SMITH:  The answer is basically going to be yes to all of that.  We have  identified four specific areas on which we want to focus with this new  defending democracy project.  The first is protecting candidates and  campaigns from hacking.  The second is protecting voters and voting from  tampering or hacking.  The third is really supporting measures to ensure  integrity in political advertising, including on social media platforms.   One of the things the Honest Ads Act will do.  And the last, there is  really -- in some ways the hardest, it is the job we all need to do to try  to address the willful disinformation campaigns we're seeing even from  foreign sources.</p><p>And so in some of these areas we have fast steps that we can take right  away in other areas.  I think we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but  we need to get started.</p><p>CHANG:  So also last quick question, you're announcing a new micro device  product, a teeny-tiny little IoT product that are secured end-to-end could  be an anything from toys to remote controls, works with AWS, works with  Google Cloud.  What are the dangers here that you're trying to protect  against?</p><p>SMITH:  Well, this I believe is a fundamentally important problem for the  country and the world because this year there will be a shift in the world,  9 billion of the small chips that are increasingly are going into toys,  refrigerators, thermostats, certainly in cars and alike, and they're all  going to be connected.  And if they're connected without being protected,  then we have a much bigger cybersecurity problem than we do today.</p><p>What we launched yesterday here in San Francisco is a new offering, we call  it Azure Sphere, and with a new and more powerful and more secure hardware  chip, and a new and more secure operating system, and a new security cloud  service.  We really for the first time --</p><p>CHANG:  OK.</p><p>SMITH:  -- have a holistic solution.</p><p>CHANG:  Microsoft President Brad Smith in San Francisco.  Brad as always,  thank you so much for stopping by.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

You know, talk us about why there is a need for such an accord.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRAD SMITH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER, MICROSOFT: I think our industry really needs to come together on a global basis to strengthen cyber security. We need to be principled as we do that. And there's fundamentally two principles that are part of this pledge.</p><p>The first is that we will step up our work to protect every customer everywhere from the cyberattacks. And the second is that we won't help governments launched cyberattacks against innocent citizens or enterprises. And we'll use those as two north stars and there are a number of concrete steps we can and we'll take to make those affective.</p><p>CHANG: So, our government is asking you for help for them --</p><p>SMITH: Absolutely.</p><p>CHANGE: -- to perpetrate cyberattacks.</p><p>SMITH: First of all, we get most importantly requests from governments every day to help defend against customers and we are doing more in that space. In the world today, I think if your principles are unclear, you do run the risk that you'll be asked by governments to do things that you're going to look back at in hindsight and regret having done.</p><p>And we've seen that over the last 15 or 20 years. And I think by being clear about what we will and will not do, we in effect give governments guidance so they don't have to ask us. They know where we stand.</p><p>CHANG: So, you referred to this as the digital Geneva Convention, yet Apple, Amazon, Twitter, Google, they're not signed up. Why not?</p><p>SMITH: Well, I think we're going to see more companies signing up in the coming weeks and months. A lot of people have been very focused on a wide variety of privacy and security issues. Recently, we have 34 major companies with us today for this tech accord.</p><p>And then what we are also doing is calling on governments to sign up for a digital Geneva Convention, in effect that new convention that would put new rules of the road in place so that governments understand that they can't attack civilians the way we're seeing in the world today.</p><p>CHANG: Facebook has been in the spotlight for inadvertently allowing state actors to meddle in elections, in U.S. elections. Why should we think of this as any more than an empty promise or a marketing ploy?</p><p>SMITH: Well, first of all, I think that in the world today it is important for companies to be principled. You can't be principled unless you define clearly and in a transparent way what you're going to do and what you're going to standup for and we're doing that. But I also believe that you are making a fundamentally important point.</p><p>At the end of the day, people should not judge us by our words alone. They should judge us by our deeds. This gives people a clear standard against which they can judge us. I think we should welcome that. Now it's up to us to prove every day that we can live up to this pledge.</p><p>CHANG: Facebook also under fire for data privacy. And I'm curious where you think Facebook went wrong, and whether you think more regulation is necessary in big tech, since that could ultimately impact Microsoft as well.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I think it's the broader question that is the most important. It's the question for all of us. We at Microsoft called for National Comprehensive Privacy Legislation. We did that in 2005, 13 years ago. This whole privacy issue does not get better with age.</p><p>We do need to come together as a country in our view, and we will benefit from having good laws in place. We'll benefit because it will be a consensus nationally about what companies should do, and we'll benefit because that I believe can play an important role in sustaining the trust and confidence of the public.</p><p>CHANG: You've also announced a new defending democracy program to help prevent campaigns from being hacked, to defend against disinformation, misinformation. Can you give us some specifics about how you intend to do that? Are you working with particular campaigns or particular states or working to secure voting machines, for example, ahead of the midterm elections?</p><p>SMITH: The answer is basically going to be yes to all of that. We have identified four specific areas on which we want to focus with this new defending democracy project. The first is protecting candidates and campaigns from hacking. The second is protecting voters and voting from tampering or hacking. The third is really supporting measures to ensure integrity in political advertising, including on social media platforms. One of the things the Honest Ads Act will do. And the last, there is really -- in some ways the hardest, it is the job we all need to do to try to address the willful disinformation campaigns we're seeing even from foreign sources.</p><p>And so in some of these areas we have fast steps that we can take right away in other areas. I think we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we need to get started.</p><p>CHANG: So also last quick question, you're announcing a new micro device product, a teeny-tiny little IoT product that are secured end-to-end could be an anything from toys to remote controls, works with AWS, works with Google Cloud. What are the dangers here that you're trying to protect against?</p><p>SMITH: Well, this I believe is a fundamentally important problem for the country and the world because this year there will be a shift in the world, 9 billion of the small chips that are increasingly are going into toys, refrigerators, thermostats, certainly in cars and alike, and they're all going to be connected. And if they're connected without being protected, then we have a much bigger cybersecurity problem than we do today.</p><p>What we launched yesterday here in San Francisco is a new offering, we call it Azure Sphere, and with a new and more powerful and more secure hardware chip, and a new and more secure operating system, and a new security cloud service. We really for the first time --</p><p>CHANG: OK.</p><p>SMITH: -- have a holistic solution.</p><p>CHANG: Microsoft President Brad Smith in San Francisco. Brad as always, thank you so much for stopping by.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

You know, talk us about why there is a need for such an accord.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  I think our industry really needs to come together on a global basis to strengthen cyber security. We need to be principled as we do that. And there's fundamentally two principles that are part of this pledge.  </p><p>      The first is that we will step up our work to protect every customer everywhere from the cyberattacks. And the second is that we won't help governments launched cyberattacks against innocent citizens or enterprises. And we'll use those as two north stars and there are a number of concrete steps we can and we'll take to make those affective.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So, our government is asking you for help for them --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANGE</emphasis>:  -- to perpetrate cyberattacks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  First of all, we get most importantly requests from governments every day to help defend against customers and we are doing more in that space. In the world today, I think if your principles are unclear, you do run the risk that you'll be asked by governments to do things that you're going to look back at in hindsight and regret having done.  </p><p>      And we've seen that over the last 15 or 20 years. And I think by being clear about what we will and will not do, we in effect give governments guidance so they don't have to ask us. They know where we stand.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So, you referred to this as the digital Geneva Convention, yet Apple, Amazon, Twitter, Google, they're not signed up. Why not?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Well, I think we're going to see more companies signing up in the coming weeks and months. A lot of people have been very focused on a wide variety of privacy and security issues. Recently, we have 34 major companies with us today for this tech accord.  </p><p>      And then what we are also doing is calling on governments to sign up for a digital Geneva Convention, in effect that new convention that would put new rules of the road in place so that governments understand that they can't attack civilians the way we're seeing in the world today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Facebook has been in the spotlight for inadvertently allowing state actors to meddle in elections, in U.S. elections. Why should we think of this as any more than an empty promise or a marketing ploy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, I think that in the world today it is important for companies to be principled. You can't be principled unless you define clearly and in a transparent way what you're going to do and what you're going to standup for and we're doing that. But I also believe that you are making a fundamentally important point.  </p><p>      At the end of the day, people should not judge us by our words alone. They should judge us by our deeds. This gives people a clear standard against which they can judge us. I think we should welcome that. Now it's up to us to prove every day that we can live up to this pledge.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Facebook also under fire for data privacy. And I'm curious where you think Facebook went wrong, and whether you think more regulation is necessary in big tech, since that could ultimately impact Microsoft as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Well, I think it's the broader question that is the most important. It's the question for all of us. We at Microsoft called for National Comprehensive Privacy Legislation. We did that in 2005, 13 years ago. This whole privacy issue does not get better with age.  </p><p>      We do need to come together as a country in our view, and we will benefit from having good laws in place. We'll benefit because it will be a consensus nationally about what companies should do, and we'll benefit because that I believe can play an important role in sustaining the trust and confidence of the public.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  You've also announced a new defending democracy program to help prevent campaigns from being hacked, to defend against disinformation, misinformation. Can you give us some specifics about how you intend to do that? Are you working with particular campaigns or particular states or working to secure voting machines, for example, ahead of the midterm elections?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  The answer is basically going to be yes to all of that. We have identified four specific areas on which we want to focus with this new defending democracy project. The first is protecting candidates and campaigns from hacking. The second is protecting voters and voting from tampering or hacking. The third is really supporting measures to ensure integrity in political advertising, including on social media platforms. One of the things the Honest Ads Act will do. And the last, there is really -- in some ways the hardest, it is the job we all need to do to try to address the willful disinformation campaigns we're seeing even from foreign sources.  </p><p>      And so in some of these areas we have fast steps that we can take right away in other areas. I think we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we need to get started.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So also last quick question, you're announcing a new micro device product, a teeny-tiny little IoT product that are secured end-to-end could be an anything from toys to remote controls, works with AWS, works with Google Cloud. What are the dangers here that you're trying to protect against?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Well, this I believe is a fundamentally important problem for the country and the world because this year there will be a shift in the world, 9 billion of the small chips that are increasingly are going into toys, refrigerators, thermostats, certainly in cars and alike, and they're all going to be connected. And if they're connected without being protected, then we have a much bigger cybersecurity problem than we do today.  </p><p>      What we launched yesterday here in San Francisco is a new offering, we call it Azure Sphere, and with a new and more powerful and more secure hardware chip, and a new and more secure operating system, and a new security cloud service. We really for the first time --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  -- have a holistic solution.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Microsoft President Brad Smith in San Francisco. Brad as always, thank you so much for stopping by.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S4K-H731-F15W-H4F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Look to the right, look to the left. Bad apple toss it away!\"</p><p>Gathered in front of her are students who are following her every move, picking up imaginary apples and throwing them over their shoulders.</p><p>Wong is leading one of her weekly sessions of Brain Beat Dance, a unique exercise technique aimed at stimulating the brain health of seniors.</p><p>While there are no lack of dance classes from salsa to line dancing aimed at the aging population, Wong's non-profit organization has filled an unusual niche in Toronto. It is a fusion of world music, dancing styles, conversation, story telling, and an explosion of Circus-like props that aim to get seniors moving. And thinking.</p><p>Wong, the president of the Canadian association, runs the non-profit from her condo. Over the last decade, the retired IT professional has grown the program to more than 20 instructors that deliver classes across the city to community centres and nursing homes.</p><p>Many of the techniques are tailored to physically challenged seniors. But the level of difficulty can be increased depending on the audience. Some classes are taught from a seated positions. Others are standing or a combination of both.</p><p>\"It really makes a difference in terms of feeling less isolated for many seniors,\" Wong says. \"Exercise is important, but you combine it with music and conversation and dancing and it becomes a really powerful therapy.\"</p><p>There has been much research on the benefits of exercise on brain activity. Less so on the connection between music and cognitive impairment.

Taking inspiration from classical dance and adding modern and cultural elements, she created BBD.</p><p>The first to implement the classes into their program was the Yee Hong Centre for Geriatric Care in Scarborough. The facility was the founding sponsor of the movement which has spread across the GTA.</p><p>\"We now know that physical and mental health are so much intertwined that today it seemed natural and unquestionable,\" said Dr. Joseph Wong, the founder of Yee Hong. \"Back 25 years ago, there was still quite a bit of doubt. Brain beat dance proves that it is beyond doubt (that) certain physical activities promote healing of degenerative tissues in the brain.\"</p><p>May Wong (no relation) says it all starts by telling a story - a narrative that people can respond to.</p><p>On this day, she is talking about the weather. She strikes one pose for lightning. Another for rain.</p><p>\"In life we have good times and bad times. It's not always smooth,\" she says. \"There might be bad and good weather but the sunshine will come through again.\" The class of 13 students applaud.</p><p>\"My mind during the day is always busy and I'm not focusing. But coming to this class makes a difference,\" says Mary Zakher, 64.</p><p>Zakher goes to the gym regularly, but says Brain Beat Dance has helped her co-ordination. Today she is following instructor Wong in an exercise of acupressure techniques that includes touching pressure points in the neck and face.</p><p>\"See, I'm giving you a facial and you don't have to pay for it,\" Wong chortles.</p><p>Later in the program, after simulating throwing lightning bolts in one of the more dynamic exercises, Zakher approaches a reporter. \"I forgot to tell you earlier how uplifting this is as well,\" she says, smiling.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

Continue reading Brain-computer interfaces are developing faster than the policy debate around them</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A few days ago, Facebook disentangled itself from a nettlesome investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into how the company violated users' privacy. And then, with that matter now squarely behind it, Facebook on Tuesday stepped forward to share some information about its effort to read our minds.</p><p>Two years after the company announced its mind-reading initiative, Facebook has an update to share. The company sponsored an experiment conducted by researchers at the University of CaliforniaSan Francisco in which they built an interface for decoding spoken dialogue from brain signals. The results were published today in Nature Communication.</p><p>The work itself is fascinating, as you might expect from the subject matter. Brain-computer interfaces aren't new, but the existing ones aren't particularly efficient   particularly the ones that don't involve drilling into your skill. Facebook's approach relies on high-density electrocorticography, aka ECoG, which implants sensors on the brain and uses them to record brain activity.</p><p>And its most recent research apparently showed promise, Adi Robertson reports:</p><p>If participants heard someone ask  Which musical instrument do you like listening to,  for example, they'd respond with one of several options like  violin  or  drums  while their brain activity was recorded. The system would guess when they were asking a question and when they were answering it, then guess the content of both speech events. The predictions were shaped by prior context   so once the system determined which question subjects were hearing, it would narrow the set of likely answers. The system could produce results with 61 to 76 percent accuracy, compared with the 7 to 20 percent accuracy expected by chance.</p><p> Here we show the value of decoding both sides of a conversation   both the questions someone hears and what they say in response,  said lead author and UCSF neurosurgery professor Edward Chang, in a statement. But Chang noted that this system only recognizes a very limited set of words so far; participants were only asked nine questions with 24 total answer options. The study's subjects   who were being prepped for epilepsy surgery   used highly invasive implants. And they were speaking answers aloud, not simply thinking them.</p><p>If successful, the work will have important clinical applications   it could help patients to communicate who have lost the ability to speak, for example. Facebook hopes the technology has a broader use   enabling what former Facebook crazy-project chief Regina Dugan once called a  brain click.  Allow people to click through dialog boxes with their minds, she told us in 2017, and you create lots of interesting new possibilities for augmented and virtual reality.</p><p>That goal remains very far away. But that seems like a good time to ask whether any of this work should, you know, be done in the first place. Antonio Regalado's piece on the Facebook experiment gets at why:</p><p> To me the brain is the one safe place for freedom of thought, of fantasies, and for dissent,  says Nita Farahany, a professor at Duke University who specializes in neuro-ethics.  We're getting close to crossing the final frontier of privacy in the absence of any protections whatsoever. </p><p>Facebook, for its part, included a section on ethics in its blog post on the subject, quoting Mark Chevillet, director of the brain-computer interface (BCI) research program at Facebook Reality Labs:</p><p> We can't anticipate or solve all of the ethical issues associated with this technology on our own,  Chevillet says.  What we can do is recognize when the technology has advanced beyond what people know is possible, and make sure that information is delivered back to the community. Neuroethical design is one of our program's key pillars   we want to be transparent about what we're working on so that people can tell us their concerns about this technology. </p><p>It has also pledged to have its research governed by an ethics board.</p><p>Of course, at this point, even invasive technology can barely distinguish between a speaker saying  fertilizer  versus one saying  synthesizer.  But it's in the nature of these technologies to improve exponentially, often away from public view, and to mature before any real public conversation about them can take place.</p><p>And so it's worth noting that Facebook hasn't ruled out using brain activity for advertising purposes at some point in the future. In some ways, it feels like the logical conclusion of an advertising monolith. Its whole business is predicated on reading your mind however it can, whether by getting you to share all of your demographic data in a profile or by reading your brainwaves through a cap on your skull. In some ways, it would be weirder if Facebook didn't seek to use your brain activity for advertising purposes.</p><p>Brain-computer interfaces would seem to have a lot of promise for medical uses   something that Elon Musk, who is also exploring the technology through his company Neuralink, is currently focused on. But they would also seem to carry with them a great risk of anti-democratic surveillance.</p><p>A futuristic headset that reads our minds to let us click through dialog prompts is all well and good. But I worry about how it might be used should the technology get much better than that. And that's probably a conversation we want to start before Facebook and other companies make too much progress.</p><p>Democracy</p><p>New bill would ban autoplay videos and endless scrolling</p><p>Here's a fascinating if likely doomed bill from Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) that would ban many popular growth hacks and engagement mechanics. From Makena Kelly:</p><p>Hawley's Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act, or the SMART Act, would ban these features that work to keep users on platforms longer, along with others, like Snapstreaks, that incentivize the continued use of these products. If approved, the Federal Trade Commission and Health and Human Services could create similar rules that would expire after three years unless Congress codified them into law.</p><p> Big tech has embraced a business model of addiction,  Hawley said.  Too much of the  innovation' in this space is designed not to create better products, but to capture more attention by using psychological tricks that make it difficult to look away. </p><p>TikTok is exhibit A in Facebook's  we're no monopoly  case</p><p>TikTok's momentary success has offered Facebook a fig leaf of evidence that Facebook is not a monopoly, David McCabe reports. Counterpoint: do you knowhow many Facebook ads TikTok had to buy to get this far?</p><p>People familiar with Facebook's thinking on competition issues said Facebook views TikTok's rapid growth as one key example in its broader antitrust defense.</p><p>The company particularly sees it as evidence that Facebook's reach has not limited the barriers to entry for new startup social products, one of the people said.</p><p>Canada's New Partisan Media Are Poised To Ride A Facebook Wave To Election Day</p><p>A big team from BuzzFeed chronicled the rise of hyper-partisan media in Canada on Facebook:</p><p>North99 is part of a new wave of advocacy media   both on the left and right   that is reaching more Canadians than ever before, thanks to savvy approaches to Facebook. These pages and associated websites are generating millions of shares, reactions, and comments, and at times eclipsing the country's biggest newspapers and broadcasters on the platform, according to a new analysis by BuzzFeed News and the Toronto Star.</p><p>But the lines between traditional news reporting   with clear editorial standards and accountability   and these new media players can be difficult to discern, especially when you're distractedly scrolling through your newsfeed, according to experts.</p><p>Here's where Facebook's record $5 billion fine goes</p><p>Turns out it just goes into the U.S. Treasury! Which sounds like it could be cool until you remember that the national debt is $22 trillion.</p><p>Trump's Baltimore Tweets Don't Violate Company's New Rules</p><p>An emerging genre of story is  Twitter does nothing about the president's tweet.  Most recently, Twitter did nothing about some tweets involving a black member of Congress and his district.</p><p>China's Beijing Kunlun to revisit Grindr IPO</p><p>In March, the US government took action suggesting that it considered gay hookup app Grindr a national security issue. But in a surprise twist, it reversed course this week, report Meg Shen and Echo Wang:</p><p>Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd said on Monday it would revive plans for an initial public offering (IPO) of popular gay dating app Grindr Inc, after a U.S. national security panel dropped its opposition to the plan.</p><p>Kunlun said in May it had agreed to a request by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to sell Grindr, setting a June 2020 deadline to do so and putting preparations for an IPO of Grindr on hold.</p><p>Elsewhere</p><p>Gilroy gunman promoted white supremacist treatise on Instagram</p><p>Ugh:</p><p>Shortly before Sunday's mass shooting in Gilroy, the 19-year-old who committed the crime used his Instagram account to promote a book widely considered a manifesto of white supremacy, offering insight into the still-unknown motivation of the gunman. [...]</p><p>In an Instagram post written about an hour before the rampage, [the gunman] encouraged people to read  Might Is Right or the Survival of the Fittest.  The fringe book, originally published in 1890 and since re-released by a handful of small publishing houses, is a call to action against the alleged tyrannies of government and organized religion. The 96-page work encourages the  strong  to rise up over the  weak. </p><p>Apple joins Google, Facebook, and Twitter in data-sharing project</p><p>Russell Brandom reports on a rare positive, pro-competition data sharing initiative between tech giants and their much smaller competitors:</p><p>Just over a year after its official launch, the Data Transfer Project is announcing a new set of partners and features. Today, Apple announced that it will be joining the project, developing interoperable systems to bring data in and out of iCloud. A number of alternative social networks have also joined the project, with Tim Berners-Lee's Solid project enabling the import and export of contacts, and Mastodon allowing for the import and export of posts.</p><p>An open-source project aimed at making it easier to transfer data from one service to another, the Data Transfer Project has mostly consisted of back-end coding to make data export tools like Google Takeout and Facebook's Access Your Information tool compatible with each other. Right now, those tools let you download data directly to your hard drive, but the hope is that the project's code could allow the data to be ported directly to another service. That would allow you to send all of your Facebook photos to a Google Photos account, for instance, with no intermediate step and a lesser possibility of leaked data.</p><p>Facebook design flaw let thousands of kids join chats with unauthorized users</p><p>As someone who has found Messenger Kids icky from the start, I read this one with an extremely smug expression:</p><p>Facebook's Messenger Kids app is built around a simple premise: children shouldn't be able to talk to users who haven't been approved by their parents. But a design flaw allowed users to sidestep that protection through the group chat system, allowing children to enter group chats with unapproved strangers.</p><p>For the past week, Facebook has been quietly closing down those group chats and alerting users, but has not made any public statements disclosing the issue.</p><p>Facebook Watch Draws More Advertisers</p><p>Sahil Patel finds signs of life on Facebook's video platform:</p><p>Advertisers have warmed up to Watch somewhat as time has passed, buyers said.</p><p>One senior media buyer, who oversees more than $350 million in marketer ad spending each year, said he plans to spend at least $1 million this year on ads inside Watch. That's not an enormous sum, but he didn't advertise on Watch at all last year. It will be part of a bigger deal the buyer has signed with Facebook to spend more than $10 million on Facebook video ads in 2019, up 50%, the buyer said.</p><p>Twitter Adds 5 Million Users; Sales Top Estimates</p><p>It was very odd on vacation to learn that Twitter is doing ... reasonably well? Like, as a company?</p><p>Second-quarter revenue came in at $841 million, up 18% from the same quarter last year and higher than the $829 million analysts estimated. The company added 5 million daily users in the period, bringing the total to 139 million. That was the biggest year-over-year increase since the summer of 2017.</p><p>Net income, excluding certain items, was $37 million, or 5 cents a share. That compares with $58 million, or 8 cents a share, a year earlier, Twitter said.</p><p>The YouTubers Union Is Not Messing Around</p><p>An organized labor movement for YouTubers is stirring in Europe, reports Edward Ongweso Jr.:</p><p>The YouTubers Union, a community-based movement fighting for the rights of content creators and users, has joined forces with IG Metall, Germany's largest union and Europe's largest trade union. Together, they have launched a joint venture called FairTube and sent a letter of demands to YouTube accompanied by a video explaining their concerns, demands, and plan of action.</p><p>The move is one of the most significant organized labor actions taken by creators on the platform, and puts some actual union power behind what has thus far been a nascent and disorganized movement.</p><p>Bollywood Rapper Sets Viewer Record YouTube Isn't Talking About</p><p>Lucas Shaw explains how moneyed YouTubers are gaming platform metrics by buying ads:</p><p>When releasing a new single, major record labels will buy an advertisement on YouTube that places their music video in between other clips. If viewers watch the ad for more than few seconds, YouTube counts that as a view, boosting the overall total. Blackpink and Swift, among others, have done it. Badshah just took it a step further, people familiar with the matter say.</p><p>The practice creates doubts about the real popularity of these clips and reveals some of the murky ways in which artists and their labels promote their music especially in emerging markets. YouTube, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.'s Google, is now reevaluating the way it judges records, according to two people familiar with the company's thinking.</p><p>Now Even Funerals Are Livestreamed and Families Are Grateful</p><p>Here's a story from Paris Martineau about a phenomenon that seems inevitable, useful, and a little sad:</p><p>In a culture obsessed with tweeting and Instagramming every moment of life, it's little surprise that streaming extends to death. Funeral livestreaming services have been around for more than a decade, but the practice has recently exploded in popularity, says Bryant Hightower, president-elect of the National Funeral Directors Association. He estimates that nearly 20 percent of US funeral homes now offer the service a big number in an industry resistant to change in response to demand from clients. Tech-savvy entrepreneurs offer livestreaming as a service to hesitant funeral directors.</p><p>Snapchat rolls out first major global ad campaign on back of surging user growth</p><p>Snap has a new ad campaign dedicated to celebrating  real friends,  as opposed to whoever follows you on Instagram.

If you're feeling sad or stressed, here are some resources that may help improve your mood,  it says, above a disclaimer that notes Pinterest's exercises are not a replacement for professional care. You can click into the box to see more, or scroll down to just look at the pins.</p><p>Takes</p><p>Facebook Gets a New Committee</p><p>I enjoyed Matt Levine's take on whether Facebook's new privacy oversight committee will be independent in practice given Mark Zuckerberg's controlling share of the stock:</p><p>Again I think Chopra is probably right that, practically speaking, there are serious limits on how aggressive and effective the committee can be in protecting user privacy. And as I suggested yesterday, if you think that Facebook and other big internet companies are systemically important institutions that should have formal responsibilities to the public as well as to shareholders, the way to do that is probably through carefully considered general legislation rather than through a negotiated settlement that binds only Facebook. But for the FTC to take some of Facebook's governance out of shareholders' (Zuckerberg's) hands, even in a limited and symbolic way, suggests that the FTC does think that, and that Facebook concedes that it's true. If you think that Facebook is too big to fail and needs to be regulated as a public utility, well, you won't be happy with this settlement really, but it is a very teeny first step in that direction.</p><p>And finally  </p><p>Do click through to check out the visual metaphor here, in which cotton candy dissolves immediately upon hitting the water.

Fifty-five percent of Americans report feeling worse about data breaches in the last 12 months, and 49% say they feel worse about the privacy of their personal data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 2019 Social Permission and Technology study, conducted by global communications consultancyKetchum, found that nearly half of consumers are skeptical when brands say they keep consumer data safe - 48% reported they don't believe companies when they say their data is protected, and 49% don't believe companies when they declare data breach issues are resolved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The study points to both reputational and business risk for brands whose business models depend on consumer data. Nearly 9 in 10 consumers (89%) believe that there needs to be more legislation around data privacy, and that companies should be fined for data breaches. A majority (59%), also report that large tech companies should be broken up.\u00a0</p><p>Further, with 4 in 10 consumers (41%) disagreeing that laws are capable of keeping up with technological advancements, people are taking matters into their own hands. Sixty percent have deleted an app from their phone in the last twelve months, 47% have created more complex passwords, 40% have turned off location tracking, and 34% report using social media accounts less frequently.</p><p>This distrust by consumers is seemingly being ignored by brands at possible huge reputational risk. When it comes to protecting consumers' data, 74% of survey respondents said companies haven't improved or have gotten worse in the last year.</p><p>\"We found two particularly fascinating takeaways in this year's study,\" says Melissa Kinch, managing director of Technology at Ketchum. \"First, the same proportion of people - 66% - are worried about data privacy as are concerned about data security. This is a wake-up call for many brands who believe that cyber security is their biggest reputational risk when it comes to data and are in danger of leaving themselves vulnerable when it comes to privacy policies. Second, people don't trust brands when they say their data is safe, suggesting there has already been a significant erosion of trust as a result of high-profile privacy lapses.\"</p><p>Tech companies lag behind</p><p>Consumers are most trusting of companies within industries that have historically had access to sensitive personal data. One-third of consumers (33%) said they trust healthcare providers more than any other type of company with their personal information, followed closely by banks (32%). Other industries that have earned consumer trust include health insurance (27%), property and life insurance (17%), and security companies (14%).</p><p>In contrast, consumers are more wary of \"big tech\" companies and startups. Only 7% of consumers say they are most trusting of social media apps, and 6% most trust wellness, fitness and smart home apps and devices. A mere 4% are most trusting of search browsers, and 3 percent most trust telecom companies or app-based transportation providers.</p><p>Perhaps most telling is the 25% of consumers who say they don't trust any industry with their personal data, demonstrating that for a quarter of the population, the damage has already been done.</p><p>'Techruptors' call for more oversight and legislation</p><p>The 2018 Social Permission and Technology study revealed the emergence of a group of consumers who are most likely to bring disruption to the technology industry. These \"Techruptors\" tend to be young digital natives who both understand technology and use more tech products and services than the general population - including ride sharing, entertainment streaming, wearable technology and virtual assistants.</p><p>The 2019 study found that like the majority of Americans, Techruptors also have growing concerns related to their online privacy and are in favor of legislation that regulates companies' use of their personal data. Compared to 12 months ago, half of Techruptors feel worse about data privacy (50%), data breaches (50%) and location tracking without their knowledge (49%).</p><p>That increasing concern about companies' ability to self-police may be the reason that 87% of Techruptors agree that there should be more legislation around data privacy and 83% believe in more government regulation on data.</p><p>\"Techruptors are a powerful group of consumers that truly understand the technology landscape and are passionate advocates for the safety of their personal information. They are taking action to ensure their own data security, they are influencing others to do the same, and they are at the forefront of calls for government to step in and regulate,\" says Lisa Sullivan, director of Technology at Ketchum. \"Brands would be wise to take note: these Techruptors are often not only their earliest adopters and most outspoken consumers, but also share many characteristics with the employees within their own walls. Listening to, understanding, and engaging with this vital and vocal audience has the potential to insulate brands from both external and internal reputational threats.\"</p><p>Through its suite of products and services, Ketchum offers expert counsel on how to identify and manage reputation and communication issues related to data privacy, cybersecurity and related topics.

When necessary, the data was weighted to be nationally representative of the U.S. population as it relates to age, gender, region, race/ethnicity, education and income. The margin of error for the total sample is +/-3.1 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level. Smaller subgroups will have larger error margins.</p><p>About KetchumKetchum is a leading global communications consultancy with operations in more than 70 countries across six continents.PRWeek's Best Agency of the Past 20 Years, Ketchum is the winner of 105 Cannes Lions and an unprecedented six\u00a0PRWeek\u00a0Campaign of the Year Awards.

Now, a reality check seems to be setting in as they face increased consumer and regulatory scrutiny.Facebookcontinues to be under fire for lack of transparency in how it shares customer data.Amazonis taking hits for 'unethical and illegal' workplace conditions in the Chinese factories that produce its Echo and Kindle devices. It's gotten to the point where Hollywood is turning out features in which Silicon Valley figures areportrayed[2]as supervillains. Now, Googlehas been called to account, and from a new direction: by its own employees.At last week's shareholder meeting, Alphabet (Google) employeespartnered[3]with investors to push a proposal to link executive pay to metrics of diversity and inclusion 'to incentivize progress.' </p><p>The proposal, put forth byZevin Asset Managementalong with some current employees, was voted down (as were all other shareholder proposals). But for a company with the motto of 'Do the right thing' and one that is consistently rated a top place to work, the raising of concernsfrom withinabout its culture and leadership must be troubling. Google executives have underlined their commitment to diversity.\"We have a stated objective in the company to have representation of blacks and Hispanics in the US and an improvement of representation of women reach market supply by 2020,\" saidEileen Naughton, Google's VP of People Operations.The company has also affirmed its commitment to considering minority candidates for every new board position.(Facebook and Amazon have recently made similar public commitments.) Nine of Alphabet's 11 board members are men. Google's most recent diversity report showed the tech giant employs a majority of white men, with 69% of its workforce being male and 56% of its workforce being white.Read More &gt;[4] NEWS YOU CAN USE The Learning Curve of Taking Stands As more brands take positions on social issues, missteps are inevitable.Businesses are navigating a radically changed commercial-cultural landscape that lacks a lengthy history of what makes for positive impact\u2014the guidelines are still being worked out. Last week, the British-based personal care companyLush, known for its strong messaging on social issues,cancelled[5]a just-launched campaign attacking politically motivated UK police undercover operations. One of the campaign's slogans was, 'Spied on for taking a stand.'Blowback from police and public officials was immediate. It was pointed out that the practice had ceased in 2008, that a public apology was issued in 2015, and that the Lush campaigncame across[6]as critical of the entire British police force.Supporters argued that Lush has always taken stands on a variety of socio-political issues.'This is a core part of what Lush stands for,'Damien Mulleyof Mulley Communicationstold[7]AdWeek. 'Have you never looked at their window displays and the campaigns they highlight? Enviro, anti-nuke, immigration, disability, women's rights. Plus, the spycops have been operating in the UK and Ireland, infiltrating the groups that they support.' Lush said it had not intended to criticize all police, and had suspended the campaign 'for the safety of its staff.' The Lush stumble joins a case study collection of misfires that includesStarbucks' 'Race Together' slogan written on cups by baristas,Dove'sracially confused body wash ad, andPepsi'scommercial that used imagery from the Black Lives Matter movement. 'If it doesn't resonate, you put yourself at risk,' saidJulio Hernandez,the global head of customer advisory at KPMG,told[8]theNY Times. In taking stands on issues,companies must share best practicesand review examples\u2014both successful and misguided\u2014to develop the relevant strategic insights on which to base successful campaigns. 'America First' Targeted in Investment Fund Ad Campaign Global asset managerOppenheimerFundshas launched a new digital ad campaign that riffs on the 'America First' slogan of the current administration. 'Challenge Borders' promotes the company's global investment products. It's aimed at financial advisors, broker dealers and high-net-worth and institutional clients, and links to a website with stories and facts that support global investment,according[9]to theWSJ. Ads from financial services brands, whether they're commercial banks or asset managers, typically aren't provocative,Louis Sciullo, an executive director atLandor, a branding agency owned byWPP, told theJournal. 'It would be a stand you want to take with a lot of facts behind you.'Of course,the bottom line figures in the firm's decision:Oppenheimer manages over $140 billion in assets for mutual funds that have global mandates versus $79 billion in funds focused on US stocks and bonds. Youthful C-suites are Re-shaping the Biotech Industry The burgeoning field of biotech has a problem:technological innovation is running ahead of the ability to find and fund management teams. The exponential growth in new biotech businesses is 'forcing company funders to look beyond 'pale, male and stale' executive teams whileopening more opportunities for young, female and first-time CEOs,'reports[10]theSan Francisco Business Times. The traditional practice of bets placed on experienced management teams is giving way as investors realize they might miss out on the emerging companies created\u2014and managed\u2014by youthful entrepreneurs.One 'bridge' solution has emerged: theCalifornia Life Sciences Institutehas developed a program\u2014FAST, for Fellows All-Star Team\u2014which pairs experienced executives as advisors to biotech start up innovators who lack management history. The goal: to help new business leadership to develop as quickly as new biotech products are being developed. C-SUITECOMMENTS 'When I came to this country, I had a strong desire to be successful in the business world. I also instinctively understood how important it was to advocate for women's equality, in business and otherwise. I began my career at the Women's Environment ...velopment Organization, which only reinforced that drive to make sure women were able to have successful and equitable careers. As I moved into the finance world, which is historically a male-driven industry, it became very apparent that there was a gap in women leadership in many of these companies. I've had experience with many leadership style over the years, and one of the more important things I've learned is that women don't need to take on a male persona to be a successful leader. Being authentic and focusing on your strengths is key to being a good leader. I've also had the benefit of having amazing mentors, both male and female, over the years, who've taught me how\u2014and how not\u2014to lead effectively.' \u2014Riham El-Lakany, VP and Chief Marketing Officer, Single-Family Division,Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) Excerpted fromMReport Magazine[11] PEOPLE ON THEMOVE Patricia Stitzelhas been named byTupperware Brandsas its first femalePresident and CEO.
