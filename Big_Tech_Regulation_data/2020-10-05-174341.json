Europe is particularly sensitive to privacy issues because spying by the Nazi-era Gestapo and the secret services in the Soviet Union is still within living memory.</p><p>Andreas Wiebe, founder of Swiss privacy-focused search engine Swisscows.</p><p>\"For us, it's all about citizens and citizens have the right to privacy,\" said Eric Leandri, chairman of Paris-based Qwant. He said that view contrasts with the mindset across the Atlantic, where internet users are seen as consumers whose rights are dictated by the terms of their agreements with tech companies.</p><p>Traffic numbers show interest is rising. Qwant handled nearly 10 billion queries in 2017, more than triple the previous year. On a monthly basis, it's getting 80 million visits while requests are growing 20 per cent. Leandri says the site now accounts for 6 per cent of search engine market share in France, its biggest market.</p><p>Qwant is even getting official support. Last month the French army and parliament both said they would drop Googleand use Qwant as their default search engine, as part of efforts to reclaim European \"digital sovereignty.\"</p><p>The site doesn't use tracking cookies or profile users, allowing it to give two different users the exact same result. It has built its own index of 20 billion pages covering French, German and Italian. It plans to expand the index to about two dozen other languages, for which it currently relies on results from Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>Mojeek, based in Brighton, England, operates on similar principles and has so far cataloged 2 billion webpages. The company says it gets 200,000 unique visitors a month and search queries have quintupled over the past year.</p><p>Germany's Unbubble is a \"meta-search\" engine, sending encrypted queries to more than 30 other search engines and hiding its users' locations. It promises neutral search results rather than ones filtered by an algorithm catering to personal biases.</p><p>To be sure, Google's in no danger of toppling. The company based in Mountain View, California, accounts for three-quarters or more of global market share, depending on whom you ask, and rules the mobile market with its Android operating system.</p><p>Some privacy search operators say an equally big motivation behind these startups is to avoid \"filter bubbles,\" in which internet content is pre-selected for users by the likes of Googleand Facebook based on previous searches and other data.</p><p>\"The main idea is to provide neutral information and allow people to depend less on machine learning-based filters,\" said Unbubble founder Tobias Sasse. \"If you are using Googletoday, perhaps you'll notice that there is always the same mainstream information,\" preventing people from seeing the \"great diversity\" online, he said.</p><p>Netherlands-based Startpage anonymizes Googlesearch results, stripping out ads and tracking. Another British startup, Oscobo, does anonymous searches for U.K. users, with results licensed from Yahoo/Bing. Outside Europe, there's also U.S. site DuckDuckGo.</p><p>Some of these sites rely financially on donations, others from \"affiliate advertising\" - links from Amazon, eBay or other shopping sites that pay a commission but don't target or track users. That's different from Google's behavioural, or targeted, ads that come up based on your search history, which many find creepy and invasive.</p><p>Mojeek has private investors. Founder Marc Smith, who began in 2004 with two servers in his bedroom, is \"very much anti-advertising,\" said Finn Brownbill, Mojeek's head of marketing. \"It's a necessary evil and we'll look for whatever route we can to avoid it.\"</p><p>In Switzerland, a country whose banking sector became a byword for secrecy, Swisscows has grown rapidly, handling 20 million search queries a month, up from 14 million a year ago, said founder Andreas Wiebe.</p><p>Even so, Wiebe said there was plenty of skepticism when he started the site. \"In 2014, I had people talking to me (saying) 'you're crazy',\" and that the project would be dead within a year. Instead, National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations of U.S. government surveillance the following year gave it a kickstart.</p><p>Swisscows has built its own German-language web index. For other languages, it uses Bing but queries and results are run through a firewall that strips out personal identifiers such as IP addresses.</p><p>Along with a conventional list of results, Swisscows also has a nifty grid of keyword tiles to narrow down search results by context.</p><p>The site's servers are buried in former military bunkers deep inside the Swiss Alps. Funding comes from donations and Wiebe's software company Hulbee. He plans next year to launch a secure messaging app, Teleguard, with a paid business version he hopes will help fund the site.</p><p>The Associated Press !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

Leandri says the site now accounts for 6 per cent of search engine market share in France, its biggest market.</p><p>Qwant is even getting official support. Last month the French army and parliament both said they would drop Google and use Qwant as their default search engine, as part of efforts to reclaim European \"digital sovereignty.\"</p><p>The site doesn't use tracking cookies or profile users, allowing it to give two different users the exact same result. It has built its own index of 20 billion pages covering French, German and Italian. It plans to expand the index to about two dozen other languages, for which it currently relies on results from Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>Mojeek, based in Brighton, England, operates on similar principles and has so far cataloged 2 billion webpages. The company says it gets 200,000 unique visitors a month and search queries have quintupled over the past year.</p><p>Germany's Unbubble is a \"meta-search\" engine, sending encrypted queries to more than 30 other search engines and hiding its users' locations. It promises neutral search results rather than ones filtered by an algorithm catering to personal biases.</p><p>To be sure, Google's in no danger of toppling. The company based in Mountain View, California, accounts for three-quarters or more of global market share, depending on whom you ask, and rules the mobile market with its Android operating system.</p><p>Some privacy search operators say an equally big motivation behind these startups is to avoid \"filter bubbles,\" in which internet content is pre-selected for users by the likes of Google and Facebook based on previous searches and other data.</p><p>\"The main idea is to provide neutral information and allow people to depend less on machine learning-based filters,\" said Unbubble founder Tobias Sasse. \"If you are using Google today, perhaps you'll notice that there is always the same mainstream information,\" preventing people from seeing the \"great diversity\" online, he said.</p><p>Netherlands-based Startpage anonymizes Google search results, stripping out ads and tracking. Another British startup, Oscobo, does anonymous searches for U.K. users, with results licensed from Yahoo/Bing. Outside Europe, there's also U.S. site DuckDuckGo.</p><p>Some of these sites rely financially on donations, others from \"affiliate advertising\" - links from Amazon, eBay or other shopping sites that pay a commission but don't target or track users. That's different from Google's behavioural, or targeted, ads that come up based on your search history, which many find creepy and invasive.</p><p>Mojeek has private investors. Founder Marc Smith, who began in 2004 with two servers in his bedroom, is \"very much anti-advertising,\" said Finn Brownbill, Mojeek's head of marketing. \"It's a necessary evil and we'll look for whatever route we can to avoid it.\"</p><p>In Switzerland, a country whose banking sector became a byword for secrecy, Swisscows has grown rapidly, handling 20 million search queries a month, up from 14 million a year ago, said founder Andreas Wiebe.</p><p>Even so, Wiebe said there was plenty of skepticism when he started the site. \"In 2014, I had people talking to me (saying) 'you're crazy',\" and that the project would be dead within a year. Instead, National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations of U.S. government surveillance the following year gave it a kickstart.</p><p>Swisscows has built its own German-language web index. For other languages, it uses Bing but queries and results are run through a firewall that strips out personal identifiers such as IP addresses.</p><p>Along with a conventional list of results, Swisscows also has a nifty grid of keyword tiles to narrow down search results by context.</p><p>The site's servers are buried in former military bunkers deep inside the Swiss Alps. Funding comes from donations and Wiebe's software company Hulbee. He plans next year to launch a secure messaging app, Teleguard, with a paid business version he hopes will help fund the site.</p><p>The Associated Press !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

Europe is particularly sensitive to privacy issues because spying by the Nazi-era Gestapo and the secret services in the Soviet Union is still within living memory.</p><p>Andreas Wiebe, founder of Swiss privacy-focused search engine Swisscows.</p><p>\"For us, it's all about citizens and citizens have the right to privacy,\" said Eric Leandri, chairman of Paris-based Qwant. He said that view contrasts with the mindset across the Atlantic, where internet users are seen as consumers whose rights are dictated by the terms of their agreements with tech companies.</p><p>Traffic numbers show interest is rising. Qwant handled nearly 10 billion queries in 2017, more than triple the previous year. On a monthly basis, it's getting 80 million visits while requests are growing 20 per cent. Leandri says the site now accounts for 6 per cent of search engine market share in France, its biggest market.</p><p>Qwant is even getting official support. Last month the French army and parliament both said they would drop Googleand use Qwant as their default search engine, as part of efforts to reclaim European \"digital sovereignty.\"</p><p>The site doesn't use tracking cookies or profile users, allowing it to give two different users the exact same result. It has built its own index of 20 billion pages covering French, German and Italian. It plans to expand the index to about two dozen other languages, for which it currently relies on results from Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>Mojeek, based in Brighton, England, operates on similar principles and has so far cataloged 2 billion webpages. The company says it gets 200,000 unique visitors a month and search queries have quintupled over the past year.</p><p>Germany's Unbubble is a \"meta-search\" engine, sending encrypted queries to more than 30 other search engines and hiding its users' locations. It promises neutral search results rather than ones filtered by an algorithm catering to personal biases.</p><p>To be sure, Google's in no danger of toppling. The company based in Mountain View, California, accounts for three-quarters or more of global market share, depending on whom you ask, and rules the mobile market with its Android operating system.</p><p>Some privacy search operators say an equally big motivation behind these startups is to avoid \"filter bubbles,\" in which internet content is pre-selected for users by the likes of Googleand Facebook based on previous searches and other data.</p><p>\"The main idea is to provide neutral information and allow people to depend less on machine learning-based filters,\" said Unbubble founder Tobias Sasse. \"If you are using Googletoday, perhaps you'll notice that there is always the same mainstream information,\" preventing people from seeing the \"great diversity\" online, he said.</p><p>Netherlands-based Startpage anonymizes Googlesearch results, stripping out ads and tracking. Another British startup, Oscobo, does anonymous searches for U.K. users, with results licensed from Yahoo/Bing. Outside Europe, there's also U.S. site DuckDuckGo.</p><p>Some of these sites rely financially on donations, others from \"affiliate advertising\" - links from Amazon, eBay or other shopping sites that pay a commission but don't target or track users. That's different from Google's behavioural, or targeted, ads that come up based on your search history, which many find creepy and invasive.</p><p>Mojeek has private investors. Founder Marc Smith, who began in 2004 with two servers in his bedroom, is \"very much anti-advertising,\" said Finn Brownbill, Mojeek's head of marketing. \"It's a necessary evil and we'll look for whatever route we can to avoid it.\"</p><p>In Switzerland, a country whose banking sector became a byword for secrecy, Swisscows has grown rapidly, handling 20 million search queries a month, up from 14 million a year ago, said founder Andreas Wiebe.</p><p>Even so, Wiebe said there was plenty of skepticism when he started the site. \"In 2014, I had people talking to me (saying) 'you're crazy',\" and that the project would be dead within a year. Instead, National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations of U.S. government surveillance the following year gave it a kickstart.</p><p>Swisscows has built its own German-language web index. For other languages, it uses Bing but queries and results are run through a firewall that strips out personal identifiers such as IP addresses.</p><p>Along with a conventional list of results, Swisscows also has a nifty grid of keyword tiles to narrow down search results by context.</p><p>The site's servers are buried in former military bunkers deep inside the Swiss Alps. Funding comes from donations and Wiebe's software company Hulbee. He plans next year to launch a secure messaging app, Teleguard, with a paid business version he hopes will help fund the site.</p><p>The Associated Press !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

Patrick Sarch, Partner, London, Co-head of Financial Institutions Global Industry Group OverviewThree key drivers for bank M#38;A:Consolidation across Europe: Gaining scale and scope to survive Skill of the trapeze: Active balance sheet management remains critical Digital transformation: Banks attempt the trifecta in the fintech race CURRENT MARKETUpward, significantWE ARE SEEING Continuing focus on intra-group corporate restructurings, primarily aimed at: Implementing \"hard\" Brexit contingency plans, including through subsidiarisation and re-architecture of balance sheets Achieving operational efficiency and simpler business models, without the financial burden of overlapping back-office functionsBalance sheet management by both non-state-aided and state-aided banks: Continuing non-core disposal programmes Rationalisation of loan portfolios through NPL disposals and outsourcing of debt-servicing functionsHigh levels of bank consolidation activity: Mainly domestic and regional consolidation Activity across established as well as \"challenger\" lenders Geographic hotspots include the Balkans, CEE, the Nordics, the Mediterranean, Germany and ItalyHeavy outlay on fintech by established lenders: Growing appetite for new customer-experience, payments and compliance-monitoring technologies Investment through multiple channels, including incubators/start-up support, dedicated investment funds, direct investments, in-house development and partnerships Ascendancy over the open-banking landscape (particularly ING, HSBC, Barclays, Socit Gnrale, Intesa Sanpaolo and KBC)Influx of new entrants into the European lending market: Organic and inorganic growth of \"challenger\" banks Fintechs securing banking licences and offering traditional banking products and services Consumer/tech majors backing \"favoured\" credit providersKEY DRIVERS Seeking scale, scope and new technology to defend/ increase market share: Fierce competition across the lending landscape from growing \"challenger\" bank offerings Availability of seed and growth capital boosting the number of \"challenger\" banks Mounting activist pressures, aimed at re-focusing core activities and improving shareholder returnsIncreasing agitation of supranational and domestic regulators for banks to find workable solutions for Europe's NPL conundrum Wide universe of potential buyers for non-core businesses and financial assets, including financial sponsors, non-European strategic investors, ultra-high-net-worth individuals and tech conglomerates US inbound investment into Europe\u2014raising of the SIFI threshold from US$50 billion to US$250 billion and easing of restrictive US bank regulation TRENDS TO WATCH Additional rigour in the quest to become the pan-European champion\u2014possibility of mega-deals End of the decade-long dormancy\u2014re-emergence of cross-border strategic M#38;A Wall Street behemoths flexing expansion muscles (e.g., Goldman Sachs's Marcus) Established banks challenging the digital \"challengers\" (e.g., RBS's Mettle and B\u00f3) Impact of M...n IT system robustness (e.g., TSB Bank's IT outage as it attempted to sever legacy dependences on Lloyds, BoE's new \"cyber stress tests\", etc.) Our M...orecastStrong growth in M...ctivity as regional and domestic banks consolidate to combat competition and return to profitability, with the support of governments and regulators.

Fragmented markets across the Middle East have forced local rumour mills into overdrive as domestic players pursue merger opportunities.\" \u2014Marcus Booth, Partner, Dubai/London \"Poland, Serbia, Albania and Bulgaria are just some of the countries which have experienced significant financial sponsor and domestic strategic investor- led consolidation activity in the last 6 months. That activity is likely to intensify as the quest to become the regional champion continues.\" \u2014Jan Andru\u0161ko, Partner, Prague6 THINGS TO THINK ABOUT WHEN CONSIDERING A BANK MERGERHaving advised on a number of market-leading and complex bank consolidations in recent years, here are 6 things we encourage our clients to consider: 1. StructureWhat is stakeholder appetite for the merger? Is it possible to lock in support early from key stakeholders? How will each merging bank be valued? How will the merger be structured from a legal/mechanical perspective? Are there any parts of the merging banks which would be excluded from the consolidation?2. TimelineWhat is the proposed timeline for the merger? How would the proposed timeline be impacted by mandatory CPs?3. Transaction managementAre all directors aware of their legal/ regulatory obligations? Are any key stakeholders independently advised? Are any share-dealing restrictions triggered? Are any public announcement obligations triggered? What is the plan for and proposed scope of due diligence? Are there any information restrictions triggered?4. Integration planning\u2014perhaps the most important aspectWhat preparation has gone into integration planning? Have the right specialist advisers been engaged? Key integration considerations include post- merger governance framework, regulatory capital structure ...anning, compliance systems ...ntrols and communications plans covering employees, customers, key business counterparts and suppliers5. Transaction certaintyWhat financial regulatory approval/ notification requirements would be triggered? What is the proposed process for testing the merger with relevant regulators ahead of implementation? Which of the merging banks will be responsible for securing relevant financial regulatory consents? Are any local/regional antitrust or other state notifications/approvals triggered? Are any other material shareholder/third- party consents required?6. Regulatory mattersEach merging bank will be particularly focussed on regulatory due diligence on the other, particularly around: Scope of financial licences/permits required by the merged bank to operate the businesses of each merging bank Existing regulatory and compliance strengths and weaknesses of the other merging bank The impact of any upcoming regulatory changes on the other merging bank's business model The preparedness of the other merging bank to comply with any new regulatory regimesDeal timetables are often extended due to interaction with financial services regulators. Key contributing factors include: Parties taking longer to complete their due diligence, since regulatory diligence is as much about the future as it is about the past Regulators' increased scrutiny of forward-looking business plans and the effect the merger will have on the merging banks' customers as well as the stability of the local financial services market more generally Regulators requiring changes to post- merger governance arrangementsBanks\u2014Publicly reported deals ...tuations Restructurings25 banks were reported to be in \"well-advanced\" talks with the European Central Bank to secure EU banking licences as of November 2018*Brexit planning (outbound): Barclays: Migration of 200 billion of European assets from UK to Dublin and double Irish employee headcount (December 2018) RBS: Application for German banking license and migration of 6 billion of balance-sheet assets and 7 billion of liabilities from UK to Dutch subsidiary NatWest Markets (December 2018) Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch: Merger of London banking unit into Irish subsidiary (December 2018) J.P.

Yes, they'll  send a car right over to take him down there, I think.  Neil Cavuto.   Thanks, Neil.  Appreciate it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CAVUTO:  All right, bud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> WEBSTER:  Breaking right now, stocks are soaring after new reports suggest  that the White House is quietly negotiating with China as both sides tried  to avoid an all-out trade war.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Hello, everybody.  I'm Ashley Webster, in today for Trish Regan.  And  welcome, everyone, to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p> Well, investors are encourage by the prospect of the world's two largest  economies reaching the deal on trade as stocks bounce back from their worst  week in more than two years and optimism apparently spreading beyond Wall  Street.  Here is Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin speaking to Fox News just  yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  I think we're working on a pathway to  see if we can reach an agreement as to what fair trade is for them to open  up their markets, reduce their tariffs, stop force-technology transfer.   These are all the things we want to do.  But in a negotiation, you have to  be prepared to take action and that's what President Trump is doing.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WEBSTER:  He certainly is.  The President displaying his confidence in our  economy in a tweet this morning saying, \"The economy is looking really  good.  It has been years that we have seen these kind of numbers.  The  underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.\"  And we'll  find out ow those companies are doing, of course, next month with the  latest round of earnings.</p><p> Joining me now Forbes Media Chairman, the man himself, Steve Forbes.  And,  Steve, thank you very much for joining us today in the studio.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  OK.  Let's just pick up from what the President said, are you  happy with the U.S. economy heading in the right direction.  Is it healthy?</p><p> FORBES:  I think it is healthy.  And I think there were news coming out  about negotiating with China and these trade disputes is a good thing  because one of the things this imposition of tariffs would have done is  create uncertainty.  Is this thing going to spin out of control?</p><p> On the steel side for Japan and China is now been exempted to further  negotiations.  On the Chinese side, working behind the scenes see what can  be done.  So I think the markets and investors will be reassured, OK, we  can invest.  They're not going to let this thing spin out of control.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Even though, let's be honest, the way its approach is a little  chaotic.  The Trump administration and it was on this campaign promise  list, if you like, so it's not a big surprise but it really did shake the  markets.  But is this, in your opinion, a classic Donald Trump maneuver?   Shoot very high, come out strong, and then bring someone to the table and  negotiate perhaps something a little lower?</p><p> FORBES:  Well, I think, that it would have been better for him and for the  economy and investing confidence if they had first, especially with China,  negotiated with our European allies, saying we know there are abusers.  Our  allies know there are abusers.  We're going to present the United Front.</p><p> Here's what we're going to put on the table.  So, you've done that kind of  preparation, one, the market wouldn't have freaked out and, two, everyone  would have acknowledged, yes, this thing has to be addressed.</p><p> WEBSTER:  These market actions are remarkable.  I was on the 3:00 show last  week when we had a 400 point drop and a 700 point drop.  Here we go again,  the volatility is back.  Everything seems now is headline driven.  Is that  going to be the way for awhile now, do you believe?</p><p> FORBES:  Well, this is going to depend on what you've referred to early.   These earnings are starting to come out next month.  But it looks like  Corporate America is starting to still turning in good profits.</p><p> People say, OK, things are still being done, things are moving ahead.   Heck, there was even a story this weekend about \"Brexit\" in Britain.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  But for all the hoopla in parliament and the disarray and the  ineffective prime minister, things are happening in the economy.  It's  amazing.  Government leaves it alone.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Despite everything.</p><p> FORBES:  People do things.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Well, it's interesting.  How much attention does the market or  investors pay to what's going on in Washington, because every day there's  some headline coming out, whether it's the President's personal lawyer  quits or whatever it'd be the story de jure.  Does that have an impact on  the markets?  Are people able to put the noise aside?</p><p> FORBES:  Most of the noise they put aside, as we've seen with the markets  reaction to recently, when concerns about what's going to happen on the  trade front came to the forefront.  That's when markets thought, my golly,  are they going to let this thing spin out of control?  Are they going to  control it?  And so, they respond to that kind of news, not to the latest  thing on \"60 Minutes\" or anything else.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I know.  That's not even news as far I can see it.  But anyway,  we'll move on.</p><p> I have to ask you about Facebook, because in light of the 444 point gain  today on Wall Street, it's been striking what we've seen with the selling  on Facebook and the hits it continues to take today.  We found out the  Federal Trade Commission has begun the investigation.  Do you have a  Facebook page?</p><p> FORBES:  I do and even own a few shares of Facebook.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.  What's your take on all of this?</p><p> FORBES:  But I think it's a case where management has flubbed the ball.   This thing could have been contained from the beginning, be upfront about  it.  Outline what you're going to do to prevent abuses by users.</p><p> Yes, the users violated the contract.  But what follow-up did you have?   What kind of auditing did you have?</p><p> Reassure that you're on top of the things, instead of look like you're  floundering, you don't know what to do.  You want to go on apology tour.   That freaks people out that you're not in charge.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Is this redeemable at this stage because it's a very good chance  to, as Neil Cavuto said, look, he's going to be down in Washington  testifying?</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, and that's like I have an offer you can't refuse kind of  invitation.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  That's going to be critical because that will determine the fate  of the stocks in the months ahead, if he goes before the committee and  says, here's what happened, here's what we're outlining doing.  We think  we're on top of this thing, present a role that he is in charge and  reassuring and confident, instead of floundering.</p><p> WEBSTER:  We haven't seen it so far.</p><p> FORBES:  We haven't seen it, but this is his chance to do it.  I hope he is  prepping for this thing in a way people say, OK, the government is not  going to really move in a big way because if the government moves in, that  stock is going to be killed.</p><p> WEBSTER:  It is.  And we're talking about new regulations which could  further crimp the business model of Facebook and other social media  companies.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, and not only Facebook but it means they're going to end up  gumming up a lot of other high-tech companies and high-tech start-ups.  We  don't have the resources to fight this kind thing.  So a lot is on his  shoulder.  I hope the shoulders are broad --</p><p> WEBSTER:  But don't blow it as they say, Steve.</p><p> FORBES:  -- well, he brought it on.</p><p> WEBSTER:  He did, that's very true.  Steve, thank you very much.  Great  stuff as always.</p><p> FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  For more on these markets, let's bring in the Stock Swoosh  Founder, Melissa Armo, along with Surevest Wealth Management CEO, Rob Luna.</p><p> Melissa, let me get to you.  What's your take on the markets right now?   You need some Pepto-Bismol, don't you?  We had a big selloff last week and  now here were are up 443 points.  Is pretty much this volatility here to  stay?</p><p> MELISSA ARMO, THE STOCK SWOOSH:  Volatility is here to stay.  Came in in  2018.  I don't think it's going anywhere.</p><p> I really didn't look today as a strong day.  I know we gapped up a lot this  morning.  But overall, this is just kind of like a dead-cat bounce, it's  something that traders use the terminology.</p><p> I really think we might still be lower, because the fact is that overall  the market is strong but everything that happens, every headline that comes  out, every news thing, the market is reacting very volatile to it, selling  off quickly and then bouncing again and selling off quickly.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> ARMO:  And the range is broadening.  We're still strong but the range from  the high to where we're at in this base is like wide, it's getting wider  and wider and wider.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Well, it's interesting because, Rob, you say, look, we are  trading in a range but to Melissa's point, that range is like the size of  the Grand Canyon right now.</p><p> ROB LUNA, CEO, SUREVEST WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Well, it's like the size of the  Grand Canyon.  If you look at the minuscule ranges that we're trading in  over the prior 18 to 24 months but I think, you know, in general, there's  11 to 12 percentage point range that we're trading in, you know, quiet  honestly, Ashley, is normal.  And we got up towards the end at the top of  that range, all this headline risk, whether it's tariffs, it's raising  interest rates, the market is looking for reason to sell.  It got it, now  we're back towards the bottom in this range.</p><p> And what you're seeing is, as we hit the 200-day moving average support,  buyers are starting to come back in this morning.  But I look at that last  hour, the last hour is going to be very telling to see if we can hold up  today.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  Good luck predicting where it's going go.  Let me follow-up  with you then, Rob.  You say, look, as far as where the economy goes it's  all flashing green.</p><p> We just spoke with Steve Forbes.  He agrees the economy is doing well.  We  get the earnings next month, assuming they're pretty solid, how important  is that for this market?</p><p> LUNA:  I think it's extremely important, right, because there is a lot of  headline risk out there.  Right now, investors are definitely nervous.  So  they need this reassurance from Wall Street, from the companies, from the  CEOs out there telling them the things are still good.  And I think if that  happens, we can head back towards the top of that range, and like we said,  that could be eight to 10 percentage-point move.  So, if you're an investor  you don't necessarily would be on the sidelines and miss out on that.</p><p> WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  Melissa, I spoke with a Money manager this  morning who said, look, I'm looking for a sector that has the least  downside, the most upside.  And I'm thinking, well, yes, we're all doing  that, right?  He said that sector was energy is being beaten down too much  and has a long way to go on the upside.  What do you say?</p><p> ARMO:  I don't agree with that.  I like the idea of banks strengths.  So  right now, the strongest things out there are banks and the tech sector  except for Facebook.  Take Facebook out of that equation, which is  unfortunate.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> ARMO:  But someone like Amazon, Netflix, Apple, I still like Google still  looks good and the banks, J.P. Morgan Chase.  I mean, I still think that  you buy strong stocks.  They're coming in, weak though.  Don't buy yet.   Wait until they're showing strength for about a week, two weeks.</p><p> You want to see consecutive green, green days just like we follow-through  and rally today and all next week into the start of April, that will be a  good time, come second-quarter earnings season to start getting back into  the strong stuff.  I don't want to buy stuff that's weak, that's down a  lot, that has a huge upside.  I want to buy stuff that's proving, that is  strong even when the market was falling last week.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.  And, Rob, you know, that has been the tech stocks.  A lot  of money has gone into tech over the last 18 months and beyond.  Is that  still the leading sector, these big tech companies, or are you seeing money  go elsewhere?</p><p> LUNA:  Yes, you know, I think so, Ashley.  You know, really if you were  looking at rising interest rates right now, the only way that your  portfolio is going to be able to combat that is through growth.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> LUNA:  And it's very tough to get top-line growth outside of technology  right now.  The financials could definitely do it but, you know, they're  actually been struggling here quite a bit.  So, I'm a little bit nervous  about what's going on with them.</p><p> But the old technology stocks, Amazon, Google, two of our top, you know,  largest holdings right now, we're continuing to stick with them.  And, I  agree, momentum is where you want to be but I don't know that you  necessarily wait for them to completely break out.  Use this opportunity  when they're pulling back technically to enter into positions.  And, you  know, 10 percent to 15 percent from where they were at before is a pretty  attractive entry point in our view.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Melissa, I want to ask you the same question I asked Steve  Forbes.  Do you think all the noise is coming out of Washington that at  this point investors pay much attention or does it have an impact on the  market?</p><p> ARMO:  Of course, it does have an impact on the market.  All you have to do  is look last week or even look back the February.  It's unfortunate because  I think the market is going to shake all of this off.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> ARMO:  But you can't ignore it.  We live in 24 hour, seven day week news  cycle.  Every time you get up, you see this thing, that thing, the other  thing.  Mr. Forbes is talking about \"60 Minutes,\" I mean even something  like that could affected the market this morning.</p><p> WEBSTER:  That's true.</p><p> ARMO:  You can't escape it.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  Rob, what do you tell to your clients?  Ignore it, just  focus on fundamentals of these companies?</p><p> LUNA:  Yes, that's exactly it.  I mean, when you look at this whole noise  about the trade tariffs, we have $375 billion deficit right now.  You know,  what was on the table is only $60 billion.  These are not huge numbers  right now.</p><p> And let's face it, Trump is not going to get any, you know, style points  for finesse here.  This is his negotiation style.</p><p> WEBSTER:  No.</p><p> LUNA:  He's trying to get China to the table.  I think it's a lot of noise  right now and investors should just pay attention to the fundamentals.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Wise words indeed from both of you.  Melissa, Rob, thanks you  very much for joining us today.</p><p> ARMO:  Thanks.</p><p> LUNA:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  The Dow up, by the way, 500 points above 24,000.  One of those  days.</p><p> Well, indeed, there may be a rally on Wall Street but shares of Facebook  taking another hit after the FTC says it is investigating the company.  Can  Mark Zuckerberg fix this mess?  Our panel discusses it next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Facebook start taking another leg down after the Federal Trade  Commission announced it was investigating Facebook's privacy practices.   Plus, 37 states attorneys general want to know when Facebook actually knew  about that massive data breach.  And the Senate Judiciary Committee goes on  and on, doesn't it, as invited, I say invited, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and  other tech leaders to testify April 10th, an offer they can't refuse as  someone put it.</p><p> And yes, the headaches keep coming.  A new report claims that Facebook logs  all your calls and texts, it is.  And you probably have no idea that's  happening either.</p><p> Joining me now to talk about this \"Wall Street Journal\" Senior Reporter,  Shelby Holliday, and our very own, Deirdre Bolton.  Thank you both for  being here.</p><p> Shelby, let me begin with you.  I don't know if you heard what Steve Forbes  had to say but he basically said, Mark Zuckerberg dropped the ball on this  and has to really be very careful this time on how he approaches it from  now on.  He has to instill confidence and he has to get it right.  What  we've seen up to now doesn't necessarily suggest he's able to do that.</p><p> SHELBY HOLLIDAY,  SENIOR REPORTER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  He's got to  be honest because there are number of issues Facebook is dealing with right  now, whether it's Russian meddling, Cambridge Analytica use of data, the  cellphone and messages scraping if you will.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  But the underlying theme for all of this is that users were not  aware their data was being used against them.  So now there's a lot of  outrage.  People are pledging to quit Facebook.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  They're calling for answers.  You're hearing lawmakers really  wanting the CEOs to get on the Hill and answer some of these questions.   But Mark Zuckerberg is still continuing to sort of let this drip instead of  just getting all the answers out there, confronting all of the problems  they have and, quite frankly, being honest with all of the users, the two  billion users Facebook has.</p><p> A lot of them when I talk to them, and I'm doing my reporting, still have  no idea that they followed Russian accounts.  So they're getting it from  journalists, rather than the company itself.</p><p> WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  And Deirdre, you know, we hear today the  FTC is getting involved.  What could that mean?</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  So that's like we're going to be --  one of the bigger questions is shall we -- you know, they had an agreement  going back to 2011.  So we should just say this is not the first time that  the FTC and Facebook have sat down together.  This is actually Facebook's  second strike at that with the FTC.</p><p> So in 2011, they had an agreement about privacy, about use of data that  Facebook agreed to.  So I think one of the questions that Facebook is now  going to have to answer is, did they follow the guidelines that they said  they would in 2011?</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> BOLTON:  If it's found not, just start tacking on millions of dollars in  fees, without even talking about potential regulation.  But it's just  actually literally going to cost them.  So I think that's going to be one  of the bigger questions.</p><p> I know with the android, so-called scraping.  I actually spoke with  somebody who said Facebook in legal thing, oh, but users did have the opt  out.  So once again, it's always the own us is on the user and we just  keeping reminding ourselves, right, authors or media is you're not paying  for the products, you are the product.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> BOLTON:  So there is a bit of a buyer beware, which I think the Facebook  legal side is going to try its best to argue.  But I think long story  short, honestly, this just opens the doors, as you said, invited to D.C.  are now Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, of course, for Twitter and Larry Page  for Google.  So I think, you know, what are these companies doing, how are  they protecting our data?  That's why the FTC is involved.</p><p> And you have spoken often with Scott Galloway, who's a professor at NYU --</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, yes.</p><p> BOLTON:  -- who actually believes there will be a call to break up big  tech.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> BOLTON:  And he just wrote a book about this saying, it's going to come  from Europe, because as he points out, Europe has all of the downside and  none of the upside of big tech.  Whereas, at least, we, in our country can  brag like, oh, these are great businesses, we grow it here but Europe has  none of that.  They just have the downside.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, they just rely on finding the big American companies as part  of their budget.</p><p> BOLTON:  Right, yes.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Shelby, let me ask you, should there be a presumption of privacy  when you're posting on something that's so public as Facebook?</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  That's a good question.  You know, I think, throughout this  debate what's getting lost is that users do have responsibility.  We share  TMI, to much information, all the time.  So I definitely think if nothing  else alerts people to the fact that their data is being used and they're  sharing perhaps --</p><p> BORTON:  Cambridge Analytica is saying, though, it was like quiz, though --</p><p> WEBSTER:  It was.</p><p> BOLTON:  -- and was like a personality profile.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  -- when you took this quiz years ago you had no idea it would  come back to be served in your face in a political sense.  And I think --  someone I spoke to last week made a really great point.  Democracy is sort  of built on this idea of open ideas, open debate.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  And when you're sending targeted messages to people that no one  knows what they say, no one knows how they might be manipulated there's no  way for candidates or companies to refute these claims.  They don't know  what's being sent.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I get the sense.  We have to wrap this up.  But I get the sense  with Facebook is they really don't have any idea how much of your  information is out there as we speak.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  No clue.  And Zuckerberg is actually admitted that.</p><p> BOLTON:  I think they built a machine that they can't manage.  It's two  billion users.  It's too big even for them.</p><p> And you recall after our scandal, right, in the run-up to the U.S.  Presidential election, 125 million U.S. voters saw that data.  They hired  1000 editors, 1000 editors with two billion users?  That proportion needs  to be up.  But then it cuts into profit margins if you're going to hire  more humans.</p><p> WEBSTER:  It's going to be very interesting.  And we're going to be talking  about it for a while.  Great stuff.  Shelby, Deirdre, thank you so much.   Appreciate it.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  Thank you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  President Trump, well, he's getting tough on Russia.  The  President ordering 60 Russian diplomats to pack their bags and get out of  the U.S.  It's in retaliation for the toxic nerve agent attack on a former  Russian spy and his daughter on British soil.  So what does this mean for  U.S.-Russia relations from here?  We'll talk about it next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  President Trump is expelling 60 Russian diplomats from the U.S.  and is closing a Russian consulate in Seattle.  This is in response to the  nerve agent attack on an ex-Russian spy in the U.K. earlier this month.   Now, the U.S. is joining at least 17 other countries in kicking out Russian  diplomats making it the biggest western expulsion of Russian  representatives since the height of the Cold War.  Interesting stuff.</p><p> Here now with more, Philip Wegmann.  He's a Commentary Writer for the  \"Washington Examiner.\"</p><p> Philip, do you think, do you get the sense that Vladmir Putin  underestimated the response to this nerve agent attack in Britain?  What is  going through in his mind right now?</p><p> PHILIP WEGMANN, COMMENTARY WRITER, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  Well if Putin  underestimated the response to that attack, he certainly understands the  message that the Trump administration is sending right now.  Remember,  Putin is an old KGB hand and he is not going to miss the significance of  the Trump administration kicking out 60 Russian diplomats and also closing  that consulate in Seattle.</p><p> The message here is clear.  It's that Russian cannot expect to manhandle  our allies and get away with it.  You can't perform these extra judicial  executions on our allies' foreign soil.  And, I think, we're just going to  turn a blind eye.</p><p> WEBSTER:  But is it symbolic?  I mean, what impact does it really have?   Sixty Russian diplomats and representatives go back to Moscow.  Does it put  a serious dent in the intelligence-gathering network?</p><p> WEGMANN:  Absolutely.  If you look at those diplomats, there were 60 of  them and they were in Seattle, Washington, close to not only some of our  sub-bases but also close to Boeing Manufacturing.  So for us to push them  out, that is significant blow to their intelligence gathering network.</p><p> And I think that what the Trump administration needs to do right now is  they need to follow-up this strong action with strong words from the  President.  He needs to show that he's serious about this threat, because,  frankly, a lot of people still don't know that this President now, by  expelling those 60 Russian agents, has sent more Russians out of the  country than President Obama did after the election with regard to the  election meddling.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.  So we're fully expecting a tit-for-tat.  We've seen the  Russians do that with the U.K. when the U.K. kicked out 23 diplomats, same  thing happened in Moscow.  Probably the same thing is going to happen in  the U.S.  Does that not hurt our intelligence-gathering abilities in  Russia?</p><p> WEGMANN:  Well, you're absolutely right.  Already the Russian embassy is  tweeting this morning somewhat tongue-in-cheek, where and which consulates  should be kicked out of Russia.  You know, which of our agents should get  the boot.  And I think that because this is so pointed and this definitely  is a blow at Russian intelligence, that Putin and company, they are going  to strike back hard but the Trump administration has shown resolve, steel  in this area.  And now that John Bolton is joining the administration,  someone who is a Russia hawk, I think we're going to see a much stronger  response from the White House.</p><p> WEBSTER:  How could have -- assuming this went all the way to Mr. Putin and  he gave the OK for this, and we don't know that for sure, but it certainly  appears that way, what was he trying to achieve?  He had to know that  something like this so brazen would have consequences.</p><p> WEGMANN:  Well, the Russians are always trying to push the envelope and  they're also very symbolic in the way that they carryout these executions.   If you look at the type of nerve agent that was used, that was a clear  calling card because that is an agent that was manufactured specifically in  Russia.  So he had to know there were these insidious bread crumbs that  were going to lead back to the Kremlin.</p><p> I think what we're seeing here is that after the 2016 election, Putin is  trying to feel out what he can do, how hard he can go after the United  States.  What we're seeing here is that Trump at least, with this reaction  is showing that we are not going to back down from the world stage.  That  we are going to stand strong in our relations with some of our longest  standing allies.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I have to leave it right there.  It'd be fascinating to follow  what happens next.  Philip, thank you so much for joining us.  Appreciate  it and thanks for your comments.</p><p> We are, of course, keeping a close eye on the markets for years.  Stocks  rally over trade talks, not a trade war.  The market up 556 points now on  the Dow, up at 24,083.</p><p> Also ahead, the court battle is underway to decide the fate of the AT&amp;T  merger with Time Warner.  Right now, top broadcasting executives are  testifying on what this merger would mean for them.  We'll have the intel  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Witnesses are taken the stand today as the Department of Justice  tries to block a potential multibillion dollar deal between AT&amp;T and Time  Warner.  Joining me from the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., is  our very own Connell McShane with the latest.</p><p> Hey, Connell.</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey there, Ashley.  Well, the  court is just about to resume, to be back in session, coming back from one  of your favorite activities, an extended lunch break which the judge took  and for him the judge in this case, Richard Leon, this is a working lunch.   It's kind of a strange morning.</p><p> We're waiting to hear from these two key executives in the cable industry.   One of these guys named Warren Schlichting, a head of a Sling T.V., a DISH  Network and the other is John Martin, the Chairman of CEO at Turner.</p><p> As the government tries to build this antitrust case and tries to block  this merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, I say it's a strange morning because  what happened to us, just before the Department of Justice was to call its  first witness of the day, the government lawyer asked the judge to approach  the bench.  And then for two hours, all the lawyers and the judge were  talking.</p><p> Now, we're in the courtroom, we couldn't hear what they were saying so we  don't know exactly what the issues were but we were told by judge, Leon,  that some issues did come up and he had a number of e-mails to review.  So  he said let's take a longer break than usual.  I'll review those e-mails  and I'll come back and have some rulings and maybe we can proceed in the  afternoon.  So we'll see if we get that testimony.  It could be important.</p><p> Just to get you up to speed, Ashley, in where we are.  In this last week,  the Justice Department started to make its case.  Its basic case is that if  these companies are allowed to combine, AT&amp;T and Time Warner, it would be  unfair and consumers would pay the price.  They'd paid higher prices that  AT&amp;T would be able to kind of weaponize Time Warner to use the Justice  Department's terms there and takes its networks HBO, and CNN, TNT, TBS to  be able to leverage those with DirecTV service and increase prices.</p><p> The companies are comeback and argued that the Justice Department's case is  fundamentally stuck in the past.  They say the game is completely changed  what to do competition from the tech companies whether the, Hulu, Netflix  and the likes.  So we're just getting started here, what could be a six to  eight week trial.  We'll see what this afternoon brings.</p><p> Back to you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  So a lot of talking so far today, Connell, and you couldn't hear  one word of it?</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Great stuff.  All right.  It's going to be a long six weeks, my  friend.  Enjoy those working lunches.</p><p> MCSHANE:  I know.</p><p> WEBSTER:  All right, Connell McShane down in D.C. on the latest development  in AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger case.</p><p> Stops our rallying as investors cheer on reports of trade negotiations,  nice press negotiations between the U.S. and China.  Let's go to the floor  of the New York Stock Exchange, where our very own Nicole Petallides has  the latest.</p><p> Big sell-off last week?  We're up 545 points.  Nicole?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  That's right.  So cooler  heads prevailed for today but big picture, people think of the hard time  committing to that is going to be a great 2018 because there are so many  factors up in the air, they're looking at technicals.</p><p> Right now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 545 points, the S&amp;P 500 is  up, 2.1 percent.  Third day in a row of two percent move.  Thursday, Friday  down two percent each of those days and today up two percent.  So the  volatility is here.</p><p> Tech, we have this interesting dichotomy, fang, right?  Facebook being the  F.  There's seems to be a separation on this one.  In fact, some people are  even wondering is fang over because Facebook under pressure again, down 1.5  percent for the month, down 12.2 percent as it remain under fire.</p><p> Zuckerberg actually has been invited to testify in the U.S. Senate.  You  could see that it's down 1.6 percent.  But Apple, Alphabet, Google,  Microsoft, IBM all gaining today.</p><p> Financials, this could actually did slightly worse than even the techs on  Friday.  Without financials and technology these markets have a very hard  time trying to get off the ground.  But here's on what's J.P. Morgan,  Morgan Stanley, Goldman, all up more than three percent.  And Katie W. (ph)  put out a note today saying that they say mergers and acquisitions ahead,  and particularly for J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs being the acquirers.</p><p> Last but not least, a quick look at defense stocks as we know that the  President and assigning in new obviously military spending a massive a  boost to this group on Friday.  You can see here, Lockheed, Northrop,  Bowman, General Dynamics all up more than two percent each.  So that trend  continues.</p><p> Back to you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Lots of green arrows.  Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p> Meanwhile, one of the oldest gunmakers in the U.S. is filing for  bankruptcy.  Remington Arms is restructuring its massive debt after a 30  percent drop in gun sales this year.  The filing will allow the 200-year- old company to stay in business while reducing its debt by $700 million.   It will, by the way, continue to make guns during the bankruptcy  proceedings.</p><p> And Elon Musk's boring company, and I don't mean boring as dull, I mean the  one that makes tunnels in the ground is going to sell Lego-like bricks made  from tunneling rock.  The life-sized interlocking blocks will be used to  build low-cost homes and other structures.  Those bricks will be  lightweight and durable, making them easy to assemble, Lego bricks.</p><p> Obamacare premiums are set to go up right before the midterm elections in  November.  We'll have the intel on what this could mean for both parties in  the midterms next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Health care premiums are expected to go up yet again right before  the midterm elections in November.  Now this after a battle in Congress  failed to include in last week's massive spending bill a plan to shore up  the health insurance exchanges.  No subsidies.  And without the government  money, insurance companies, well you know what they're going to do?   They're going to raise rates, right?</p><p> Gerri Willis joins us live from the newsroom with the latest on this.   Gerri.</p><p> GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Well, Ash, you've got that story  right.  Estimates of just how much premiums could rise, according to the  Congressional Budget Office, some 10 percent for a popular middle priced  option on the insurance exchanges and, you know, that doesn't even include  the hike to premiums that will likely occur as the mandate fades away.</p><p> Now, lawmakers on both sides are pointing fingers, Democrats blame the GOP  for failure in negotiations saying they demanded abortion restrictions  being included something they knew would be unacceptable to Democrats.  And  Republicans say this that they negotiated in good faith and Democrats  rejected reasonable rules on abortion.  Either way, the impasse means money  to shore up the Obamacare insurance exchanges was omitted from the $1.3  trillion spending plan that the President signed last week.</p><p> Failing to shore up, the exchanges could have big repercussions at the  ballot box.  A recent poll in Pennsylvania showed health care was a top  issue for 52 percent of voters according to Public Policy Polling.</p><p> Payments to insurers were stopped last year after President Trump said they  were illegal because the money had not been appropriated by Congress.   Meanwhile, insiders say that passage of legislation to stabilize the  exchanges, highly unlikely.</p><p> Ash, back to you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Interesting stuff.  The bottom line is those rates go up.  Gerri,  thank you very much.</p><p> Health care is expected to be one of the top issues for this year's midterm  elections.  Topping the latest \"Q-poll\" as the number one issue and poll  show that most voters feel Democrats would handle health care better, but a  new Fox poll shows the Democrats lead in the midterms is actually slipping  to just five points.  Interesting.</p><p> Joining me now, Former Bush Administration Aide, Matt Mackowiak, and  Democratic Strategist, Antjuan Seawright.  Thank you both for being here.</p><p> Matt, let me begin with you.  You could argue that health care continues to  be a problem and it was failure of the Republicans who have the House in  Senate and Oval Office to get this thing sorted out.  How would you  respond? </p><p> MATT MACKOWIAK, FORMER BUSH ADMINISTRATION AIDE:  Yes, there's no question  that Republicans promised to repeal and replace Obamacare.  The House took  two attempts and got it done.  The Senate took two attempts and failed by  one vote and so Republican voters have some frustration about that, there's  no question.  But that's going to be one be one issue the midterms are  going to be about.  They're going to be about economy, they're going to be  about direction of the country and they're ultimately going to be about the  candidates that running on both sides, you know, in each district.</p><p> The generic ballot is helpful directionally.  But ultimately every  individual race comes down to that district, comes down to the candidates  that are running, the campaigns they're running.  We saw that in  Pennsylvania 18 where the Democratic candidate ran as pro-gun, personally  anti-abortion, Democratic candidate.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  And that's not what you're going to see in a lot of other races  around the country.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Antjuan, let me ask you.  Why do you think the gap is closing in  the polls?  What do you put that down to?</p><p> ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, a couple of things here,  one, you should know that between now and November this will be a marathon,  not a sprint on both sides.</p><p> WEBSTER:  True.</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  So you're going to see the polls change, go up and down from  here until November.  The second thing to remember is that the enthusiasm  gap favors the Democrats as well as history.  It is very uncommon for the  party in charge to keep their charge in the midterm elections.</p><p> And the third thing that I will tell you, if you look what is happening all  across the country, in special elections whether State House seats,  Alabama, New Jersey, Virginia, even in Pennsylvania, the voters are  speaking out very loudly.  They are rejecting the policies of Donald Trump  and the Republican Party.  I think the Republicans have a big issue in  November and what no poll will be able to tell you this point is the  massive enthusiasm we've seen from the Women's March movement just a few  months ago in Washington as well as these young people all across the  country who are organizing.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Antjuan, let me just follow up very quickly.  Matt mentioned the  economy.  The tax reform has put up more money in a lot of people's pockets  and the economy for all intents and purposes is doing very well.  If you  hang your hat on the economy, how are you going to make that argument?</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Well, I think the economy will be just one issue that voters  will decide on.  But here's the thing to remember about the economy, there  is a reason why the Republican Party did not run one single ad in  Pennsylvania about their tax scam that they passed a few months ago because  the voters do not agree what happened.</p><p> Look, that bonus they received in their check, I'm not saying it's not a  good thing but it was a shot in the arm.  What want people are raise in  wages that will sustain them long term and improve their quality of life,  and middle class families over the long term will not see that from the tax  bill that passed a few months ago by the Republicans.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Matt, let me have you respond to Antjuan.  I mean, you know, yes,  the bonuses were nice.  They weren't crumbs but they're also seeing  benefits from the tax reform paying lower taxes.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  No question.  You have about 5 million people who received  their bonus or received their wage increase because of the tax law, that's  significant.  You have the highest consumer confidence we've had in  decades.  And I can put Antjuan's mind at ease, wages are going up for  first time in a decade and that's very good news.</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Well they're not, Matt, according to statistics.  According to  statistics wages are flat.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  Antjuan, I'd be happy to send you the statistics that have come  out on the last couple months that shown wages have begun rising.  So the  economy is improving.  It's strengthening.  We have 4.1 percent  unemployment and historically very, very low.</p><p> And I think Republicans everyday they aren't talking about the economy as a  waste.  They need to talk about the economy.  They need to sell the tax  law.  A majority of the public is now viewing it very favorably.  This has  a chance to save their majority even though it is very much up for grabs.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Antjuan, do you think that --</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Matt, keep in mind --</p><p> WEBSTER:  -- all right, go ahead.</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  -- Matt, keep in mind, the one thing that you all have around  your neck is President Donald Trump, the most toxic President probably in  modern-day history at the top of the ticket.  Look, that is not a good  thing going into someone --</p><p> WEBSTER:  But why is his approval rating Antjuan?  Why is the President's  approval rating going up?</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  -- it may be rising from the graveyard but it has not hit  aboveground just yet.  And keep in mind, Virginia rejected, Alabama  rejected Trump, so did Pennsylvania and in districts where he carried about  20, 30 points in the last election cycle.  Democrats have been winning at  various levels of our government.  And so, you can decide however you want  to break that down, but I am telling you that something is brewing here in  this country and I don't think the way will be in favor of Republicans.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Very quickly, Matt.  You know, if you're a candidate, do you want  Donald Trump to come to your town and stamp for you and, you know, get the  crowd fired up?  Would you distance yourself?</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  It totally depends on district and on the dynamics of the race  that you're in.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  In some districts, particularly in places like California you  probably don't want the President to come in.  If you're in the middle of  country, in states that Trump won, if you're running for U.S. Senate in  North Dakota or West Virginia or Montana, the President can be very  helpful.  So, they're going to have to be strategic on how they deploy him  next fall.</p><p> There's no question, his improvement has been narrowly increasing.  He's in  the middle of 30s last year.  It's in the low 40s now.  They needed to get  in the mid-40s by the midterms.  They'll have a chance to hold the House  and that's very important.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Guys, we have to leave it right there.  You know, bottom line is  a day is a long time in politics.  So, there is a long time between now and  November.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  A marathon, not a sprint.</p><p> WEBSTER:  All right.  Matt and Antjuan, great stuff as always.  Thank you  both for joining us today.</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Thank you.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  Thank you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Coming up next, we got preview of tonight's new episodes of the  \"Strange Inheritance,\" including a son of a NASA chaplain who inherits more  than a 100 Bibles that went to the moon.  I kid you not.  Stay with us.   We're back in two.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Monday night on Fox Business are getting a just little bit  stranger.  Strange Inheritance is back tonight with two new episodes, one,  involving some Bibles that went all the way to the moon.  I kid you not.   Take a look.</p><p> (BEGINNING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAMIE COLBY, HOST, \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\":  It's a small postage stamp.   What's on there?</p><p> JONATHAN STOUT:  That's the entire Bible.</p><p> COLBY:  On one little tiny microfiche?</p><p> STOUT:  On each sheet.</p><p> COLBY:  When it's magnified under a microscope, sure enough there is the  Holy Scripture.</p><p> STOUT:  That was my dad's dream, to get the Bible to the moon.</p><p> COLBY:  Wait, your inheritance is this little teeny-tiny Bibles went to the  moon?</p><p> COLBY:  Yes, it did.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WEBSTER:  You know, it's fascinating.  Joining me now in the studio to chat  about all of the Strange Inheritance stamp, and it is fascinating, is the  host, Jamie Colby.</p><p> Jamie, thank you so much for being here.</p><p> COLBY:  Absolutely, Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Define Bible.</p><p> COLBY:  Did you know I did not know Bibles went to the moon.</p><p> WEBSTER:  No.</p><p> COLBY:  But Reverend Stout was.</p><p> WEBSTER:  And they came back.  They weren't left there for someone to read.</p><p> COLBY:  Well, it took several attempts to get them there successfully to be  on the lunar surface.  He was really determined.  He was NASA engineer who  happened to be at Reverend and he decided this is something he wanted to  do.</p><p> So, Edgar Mitchell was the astronaut that actually took it as part of his  personal items, hundreds of them, because they were that small.  I don't  even know how many people remember microfiche but I read and the entire  Bible was there.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I'm old enough to remember microfiche at the library, you know,  you go through.</p><p> COLBY:  But here's the problem.  You want to know what their worst because  this is a business channel.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Always.</p><p> COLBY:  They are so valuable.  The individual ones have sold anywhere from  10,000 to 70,000.</p><p> WEBSTER:  You are kidding.</p><p> COLBY:  He has several hundred of them but there wasn't a will and even  though when there's a will there's a way.  When there's no will it's get  very complicated on Strange Inheritance.</p><p> So, tonight, you'll meet the family.  You'll also meet an author, Carol  Mersch, who did some investigation and story on the Bibles with Reverend  and she says, the Bibles belonged to her.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Interesting.</p><p> COLBY:  It's a little messy.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  That's the best you say.</p><p> COLBY:  The good book on demand.</p><p> WEBSTER:  When it comes with the territory, when you're talking about  things that are, you know, left behind, if the ownership part is not clear  it can get, well, down right ugly at times.  Anyway, --</p><p> COLBY:  In Texas, they're good people.  They're going to work it out.</p><p> WEBSTER:  -- of course they will.  Now, also, there's another topic you're  getting into involving race cars.</p><p> COLBY:  Rave up you engine because --</p><p> WEBSTER:  Best car?</p><p> COLBY:  -- this family, actually the father, Mickey Thompson, broke the  land speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats on what he called the  Challenger.  It's a piston-driven engine that goes 400 plus miles.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Look at that.  Oh my God!</p><p> COLBY:  Wait till you see me in it.  But anyway I degrease that so much  fun.  I could almost knock it out.  It's so high speed.</p><p> WEBSTER:  You still be in and out.</p><p> COLBY:  It was amazing.  So, Danny is his son and he was determined to  break his dad's land speed record because for all the years his father told  him, no racing, it's dangerous.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Oh, my God.  Yes.</p><p> COLBY:  The last thing his father said to him is I'm giving you the  Challenger.  I want you to race it and now, he's determined to make sure  that the Thompson family keeps that record.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Fascinating.  The air tonight beginning at?</p><p> COLBY:  9:00 to 9:30.</p><p> WEBSTER:  9:00 to 9:30.</p><p> COLBY:  Come on over.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I'd love it.  I want to try that car, break the land speed record  or may be not.  At least you got of it, that's the main thing.</p><p> COLBY:  Wear your seatbelt, Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, always.  Jamie, thank you very much.</p><p> Let's take a look at the market for you.  What a day.  We said it's a Jamie  Colby effect.  It was going to hit 600 points, nearly Jamie.  Good.  We're  up 564 points.</p><p> Liz Claman, by the way, is back from, I think, she went skiing.  I think  she went old fancy and went out west to go skiing.</p><p> We saw some picture, Liz.  You looked terrific out there.  And you're into  friend.  I think you ride into Peter Toughman (ph) </p><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Can you believe that.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Of all of people, I mean, it's a small world because Peter  Toughman works down at the New York Exchange.  He's the guy with that crazy  hair and the glasses.  And he's taking picture when the markets doing crazy  thing.</p><p> CLAMAN:  He is the most photographed trader on the floor of the New York  Stock.  We're going to find that picture up the Twitter feed.</p><p> WEBSTER:  We do.  It's great to have you back.</p><p> LIZ:  But I can tell you, he wasn't wearing a helmet.</p><p> WEBSTER:  What?</p><p> CLAMAN:  Bad, Peter, bad.  That's how I recognize him because out there  with his hair.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Funny.  He looks funny in a helmet.  Yes.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

And, Steve, thank you very much for joining us today in the studio.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you.</p><p>WEBSTER: OK. Let's just pick up from what the President said, are you happy with the U.S. economy heading in the right direction. Is it healthy?</p><p>FORBES: I think it is healthy. And I think there were news coming out about negotiating with China and these trade disputes is a good thing because one of the things this imposition of tariffs would have done is create uncertainty. Is this thing going to spin out of control?</p><p>On the steel side for Japan and China is now been exempted to further negotiations. On the Chinese side, working behind the scenes see what can be done. So I think the markets and investors will be reassured, OK, we can invest. They're not going to let this thing spin out of control.</p><p>WEBSTER: Even though, let's be honest, the way its approach is a little chaotic. The Trump administration and it was on this campaign promise list, if you like, so it's not a big surprise but it really did shake the markets. But is this, in your opinion, a classic Donald Trump maneuver? Shoot very high, come out strong, and then bring someone to the table and negotiate perhaps something a little lower?</p><p>FORBES: Well, I think, that it would have been better for him and for the economy and investing confidence if they had first, especially with China, negotiated with our European allies, saying we know there are abusers. Our allies know there are abusers. We're going to present the United Front.</p><p>Here's what we're going to put on the table. So, you've done that kind of preparation, one, the market wouldn't have freaked out and, two, everyone would have acknowledged, yes, this thing has to be addressed.</p><p>WEBSTER: These market actions are remarkable. I was on the 3:00 show last week when we had a 400 point drop and a 700 point drop. Here we go again, the volatility is back. Everything seems now is headline driven. Is that going to be the way for awhile now, do you believe?</p><p>FORBES: Well, this is going to depend on what you've referred to early. These earnings are starting to come out next month. But it looks like Corporate America is starting to still turning in good profits.</p><p>People say, OK, things are still being done, things are moving ahead. Heck, there was even a story this weekend about \"Brexit\" in Britain.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: But for all the hoopla in parliament and the disarray and the ineffective prime minister, things are happening in the economy. It's amazing. Government leaves it alone.</p><p>WEBSTER: Despite everything.</p><p>FORBES: People do things.</p><p>WEBSTER: Well, it's interesting. How much attention does the market or investors pay to what's going on in Washington, because every day there's some headline coming out, whether it's the President's personal lawyer quits or whatever it'd be the story de jure. Does that have an impact on the markets? Are people able to put the noise aside?</p><p>FORBES: Most of the noise they put aside, as we've seen with the markets reaction to recently, when concerns about what's going to happen on the trade front came to the forefront. That's when markets thought, my golly, are they going to let this thing spin out of control? Are they going to control it? And so, they respond to that kind of news, not to the latest thing on \"60 Minutes\" or anything else.</p><p>WEBSTER: I know. That's not even news as far I can see it. But anyway, we'll move on.</p><p>I have to ask you about <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>because in light of the 444 point gain today on Wall Street, it's been striking what we've seen with the selling on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and the hits it continues to take today. We found out the Federal Trade Commission has begun the investigation. Do you have a <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>page?</p><p>FORBES: I do and even own a few shares of <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>WEBSTER: Right. What's your take on all of this?</p><p>FORBES: But I think it's a case where management has flubbed the ball. This thing could have been contained from the beginning, be upfront about it. Outline what you're going to do to prevent abuses by users.</p><p>Yes, the users violated the contract. But what follow-up did you have? What kind of auditing did you have?</p><p>Reassure that you're on top of the things, instead of look like you're floundering, you don't know what to do. You want to go on apology tour. That freaks people out that you're not in charge.</p><p>WEBSTER: Is this redeemable at this stage because it's a very good chance to, as <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto </nameText></person>said, look, he's going to be down in Washington testifying?</p><p>FORBES: Yes, and that's like I have an offer you can't refuse kind of invitation.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: That's going to be critical because that will determine the fate of the stocks in the months ahead, if he goes before the committee and says, here's what happened, here's what we're outlining doing. We think we're on top of this thing, present a role that he is in charge and reassuring and confident, instead of floundering.</p><p>WEBSTER: We haven't seen it so far.</p><p>FORBES: We haven't seen it, but this is his chance to do it. I hope he is prepping for this thing in a way people say, OK, the government is not going to really move in a big way because if the government moves in, that stock is going to be killed.</p><p>WEBSTER: It is. And we're talking about new regulations which could further crimp the business model of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other social media companies.</p><p>FORBES: Yes, and not only <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>but it means they're going to end up gumming up a lot of other high-tech companies and high-tech start-ups. We don't have the resources to fight this kind thing. So a lot is on his shoulder. I hope the shoulders are broad --</p><p>WEBSTER: But don't blow it as they say, Steve.</p><p>FORBES: -- well, he brought it on.</p><p>WEBSTER: He did, that's very true. Steve, thank you very much. Great stuff as always.</p><p>FORBES: Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER: For more on these markets, let's bring in the Stock Swoosh Founder, Melissa Armo, along with Surevest Wealth Management CEO, Rob Luna.</p><p>Melissa, let me get to you. What's your take on the markets right now? You need some Pepto-Bismol, don't you? We had a big selloff last week and now here were are up 443 points. Is pretty much this volatility here to stay?</p><p>MELISSA ARMO, THE STOCK SWOOSH: Volatility is here to stay. Came in in 2018. I don't think it's going anywhere.</p><p>I really didn't look today as a strong day. I know we gapped up a lot this morning. But overall, this is just kind of like a dead-cat bounce, it's something that traders use the terminology.</p><p>I really think we might still be lower, because the fact is that overall the market is strong but everything that happens, every headline that comes out, every news thing, the market is reacting very volatile to it, selling off quickly and then bouncing again and selling off quickly.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>ARMO: And the range is broadening. We're still strong but the range from the high to where we're at in this base is like wide, it's getting wider and wider and wider.</p><p>WEBSTER: Well, it's interesting because, Rob, you say, look, we are trading in a range but to Melissa's point, that range is like the size of the Grand Canyon right now.</p><p>ROB LUNA, CEO, SUREVEST WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Well, it's like the size of the Grand Canyon. If you look at the minuscule ranges that we're trading in over the prior 18 to 24 months but I think, you know, in general, there's 11 to 12 percentage point range that we're trading in, you know, quiet honestly, Ashley, is normal. And we got up towards the end at the top of that range, all this headline risk, whether it's tariffs, it's raising interest rates, the market is looking for reason to sell. It got it, now we're back towards the bottom in this range.</p><p>And what you're seeing is, as we hit the 200-day moving average support, buyers are starting to come back in this morning. But I look at that last hour, the last hour is going to be very telling to see if we can hold up today.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. Good luck predicting where it's going go. Let me follow-up with you then, Rob. You say, look, as far as where the economy goes it's all flashing green.</p><p>We just spoke with Steve Forbes. He agrees the economy is doing well. We get the earnings next month, assuming they're pretty solid, how important is that for this market?</p><p>LUNA: I think it's extremely important, right, because there is a lot of headline risk out there. Right now, investors are definitely nervous. So they need this reassurance from Wall Street, from the companies, from the CEOs out there telling them the things are still good. And I think if that happens, we can head back towards the top of that range, and like we said, that could be eight to 10 percentage-point move. So, if you're an investor you don't necessarily would be on the sidelines and miss out on that.</p><p>WEBSTER: That's a good point. Melissa, I spoke with a Money manager this morning who said, look, I'm looking for a sector that has the least downside, the most upside. And I'm thinking, well, yes, we're all doing that, right? He said that sector was energy is being beaten down too much and has a long way to go on the upside. What do you say?</p><p>ARMO: I don't agree with that. I like the idea of banks strengths. So right now, the strongest things out there are banks and the tech sector except for <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>Take <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>out of that equation, which is unfortunate.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>ARMO: But someone like Amazon, Netflix, Apple, I still like Google still looks good and the banks, J.P. Morgan Chase. I mean, I still think that you buy strong stocks. They're coming in, weak though. Don't buy yet. Wait until they're showing strength for about a week, two weeks.</p><p>You want to see consecutive green, green days just like we follow-through and rally today and all next week into the start of April, that will be a good time, come second-quarter earnings season to start getting back into the strong stuff. I don't want to buy stuff that's weak, that's down a lot, that has a huge upside. I want to buy stuff that's proving, that is strong even when the market was falling last week.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right. And, Rob, you know, that has been the tech stocks. A lot of money has gone into tech over the last 18 months and beyond. Is that still the leading sector, these big tech companies, or are you seeing money go elsewhere?</p><p>LUNA: Yes, you know, I think so, Ashley. You know, really if you were looking at rising interest rates right now, the only way that your portfolio is going to be able to combat that is through growth.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>LUNA: And it's very tough to get top-line growth outside of technology right now. The financials could definitely do it but, you know, they're actually been struggling here quite a bit. So, I'm a little bit nervous about what's going on with them.</p><p>But the old technology stocks, Amazon, Google, two of our top, you know, largest holdings right now, we're continuing to stick with them. And, I agree, momentum is where you want to be but I don't know that you necessarily wait for them to completely break out. Use this opportunity when they're pulling back technically to enter into positions. And, you know, 10 percent to 15 percent from where they were at before is a pretty attractive entry point in our view.</p><p>WEBSTER: Melissa, I want to ask you the same question I asked Steve Forbes. Do you think all the noise is coming out of Washington that at this point investors pay much attention or does it have an impact on the market?</p><p>ARMO: Of course, it does have an impact on the market. All you have to do is look last week or even look back the February. It's unfortunate because I think the market is going to shake all of this off.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>ARMO: But you can't ignore it. We live in 24 hour, seven day week news cycle. Every time you get up, you see this thing, that thing, the other thing. Mr. Forbes is talking about \"60 Minutes,\" I mean even something like that could affected the market this morning.</p><p>WEBSTER: That's true.</p><p>ARMO: You can't escape it.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. Rob, what do you tell to your clients? Ignore it, just focus on fundamentals of these companies?</p><p>LUNA: Yes, that's exactly it. I mean, when you look at this whole noise about the trade tariffs, we have $375 billion deficit right now. You know, what was on the table is only $60 billion. These are not huge numbers right now.</p><p>And let's face it, Trump is not going to get any, you know, style points for finesse here. This is his negotiation style.</p><p>WEBSTER: No.</p><p>LUNA: He's trying to get China to the table. I think it's a lot of noise right now and investors should just pay attention to the fundamentals.</p><p>WEBSTER: Wise words indeed from both of you. Melissa, Rob, thanks you very much for joining us today.</p><p>ARMO: Thanks.</p><p>LUNA: Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER: The Dow up, by the way, 500 points above 24,000. One of those days.</p><p>Well, indeed, there may be a rally on Wall Street but shares of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>taking another hit after the FTC says it is investigating the company. Can Mark Zuckerberg fix this mess? Our panel discusses it next.</p><p>WEBSTER: <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>start taking another leg down after the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>privacy practices. Plus, 37 states attorneys general want to know when <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>actually knew about that massive data breach. And the Senate Judiciary Committee goes on and on, doesn't it, as invited, I say invited, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other tech leaders to testify April 10th, an offer they can't refuse as someone put it.</p><p>And yes, the headaches keep coming. A new report claims that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>logs all your calls and texts, it is. And you probably have no idea that's happening either.</p><p>Joining me now to talk about this \"Wall Street Journal\" Senior Reporter, Shelby Holliday, and our very own, Deirdre Bolton. Thank you both for being here.</p><p>Shelby, let me begin with you. I don't know if you heard what Steve Forbes had to say but he basically said, Mark Zuckerberg dropped the ball on this and has to really be very careful this time on how he approaches it from now on. He has to instill confidence and he has to get it right. What we've seen up to now doesn't necessarily suggest he's able to do that.</p><p>SHELBY HOLLIDAY, SENIOR REPORTER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": He's got to be honest because there are number of issues <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is dealing with right now, whether it's Russian meddling, Cambridge Analytica use of data, the cellphone and messages scraping if you will.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>HOLLIDAY: But the underlying theme for all of this is that users were not aware their data was being used against them. So now there's a lot of outrage. People are pledging to quit <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>HOLLIDAY: They're calling for answers. You're hearing lawmakers really wanting the CEOs to get on the Hill and answer some of these questions. But Mark Zuckerberg is still continuing to sort of let this drip instead of just getting all the answers out there, confronting all of the problems they have and, quite frankly, being honest with all of the users, the two billion users <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has.</p><p>A lot of them when I talk to them, and I'm doing my reporting, still have no idea that they followed Russian accounts. So they're getting it from journalists, rather than the company itself.</p><p>WEBSTER: That's a good point. And Deirdre, you know, we hear today the FTC is getting involved. What could that mean?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: So that's like we're going to be -- one of the bigger questions is shall we -- you know, they had an agreement going back to 2011. So we should just say this is not the first time that the FTC and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>have sat down together. This is actually <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>second strike at that with the FTC.</p><p>So in 2011, they had an agreement about privacy, about use of data that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>agreed to. So I think one of the questions that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is now going to have to answer is, did they follow the guidelines that they said they would in 2011?</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: If it's found not, just start tacking on millions of dollars in fees, without even talking about potential regulation. But it's just actually literally going to cost them. So I think that's going to be one of the bigger questions.</p><p>I know with the android, so-called scraping. I actually spoke with somebody who said <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in legal thing, oh, but users did have the opt out. So once again, it's always the own us is on the user and we just keeping reminding ourselves, right, authors or media is you're not paying for the products, you are the product.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: So there is a bit of a buyer beware, which I think the <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>legal side is going to try its best to argue. But I think long story short, honestly, this just opens the doors, as you said, invited to D.C. are now Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, of course, for Twitter and Larry Page for Google. So I think, you know, what are these companies doing, how are they protecting our data? That's why the FTC is involved.</p><p>And you have spoken often with Scott Galloway, who's a professor at NYU --</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, yes.</p><p>BOLTON: -- who actually believes there will be a call to break up big tech.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: And he just wrote a book about this saying, it's going to come from Europe, because as he points out, Europe has all of the downside and none of the upside of big tech. Whereas, at least, we, in our country can brag like, oh, these are great businesses, we grow it here but Europe has none of that. They just have the downside.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, they just rely on finding the big American companies as part of their budget.</p><p>BOLTON: Right, yes.</p><p>WEBSTER: Shelby, let me ask you, should there be a presumption of privacy when you're posting on something that's so public as <person><nameText>Facebook?</nameText></person></p><p>HOLLIDAY: That's a good question. You know, I think, throughout this debate what's getting lost is that users do have responsibility. We share TMI, to much information, all the time. So I definitely think if nothing else alerts people to the fact that their data is being used and they're sharing perhaps --</p><p>BORTON: Cambridge Analytica is saying, though, it was like quiz, though --</p><p>WEBSTER: It was.</p><p>BOLTON: -- and was like a personality profile.</p><p>HOLLIDAY: -- when you took this quiz years ago you had no idea it would come back to be served in your face in a political sense. And I think -- someone I spoke to last week made a really great point. Democracy is sort of built on this idea of open ideas, open debate.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>HOLLIDAY: And when you're sending targeted messages to people that no one knows what they say, no one knows how they might be manipulated there's no way for candidates or companies to refute these claims. They don't know what's being sent.</p><p>WEBSTER: I get the sense. We have to wrap this up. But I get the sense with <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is they really don't have any idea how much of your information is out there as we speak.</p><p>HOLLIDAY: No clue. And Zuckerberg is actually admitted that.</p><p>BOLTON: I think they built a machine that they can't manage. It's two billion users. It's too big even for them.</p><p>And you recall after our scandal, right, in the run-up to the U.S. Presidential election, 125 million U.S. voters saw that data. They hired 1000 editors, 1000 editors with two billion users? That proportion needs to be up. But then it cuts into profit margins if you're going to hire more humans.</p><p>WEBSTER: It's going to be very interesting. And we're going to be talking about it for a while. Great stuff. Shelby, Deirdre, thank you so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>HOLLIDAY: Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER: President Trump, well, he's getting tough on Russia. The President ordering 60 Russian diplomats to pack their bags and get out of the U.S. It's in retaliation for the toxic nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil. So what does this mean for U.S.-Russia relations from here? We'll talk about it next.</p><p>WEBSTER: President Trump is expelling 60 Russian diplomats from the U.S. and is closing a Russian consulate in Seattle. This is in response to the nerve agent attack on an ex-Russian spy in the U.K. earlier this month. Now, the U.S. is joining at least 17 other countries in kicking out Russian diplomats making it the biggest western expulsion of Russian representatives since the height of the Cold War. Interesting stuff.</p><p>Here now with more, Philip Wegmann. He's a Commentary Writer for the \"Washington Examiner.\"</p><p>Philip, do you think, do you get the sense that Vladmir Putin underestimated the response to this nerve agent attack in Britain? What is going through in his mind right now?</p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, COMMENTARY WRITER, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Well if Putin underestimated the response to that attack, he certainly understands the message that the Trump administration is sending right now. Remember, Putin is an old KGB hand and he is not going to miss the significance of the Trump administration kicking out 60 Russian diplomats and also closing that consulate in Seattle.</p><p>The message here is clear. It's that Russian cannot expect to manhandle our allies and get away with it. You can't perform these extra judicial executions on our allies' foreign soil. And, I think, we're just going to turn a blind eye.</p><p>WEBSTER: But is it symbolic? I mean, what impact does it really have? Sixty Russian diplomats and representatives go back to Moscow. Does it put a serious dent in the intelligence-gathering network?</p><p>WEGMANN: Absolutely. If you look at those diplomats, there were 60 of them and they were in Seattle, Washington, close to not only some of our sub-bases but also close to Boeing Manufacturing. So for us to push them out, that is significant blow to their intelligence gathering network.</p><p>And I think that what the Trump administration needs to do right now is they need to follow-up this strong action with strong words from the President. He needs to show that he's serious about this threat, because, frankly, a lot of people still don't know that this President now, by expelling those 60 Russian agents, has sent more Russians out of the country than President Obama did after the election with regard to the election meddling.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right. So we're fully expecting a tit-for-tat. We've seen the Russians do that with the U.K. when the U.K. kicked out 23 diplomats, same thing happened in Moscow. Probably the same thing is going to happen in the U.S. Does that not hurt our intelligence-gathering abilities in Russia?</p><p>WEGMANN: Well, you're absolutely right. Already the Russian embassy is tweeting this morning somewhat tongue-in-cheek, where and which consulates should be kicked out of Russia. You know, which of our agents should get the boot. And I think that because this is so pointed and this definitely is a blow at Russian intelligence, that Putin and company, they are going to strike back hard but the Trump administration has shown resolve, steel in this area. And now that John Bolton is joining the administration, someone who is a Russia hawk, I think we're going to see a much stronger response from the White House.</p><p>WEBSTER: How could have -- assuming this went all the way to Mr. Putin and he gave the OK for this, and we don't know that for sure, but it certainly appears that way, what was he trying to achieve? He had to know that something like this so brazen would have consequences.</p><p>WEGMANN: Well, the Russians are always trying to push the envelope and they're also very symbolic in the way that they carryout these executions. If you look at the type of nerve agent that was used, that was a clear calling card because that is an agent that was manufactured specifically in Russia. So he had to know there were these insidious bread crumbs that were going to lead back to the Kremlin.</p><p>I think what we're seeing here is that after the 2016 election, Putin is trying to feel out what he can do, how hard he can go after the United States. What we're seeing here is that Trump at least, with this reaction is showing that we are not going to back down from the world stage. That we are going to stand strong in our relations with some of our longest standing allies.</p><p>WEBSTER: I have to leave it right there. It'd be fascinating to follow what happens next. Philip, thank you so much for joining us. Appreciate it and thanks for your comments.</p><p>We are, of course, keeping a close eye on the markets for years. Stocks rally over trade talks, not a trade war. The market up 556 points now on the Dow, up at 24,083.</p><p>Also ahead, the court battle is underway to decide the fate of the AT&amp;T merger with Time Warner. Right now, top broadcasting executives are testifying on what this merger would mean for them. We'll have the intel next.</p><p>WEBSTER: Witnesses are taken the stand today as the Department of Justice tries to block a potential multibillion dollar deal between AT&amp;T and Time Warner. Joining me from the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., is our very own Connell McShane with the latest.</p><p>Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: Hey there, Ashley. Well, the court is just about to resume, to be back in session, coming back from one of your favorite activities, an extended lunch break which the judge took and for him the judge in this case, Richard Leon, this is a working lunch. It's kind of a strange morning.</p><p>We're waiting to hear from these two key executives in the cable industry. One of these guys named Warren Schlichting, a head of a Sling T.V., a DISH Network and the other is John Martin, the Chairman of CEO at Turner.</p><p>As the government tries to build this antitrust case and tries to block this merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, I say it's a strange morning because what happened to us, just before the Department of Justice was to call its first witness of the day, the government lawyer asked the judge to approach the bench. And then for two hours, all the lawyers and the judge were talking.</p><p>Now, we're in the courtroom, we couldn't hear what they were saying so we don't know exactly what the issues were but we were told by judge, Leon, that some issues did come up and he had a number of e-mails to review. So he said let's take a longer break than usual. I'll review those e-mails and I'll come back and have some rulings and maybe we can proceed in the afternoon. So we'll see if we get that testimony. It could be important.</p><p>Just to get you up to speed, Ashley, in where we are. In this last week, the Justice Department started to make its case. Its basic case is that if these companies are allowed to combine, AT&amp;T and Time Warner, it would be unfair and consumers would pay the price. They'd paid higher prices that AT&amp;T would be able to kind of weaponize Time Warner to use the Justice Department's terms there and takes its networks HBO, and CNN, TNT, TBS to be able to leverage those with DirecTV service and increase prices.</p><p>The companies are comeback and argued that the Justice Department's case is fundamentally stuck in the past. They say the game is completely changed what to do competition from the tech companies whether the, Hulu, Netflix and the likes. So we're just getting started here, what could be a six to eight week trial. We'll see what this afternoon brings.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER: So a lot of talking so far today, Connell, and you couldn't hear one word of it?</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER: Great stuff. All right. It's going to be a long six weeks, my friend. Enjoy those working lunches.</p><p>MCSHANE: I know.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right, Connell McShane down in D.C. on the latest development in AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger case.</p><p>Stops our rallying as investors cheer on reports of trade negotiations, nice press negotiations between the U.S. and China. Let's go to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, where our very own Nicole Petallides has the latest.</p><p>Big sell-off last week? We're up 545 points. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: That's right. So cooler heads prevailed for today but big picture, people think of the hard time committing to that is going to be a great 2018 because there are so many factors up in the air, they're looking at technicals.</p><p>Right now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 545 points, the S&amp;P 500 is up, 2.1 percent. Third day in a row of two percent move. Thursday, Friday down two percent each of those days and today up two percent.

We'll have the intel on what this could mean for both parties in the midterms next.</p><p>WEBSTER: Health care premiums are expected to go up yet again right before the midterm elections in November. Now this after a battle in Congress failed to include in last week's massive spending bill a plan to shore up the health insurance exchanges. No subsidies. And without the government money, insurance companies, well you know what they're going to do? They're going to raise rates, right?</p><p>Gerri Willis joins us live from the newsroom with the latest on this. Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: Well, Ash, you've got that story right. Estimates of just how much premiums could rise, according to the Congressional Budget Office, some 10 percent for a popular middle priced option on the insurance exchanges and, you know, that doesn't even include the hike to premiums that will likely occur as the mandate fades away.</p><p>Now, lawmakers on both sides are pointing fingers, Democrats blame the GOP for failure in negotiations saying they demanded abortion restrictions being included something they knew would be unacceptable to Democrats. And Republicans say this that they negotiated in good faith and Democrats rejected reasonable rules on abortion. Either way, the impasse means money to shore up the Obamacare insurance exchanges was omitted from the $1.3 trillion spending plan that the President signed last week.</p><p>Failing to shore up, the exchanges could have big repercussions at the ballot box. A recent poll in Pennsylvania showed health care was a top issue for 52 percent of voters according to Public Policy Polling.</p><p>Payments to insurers were stopped last year after President Trump said they were illegal because the money had not been appropriated by Congress. Meanwhile, insiders say that passage of legislation to stabilize the exchanges, highly unlikely.</p><p>Ash, back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER: Interesting stuff. The bottom line is those rates go up. Gerri, thank you very much.</p><p>Health care is expected to be one of the top issues for this year's midterm elections. Topping the latest \"Q-poll\" as the number one issue and poll show that most voters feel Democrats would handle health care better, but a new Fox poll shows the Democrats lead in the midterms is actually slipping to just five points. Interesting.</p><p>Joining me now, Former Bush Administration Aide, Matt Mackowiak, and Democratic Strategist, Antjuan Seawright. Thank you both for being here.</p><p>Matt, let me begin with you. You could argue that health care continues to be a problem and it was failure of the Republicans who have the House in Senate and Oval Office to get this thing sorted out. How would you respond?</p><p>MATT MACKOWIAK, FORMER BUSH ADMINISTRATION AIDE: Yes, there's no question that Republicans promised to repeal and replace Obamacare. The House took two attempts and got it done. The Senate took two attempts and failed by one vote and so Republican voters have some frustration about that, there's no question. But that's going to be one be one issue the midterms are going to be about. They're going to be about economy, they're going to be about direction of the country and they're ultimately going to be about the candidates that running on both sides, you know, in each district.</p><p>The generic ballot is helpful directionally. But ultimately every individual race comes down to that district, comes down to the candidates that are running, the campaigns they're running. We saw that in Pennsylvania 18 where the Democratic candidate ran as pro-gun, personally anti-abortion, Democratic candidate.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>MACKOWIAK: And that's not what you're going to see in a lot of other races around the country.</p><p>WEBSTER: Antjuan, let me ask you. Why do you think the gap is closing in the polls? What do you put that down to?</p><p>ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, a couple of things here, one, you should know that between now and November this will be a marathon, not a sprint on both sides.</p><p>WEBSTER: True.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: So you're going to see the polls change, go up and down from here until November. The second thing to remember is that the enthusiasm gap favors the Democrats as well as history. It is very uncommon for the party in charge to keep their charge in the midterm elections.</p><p>And the third thing that I will tell you, if you look what is happening all across the country, in special elections whether State House seats, Alabama, New Jersey, Virginia, even in Pennsylvania, the voters are speaking out very loudly. They are rejecting the policies of Donald Trump and the Republican Party. I think the Republicans have a big issue in November and what no poll will be able to tell you this point is the massive enthusiasm we've seen from the Women's March movement just a few months ago in Washington as well as these young people all across the country who are organizing.</p><p>WEBSTER: Antjuan, let me just follow up very quickly. Matt mentioned the economy. The tax reform has put up more money in a lot of people's pockets and the economy for all intents and purposes is doing very well. If you hang your hat on the economy, how are you going to make that argument?</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Well, I think the economy will be just one issue that voters will decide on. But here's the thing to remember about the economy, there is a reason why the Republican Party did not run one single ad in Pennsylvania about their tax scam that they passed a few months ago because the voters do not agree what happened.</p><p>Look, that bonus they received in their check, I'm not saying it's not a good thing but it was a shot in the arm. What want people are raise in wages that will sustain them long term and improve their quality of life, and middle class families over the long term will not see that from the tax bill that passed a few months ago by the Republicans.</p><p>WEBSTER: Matt, let me have you respond to Antjuan. I mean, you know, yes, the bonuses were nice. They weren't crumbs but they're also seeing benefits from the tax reform paying lower taxes.</p><p>MACKOWIAK: No question. You have about 5 million people who received their bonus or received their wage increase because of the tax law, that's significant. You have the highest consumer confidence we've had in decades. And I can put Antjuan's mind at ease, wages are going up for first time in a decade and that's very good news.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Well they're not, Matt, according to statistics. According to statistics wages are flat.</p><p>MACKOWIAK: Antjuan, I'd be happy to send you the statistics that have come out on the last couple months that shown wages have begun rising. So the economy is improving. It's strengthening. We have 4.1 percent unemployment and historically very, very low.</p><p>And I think Republicans everyday they aren't talking about the economy as a waste. They need to talk about the economy. They need to sell the tax law. A majority of the public is now viewing it very favorably. This has a chance to save their majority even though it is very much up for grabs.</p><p>WEBSTER: Antjuan, do you think that --</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Matt, keep in mind --</p><p>WEBSTER: -- all right, go ahead.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: -- Matt, keep in mind, the one thing that you all have around your neck is President Donald Trump, the most toxic President probably in modern-day history at the top of the ticket. Look, that is not a good thing going into someone --</p><p>WEBSTER: But why is his approval rating Antjuan? Why is the President's approval rating going up?</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: -- it may be rising from the graveyard but it has not hit aboveground just yet. And keep in mind, Virginia rejected, Alabama rejected Trump, so did Pennsylvania and in districts where he carried about 20, 30 points in the last election cycle. Democrats have been winning at various levels of our government. And so, you can decide however you want to break that down, but I am telling you that something is brewing here in this country and I don't think the way will be in favor of Republicans.</p><p>WEBSTER: Very quickly, Matt. You know, if you're a candidate, do you want Donald Trump to come to your town and stamp for you and, you know, get the crowd fired up? Would you distance yourself?</p><p>MACKOWIAK: It totally depends on district and on the dynamics of the race that you're in.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>MACKOWIAK: In some districts, particularly in places like California you probably don't want the President to come in. If you're in the middle of country, in states that Trump won, if you're running for U.S. Senate in North Dakota or West Virginia or Montana, the President can be very helpful. So, they're going to have to be strategic on how they deploy him next fall.</p><p>There's no question, his improvement has been narrowly increasing. He's in the middle of 30s last year. It's in the low 40s now. They needed to get in the mid-40s by the midterms. They'll have a chance to hold the House and that's very important.</p><p>WEBSTER: Guys, we have to leave it right there. You know, bottom line is a day is a long time in politics. So, there is a long time between now and November.</p><p>MACKOWIAK: A marathon, not a sprint.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right. Matt and Antjuan, great stuff as always. Thank you both for joining us today.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Thank you.</p><p>MACKOWIAK: Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER: Coming up next, we got preview of tonight's new episodes of the \"Strange Inheritance,\" including a son of a NASA chaplain who inherits more than a 100 Bibles that went to the moon. I kid you not. Stay with us. We're back in two.</p><p>WEBSTER: Monday night on Fox Business are getting a just little bit stranger. Strange Inheritance is back tonight with two new episodes, one, involving some Bibles that went all the way to the moon. I kid you not. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGINNING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMIE COLBY, HOST, \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\": It's a small postage stamp. What's on there?</p><p>JONATHAN STOUT: That's the entire Bible.</p><p>COLBY: On one little tiny microfiche?</p><p>STOUT: On each sheet.</p><p>COLBY: When it's magnified under a microscope, sure enough there is the Holy Scripture.</p><p>STOUT: That was my dad's dream, to get the Bible to the moon.</p><p>COLBY: Wait, your inheritance is this little teeny-tiny Bibles went to the moon?</p><p>COLBY: Yes, it did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER: You know, it's fascinating. Joining me now in the studio to chat about all of the Strange Inheritance stamp, and it is fascinating, is the host, Jamie Colby.</p><p>Jamie, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>COLBY: Absolutely, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER: Define Bible.</p><p>COLBY: Did you know I did not know Bibles went to the moon.</p><p>WEBSTER: No.</p><p>COLBY: But Reverend Stout was.</p><p>WEBSTER: And they came back. They weren't left there for someone to read.</p><p>COLBY: Well, it took several attempts to get them there successfully to be on the lunar surface. He was really determined. He was NASA engineer who happened to be at Reverend and he decided this is something he wanted to do.</p><p>So, Edgar Mitchell was the astronaut that actually took it as part of his personal items, hundreds of them, because they were that small. I don't even know how many people remember microfiche but I read and the entire Bible was there.</p><p>WEBSTER: I'm old enough to remember microfiche at the library, you know, you go through.</p><p>COLBY: But here's the problem. You want to know what their worst because this is a business channel.</p><p>WEBSTER: Always.</p><p>COLBY: They are so valuable. The individual ones have sold anywhere from 10,000 to 70,000.</p><p>WEBSTER: You are kidding.</p><p>COLBY: He has several hundred of them but there wasn't a will and even though when there's a will there's a way. When there's no will it's get very complicated on Strange Inheritance.</p><p>So, tonight, you'll meet the family. You'll also meet an author, Carol Mersch, who did some investigation and story on the Bibles with Reverend and she says, the Bibles belonged to her.</p><p>WEBSTER: Interesting.</p><p>COLBY: It's a little messy.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. That's the best you say.</p><p>COLBY: The good book on demand.</p><p>WEBSTER: When it comes with the territory, when you're talking about things that are, you know, left behind, if the ownership part is not clear it can get, well, down right ugly at times. Anyway, --</p><p>COLBY: In Texas, they're good people. They're going to work it out.</p><p>WEBSTER: -- of course they will. Now, also, there's another topic you're getting into involving race cars.</p><p>COLBY: Rave up you engine because --</p><p>WEBSTER: Best car?</p><p>COLBY: -- this family, actually the father, Mickey Thompson, broke the land speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats on what he called the Challenger. It's a piston-driven engine that goes 400 plus miles.</p><p>WEBSTER: Look at that. Oh my God!</p><p>COLBY: Wait till you see me in it. But anyway I degrease that so much fun. I could almost knock it out. It's so high speed.</p><p>WEBSTER: You still be in and out.</p><p>COLBY: It was amazing. So, Danny is his son and he was determined to break his dad's land speed record because for all the years his father told him, no racing, it's dangerous.</p><p>WEBSTER: Oh, my God. Yes.</p><p>COLBY: The last thing his father said to him is I'm giving you the Challenger. I want you to race it and now, he's determined to make sure that the Thompson family keeps that record.</p><p>WEBSTER: Fascinating. The air tonight beginning at?</p><p>COLBY: 9:00 to 9:30.</p><p>WEBSTER: 9:00 to 9:30.</p><p>COLBY: Come on over.</p><p>WEBSTER: I'd love it. I want to try that car, break the land speed record or may be not. At least you got of it, that's the main thing.</p><p>COLBY: Wear your seatbelt, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, always. Jamie, thank you very much.</p><p>Let's take a look at the market for you. What a day. We said it's a Jamie Colby effect. It was going to hit 600 points, nearly Jamie. Good. We're up 564 points.</p><p>Liz Claman, by the way, is back from, I think, she went skiing. I think she went old fancy and went out west to go skiing.</p><p>We saw some picture, Liz. You looked terrific out there. And you're into friend. I think you ride into Peter Toughman (ph)</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: Can you believe that.</p><p>WEBSTER: Of all of people, I mean, it's a small world because Peter Toughman works down at the New York Exchange. He's the guy with that crazy hair and the glasses. And he's taking picture when the markets doing crazy thing.</p><p>CLAMAN: He is the most photographed trader on the floor of the New York Stock. We're going to find that picture up the Twitter feed.</p><p>WEBSTER: We do. It's great to have you back.</p><p>LIZ: But I can tell you, he wasn't wearing a helmet.</p><p>WEBSTER: What?</p><p>CLAMAN: Bad, Peter, bad. That's how I recognize him because out there with his hair.</p><p>WEBSTER: Funny. He looks funny in a helmet.

Yes, they'll  send a car right over to take him down there, I think.  Neil Cavuto.   Thanks, Neil.  Appreciate it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAVUTO:  All right, bud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WEBSTER:  Breaking right now, stocks are soaring after new reports suggest  that the White House is quietly negotiating with China as both sides tried  to avoid an all-out trade war.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, everybody.  I'm Ashley Webster, in today for Trish Regan.  And  welcome, everyone, to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>Well, investors are encourage by the prospect of the world's two largest  economies reaching the deal on trade as stocks bounce back from their worst  week in more than two years and optimism apparently spreading beyond Wall  Street.  Here is Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin speaking to Fox News just  yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  I think we're working on a pathway to  see if we can reach an agreement as to what fair trade is for them to open  up their markets, reduce their tariffs, stop force-technology transfer.   These are all the things we want to do.  But in a negotiation, you have to  be prepared to take action and that's what President Trump is doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER:  He certainly is.  The President displaying his confidence in our  economy in a tweet this morning saying, \"The economy is looking really  good.  It has been years that we have seen these kind of numbers.  The  underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.\"  And we'll  find out ow those companies are doing, of course, next month with the  latest round of earnings.</p><p>Joining me now Forbes Media Chairman, the man himself, Steve Forbes.  And,  Steve, thank you very much for joining us today in the studio.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  OK.  Let's just pick up from what the President said, are you  happy with the U.S. economy heading in the right direction.  Is it healthy?</p><p>FORBES:  I think it is healthy.  And I think there were news coming out  about negotiating with China and these trade disputes is a good thing  because one of the things this imposition of tariffs would have done is  create uncertainty.  Is this thing going to spin out of control?</p><p>On the steel side for Japan and China is now been exempted to further  negotiations.  On the Chinese side, working behind the scenes see what can  be done.  So I think the markets and investors will be reassured, OK, we  can invest.  They're not going to let this thing spin out of control.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Even though, let's be honest, the way its approach is a little  chaotic.  The Trump administration and it was on this campaign promise  list, if you like, so it's not a big surprise but it really did shake the  markets.  But is this, in your opinion, a classic Donald Trump maneuver?   Shoot very high, come out strong, and then bring someone to the table and  negotiate perhaps something a little lower?</p><p>FORBES:  Well, I think, that it would have been better for him and for the  economy and investing confidence if they had first, especially with China,  negotiated with our European allies, saying we know there are abusers.  Our  allies know there are abusers.  We're going to present the United Front.</p><p>Here's what we're going to put on the table.  So, you've done that kind of  preparation, one, the market wouldn't have freaked out and, two, everyone  would have acknowledged, yes, this thing has to be addressed.</p><p>WEBSTER:  These market actions are remarkable.  I was on the 3:00 show last  week when we had a 400 point drop and a 700 point drop.  Here we go again,  the volatility is back.  Everything seems now is headline driven.  Is that  going to be the way for awhile now, do you believe?</p><p>FORBES:  Well, this is going to depend on what you've referred to early.   These earnings are starting to come out next month.  But it looks like  Corporate America is starting to still turning in good profits.</p><p>People say, OK, things are still being done, things are moving ahead.   Heck, there was even a story this weekend about \"Brexit\" in Britain.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  But for all the hoopla in parliament and the disarray and the  ineffective prime minister, things are happening in the economy.  It's  amazing.  Government leaves it alone.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Despite everything.</p><p>FORBES:  People do things.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, it's interesting.  How much attention does the market or  investors pay to what's going on in Washington, because every day there's  some headline coming out, whether it's the President's personal lawyer  quits or whatever it'd be the story de jure.  Does that have an impact on  the markets?  Are people able to put the noise aside?</p><p>FORBES:  Most of the noise they put aside, as we've seen with the markets  reaction to recently, when concerns about what's going to happen on the  trade front came to the forefront.  That's when markets thought, my golly,  are they going to let this thing spin out of control?  Are they going to  control it?  And so, they respond to that kind of news, not to the latest  thing on \"60 Minutes\" or anything else.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I know.  That's not even news as far I can see it.  But anyway,  we'll move on.</p><p>I have to ask you about Facebook, because in light of the 444 point gain  today on Wall Street, it's been striking what we've seen with the selling  on Facebook and the hits it continues to take today.  We found out the  Federal Trade Commission has begun the investigation.  Do you have a  Facebook page?</p><p>FORBES:  I do and even own a few shares of Facebook.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  What's your take on all of this?</p><p>FORBES:  But I think it's a case where management has flubbed the ball.   This thing could have been contained from the beginning, be upfront about  it.  Outline what you're going to do to prevent abuses by users.</p><p>Yes, the users violated the contract.  But what follow-up did you have?   What kind of auditing did you have?</p><p>Reassure that you're on top of the things, instead of look like you're  floundering, you don't know what to do.  You want to go on apology tour.   That freaks people out that you're not in charge.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Is this redeemable at this stage because it's a very good chance  to, as Neil Cavuto said, look, he's going to be down in Washington  testifying?</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and that's like I have an offer you can't refuse kind of  invitation.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  That's going to be critical because that will determine the fate  of the stocks in the months ahead, if he goes before the committee and  says, here's what happened, here's what we're outlining doing.  We think  we're on top of this thing, present a role that he is in charge and  reassuring and confident, instead of floundering.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We haven't seen it so far.</p><p>FORBES:  We haven't seen it, but this is his chance to do it.  I hope he is  prepping for this thing in a way people say, OK, the government is not  going to really move in a big way because if the government moves in, that  stock is going to be killed.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It is.  And we're talking about new regulations which could  further crimp the business model of Facebook and other social media  companies.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and not only Facebook but it means they're going to end up  gumming up a lot of other high-tech companies and high-tech start-ups.  We  don't have the resources to fight this kind thing.  So a lot is on his  shoulder.  I hope the shoulders are broad --</p><p>WEBSTER:  But don't blow it as they say, Steve.</p><p>FORBES:  -- well, he brought it on.</p><p>WEBSTER:  He did, that's very true.  Steve, thank you very much.  Great  stuff as always.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  For more on these markets, let's bring in the Stock Swoosh  Founder, Melissa Armo, along with Surevest Wealth Management CEO, Rob Luna.</p><p>Melissa, let me get to you.  What's your take on the markets right now?   You need some Pepto-Bismol, don't you?  We had a big selloff last week and  now here were are up 443 points.  Is pretty much this volatility here to  stay?</p><p>MELISSA ARMO, THE STOCK SWOOSH:  Volatility is here to stay.  Came in in  2018.  I don't think it's going anywhere.</p><p>I really didn't look today as a strong day.  I know we gapped up a lot this  morning.  But overall, this is just kind of like a dead-cat bounce, it's  something that traders use the terminology.</p><p>I really think we might still be lower, because the fact is that overall  the market is strong but everything that happens, every headline that comes  out, every news thing, the market is reacting very volatile to it, selling  off quickly and then bouncing again and selling off quickly.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>ARMO:  And the range is broadening.  We're still strong but the range from  the high to where we're at in this base is like wide, it's getting wider  and wider and wider.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, it's interesting because, Rob, you say, look, we are  trading in a range but to Melissa's point, that range is like the size of  the Grand Canyon right now.</p><p>ROB LUNA, CEO, SUREVEST WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Well, it's like the size of the  Grand Canyon.  If you look at the minuscule ranges that we're trading in  over the prior 18 to 24 months but I think, you know, in general, there's  11 to 12 percentage point range that we're trading in, you know, quiet  honestly, Ashley, is normal.  And we got up towards the end at the top of  that range, all this headline risk, whether it's tariffs, it's raising  interest rates, the market is looking for reason to sell.  It got it, now  we're back towards the bottom in this range.</p><p>And what you're seeing is, as we hit the 200-day moving average support,  buyers are starting to come back in this morning.  But I look at that last  hour, the last hour is going to be very telling to see if we can hold up  today.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Good luck predicting where it's going go.  Let me follow-up  with you then, Rob.  You say, look, as far as where the economy goes it's  all flashing green.</p><p>We just spoke with Steve Forbes.  He agrees the economy is doing well.  We  get the earnings next month, assuming they're pretty solid, how important  is that for this market?</p><p>LUNA:  I think it's extremely important, right, because there is a lot of  headline risk out there.  Right now, investors are definitely nervous.  So  they need this reassurance from Wall Street, from the companies, from the  CEOs out there telling them the things are still good.  And I think if that  happens, we can head back towards the top of that range, and like we said,  that could be eight to 10 percentage-point move.  So, if you're an investor  you don't necessarily would be on the sidelines and miss out on that.</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  Melissa, I spoke with a Money manager this  morning who said, look, I'm looking for a sector that has the least  downside, the most upside.  And I'm thinking, well, yes, we're all doing  that, right?  He said that sector was energy is being beaten down too much  and has a long way to go on the upside.  What do you say?</p><p>ARMO:  I don't agree with that.  I like the idea of banks strengths.  So  right now, the strongest things out there are banks and the tech sector  except for Facebook.  Take Facebook out of that equation, which is  unfortunate.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>ARMO:  But someone like Amazon, Netflix, Apple, I still like Google still  looks good and the banks, J.P. Morgan Chase.  I mean, I still think that  you buy strong stocks.  They're coming in, weak though.  Don't buy yet.   Wait until they're showing strength for about a week, two weeks.</p><p>You want to see consecutive green, green days just like we follow-through  and rally today and all next week into the start of April, that will be a  good time, come second-quarter earnings season to start getting back into  the strong stuff.  I don't want to buy stuff that's weak, that's down a  lot, that has a huge upside.  I want to buy stuff that's proving, that is  strong even when the market was falling last week.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  And, Rob, you know, that has been the tech stocks.  A lot  of money has gone into tech over the last 18 months and beyond.  Is that  still the leading sector, these big tech companies, or are you seeing money  go elsewhere?</p><p>LUNA:  Yes, you know, I think so, Ashley.  You know, really if you were  looking at rising interest rates right now, the only way that your  portfolio is going to be able to combat that is through growth.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LUNA:  And it's very tough to get top-line growth outside of technology  right now.  The financials could definitely do it but, you know, they're  actually been struggling here quite a bit.  So, I'm a little bit nervous  about what's going on with them.</p><p>But the old technology stocks, Amazon, Google, two of our top, you know,  largest holdings right now, we're continuing to stick with them.  And, I  agree, momentum is where you want to be but I don't know that you  necessarily wait for them to completely break out.  Use this opportunity  when they're pulling back technically to enter into positions.  And, you  know, 10 percent to 15 percent from where they were at before is a pretty  attractive entry point in our view.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Melissa, I want to ask you the same question I asked Steve  Forbes.  Do you think all the noise is coming out of Washington that at  this point investors pay much attention or does it have an impact on the  market?</p><p>ARMO:  Of course, it does have an impact on the market.  All you have to do  is look last week or even look back the February.  It's unfortunate because  I think the market is going to shake all of this off.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>ARMO:  But you can't ignore it.  We live in 24 hour, seven day week news  cycle.  Every time you get up, you see this thing, that thing, the other  thing.  Mr. Forbes is talking about \"60 Minutes,\" I mean even something  like that could affected the market this morning.</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's true.</p><p>ARMO:  You can't escape it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Rob, what do you tell to your clients?  Ignore it, just  focus on fundamentals of these companies?</p><p>LUNA:  Yes, that's exactly it.  I mean, when you look at this whole noise  about the trade tariffs, we have $375 billion deficit right now.  You know,  what was on the table is only $60 billion.  These are not huge numbers  right now.</p><p>And let's face it, Trump is not going to get any, you know, style points  for finesse here.  This is his negotiation style.</p><p>WEBSTER:  No.</p><p>LUNA:  He's trying to get China to the table.  I think it's a lot of noise  right now and investors should just pay attention to the fundamentals.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Wise words indeed from both of you.  Melissa, Rob, thanks you  very much for joining us today.</p><p>ARMO:  Thanks.</p><p>LUNA:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  The Dow up, by the way, 500 points above 24,000.  One of those  days.</p><p>Well, indeed, there may be a rally on Wall Street but shares of Facebook  taking another hit after the FTC says it is investigating the company.  Can  Mark Zuckerberg fix this mess?  Our panel discusses it next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Facebook start taking another leg down after the Federal Trade  Commission announced it was investigating Facebook's privacy practices.   Plus, 37 states attorneys general want to know when Facebook actually knew  about that massive data breach.  And the Senate Judiciary Committee goes on  and on, doesn't it, as invited, I say invited, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and  other tech leaders to testify April 10th, an offer they can't refuse as  someone put it.</p><p>And yes, the headaches keep coming.  A new report claims that Facebook logs  all your calls and texts, it is.  And you probably have no idea that's  happening either.</p><p>Joining me now to talk about this \"Wall Street Journal\" Senior Reporter,  Shelby Holliday, and our very own, Deirdre Bolton.  Thank you both for  being here.</p><p>Shelby, let me begin with you.  I don't know if you heard what Steve Forbes  had to say but he basically said, Mark Zuckerberg dropped the ball on this  and has to really be very careful this time on how he approaches it from  now on.  He has to instill confidence and he has to get it right.  What  we've seen up to now doesn't necessarily suggest he's able to do that.</p><p>SHELBY HOLLIDAY,  SENIOR REPORTER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  He's got to  be honest because there are number of issues Facebook is dealing with right  now, whether it's Russian meddling, Cambridge Analytica use of data, the  cellphone and messages scraping if you will.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  But the underlying theme for all of this is that users were not  aware their data was being used against them.  So now there's a lot of  outrage.  People are pledging to quit Facebook.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  They're calling for answers.  You're hearing lawmakers really  wanting the CEOs to get on the Hill and answer some of these questions.   But Mark Zuckerberg is still continuing to sort of let this drip instead of  just getting all the answers out there, confronting all of the problems  they have and, quite frankly, being honest with all of the users, the two  billion users Facebook has.</p><p>A lot of them when I talk to them, and I'm doing my reporting, still have  no idea that they followed Russian accounts.  So they're getting it from  journalists, rather than the company itself.</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  And Deirdre, you know, we hear today the  FTC is getting involved.  What could that mean?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  So that's like we're going to be --  one of the bigger questions is shall we -- you know, they had an agreement  going back to 2011.  So we should just say this is not the first time that  the FTC and Facebook have sat down together.  This is actually Facebook's  second strike at that with the FTC.</p><p>So in 2011, they had an agreement about privacy, about use of data that  Facebook agreed to.  So I think one of the questions that Facebook is now  going to have to answer is, did they follow the guidelines that they said  they would in 2011?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  If it's found not, just start tacking on millions of dollars in  fees, without even talking about potential regulation.  But it's just  actually literally going to cost them.  So I think that's going to be one  of the bigger questions.</p><p>I know with the android, so-called scraping.  I actually spoke with  somebody who said Facebook in legal thing, oh, but users did have the opt  out.  So once again, it's always the own us is on the user and we just  keeping reminding ourselves, right, authors or media is you're not paying  for the products, you are the product.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  So there is a bit of a buyer beware, which I think the Facebook  legal side is going to try its best to argue.  But I think long story  short, honestly, this just opens the doors, as you said, invited to D.C.  are now Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, of course, for Twitter and Larry Page  for Google.  So I think, you know, what are these companies doing, how are  they protecting our data?  That's why the FTC is involved.</p><p>And you have spoken often with Scott Galloway, who's a professor at NYU --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  -- who actually believes there will be a call to break up big  tech.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  And he just wrote a book about this saying, it's going to come  from Europe, because as he points out, Europe has all of the downside and  none of the upside of big tech.  Whereas, at least, we, in our country can  brag like, oh, these are great businesses, we grow it here but Europe has  none of that.  They just have the downside.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, they just rely on finding the big American companies as part  of their budget.</p><p>BOLTON:  Right, yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Shelby, let me ask you, should there be a presumption of privacy  when you're posting on something that's so public as Facebook?</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  That's a good question.  You know, I think, throughout this  debate what's getting lost is that users do have responsibility.  We share  TMI, to much information, all the time.  So I definitely think if nothing  else alerts people to the fact that their data is being used and they're  sharing perhaps --</p><p>BORTON:  Cambridge Analytica is saying, though, it was like quiz, though --</p><p>WEBSTER:  It was.</p><p>BOLTON:  -- and was like a personality profile.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  -- when you took this quiz years ago you had no idea it would  come back to be served in your face in a political sense.  And I think --  someone I spoke to last week made a really great point.  Democracy is sort  of built on this idea of open ideas, open debate.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  And when you're sending targeted messages to people that no one  knows what they say, no one knows how they might be manipulated there's no  way for candidates or companies to refute these claims.  They don't know  what's being sent.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I get the sense.  We have to wrap this up.  But I get the sense  with Facebook is they really don't have any idea how much of your  information is out there as we speak.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  No clue.  And Zuckerberg is actually admitted that.</p><p>BOLTON:  I think they built a machine that they can't manage.  It's two  billion users.  It's too big even for them.</p><p>And you recall after our scandal, right, in the run-up to the U.S.  Presidential election, 125 million U.S. voters saw that data.  They hired  1000 editors, 1000 editors with two billion users?  That proportion needs  to be up.  But then it cuts into profit margins if you're going to hire  more humans.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It's going to be very interesting.  And we're going to be talking  about it for a while.  Great stuff.  Shelby, Deirdre, thank you so much.   Appreciate it.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  President Trump, well, he's getting tough on Russia.  The  President ordering 60 Russian diplomats to pack their bags and get out of  the U.S.  It's in retaliation for the toxic nerve agent attack on a former  Russian spy and his daughter on British soil.  So what does this mean for  U.S.-Russia relations from here?  We'll talk about it next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  President Trump is expelling 60 Russian diplomats from the U.S.  and is closing a Russian consulate in Seattle.  This is in response to the  nerve agent attack on an ex-Russian spy in the U.K. earlier this month.   Now, the U.S. is joining at least 17 other countries in kicking out Russian  diplomats making it the biggest western expulsion of Russian  representatives since the height of the Cold War.  Interesting stuff.</p><p>Here now with more, Philip Wegmann.  He's a Commentary Writer for the  \"Washington Examiner.\"</p><p>Philip, do you think, do you get the sense that Vladmir Putin  underestimated the response to this nerve agent attack in Britain?  What is  going through in his mind right now?</p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, COMMENTARY WRITER, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  Well if Putin  underestimated the response to that attack, he certainly understands the  message that the Trump administration is sending right now.  Remember,  Putin is an old KGB hand and he is not going to miss the significance of  the Trump administration kicking out 60 Russian diplomats and also closing  that consulate in Seattle.</p><p>The message here is clear.  It's that Russian cannot expect to manhandle  our allies and get away with it.  You can't perform these extra judicial  executions on our allies' foreign soil.  And, I think, we're just going to  turn a blind eye.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But is it symbolic?  I mean, what impact does it really have?   Sixty Russian diplomats and representatives go back to Moscow.  Does it put  a serious dent in the intelligence-gathering network?</p><p>WEGMANN:  Absolutely.  If you look at those diplomats, there were 60 of  them and they were in Seattle, Washington, close to not only some of our  sub-bases but also close to Boeing Manufacturing.  So for us to push them  out, that is significant blow to their intelligence gathering network.</p><p>And I think that what the Trump administration needs to do right now is  they need to follow-up this strong action with strong words from the  President.  He needs to show that he's serious about this threat, because,  frankly, a lot of people still don't know that this President now, by  expelling those 60 Russian agents, has sent more Russians out of the  country than President Obama did after the election with regard to the  election meddling.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  So we're fully expecting a tit-for-tat.  We've seen the  Russians do that with the U.K. when the U.K. kicked out 23 diplomats, same  thing happened in Moscow.  Probably the same thing is going to happen in  the U.S.  Does that not hurt our intelligence-gathering abilities in  Russia?</p><p>WEGMANN:  Well, you're absolutely right.  Already the Russian embassy is  tweeting this morning somewhat tongue-in-cheek, where and which consulates  should be kicked out of Russia.  You know, which of our agents should get  the boot.  And I think that because this is so pointed and this definitely  is a blow at Russian intelligence, that Putin and company, they are going  to strike back hard but the Trump administration has shown resolve, steel  in this area.  And now that John Bolton is joining the administration,  someone who is a Russia hawk, I think we're going to see a much stronger  response from the White House.</p><p>WEBSTER:  How could have -- assuming this went all the way to Mr. Putin and  he gave the OK for this, and we don't know that for sure, but it certainly  appears that way, what was he trying to achieve?  He had to know that  something like this so brazen would have consequences.</p><p>WEGMANN:  Well, the Russians are always trying to push the envelope and  they're also very symbolic in the way that they carryout these executions.   If you look at the type of nerve agent that was used, that was a clear  calling card because that is an agent that was manufactured specifically in  Russia.  So he had to know there were these insidious bread crumbs that  were going to lead back to the Kremlin.</p><p>I think what we're seeing here is that after the 2016 election, Putin is  trying to feel out what he can do, how hard he can go after the United  States.  What we're seeing here is that Trump at least, with this reaction  is showing that we are not going to back down from the world stage.  That  we are going to stand strong in our relations with some of our longest  standing allies.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I have to leave it right there.  It'd be fascinating to follow  what happens next.  Philip, thank you so much for joining us.  Appreciate  it and thanks for your comments.</p><p>We are, of course, keeping a close eye on the markets for years.  Stocks  rally over trade talks, not a trade war.  The market up 556 points now on  the Dow, up at 24,083.</p><p>Also ahead, the court battle is underway to decide the fate of the AT&amp;T  merger with Time Warner.  Right now, top broadcasting executives are  testifying on what this merger would mean for them.  We'll have the intel  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Witnesses are taken the stand today as the Department of Justice  tries to block a potential multibillion dollar deal between AT&amp;T and Time  Warner.  Joining me from the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., is  our very own Connell McShane with the latest.</p><p>Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey there, Ashley.  Well, the  court is just about to resume, to be back in session, coming back from one  of your favorite activities, an extended lunch break which the judge took  and for him the judge in this case, Richard Leon, this is a working lunch.   It's kind of a strange morning.</p><p>We're waiting to hear from these two key executives in the cable industry.   One of these guys named Warren Schlichting, a head of a Sling T.V., a DISH  Network and the other is John Martin, the Chairman of CEO at Turner.</p><p>As the government tries to build this antitrust case and tries to block  this merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, I say it's a strange morning because  what happened to us, just before the Department of Justice was to call its  first witness of the day, the government lawyer asked the judge to approach  the bench.  And then for two hours, all the lawyers and the judge were  talking.</p><p>Now, we're in the courtroom, we couldn't hear what they were saying so we  don't know exactly what the issues were but we were told by judge, Leon,  that some issues did come up and he had a number of e-mails to review.  So  he said let's take a longer break than usual.  I'll review those e-mails  and I'll come back and have some rulings and maybe we can proceed in the  afternoon.  So we'll see if we get that testimony.  It could be important.</p><p>Just to get you up to speed, Ashley, in where we are.  In this last week,  the Justice Department started to make its case.  Its basic case is that if  these companies are allowed to combine, AT&amp;T and Time Warner, it would be  unfair and consumers would pay the price.  They'd paid higher prices that  AT&amp;T would be able to kind of weaponize Time Warner to use the Justice  Department's terms there and takes its networks HBO, and CNN, TNT, TBS to  be able to leverage those with DirecTV service and increase prices.</p><p>The companies are comeback and argued that the Justice Department's case is  fundamentally stuck in the past.  They say the game is completely changed  what to do competition from the tech companies whether the, Hulu, Netflix  and the likes.  So we're just getting started here, what could be a six to  eight week trial.  We'll see what this afternoon brings.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So a lot of talking so far today, Connell, and you couldn't hear  one word of it?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Great stuff.  All right.  It's going to be a long six weeks, my  friend.  Enjoy those working lunches.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I know.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, Connell McShane down in D.C. on the latest development  in AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger case.</p><p>Stops our rallying as investors cheer on reports of trade negotiations,  nice press negotiations between the U.S. and China.  Let's go to the floor  of the New York Stock Exchange, where our very own Nicole Petallides has  the latest.</p><p>Big sell-off last week?  We're up 545 points.  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  That's right.  So cooler  heads prevailed for today but big picture, people think of the hard time  committing to that is going to be a great 2018 because there are so many  factors up in the air, they're looking at technicals.</p><p>Right now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 545 points, the S&amp;P 500 is  up, 2.1 percent.  Third day in a row of two percent move.  Thursday, Friday  down two percent each of those days and today up two percent.  So the  volatility is here.</p><p>Tech, we have this interesting dichotomy, fang, right?  Facebook being the  F.  There's seems to be a separation on this one.  In fact, some people are  even wondering is fang over because Facebook under pressure again, down 1.5  percent for the month, down 12.2 percent as it remain under fire.</p><p>Zuckerberg actually has been invited to testify in the U.S. Senate.  You  could see that it's down 1.6 percent.  But Apple, Alphabet, Google,  Microsoft, IBM all gaining today.</p><p>Financials, this could actually did slightly worse than even the techs on  Friday.  Without financials and technology these markets have a very hard  time trying to get off the ground.  But here's on what's J.P. Morgan,  Morgan Stanley, Goldman, all up more than three percent.  And Katie W. (ph)  put out a note today saying that they say mergers and acquisitions ahead,  and particularly for J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs being the acquirers.</p><p>Last but not least, a quick look at defense stocks as we know that the  President and assigning in new obviously military spending a massive a  boost to this group on Friday.  You can see here, Lockheed, Northrop,  Bowman, General Dynamics all up more than two percent each.  So that trend  continues.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Lots of green arrows.  Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p>Meanwhile, one of the oldest gunmakers in the U.S. is filing for  bankruptcy.  Remington Arms is restructuring its massive debt after a 30  percent drop in gun sales this year.  The filing will allow the 200-year- old company to stay in business while reducing its debt by $700 million.   It will, by the way, continue to make guns during the bankruptcy  proceedings.</p><p>And Elon Musk's boring company, and I don't mean boring as dull, I mean the  one that makes tunnels in the ground is going to sell Lego-like bricks made  from tunneling rock.  The life-sized interlocking blocks will be used to  build low-cost homes and other structures.  Those bricks will be  lightweight and durable, making them easy to assemble, Lego bricks.</p><p>Obamacare premiums are set to go up right before the midterm elections in  November.  We'll have the intel on what this could mean for both parties in  the midterms next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Health care premiums are expected to go up yet again right before  the midterm elections in November.  Now this after a battle in Congress  failed to include in last week's massive spending bill a plan to shore up  the health insurance exchanges.  No subsidies.  And without the government  money, insurance companies, well you know what they're going to do?   They're going to raise rates, right?</p><p>Gerri Willis joins us live from the newsroom with the latest on this.   Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Well, Ash, you've got that story  right.  Estimates of just how much premiums could rise, according to the  Congressional Budget Office, some 10 percent for a popular middle priced  option on the insurance exchanges and, you know, that doesn't even include  the hike to premiums that will likely occur as the mandate fades away.</p><p>Now, lawmakers on both sides are pointing fingers, Democrats blame the GOP  for failure in negotiations saying they demanded abortion restrictions  being included something they knew would be unacceptable to Democrats.  And  Republicans say this that they negotiated in good faith and Democrats  rejected reasonable rules on abortion.  Either way, the impasse means money  to shore up the Obamacare insurance exchanges was omitted from the $1.3  trillion spending plan that the President signed last week.</p><p>Failing to shore up, the exchanges could have big repercussions at the  ballot box.  A recent poll in Pennsylvania showed health care was a top  issue for 52 percent of voters according to Public Policy Polling.</p><p>Payments to insurers were stopped last year after President Trump said they  were illegal because the money had not been appropriated by Congress.   Meanwhile, insiders say that passage of legislation to stabilize the  exchanges, highly unlikely.</p><p>Ash, back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Interesting stuff.  The bottom line is those rates go up.  Gerri,  thank you very much.</p><p>Health care is expected to be one of the top issues for this year's midterm  elections.  Topping the latest \"Q-poll\" as the number one issue and poll  show that most voters feel Democrats would handle health care better, but a  new Fox poll shows the Democrats lead in the midterms is actually slipping  to just five points.  Interesting.</p><p>Joining me now, Former Bush Administration Aide, Matt Mackowiak, and  Democratic Strategist, Antjuan Seawright.  Thank you both for being here.</p><p>Matt, let me begin with you.  You could argue that health care continues to  be a problem and it was failure of the Republicans who have the House in  Senate and Oval Office to get this thing sorted out.  How would you  respond? </p><p>MATT MACKOWIAK, FORMER BUSH ADMINISTRATION AIDE:  Yes, there's no question  that Republicans promised to repeal and replace Obamacare.  The House took  two attempts and got it done.  The Senate took two attempts and failed by  one vote and so Republican voters have some frustration about that, there's  no question.  But that's going to be one be one issue the midterms are  going to be about.  They're going to be about economy, they're going to be  about direction of the country and they're ultimately going to be about the  candidates that running on both sides, you know, in each district.</p><p>The generic ballot is helpful directionally.  But ultimately every  individual race comes down to that district, comes down to the candidates  that are running, the campaigns they're running.  We saw that in  Pennsylvania 18 where the Democratic candidate ran as pro-gun, personally  anti-abortion, Democratic candidate.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  And that's not what you're going to see in a lot of other races  around the country.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Antjuan, let me ask you.  Why do you think the gap is closing in  the polls?  What do you put that down to?</p><p>ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, a couple of things here,  one, you should know that between now and November this will be a marathon,  not a sprint on both sides.</p><p>WEBSTER:  True.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  So you're going to see the polls change, go up and down from  here until November.  The second thing to remember is that the enthusiasm  gap favors the Democrats as well as history.  It is very uncommon for the  party in charge to keep their charge in the midterm elections.</p><p>And the third thing that I will tell you, if you look what is happening all  across the country, in special elections whether State House seats,  Alabama, New Jersey, Virginia, even in Pennsylvania, the voters are  speaking out very loudly.  They are rejecting the policies of Donald Trump  and the Republican Party.  I think the Republicans have a big issue in  November and what no poll will be able to tell you this point is the  massive enthusiasm we've seen from the Women's March movement just a few  months ago in Washington as well as these young people all across the  country who are organizing.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Antjuan, let me just follow up very quickly.  Matt mentioned the  economy.  The tax reform has put up more money in a lot of people's pockets  and the economy for all intents and purposes is doing very well.  If you  hang your hat on the economy, how are you going to make that argument?</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Well, I think the economy will be just one issue that voters  will decide on.  But here's the thing to remember about the economy, there  is a reason why the Republican Party did not run one single ad in  Pennsylvania about their tax scam that they passed a few months ago because  the voters do not agree what happened.</p><p>Look, that bonus they received in their check, I'm not saying it's not a  good thing but it was a shot in the arm.  What want people are raise in  wages that will sustain them long term and improve their quality of life,  and middle class families over the long term will not see that from the tax  bill that passed a few months ago by the Republicans.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Matt, let me have you respond to Antjuan.  I mean, you know, yes,  the bonuses were nice.  They weren't crumbs but they're also seeing  benefits from the tax reform paying lower taxes.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  No question.  You have about 5 million people who received  their bonus or received their wage increase because of the tax law, that's  significant.  You have the highest consumer confidence we've had in  decades.  And I can put Antjuan's mind at ease, wages are going up for  first time in a decade and that's very good news.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Well they're not, Matt, according to statistics.  According to  statistics wages are flat.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  Antjuan, I'd be happy to send you the statistics that have come  out on the last couple months that shown wages have begun rising.  So the  economy is improving.  It's strengthening.  We have 4.1 percent  unemployment and historically very, very low.</p><p>And I think Republicans everyday they aren't talking about the economy as a  waste.  They need to talk about the economy.  They need to sell the tax  law.  A majority of the public is now viewing it very favorably.  This has  a chance to save their majority even though it is very much up for grabs.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Antjuan, do you think that --</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Matt, keep in mind --</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- all right, go ahead.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  -- Matt, keep in mind, the one thing that you all have around  your neck is President Donald Trump, the most toxic President probably in  modern-day history at the top of the ticket.  Look, that is not a good  thing going into someone --</p><p>WEBSTER:  But why is his approval rating Antjuan?  Why is the President's  approval rating going up?</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  -- it may be rising from the graveyard but it has not hit  aboveground just yet.  And keep in mind, Virginia rejected, Alabama  rejected Trump, so did Pennsylvania and in districts where he carried about  20, 30 points in the last election cycle.  Democrats have been winning at  various levels of our government.  And so, you can decide however you want  to break that down, but I am telling you that something is brewing here in  this country and I don't think the way will be in favor of Republicans.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very quickly, Matt.  You know, if you're a candidate, do you want  Donald Trump to come to your town and stamp for you and, you know, get the  crowd fired up?  Would you distance yourself?</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  It totally depends on district and on the dynamics of the race  that you're in.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  In some districts, particularly in places like California you  probably don't want the President to come in.  If you're in the middle of  country, in states that Trump won, if you're running for U.S. Senate in  North Dakota or West Virginia or Montana, the President can be very  helpful.  So, they're going to have to be strategic on how they deploy him  next fall.</p><p>There's no question, his improvement has been narrowly increasing.  He's in  the middle of 30s last year.  It's in the low 40s now.  They needed to get  in the mid-40s by the midterms.  They'll have a chance to hold the House  and that's very important.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Guys, we have to leave it right there.  You know, bottom line is  a day is a long time in politics.  So, there is a long time between now and  November.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  A marathon, not a sprint.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Matt and Antjuan, great stuff as always.  Thank you  both for joining us today.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Thank you.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Coming up next, we got preview of tonight's new episodes of the  \"Strange Inheritance,\" including a son of a NASA chaplain who inherits more  than a 100 Bibles that went to the moon.  I kid you not.  Stay with us.   We're back in two.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Monday night on Fox Business are getting a just little bit  stranger.  Strange Inheritance is back tonight with two new episodes, one,  involving some Bibles that went all the way to the moon.  I kid you not.   Take a look.</p><p>(BEGINNING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMIE COLBY, HOST, \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\":  It's a small postage stamp.   What's on there?</p><p>JONATHAN STOUT:  That's the entire Bible.</p><p>COLBY:  On one little tiny microfiche?</p><p>STOUT:  On each sheet.</p><p>COLBY:  When it's magnified under a microscope, sure enough there is the  Holy Scripture.</p><p>STOUT:  That was my dad's dream, to get the Bible to the moon.</p><p>COLBY:  Wait, your inheritance is this little teeny-tiny Bibles went to the  moon?</p><p>COLBY:  Yes, it did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, it's fascinating.  Joining me now in the studio to chat  about all of the Strange Inheritance stamp, and it is fascinating, is the  host, Jamie Colby.</p><p>Jamie, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>COLBY:  Absolutely, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Define Bible.</p><p>COLBY:  Did you know I did not know Bibles went to the moon.</p><p>WEBSTER:  No.</p><p>COLBY:  But Reverend Stout was.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And they came back.  They weren't left there for someone to read.</p><p>COLBY:  Well, it took several attempts to get them there successfully to be  on the lunar surface.  He was really determined.  He was NASA engineer who  happened to be at Reverend and he decided this is something he wanted to  do.</p><p>So, Edgar Mitchell was the astronaut that actually took it as part of his  personal items, hundreds of them, because they were that small.  I don't  even know how many people remember microfiche but I read and the entire  Bible was there.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I'm old enough to remember microfiche at the library, you know,  you go through.</p><p>COLBY:  But here's the problem.  You want to know what their worst because  this is a business channel.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Always.</p><p>COLBY:  They are so valuable.  The individual ones have sold anywhere from  10,000 to 70,000.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You are kidding.</p><p>COLBY:  He has several hundred of them but there wasn't a will and even  though when there's a will there's a way.  When there's no will it's get  very complicated on Strange Inheritance.</p><p>So, tonight, you'll meet the family.  You'll also meet an author, Carol  Mersch, who did some investigation and story on the Bibles with Reverend  and she says, the Bibles belonged to her.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Interesting.</p><p>COLBY:  It's a little messy.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  That's the best you say.</p><p>COLBY:  The good book on demand.</p><p>WEBSTER:  When it comes with the territory, when you're talking about  things that are, you know, left behind, if the ownership part is not clear  it can get, well, down right ugly at times.  Anyway, --</p><p>COLBY:  In Texas, they're good people.  They're going to work it out.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- of course they will.  Now, also, there's another topic you're  getting into involving race cars.</p><p>COLBY:  Rave up you engine because --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Best car?</p><p>COLBY:  -- this family, actually the father, Mickey Thompson, broke the  land speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats on what he called the  Challenger.  It's a piston-driven engine that goes 400 plus miles.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Look at that.  Oh my God!</p><p>COLBY:  Wait till you see me in it.  But anyway I degrease that so much  fun.  I could almost knock it out.  It's so high speed.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You still be in and out.</p><p>COLBY:  It was amazing.  So, Danny is his son and he was determined to  break his dad's land speed record because for all the years his father told  him, no racing, it's dangerous.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Oh, my God.  Yes.</p><p>COLBY:  The last thing his father said to him is I'm giving you the  Challenger.  I want you to race it and now, he's determined to make sure  that the Thompson family keeps that record.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Fascinating.

I want to try that car, break the land speed record  or may be not.  At least you got of it, that's the main thing.</p><p>COLBY:  Wear your seatbelt, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, always.  Jamie, thank you very much.</p><p>Let's take a look at the market for you.  What a day.  We said it's a Jamie  Colby effect.  It was going to hit 600 points, nearly Jamie.  Good.  We're  up 564 points.</p><p>Liz Claman, by the way, is back from, I think, she went skiing.  I think  she went old fancy and went out west to go skiing.</p><p>We saw some picture, Liz.  You looked terrific out there.  And you're into  friend.  I think you ride into Peter Toughman (ph) </p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Can you believe that.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Of all of people, I mean, it's a small world because Peter  Toughman works down at the New York Exchange.  He's the guy with that crazy  hair and the glasses.  And he's taking picture when the markets doing crazy  thing.</p><p>CLAMAN:  He is the most photographed trader on the floor of the New York  Stock.  We're going to find that picture up the Twitter feed.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We do.

Yes, they'll  send a car right over to take him down there, I think.  Neil Cavuto.   Thanks, Neil.  Appreciate it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAVUTO:  All right, bud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WEBSTER:  Breaking right now, stocks are soaring after new reports suggest  that the White House is quietly negotiating with China as both sides tried  to avoid an all-out trade war.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, everybody.  I'm Ashley Webster, in today for Trish Regan.  And  welcome, everyone, to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>Well, investors are encourage by the prospect of the world's two largest  economies reaching the deal on trade as stocks bounce back from their worst  week in more than two years and optimism apparently spreading beyond Wall  Street.  Here is Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin speaking to Fox News just  yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  I think we're working on a pathway to  see if we can reach an agreement as to what fair trade is for them to open  up their markets, reduce their tariffs, stop force-technology transfer.   These are all the things we want to do.  But in a negotiation, you have to  be prepared to take action and that's what President Trump is doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER:  He certainly is.  The President displaying his confidence in our  economy in a tweet this morning saying, \"The economy is looking really  good.  It has been years that we have seen these kind of numbers.  The  underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.\"  And we'll  find out ow those companies are doing, of course, next month with the  latest round of earnings.</p><p>Joining me now Forbes Media Chairman, the man himself, Steve Forbes.  And,  Steve, thank you very much for joining us today in the studio.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  OK.  Let's just pick up from what the President said, are you  happy with the U.S. economy heading in the right direction.  Is it healthy?</p><p>FORBES:  I think it is healthy.  And I think there were news coming out  about negotiating with China and these trade disputes is a good thing  because one of the things this imposition of tariffs would have done is  create uncertainty.  Is this thing going to spin out of control?</p><p>On the steel side for Japan and China is now been exempted to further  negotiations.  On the Chinese side, working behind the scenes see what can  be done.  So I think the markets and investors will be reassured, OK, we  can invest.  They're not going to let this thing spin out of control.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Even though, let's be honest, the way its approach is a little  chaotic.  The Trump administration and it was on this campaign promise  list, if you like, so it's not a big surprise but it really did shake the  markets.  But is this, in your opinion, a classic Donald Trump maneuver?   Shoot very high, come out strong, and then bring someone to the table and  negotiate perhaps something a little lower?</p><p>FORBES:  Well, I think, that it would have been better for him and for the  economy and investing confidence if they had first, especially with China,  negotiated with our European allies, saying we know there are abusers.  Our  allies know there are abusers.  We're going to present the United Front.</p><p>Here's what we're going to put on the table.  So, you've done that kind of  preparation, one, the market wouldn't have freaked out and, two, everyone  would have acknowledged, yes, this thing has to be addressed.</p><p>WEBSTER:  These market actions are remarkable.  I was on the 3:00 show last  week when we had a 400 point drop and a 700 point drop.  Here we go again,  the volatility is back.  Everything seems now is headline driven.  Is that  going to be the way for awhile now, do you believe?</p><p>FORBES:  Well, this is going to depend on what you've referred to early.   These earnings are starting to come out next month.  But it looks like  Corporate America is starting to still turning in good profits.</p><p>People say, OK, things are still being done, things are moving ahead.   Heck, there was even a story this weekend about \"Brexit\" in Britain.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  But for all the hoopla in parliament and the disarray and the  ineffective prime minister, things are happening in the economy.  It's  amazing.  Government leaves it alone.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Despite everything.</p><p>FORBES:  People do things.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, it's interesting.  How much attention does the market or  investors pay to what's going on in Washington, because every day there's  some headline coming out, whether it's the President's personal lawyer  quits or whatever it'd be the story de jure.  Does that have an impact on  the markets?  Are people able to put the noise aside?</p><p>FORBES:  Most of the noise they put aside, as we've seen with the markets  reaction to recently, when concerns about what's going to happen on the  trade front came to the forefront.  That's when markets thought, my golly,  are they going to let this thing spin out of control?  Are they going to  control it?  And so, they respond to that kind of news, not to the latest  thing on \"60 Minutes\" or anything else.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I know.  That's not even news as far I can see it.  But anyway,  we'll move on.</p><p>I have to ask you about Facebook, because in light of the 444 point gain  today on Wall Street, it's been striking what we've seen with the selling  on Facebook and the hits it continues to take today.  We found out the  Federal Trade Commission has begun the investigation.  Do you have a  Facebook page?</p><p>FORBES:  I do and even own a few shares of Facebook.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  What's your take on all of this?</p><p>FORBES:  But I think it's a case where management has flubbed the ball.   This thing could have been contained from the beginning, be upfront about  it.  Outline what you're going to do to prevent abuses by users.</p><p>Yes, the users violated the contract.  But what follow-up did you have?   What kind of auditing did you have?</p><p>Reassure that you're on top of the things, instead of look like you're  floundering, you don't know what to do.  You want to go on apology tour.   That freaks people out that you're not in charge.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Is this redeemable at this stage because it's a very good chance  to, as Neil Cavuto said, look, he's going to be down in Washington  testifying?</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and that's like I have an offer you can't refuse kind of  invitation.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  That's going to be critical because that will determine the fate  of the stocks in the months ahead, if he goes before the committee and  says, here's what happened, here's what we're outlining doing.  We think  we're on top of this thing, present a role that he is in charge and  reassuring and confident, instead of floundering.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We haven't seen it so far.</p><p>FORBES:  We haven't seen it, but this is his chance to do it.  I hope he is  prepping for this thing in a way people say, OK, the government is not  going to really move in a big way because if the government moves in, that  stock is going to be killed.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It is.  And we're talking about new regulations which could  further crimp the business model of Facebook and other social media  companies.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and not only Facebook but it means they're going to end up  gumming up a lot of other high-tech companies and high-tech start-ups.  We  don't have the resources to fight this kind thing.  So a lot is on his  shoulder.  I hope the shoulders are broad --</p><p>WEBSTER:  But don't blow it as they say, Steve.</p><p>FORBES:  -- well, he brought it on.</p><p>WEBSTER:  He did, that's very true.  Steve, thank you very much.  Great  stuff as always.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  For more on these markets, let's bring in the Stock Swoosh  Founder, Melissa Armo, along with Surevest Wealth Management CEO, Rob Luna.</p><p>Melissa, let me get to you.  What's your take on the markets right now?   You need some Pepto-Bismol, don't you?  We had a big selloff last week and  now here were are up 443 points.  Is pretty much this volatility here to  stay?</p><p>MELISSA ARMO, THE STOCK SWOOSH:  Volatility is here to stay.  Came in in  2018.  I don't think it's going anywhere.</p><p>I really didn't look today as a strong day.  I know we gapped up a lot this  morning.  But overall, this is just kind of like a dead-cat bounce, it's  something that traders use the terminology.</p><p>I really think we might still be lower, because the fact is that overall  the market is strong but everything that happens, every headline that comes  out, every news thing, the market is reacting very volatile to it, selling  off quickly and then bouncing again and selling off quickly.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>ARMO:  And the range is broadening.  We're still strong but the range from  the high to where we're at in this base is like wide, it's getting wider  and wider and wider.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, it's interesting because, Rob, you say, look, we are  trading in a range but to Melissa's point, that range is like the size of  the Grand Canyon right now.</p><p>ROB LUNA, CEO, SUREVEST WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Well, it's like the size of the  Grand Canyon.  If you look at the minuscule ranges that we're trading in  over the prior 18 to 24 months but I think, you know, in general, there's  11 to 12 percentage point range that we're trading in, you know, quiet  honestly, Ashley, is normal.  And we got up towards the end at the top of  that range, all this headline risk, whether it's tariffs, it's raising  interest rates, the market is looking for reason to sell.  It got it, now  we're back towards the bottom in this range.</p><p>And what you're seeing is, as we hit the 200-day moving average support,  buyers are starting to come back in this morning.  But I look at that last  hour, the last hour is going to be very telling to see if we can hold up  today.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Good luck predicting where it's going go.  Let me follow-up  with you then, Rob.  You say, look, as far as where the economy goes it's  all flashing green.</p><p>We just spoke with Steve Forbes.  He agrees the economy is doing well.  We  get the earnings next month, assuming they're pretty solid, how important  is that for this market?</p><p>LUNA:  I think it's extremely important, right, because there is a lot of  headline risk out there.  Right now, investors are definitely nervous.  So  they need this reassurance from Wall Street, from the companies, from the  CEOs out there telling them the things are still good.  And I think if that  happens, we can head back towards the top of that range, and like we said,  that could be eight to 10 percentage-point move.  So, if you're an investor  you don't necessarily would be on the sidelines and miss out on that.</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  Melissa, I spoke with a Money manager this  morning who said, look, I'm looking for a sector that has the least  downside, the most upside.  And I'm thinking, well, yes, we're all doing  that, right?  He said that sector was energy is being beaten down too much  and has a long way to go on the upside.  What do you say?</p><p>ARMO:  I don't agree with that.  I like the idea of banks strengths.  So  right now, the strongest things out there are banks and the tech sector  except for Facebook.  Take Facebook out of that equation, which is  unfortunate.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>ARMO:  But someone like Amazon, Netflix, Apple, I still like Google still  looks good and the banks, J.P. Morgan Chase.  I mean, I still think that  you buy strong stocks.  They're coming in, weak though.  Don't buy yet.   Wait until they're showing strength for about a week, two weeks.</p><p>You want to see consecutive green, green days just like we follow-through  and rally today and all next week into the start of April, that will be a  good time, come second-quarter earnings season to start getting back into  the strong stuff.  I don't want to buy stuff that's weak, that's down a  lot, that has a huge upside.  I want to buy stuff that's proving, that is  strong even when the market was falling last week.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  And, Rob, you know, that has been the tech stocks.  A lot  of money has gone into tech over the last 18 months and beyond.  Is that  still the leading sector, these big tech companies, or are you seeing money  go elsewhere?</p><p>LUNA:  Yes, you know, I think so, Ashley.  You know, really if you were  looking at rising interest rates right now, the only way that your  portfolio is going to be able to combat that is through growth.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LUNA:  And it's very tough to get top-line growth outside of technology  right now.  The financials could definitely do it but, you know, they're  actually been struggling here quite a bit.  So, I'm a little bit nervous  about what's going on with them.</p><p>But the old technology stocks, Amazon, Google, two of our top, you know,  largest holdings right now, we're continuing to stick with them.  And, I  agree, momentum is where you want to be but I don't know that you  necessarily wait for them to completely break out.  Use this opportunity  when they're pulling back technically to enter into positions.  And, you  know, 10 percent to 15 percent from where they were at before is a pretty  attractive entry point in our view.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Melissa, I want to ask you the same question I asked Steve  Forbes.  Do you think all the noise is coming out of Washington that at  this point investors pay much attention or does it have an impact on the  market?</p><p>ARMO:  Of course, it does have an impact on the market.  All you have to do  is look last week or even look back the February.  It's unfortunate because  I think the market is going to shake all of this off.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>ARMO:  But you can't ignore it.  We live in 24 hour, seven day week news  cycle.  Every time you get up, you see this thing, that thing, the other  thing.  Mr. Forbes is talking about \"60 Minutes,\" I mean even something  like that could affected the market this morning.</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's true.</p><p>ARMO:  You can't escape it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Rob, what do you tell to your clients?  Ignore it, just  focus on fundamentals of these companies?</p><p>LUNA:  Yes, that's exactly it.  I mean, when you look at this whole noise  about the trade tariffs, we have $375 billion deficit right now.  You know,  what was on the table is only $60 billion.  These are not huge numbers  right now.</p><p>And let's face it, Trump is not going to get any, you know, style points  for finesse here.  This is his negotiation style.</p><p>WEBSTER:  No.</p><p>LUNA:  He's trying to get China to the table.  I think it's a lot of noise  right now and investors should just pay attention to the fundamentals.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Wise words indeed from both of you.  Melissa, Rob, thanks you  very much for joining us today.</p><p>ARMO:  Thanks.</p><p>LUNA:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  The Dow up, by the way, 500 points above 24,000.  One of those  days.</p><p>Well, indeed, there may be a rally on Wall Street but shares of Facebook  taking another hit after the FTC says it is investigating the company.  Can  Mark Zuckerberg fix this mess?  Our panel discusses it next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Facebook start taking another leg down after the Federal Trade  Commission announced it was investigating Facebook's privacy practices.   Plus, 37 states attorneys general want to know when Facebook actually knew  about that massive data breach.  And the Senate Judiciary Committee goes on  and on, doesn't it, as invited, I say invited, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and  other tech leaders to testify April 10th, an offer they can't refuse as  someone put it.</p><p>And yes, the headaches keep coming.  A new report claims that Facebook logs  all your calls and texts, it is.  And you probably have no idea that's  happening either.</p><p>Joining me now to talk about this \"Wall Street Journal\" Senior Reporter,  Shelby Holliday, and our very own, Deirdre Bolton.  Thank you both for  being here.</p><p>Shelby, let me begin with you.  I don't know if you heard what Steve Forbes  had to say but he basically said, Mark Zuckerberg dropped the ball on this  and has to really be very careful this time on how he approaches it from  now on.  He has to instill confidence and he has to get it right.  What  we've seen up to now doesn't necessarily suggest he's able to do that.</p><p>SHELBY HOLLIDAY,  SENIOR REPORTER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  He's got to  be honest because there are number of issues Facebook is dealing with right  now, whether it's Russian meddling, Cambridge Analytica use of data, the  cellphone and messages scraping if you will.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  But the underlying theme for all of this is that users were not  aware their data was being used against them.  So now there's a lot of  outrage.  People are pledging to quit Facebook.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  They're calling for answers.  You're hearing lawmakers really  wanting the CEOs to get on the Hill and answer some of these questions.   But Mark Zuckerberg is still continuing to sort of let this drip instead of  just getting all the answers out there, confronting all of the problems  they have and, quite frankly, being honest with all of the users, the two  billion users Facebook has.</p><p>A lot of them when I talk to them, and I'm doing my reporting, still have  no idea that they followed Russian accounts.  So they're getting it from  journalists, rather than the company itself.</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  And Deirdre, you know, we hear today the  FTC is getting involved.  What could that mean?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  So that's like we're going to be --  one of the bigger questions is shall we -- you know, they had an agreement  going back to 2011.  So we should just say this is not the first time that  the FTC and Facebook have sat down together.  This is actually Facebook's  second strike at that with the FTC.</p><p>So in 2011, they had an agreement about privacy, about use of data that  Facebook agreed to.  So I think one of the questions that Facebook is now  going to have to answer is, did they follow the guidelines that they said  they would in 2011?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  If it's found not, just start tacking on millions of dollars in  fees, without even talking about potential regulation.  But it's just  actually literally going to cost them.  So I think that's going to be one  of the bigger questions.</p><p>I know with the android, so-called scraping.  I actually spoke with  somebody who said Facebook in legal thing, oh, but users did have the opt  out.  So once again, it's always the own us is on the user and we just  keeping reminding ourselves, right, authors or media is you're not paying  for the products, you are the product.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  So there is a bit of a buyer beware, which I think the Facebook  legal side is going to try its best to argue.  But I think long story  short, honestly, this just opens the doors, as you said, invited to D.C.  are now Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, of course, for Twitter and Larry Page  for Google.  So I think, you know, what are these companies doing, how are  they protecting our data?  That's why the FTC is involved.</p><p>And you have spoken often with Scott Galloway, who's a professor at NYU --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  -- who actually believes there will be a call to break up big  tech.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  And he just wrote a book about this saying, it's going to come  from Europe, because as he points out, Europe has all of the downside and  none of the upside of big tech.  Whereas, at least, we, in our country can  brag like, oh, these are great businesses, we grow it here but Europe has  none of that.  They just have the downside.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, they just rely on finding the big American companies as part  of their budget.</p><p>BOLTON:  Right, yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Shelby, let me ask you, should there be a presumption of privacy  when you're posting on something that's so public as Facebook?</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  That's a good question.  You know, I think, throughout this  debate what's getting lost is that users do have responsibility.  We share  TMI, to much information, all the time.  So I definitely think if nothing  else alerts people to the fact that their data is being used and they're  sharing perhaps --</p><p>BORTON:  Cambridge Analytica is saying, though, it was like quiz, though --</p><p>WEBSTER:  It was.</p><p>BOLTON:  -- and was like a personality profile.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  -- when you took this quiz years ago you had no idea it would  come back to be served in your face in a political sense.  And I think --  someone I spoke to last week made a really great point.  Democracy is sort  of built on this idea of open ideas, open debate.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  And when you're sending targeted messages to people that no one  knows what they say, no one knows how they might be manipulated there's no  way for candidates or companies to refute these claims.  They don't know  what's being sent.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I get the sense.  We have to wrap this up.  But I get the sense  with Facebook is they really don't have any idea how much of your  information is out there as we speak.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  No clue.  And Zuckerberg is actually admitted that.</p><p>BOLTON:  I think they built a machine that they can't manage.  It's two  billion users.  It's too big even for them.</p><p>And you recall after our scandal, right, in the run-up to the U.S.  Presidential election, 125 million U.S. voters saw that data.  They hired  1000 editors, 1000 editors with two billion users?  That proportion needs  to be up.  But then it cuts into profit margins if you're going to hire  more humans.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It's going to be very interesting.  And we're going to be talking  about it for a while.  Great stuff.  Shelby, Deirdre, thank you so much.   Appreciate it.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  President Trump, well, he's getting tough on Russia.  The  President ordering 60 Russian diplomats to pack their bags and get out of  the U.S.  It's in retaliation for the toxic nerve agent attack on a former  Russian spy and his daughter on British soil.  So what does this mean for  U.S.-Russia relations from here?  We'll talk about it next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  President Trump is expelling 60 Russian diplomats from the U.S.  and is closing a Russian consulate in Seattle.  This is in response to the  nerve agent attack on an ex-Russian spy in the U.K. earlier this month.   Now, the U.S. is joining at least 17 other countries in kicking out Russian  diplomats making it the biggest western expulsion of Russian  representatives since the height of the Cold War.  Interesting stuff.</p><p>Here now with more, Philip Wegmann.  He's a Commentary Writer for the  \"Washington Examiner.\"</p><p>Philip, do you think, do you get the sense that Vladmir Putin  underestimated the response to this nerve agent attack in Britain?  What is  going through in his mind right now?</p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, COMMENTARY WRITER, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  Well if Putin  underestimated the response to that attack, he certainly understands the  message that the Trump administration is sending right now.  Remember,  Putin is an old KGB hand and he is not going to miss the significance of  the Trump administration kicking out 60 Russian diplomats and also closing  that consulate in Seattle.</p><p>The message here is clear.  It's that Russian cannot expect to manhandle  our allies and get away with it.  You can't perform these extra judicial  executions on our allies' foreign soil.  And, I think, we're just going to  turn a blind eye.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But is it symbolic?  I mean, what impact does it really have?   Sixty Russian diplomats and representatives go back to Moscow.  Does it put  a serious dent in the intelligence-gathering network?</p><p>WEGMANN:  Absolutely.  If you look at those diplomats, there were 60 of  them and they were in Seattle, Washington, close to not only some of our  sub-bases but also close to Boeing Manufacturing.  So for us to push them  out, that is significant blow to their intelligence gathering network.</p><p>And I think that what the Trump administration needs to do right now is  they need to follow-up this strong action with strong words from the  President.  He needs to show that he's serious about this threat, because,  frankly, a lot of people still don't know that this President now, by  expelling those 60 Russian agents, has sent more Russians out of the  country than President Obama did after the election with regard to the  election meddling.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  So we're fully expecting a tit-for-tat.  We've seen the  Russians do that with the U.K. when the U.K. kicked out 23 diplomats, same  thing happened in Moscow.  Probably the same thing is going to happen in  the U.S.  Does that not hurt our intelligence-gathering abilities in  Russia?</p><p>WEGMANN:  Well, you're absolutely right.  Already the Russian embassy is  tweeting this morning somewhat tongue-in-cheek, where and which consulates  should be kicked out of Russia.  You know, which of our agents should get  the boot.  And I think that because this is so pointed and this definitely  is a blow at Russian intelligence, that Putin and company, they are going  to strike back hard but the Trump administration has shown resolve, steel  in this area.  And now that John Bolton is joining the administration,  someone who is a Russia hawk, I think we're going to see a much stronger  response from the White House.</p><p>WEBSTER:  How could have -- assuming this went all the way to Mr. Putin and  he gave the OK for this, and we don't know that for sure, but it certainly  appears that way, what was he trying to achieve?  He had to know that  something like this so brazen would have consequences.</p><p>WEGMANN:  Well, the Russians are always trying to push the envelope and  they're also very symbolic in the way that they carryout these executions.   If you look at the type of nerve agent that was used, that was a clear  calling card because that is an agent that was manufactured specifically in  Russia.  So he had to know there were these insidious bread crumbs that  were going to lead back to the Kremlin.</p><p>I think what we're seeing here is that after the 2016 election, Putin is  trying to feel out what he can do, how hard he can go after the United  States.  What we're seeing here is that Trump at least, with this reaction  is showing that we are not going to back down from the world stage.  That  we are going to stand strong in our relations with some of our longest  standing allies.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I have to leave it right there.  It'd be fascinating to follow  what happens next.  Philip, thank you so much for joining us.  Appreciate  it and thanks for your comments.</p><p>We are, of course, keeping a close eye on the markets for years.  Stocks  rally over trade talks, not a trade war.  The market up 556 points now on  the Dow, up at 24,083.</p><p>Also ahead, the court battle is underway to decide the fate of the AT&amp;T  merger with Time Warner.  Right now, top broadcasting executives are  testifying on what this merger would mean for them.  We'll have the intel  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Witnesses are taken the stand today as the Department of Justice  tries to block a potential multibillion dollar deal between AT&amp;T and Time  Warner.  Joining me from the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., is  our very own Connell McShane with the latest.</p><p>Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey there, Ashley.  Well, the  court is just about to resume, to be back in session, coming back from one  of your favorite activities, an extended lunch break which the judge took  and for him the judge in this case, Richard Leon, this is a working lunch.   It's kind of a strange morning.</p><p>We're waiting to hear from these two key executives in the cable industry.   One of these guys named Warren Schlichting, a head of a Sling T.V., a DISH  Network and the other is John Martin, the Chairman of CEO at Turner.</p><p>As the government tries to build this antitrust case and tries to block  this merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, I say it's a strange morning because  what happened to us, just before the Department of Justice was to call its  first witness of the day, the government lawyer asked the judge to approach  the bench.  And then for two hours, all the lawyers and the judge were  talking.</p><p>Now, we're in the courtroom, we couldn't hear what they were saying so we  don't know exactly what the issues were but we were told by judge, Leon,  that some issues did come up and he had a number of e-mails to review.  So  he said let's take a longer break than usual.  I'll review those e-mails  and I'll come back and have some rulings and maybe we can proceed in the  afternoon.  So we'll see if we get that testimony.  It could be important.</p><p>Just to get you up to speed, Ashley, in where we are.  In this last week,  the Justice Department started to make its case.  Its basic case is that if  these companies are allowed to combine, AT&amp;T and Time Warner, it would be  unfair and consumers would pay the price.  They'd paid higher prices that  AT&amp;T would be able to kind of weaponize Time Warner to use the Justice  Department's terms there and takes its networks HBO, and CNN, TNT, TBS to  be able to leverage those with DirecTV service and increase prices.</p><p>The companies are comeback and argued that the Justice Department's case is  fundamentally stuck in the past.  They say the game is completely changed  what to do competition from the tech companies whether the, Hulu, Netflix  and the likes.  So we're just getting started here, what could be a six to  eight week trial.  We'll see what this afternoon brings.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So a lot of talking so far today, Connell, and you couldn't hear  one word of it?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Great stuff.  All right.  It's going to be a long six weeks, my  friend.  Enjoy those working lunches.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I know.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, Connell McShane down in D.C. on the latest development  in AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger case.</p><p>Stops our rallying as investors cheer on reports of trade negotiations,  nice press negotiations between the U.S. and China.  Let's go to the floor  of the New York Stock Exchange, where our very own Nicole Petallides has  the latest.</p><p>Big sell-off last week?  We're up 545 points.  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  That's right.  So cooler  heads prevailed for today but big picture, people think of the hard time  committing to that is going to be a great 2018 because there are so many  factors up in the air, they're looking at technicals.</p><p>Right now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 545 points, the S&amp;P 500 is  up, 2.1 percent.  Third day in a row of two percent move.  Thursday, Friday  down two percent each of those days and today up two percent.  So the  volatility is here.</p><p>Tech, we have this interesting dichotomy, fang, right?  Facebook being the  F.  There's seems to be a separation on this one.

We'll have the intel on what this could mean for both parties in  the midterms next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Health care premiums are expected to go up yet again right before  the midterm elections in November.  Now this after a battle in Congress  failed to include in last week's massive spending bill a plan to shore up  the health insurance exchanges.  No subsidies.  And without the government  money, insurance companies, well you know what they're going to do?   They're going to raise rates, right?</p><p>Gerri Willis joins us live from the newsroom with the latest on this.   Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Well, Ash, you've got that story  right.  Estimates of just how much premiums could rise, according to the  Congressional Budget Office, some 10 percent for a popular middle priced  option on the insurance exchanges and, you know, that doesn't even include  the hike to premiums that will likely occur as the mandate fades away.</p><p>Now, lawmakers on both sides are pointing fingers, Democrats blame the GOP  for failure in negotiations saying they demanded abortion restrictions  being included something they knew would be unacceptable to Democrats.  And  Republicans say this that they negotiated in good faith and Democrats  rejected reasonable rules on abortion.  Either way, the impasse means money  to shore up the Obamacare insurance exchanges was omitted from the $1.3  trillion spending plan that the President signed last week.</p><p>Failing to shore up, the exchanges could have big repercussions at the  ballot box.  A recent poll in Pennsylvania showed health care was a top  issue for 52 percent of voters according to Public Policy Polling.</p><p>Payments to insurers were stopped last year after President Trump said they  were illegal because the money had not been appropriated by Congress.   Meanwhile, insiders say that passage of legislation to stabilize the  exchanges, highly unlikely.</p><p>Ash, back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Interesting stuff.  The bottom line is those rates go up.  Gerri,  thank you very much.</p><p>Health care is expected to be one of the top issues for this year's midterm  elections.  Topping the latest \"Q-poll\" as the number one issue and poll  show that most voters feel Democrats would handle health care better, but a  new Fox poll shows the Democrats lead in the midterms is actually slipping  to just five points.  Interesting.</p><p>Joining me now, Former Bush Administration Aide, Matt Mackowiak, and  Democratic Strategist, Antjuan Seawright.  Thank you both for being here.</p><p>Matt, let me begin with you.  You could argue that health care continues to  be a problem and it was failure of the Republicans who have the House in  Senate and Oval Office to get this thing sorted out.  How would you  respond? </p><p>MATT MACKOWIAK, FORMER BUSH ADMINISTRATION AIDE:  Yes, there's no question  that Republicans promised to repeal and replace Obamacare.  The House took  two attempts and got it done.  The Senate took two attempts and failed by  one vote and so Republican voters have some frustration about that, there's  no question.  But that's going to be one be one issue the midterms are  going to be about.  They're going to be about economy, they're going to be  about direction of the country and they're ultimately going to be about the  candidates that running on both sides, you know, in each district.</p><p>The generic ballot is helpful directionally.  But ultimately every  individual race comes down to that district, comes down to the candidates  that are running, the campaigns they're running.  We saw that in  Pennsylvania 18 where the Democratic candidate ran as pro-gun, personally  anti-abortion, Democratic candidate.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  And that's not what you're going to see in a lot of other races  around the country.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Antjuan, let me ask you.  Why do you think the gap is closing in  the polls?  What do you put that down to?</p><p>ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, a couple of things here,  one, you should know that between now and November this will be a marathon,  not a sprint on both sides.</p><p>WEBSTER:  True.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  So you're going to see the polls change, go up and down from  here until November.  The second thing to remember is that the enthusiasm  gap favors the Democrats as well as history.  It is very uncommon for the  party in charge to keep their charge in the midterm elections.</p><p>And the third thing that I will tell you, if you look what is happening all  across the country, in special elections whether State House seats,  Alabama, New Jersey, Virginia, even in Pennsylvania, the voters are  speaking out very loudly.  They are rejecting the policies of Donald Trump  and the Republican Party.  I think the Republicans have a big issue in  November and what no poll will be able to tell you this point is the  massive enthusiasm we've seen from the Women's March movement just a few  months ago in Washington as well as these young people all across the  country who are organizing.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Antjuan, let me just follow up very quickly.  Matt mentioned the  economy.  The tax reform has put up more money in a lot of people's pockets  and the economy for all intents and purposes is doing very well.  If you  hang your hat on the economy, how are you going to make that argument?</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Well, I think the economy will be just one issue that voters  will decide on.  But here's the thing to remember about the economy, there  is a reason why the Republican Party did not run one single ad in  Pennsylvania about their tax scam that they passed a few months ago because  the voters do not agree what happened.</p><p>Look, that bonus they received in their check, I'm not saying it's not a  good thing but it was a shot in the arm.  What want people are raise in  wages that will sustain them long term and improve their quality of life,  and middle class families over the long term will not see that from the tax  bill that passed a few months ago by the Republicans.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Matt, let me have you respond to Antjuan.  I mean, you know, yes,  the bonuses were nice.  They weren't crumbs but they're also seeing  benefits from the tax reform paying lower taxes.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  No question.  You have about 5 million people who received  their bonus or received their wage increase because of the tax law, that's  significant.  You have the highest consumer confidence we've had in  decades.  And I can put Antjuan's mind at ease, wages are going up for  first time in a decade and that's very good news.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Well they're not, Matt, according to statistics.  According to  statistics wages are flat.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  Antjuan, I'd be happy to send you the statistics that have come  out on the last couple months that shown wages have begun rising.  So the  economy is improving.  It's strengthening.  We have 4.1 percent  unemployment and historically very, very low.</p><p>And I think Republicans everyday they aren't talking about the economy as a  waste.  They need to talk about the economy.  They need to sell the tax  law.  A majority of the public is now viewing it very favorably.  This has  a chance to save their majority even though it is very much up for grabs.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Antjuan, do you think that --</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Matt, keep in mind --</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- all right, go ahead.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  -- Matt, keep in mind, the one thing that you all have around  your neck is President Donald Trump, the most toxic President probably in  modern-day history at the top of the ticket.  Look, that is not a good  thing going into someone --</p><p>WEBSTER:  But why is his approval rating Antjuan?  Why is the President's  approval rating going up?</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  -- it may be rising from the graveyard but it has not hit  aboveground just yet.  And keep in mind, Virginia rejected, Alabama  rejected Trump, so did Pennsylvania and in districts where he carried about  20, 30 points in the last election cycle.  Democrats have been winning at  various levels of our government.  And so, you can decide however you want  to break that down, but I am telling you that something is brewing here in  this country and I don't think the way will be in favor of Republicans.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very quickly, Matt.  You know, if you're a candidate, do you want  Donald Trump to come to your town and stamp for you and, you know, get the  crowd fired up?  Would you distance yourself?</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  It totally depends on district and on the dynamics of the race  that you're in.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  In some districts, particularly in places like California you  probably don't want the President to come in.  If you're in the middle of  country, in states that Trump won, if you're running for U.S. Senate in  North Dakota or West Virginia or Montana, the President can be very  helpful.  So, they're going to have to be strategic on how they deploy him  next fall.</p><p>There's no question, his improvement has been narrowly increasing.  He's in  the middle of 30s last year.  It's in the low 40s now.  They needed to get  in the mid-40s by the midterms.  They'll have a chance to hold the House  and that's very important.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Guys, we have to leave it right there.  You know, bottom line is  a day is a long time in politics.  So, there is a long time between now and  November.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  A marathon, not a sprint.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Matt and Antjuan, great stuff as always.  Thank you  both for joining us today.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Thank you.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Coming up next, we got preview of tonight's new episodes of the  \"Strange Inheritance,\" including a son of a NASA chaplain who inherits more  than a 100 Bibles that went to the moon.  I kid you not.  Stay with us.   We're back in two.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Monday night on Fox Business are getting a just little bit  stranger.  Strange Inheritance is back tonight with two new episodes, one,  involving some Bibles that went all the way to the moon.  I kid you not.   Take a look.</p><p>(BEGINNING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMIE COLBY, HOST, \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\":  It's a small postage stamp.   What's on there?</p><p>JONATHAN STOUT:  That's the entire Bible.</p><p>COLBY:  On one little tiny microfiche?</p><p>STOUT:  On each sheet.</p><p>COLBY:  When it's magnified under a microscope, sure enough there is the  Holy Scripture.</p><p>STOUT:  That was my dad's dream, to get the Bible to the moon.</p><p>COLBY:  Wait, your inheritance is this little teeny-tiny Bibles went to the  moon?</p><p>COLBY:  Yes, it did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, it's fascinating.  Joining me now in the studio to chat  about all of the Strange Inheritance stamp, and it is fascinating, is the  host, Jamie Colby.</p><p>Jamie, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>COLBY:  Absolutely, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Define Bible.</p><p>COLBY:  Did you know I did not know Bibles went to the moon.</p><p>WEBSTER:  No.</p><p>COLBY:  But Reverend Stout was.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And they came back.  They weren't left there for someone to read.</p><p>COLBY:  Well, it took several attempts to get them there successfully to be  on the lunar surface.  He was really determined.  He was NASA engineer who  happened to be at Reverend and he decided this is something he wanted to  do.</p><p>So, Edgar Mitchell was the astronaut that actually took it as part of his  personal items, hundreds of them, because they were that small.  I don't  even know how many people remember microfiche but I read and the entire  Bible was there.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I'm old enough to remember microfiche at the library, you know,  you go through.</p><p>COLBY:  But here's the problem.  You want to know what their worst because  this is a business channel.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Always.</p><p>COLBY:  They are so valuable.  The individual ones have sold anywhere from  10,000 to 70,000.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You are kidding.</p><p>COLBY:  He has several hundred of them but there wasn't a will and even  though when there's a will there's a way.  When there's no will it's get  very complicated on Strange Inheritance.</p><p>So, tonight, you'll meet the family.  You'll also meet an author, Carol  Mersch, who did some investigation and story on the Bibles with Reverend  and she says, the Bibles belonged to her.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Interesting.</p><p>COLBY:  It's a little messy.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  That's the best you say.</p><p>COLBY:  The good book on demand.</p><p>WEBSTER:  When it comes with the territory, when you're talking about  things that are, you know, left behind, if the ownership part is not clear  it can get, well, down right ugly at times.  Anyway, --</p><p>COLBY:  In Texas, they're good people.  They're going to work it out.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- of course they will.  Now, also, there's another topic you're  getting into involving race cars.</p><p>COLBY:  Rave up you engine because --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Best car?</p><p>COLBY:  -- this family, actually the father, Mickey Thompson, broke the  land speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats on what he called the  Challenger.  It's a piston-driven engine that goes 400 plus miles.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Look at that.  Oh my God!</p><p>COLBY:  Wait till you see me in it.  But anyway I degrease that so much  fun.  I could almost knock it out.  It's so high speed.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You still be in and out.</p><p>COLBY:  It was amazing.  So, Danny is his son and he was determined to  break his dad's land speed record because for all the years his father told  him, no racing, it's dangerous.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Oh, my God.  Yes.</p><p>COLBY:  The last thing his father said to him is I'm giving you the  Challenger.  I want you to race it and now, he's determined to make sure  that the Thompson family keeps that record.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Fascinating.  The air tonight beginning at?</p><p>COLBY:  9:00 to 9:30.</p><p>WEBSTER:  9:00 to 9:30.</p><p>COLBY:  Come on over.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I'd love it.  I want to try that car, break the land speed record  or may be not.  At least you got of it, that's the main thing.</p><p>COLBY:  Wear your seatbelt, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, always.  Jamie, thank you very much.</p><p>Let's take a look at the market for you.  What a day.  We said it's a Jamie  Colby effect.  It was going to hit 600 points, nearly Jamie.  Good.  We're  up 564 points.</p><p>Liz Claman, by the way, is back from, I think, she went skiing.  I think  she went old fancy and went out west to go skiing.</p><p>We saw some picture, Liz.  You looked terrific out there.  And you're into  friend.  I think you ride into Peter Toughman (ph) </p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Can you believe that.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Of all of people, I mean, it's a small world because Peter  Toughman works down at the New York Exchange.  He's the guy with that crazy  hair and the glasses.  And he's taking picture when the markets doing crazy  thing.</p><p>CLAMAN:  He is the most photographed trader on the floor of the New York  Stock.  We're going to find that picture up the Twitter feed.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We do.  It's great to have you back.</p><p>LIZ:  But I can tell you, he wasn't wearing a helmet.</p><p>WEBSTER:  What?</p><p>CLAMAN:  Bad, Peter, bad.  That's how I recognize him because out there  with his hair.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Funny.  He looks funny in a helmet.  Yes.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Yes, they'll  send a car right over to take him down there, I think.  Neil Cavuto.   Thanks, Neil.  Appreciate it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAVUTO:  All right, bud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WEBSTER:  Breaking right now, stocks are soaring after new reports suggest  that the White House is quietly negotiating with China as both sides tried  to avoid an all-out trade war.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, everybody.  I'm Ashley Webster, in today for Trish Regan.  And  welcome, everyone, to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p>Well, investors are encourage by the prospect of the world's two largest  economies reaching the deal on trade as stocks bounce back from their worst  week in more than two years and optimism apparently spreading beyond Wall  Street.  Here is Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin speaking to Fox News just  yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  I think we're working on a pathway to  see if we can reach an agreement as to what fair trade is for them to open  up their markets, reduce their tariffs, stop force-technology transfer.   These are all the things we want to do.  But in a negotiation, you have to  be prepared to take action and that's what President Trump is doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER:  He certainly is.  The President displaying his confidence in our  economy in a tweet this morning saying, \"The economy is looking really  good.  It has been years that we have seen these kind of numbers.  The  underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.\"  And we'll  find out ow those companies are doing, of course, next month with the  latest round of earnings.</p><p>Joining me now Forbes Media Chairman, the man himself, Steve Forbes.  And,  Steve, thank you very much for joining us today in the studio.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  OK.  Let's just pick up from what the President said, are you  happy with the U.S. economy heading in the right direction.  Is it healthy?</p><p>FORBES:  I think it is healthy.  And I think there were news coming out  about negotiating with China and these trade disputes is a good thing  because one of the things this imposition of tariffs would have done is  create uncertainty.  Is this thing going to spin out of control?</p><p>On the steel side for Japan and China is now been exempted to further  negotiations.  On the Chinese side, working behind the scenes see what can  be done.  So I think the markets and investors will be reassured, OK, we  can invest.  They're not going to let this thing spin out of control.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Even though, let's be honest, the way its approach is a little  chaotic.  The Trump administration and it was on this campaign promise  list, if you like, so it's not a big surprise but it really did shake the  markets.  But is this, in your opinion, a classic Donald Trump maneuver?   Shoot very high, come out strong, and then bring someone to the table and  negotiate perhaps something a little lower?</p><p>FORBES:  Well, I think, that it would have been better for him and for the  economy and investing confidence if they had first, especially with China,  negotiated with our European allies, saying we know there are abusers.  Our  allies know there are abusers.  We're going to present the United Front.</p><p>Here's what we're going to put on the table.  So, you've done that kind of  preparation, one, the market wouldn't have freaked out and, two, everyone  would have acknowledged, yes, this thing has to be addressed.</p><p>WEBSTER:  These market actions are remarkable.  I was on the 3:00 show last  week when we had a 400 point drop and a 700 point drop.  Here we go again,  the volatility is back.  Everything seems now is headline driven.  Is that  going to be the way for awhile now, do you believe?</p><p>FORBES:  Well, this is going to depend on what you've referred to early.   These earnings are starting to come out next month.  But it looks like  Corporate America is starting to still turning in good profits.</p><p>People say, OK, things are still being done, things are moving ahead.   Heck, there was even a story this weekend about \"Brexit\" in Britain.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  But for all the hoopla in parliament and the disarray and the  ineffective prime minister, things are happening in the economy.  It's  amazing.  Government leaves it alone.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Despite everything.</p><p>FORBES:  People do things.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, it's interesting.  How much attention does the market or  investors pay to what's going on in Washington, because every day there's  some headline coming out, whether it's the President's personal lawyer  quits or whatever it'd be the story de jure.  Does that have an impact on  the markets?  Are people able to put the noise aside?</p><p>FORBES:  Most of the noise they put aside, as we've seen with the markets  reaction to recently, when concerns about what's going to happen on the  trade front came to the forefront.  That's when markets thought, my golly,  are they going to let this thing spin out of control?  Are they going to  control it?  And so, they respond to that kind of news, not to the latest  thing on \"60 Minutes\" or anything else.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I know.  That's not even news as far I can see it.  But anyway,  we'll move on.</p><p>I have to ask you about Facebook, because in light of the 444 point gain  today on Wall Street, it's been striking what we've seen with the selling  on Facebook and the hits it continues to take today.  We found out the  Federal Trade Commission has begun the investigation.  Do you have a  Facebook page?</p><p>FORBES:  I do and even own a few shares of Facebook.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  What's your take on all of this?</p><p>FORBES:  But I think it's a case where management has flubbed the ball.   This thing could have been contained from the beginning, be upfront about  it.  Outline what you're going to do to prevent abuses by users.</p><p>Yes, the users violated the contract.  But what follow-up did you have?   What kind of auditing did you have?</p><p>Reassure that you're on top of the things, instead of look like you're  floundering, you don't know what to do.  You want to go on apology tour.   That freaks people out that you're not in charge.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Is this redeemable at this stage because it's a very good chance  to, as Neil Cavuto said, look, he's going to be down in Washington  testifying?</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and that's like I have an offer you can't refuse kind of  invitation.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  That's going to be critical because that will determine the fate  of the stocks in the months ahead, if he goes before the committee and  says, here's what happened, here's what we're outlining doing.  We think  we're on top of this thing, present a role that he is in charge and  reassuring and confident, instead of floundering.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We haven't seen it so far.</p><p>FORBES:  We haven't seen it, but this is his chance to do it.  I hope he is  prepping for this thing in a way people say, OK, the government is not  going to really move in a big way because if the government moves in, that  stock is going to be killed.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It is.  And we're talking about new regulations which could  further crimp the business model of Facebook and other social media  companies.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, and not only Facebook but it means they're going to end up  gumming up a lot of other high-tech companies and high-tech start-ups.  We  don't have the resources to fight this kind thing.  So a lot is on his  shoulder.  I hope the shoulders are broad --</p><p>WEBSTER:  But don't blow it as they say, Steve.</p><p>FORBES:  -- well, he brought it on.</p><p>WEBSTER:  He did, that's very true.  Steve, thank you very much.  Great  stuff as always.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  For more on these markets, let's bring in the Stock Swoosh  Founder, Melissa Armo, along with Surevest Wealth Management CEO, Rob Luna.</p><p>Melissa, let me get to you.  What's your take on the markets right now?   You need some Pepto-Bismol, don't you?  We had a big selloff last week and  now here were are up 443 points.  Is pretty much this volatility here to  stay?</p><p>MELISSA ARMO, THE STOCK SWOOSH:  Volatility is here to stay.  Came in in  2018.  I don't think it's going anywhere.</p><p>I really didn't look today as a strong day.  I know we gapped up a lot this  morning.  But overall, this is just kind of like a dead-cat bounce, it's  something that traders use the terminology.</p><p>I really think we might still be lower, because the fact is that overall  the market is strong but everything that happens, every headline that comes  out, every news thing, the market is reacting very volatile to it, selling  off quickly and then bouncing again and selling off quickly.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>ARMO:  And the range is broadening.  We're still strong but the range from  the high to where we're at in this base is like wide, it's getting wider  and wider and wider.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, it's interesting because, Rob, you say, look, we are  trading in a range but to Melissa's point, that range is like the size of  the Grand Canyon right now.</p><p>ROB LUNA, CEO, SUREVEST WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Well, it's like the size of the  Grand Canyon.  If you look at the minuscule ranges that we're trading in  over the prior 18 to 24 months but I think, you know, in general, there's  11 to 12 percentage point range that we're trading in, you know, quiet  honestly, Ashley, is normal.  And we got up towards the end at the top of  that range, all this headline risk, whether it's tariffs, it's raising  interest rates, the market is looking for reason to sell.  It got it, now  we're back towards the bottom in this range.</p><p>And what you're seeing is, as we hit the 200-day moving average support,  buyers are starting to come back in this morning.  But I look at that last  hour, the last hour is going to be very telling to see if we can hold up  today.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Good luck predicting where it's going go.  Let me follow-up  with you then, Rob.  You say, look, as far as where the economy goes it's  all flashing green.</p><p>We just spoke with Steve Forbes.  He agrees the economy is doing well.  We  get the earnings next month, assuming they're pretty solid, how important  is that for this market?</p><p>LUNA:  I think it's extremely important, right, because there is a lot of  headline risk out there.  Right now, investors are definitely nervous.  So  they need this reassurance from Wall Street, from the companies, from the  CEOs out there telling them the things are still good.  And I think if that  happens, we can head back towards the top of that range, and like we said,  that could be eight to 10 percentage-point move.  So, if you're an investor  you don't necessarily would be on the sidelines and miss out on that.</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  Melissa, I spoke with a Money manager this  morning who said, look, I'm looking for a sector that has the least  downside, the most upside.  And I'm thinking, well, yes, we're all doing  that, right?  He said that sector was energy is being beaten down too much  and has a long way to go on the upside.  What do you say?</p><p>ARMO:  I don't agree with that.  I like the idea of banks strengths.  So  right now, the strongest things out there are banks and the tech sector  except for Facebook.  Take Facebook out of that equation, which is  unfortunate.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>ARMO:  But someone like Amazon, Netflix, Apple, I still like Google still  looks good and the banks, J.P. Morgan Chase.  I mean, I still think that  you buy strong stocks.  They're coming in, weak though.  Don't buy yet.   Wait until they're showing strength for about a week, two weeks.</p><p>You want to see consecutive green, green days just like we follow-through  and rally today and all next week into the start of April, that will be a  good time, come second-quarter earnings season to start getting back into  the strong stuff.  I don't want to buy stuff that's weak, that's down a  lot, that has a huge upside.  I want to buy stuff that's proving, that is  strong even when the market was falling last week.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  And, Rob, you know, that has been the tech stocks.  A lot  of money has gone into tech over the last 18 months and beyond.  Is that  still the leading sector, these big tech companies, or are you seeing money  go elsewhere?</p><p>LUNA:  Yes, you know, I think so, Ashley.  You know, really if you were  looking at rising interest rates right now, the only way that your  portfolio is going to be able to combat that is through growth.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>LUNA:  And it's very tough to get top-line growth outside of technology  right now.  The financials could definitely do it but, you know, they're  actually been struggling here quite a bit.  So, I'm a little bit nervous  about what's going on with them.</p><p>But the old technology stocks, Amazon, Google, two of our top, you know,  largest holdings right now, we're continuing to stick with them.  And, I  agree, momentum is where you want to be but I don't know that you  necessarily wait for them to completely break out.  Use this opportunity  when they're pulling back technically to enter into positions.  And, you  know, 10 percent to 15 percent from where they were at before is a pretty  attractive entry point in our view.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Melissa, I want to ask you the same question I asked Steve  Forbes.  Do you think all the noise is coming out of Washington that at  this point investors pay much attention or does it have an impact on the  market?</p><p>ARMO:  Of course, it does have an impact on the market.  All you have to do  is look last week or even look back the February.  It's unfortunate because  I think the market is going to shake all of this off.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>ARMO:  But you can't ignore it.  We live in 24 hour, seven day week news  cycle.  Every time you get up, you see this thing, that thing, the other  thing.  Mr. Forbes is talking about \"60 Minutes,\" I mean even something  like that could affected the market this morning.</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's true.</p><p>ARMO:  You can't escape it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Rob, what do you tell to your clients?  Ignore it, just  focus on fundamentals of these companies?</p><p>LUNA:  Yes, that's exactly it.  I mean, when you look at this whole noise  about the trade tariffs, we have $375 billion deficit right now.  You know,  what was on the table is only $60 billion.  These are not huge numbers  right now.</p><p>And let's face it, Trump is not going to get any, you know, style points  for finesse here.  This is his negotiation style.</p><p>WEBSTER:  No.</p><p>LUNA:  He's trying to get China to the table.  I think it's a lot of noise  right now and investors should just pay attention to the fundamentals.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Wise words indeed from both of you.  Melissa, Rob, thanks you  very much for joining us today.</p><p>ARMO:  Thanks.</p><p>LUNA:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  The Dow up, by the way, 500 points above 24,000.  One of those  days.</p><p>Well, indeed, there may be a rally on Wall Street but shares of Facebook  taking another hit after the FTC says it is investigating the company.  Can  Mark Zuckerberg fix this mess?  Our panel discusses it next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Facebook start taking another leg down after the Federal Trade  Commission announced it was investigating Facebook's privacy practices.   Plus, 37 states attorneys general want to know when Facebook actually knew  about that massive data breach.  And the Senate Judiciary Committee goes on  and on, doesn't it, as invited, I say invited, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and  other tech leaders to testify April 10th, an offer they can't refuse as  someone put it.</p><p>And yes, the headaches keep coming.  A new report claims that Facebook logs  all your calls and texts, it is.  And you probably have no idea that's  happening either.</p><p>Joining me now to talk about this \"Wall Street Journal\" Senior Reporter,  Shelby Holliday, and our very own, Deirdre Bolton.  Thank you both for  being here.</p><p>Shelby, let me begin with you.  I don't know if you heard what Steve Forbes  had to say but he basically said, Mark Zuckerberg dropped the ball on this  and has to really be very careful this time on how he approaches it from  now on.  He has to instill confidence and he has to get it right.  What  we've seen up to now doesn't necessarily suggest he's able to do that.</p><p>SHELBY HOLLIDAY,  SENIOR REPORTER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  He's got to  be honest because there are number of issues Facebook is dealing with right  now, whether it's Russian meddling, Cambridge Analytica use of data, the  cellphone and messages scraping if you will.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  But the underlying theme for all of this is that users were not  aware their data was being used against them.  So now there's a lot of  outrage.  People are pledging to quit Facebook.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  They're calling for answers.  You're hearing lawmakers really  wanting the CEOs to get on the Hill and answer some of these questions.   But Mark Zuckerberg is still continuing to sort of let this drip instead of  just getting all the answers out there, confronting all of the problems  they have and, quite frankly, being honest with all of the users, the two  billion users Facebook has.</p><p>A lot of them when I talk to them, and I'm doing my reporting, still have  no idea that they followed Russian accounts.  So they're getting it from  journalists, rather than the company itself.</p><p>WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  And Deirdre, you know, we hear today the  FTC is getting involved.  What could that mean?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  So that's like we're going to be --  one of the bigger questions is shall we -- you know, they had an agreement  going back to 2011.  So we should just say this is not the first time that  the FTC and Facebook have sat down together.  This is actually Facebook's  second strike at that with the FTC.</p><p>So in 2011, they had an agreement about privacy, about use of data that  Facebook agreed to.  So I think one of the questions that Facebook is now  going to have to answer is, did they follow the guidelines that they said  they would in 2011?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  If it's found not, just start tacking on millions of dollars in  fees, without even talking about potential regulation.  But it's just  actually literally going to cost them.  So I think that's going to be one  of the bigger questions.</p><p>I know with the android, so-called scraping.  I actually spoke with  somebody who said Facebook in legal thing, oh, but users did have the opt  out.  So once again, it's always the own us is on the user and we just  keeping reminding ourselves, right, authors or media is you're not paying  for the products, you are the product.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  So there is a bit of a buyer beware, which I think the Facebook  legal side is going to try its best to argue.  But I think long story  short, honestly, this just opens the doors, as you said, invited to D.C.  are now Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, of course, for Twitter and Larry Page  for Google.  So I think, you know, what are these companies doing, how are  they protecting our data?  That's why the FTC is involved.</p><p>And you have spoken often with Scott Galloway, who's a professor at NYU --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  -- who actually believes there will be a call to break up big  tech.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  And he just wrote a book about this saying, it's going to come  from Europe, because as he points out, Europe has all of the downside and  none of the upside of big tech.  Whereas, at least, we, in our country can  brag like, oh, these are great businesses, we grow it here but Europe has  none of that.  They just have the downside.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, they just rely on finding the big American companies as part  of their budget.</p><p>BOLTON:  Right, yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Shelby, let me ask you, should there be a presumption of privacy  when you're posting on something that's so public as Facebook?</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  That's a good question.  You know, I think, throughout this  debate what's getting lost is that users do have responsibility.  We share  TMI, to much information, all the time.  So I definitely think if nothing  else alerts people to the fact that their data is being used and they're  sharing perhaps --</p><p>BORTON:  Cambridge Analytica is saying, though, it was like quiz, though --</p><p>WEBSTER:  It was.</p><p>BOLTON:  -- and was like a personality profile.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  -- when you took this quiz years ago you had no idea it would  come back to be served in your face in a political sense.  And I think --  someone I spoke to last week made a really great point.  Democracy is sort  of built on this idea of open ideas, open debate.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  And when you're sending targeted messages to people that no one  knows what they say, no one knows how they might be manipulated there's no  way for candidates or companies to refute these claims.  They don't know  what's being sent.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I get the sense.  We have to wrap this up.  But I get the sense  with Facebook is they really don't have any idea how much of your  information is out there as we speak.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  No clue.  And Zuckerberg is actually admitted that.</p><p>BOLTON:  I think they built a machine that they can't manage.  It's two  billion users.  It's too big even for them.</p><p>And you recall after our scandal, right, in the run-up to the U.S.  Presidential election, 125 million U.S. voters saw that data.  They hired  1000 editors, 1000 editors with two billion users?  That proportion needs  to be up.  But then it cuts into profit margins if you're going to hire  more humans.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It's going to be very interesting.  And we're going to be talking  about it for a while.  Great stuff.  Shelby, Deirdre, thank you so much.   Appreciate it.</p><p>HOLLIDAY:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  President Trump, well, he's getting tough on Russia.  The  President ordering 60 Russian diplomats to pack their bags and get out of  the U.S.  It's in retaliation for the toxic nerve agent attack on a former  Russian spy and his daughter on British soil.  So what does this mean for  U.S.-Russia relations from here?  We'll talk about it next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  President Trump is expelling 60 Russian diplomats from the U.S.  and is closing a Russian consulate in Seattle.  This is in response to the  nerve agent attack on an ex-Russian spy in the U.K. earlier this month.   Now, the U.S. is joining at least 17 other countries in kicking out Russian  diplomats making it the biggest western expulsion of Russian  representatives since the height of the Cold War.  Interesting stuff.</p><p>Here now with more, Philip Wegmann.  He's a Commentary Writer for the  \"Washington Examiner.\"</p><p>Philip, do you think, do you get the sense that Vladmir Putin  underestimated the response to this nerve agent attack in Britain?  What is  going through in his mind right now?</p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, COMMENTARY WRITER, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  Well if Putin  underestimated the response to that attack, he certainly understands the  message that the Trump administration is sending right now.  Remember,  Putin is an old KGB hand and he is not going to miss the significance of  the Trump administration kicking out 60 Russian diplomats and also closing  that consulate in Seattle.</p><p>The message here is clear.  It's that Russian cannot expect to manhandle  our allies and get away with it.  You can't perform these extra judicial  executions on our allies' foreign soil.  And, I think, we're just going to  turn a blind eye.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But is it symbolic?  I mean, what impact does it really have?   Sixty Russian diplomats and representatives go back to Moscow.  Does it put  a serious dent in the intelligence-gathering network?</p><p>WEGMANN:  Absolutely.  If you look at those diplomats, there were 60 of  them and they were in Seattle, Washington, close to not only some of our  sub-bases but also close to Boeing Manufacturing.  So for us to push them  out, that is significant blow to their intelligence gathering network.</p><p>And I think that what the Trump administration needs to do right now is  they need to follow-up this strong action with strong words from the  President.  He needs to show that he's serious about this threat, because,  frankly, a lot of people still don't know that this President now, by  expelling those 60 Russian agents, has sent more Russians out of the  country than President Obama did after the election with regard to the  election meddling.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  So we're fully expecting a tit-for-tat.  We've seen the  Russians do that with the U.K. when the U.K. kicked out 23 diplomats, same  thing happened in Moscow.  Probably the same thing is going to happen in  the U.S.  Does that not hurt our intelligence-gathering abilities in  Russia?</p><p>WEGMANN:  Well, you're absolutely right.  Already the Russian embassy is  tweeting this morning somewhat tongue-in-cheek, where and which consulates  should be kicked out of Russia.  You know, which of our agents should get  the boot.  And I think that because this is so pointed and this definitely  is a blow at Russian intelligence, that Putin and company, they are going  to strike back hard but the Trump administration has shown resolve, steel  in this area.  And now that John Bolton is joining the administration,  someone who is a Russia hawk, I think we're going to see a much stronger  response from the White House.</p><p>WEBSTER:  How could have -- assuming this went all the way to Mr. Putin and  he gave the OK for this, and we don't know that for sure, but it certainly  appears that way, what was he trying to achieve?  He had to know that  something like this so brazen would have consequences.</p><p>WEGMANN:  Well, the Russians are always trying to push the envelope and  they're also very symbolic in the way that they carryout these executions.   If you look at the type of nerve agent that was used, that was a clear  calling card because that is an agent that was manufactured specifically in  Russia.  So he had to know there were these insidious bread crumbs that  were going to lead back to the Kremlin.</p><p>I think what we're seeing here is that after the 2016 election, Putin is  trying to feel out what he can do, how hard he can go after the United  States.  What we're seeing here is that Trump at least, with this reaction  is showing that we are not going to back down from the world stage.  That  we are going to stand strong in our relations with some of our longest  standing allies.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I have to leave it right there.  It'd be fascinating to follow  what happens next.  Philip, thank you so much for joining us.  Appreciate  it and thanks for your comments.</p><p>We are, of course, keeping a close eye on the markets for years.  Stocks  rally over trade talks, not a trade war.  The market up 556 points now on  the Dow, up at 24,083.</p><p>Also ahead, the court battle is underway to decide the fate of the AT&amp;T  merger with Time Warner.  Right now, top broadcasting executives are  testifying on what this merger would mean for them.  We'll have the intel  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Witnesses are taken the stand today as the Department of Justice  tries to block a potential multibillion dollar deal between AT&amp;T and Time  Warner.  Joining me from the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., is  our very own Connell McShane with the latest.</p><p>Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey there, Ashley.  Well, the  court is just about to resume, to be back in session, coming back from one  of your favorite activities, an extended lunch break which the judge took  and for him the judge in this case, Richard Leon, this is a working lunch.   It's kind of a strange morning.</p><p>We're waiting to hear from these two key executives in the cable industry.   One of these guys named Warren Schlichting, a head of a Sling T.V., a DISH  Network and the other is John Martin, the Chairman of CEO at Turner.</p><p>As the government tries to build this antitrust case and tries to block  this merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, I say it's a strange morning because  what happened to us, just before the Department of Justice was to call its  first witness of the day, the government lawyer asked the judge to approach  the bench.  And then for two hours, all the lawyers and the judge were  talking.</p><p>Now, we're in the courtroom, we couldn't hear what they were saying so we  don't know exactly what the issues were but we were told by judge, Leon,  that some issues did come up and he had a number of e-mails to review.  So  he said let's take a longer break than usual.  I'll review those e-mails  and I'll come back and have some rulings and maybe we can proceed in the  afternoon.  So we'll see if we get that testimony.  It could be important.</p><p>Just to get you up to speed, Ashley, in where we are.  In this last week,  the Justice Department started to make its case.  Its basic case is that if  these companies are allowed to combine, AT&amp;T and Time Warner, it would be  unfair and consumers would pay the price.  They'd paid higher prices that  AT&amp;T would be able to kind of weaponize Time Warner to use the Justice  Department's terms there and takes its networks HBO, and CNN, TNT, TBS to  be able to leverage those with DirecTV service and increase prices.</p><p>The companies are comeback and argued that the Justice Department's case is  fundamentally stuck in the past.  They say the game is completely changed  what to do competition from the tech companies whether the, Hulu, Netflix  and the likes.  So we're just getting started here, what could be a six to  eight week trial.  We'll see what this afternoon brings.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So a lot of talking so far today, Connell, and you couldn't hear  one word of it?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Great stuff.  All right.  It's going to be a long six weeks, my  friend.  Enjoy those working lunches.</p><p>MCSHANE:  I know.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, Connell McShane down in D.C. on the latest development  in AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger case.</p><p>Stops our rallying as investors cheer on reports of trade negotiations,  nice press negotiations between the U.S. and China.  Let's go to the floor  of the New York Stock Exchange, where our very own Nicole Petallides has  the latest.</p><p>Big sell-off last week?  We're up 545 points.  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  That's right.  So cooler  heads prevailed for today but big picture, people think of the hard time  committing to that is going to be a great 2018 because there are so many  factors up in the air, they're looking at technicals.</p><p>Right now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 545 points, the S&amp;P 500 is  up, 2.1 percent.  Third day in a row of two percent move.  Thursday, Friday  down two percent each of those days and today up two percent.  So the  volatility is here.</p><p>Tech, we have this interesting dichotomy, fang, right?  Facebook being the  F.  There's seems to be a separation on this one.  In fact, some people are  even wondering is fang over because Facebook under pressure again, down 1.5  percent for the month, down 12.2 percent as it remain under fire.</p><p>Zuckerberg actually has been invited to testify in the U.S. Senate.  You  could see that it's down 1.6 percent.  But Apple, Alphabet, Google,  Microsoft, IBM all gaining today.</p><p>Financials, this could actually did slightly worse than even the techs on  Friday.  Without financials and technology these markets have a very hard  time trying to get off the ground.  But here's on what's J.P. Morgan,  Morgan Stanley, Goldman, all up more than three percent.  And Katie W. (ph)  put out a note today saying that they say mergers and acquisitions ahead,  and particularly for J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs being the acquirers.</p><p>Last but not least, a quick look at defense stocks as we know that the  President and assigning in new obviously military spending a massive a  boost to this group on Friday.  You can see here, Lockheed, Northrop,  Bowman, General Dynamics all up more than two percent each.  So that trend  continues.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Lots of green arrows.  Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p>Meanwhile, one of the oldest gunmakers in the U.S. is filing for  bankruptcy.  Remington Arms is restructuring its massive debt after a 30  percent drop in gun sales this year.  The filing will allow the 200-year- old company to stay in business while reducing its debt by $700 million.   It will, by the way, continue to make guns during the bankruptcy  proceedings.</p><p>And Elon Musk's boring company, and I don't mean boring as dull, I mean the  one that makes tunnels in the ground is going to sell Lego-like bricks made  from tunneling rock.  The life-sized interlocking blocks will be used to  build low-cost homes and other structures.  Those bricks will be  lightweight and durable, making them easy to assemble, Lego bricks.</p><p>Obamacare premiums are set to go up right before the midterm elections in  November.  We'll have the intel on what this could mean for both parties in  the midterms next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Health care premiums are expected to go up yet again right before  the midterm elections in November.  Now this after a battle in Congress  failed to include in last week's massive spending bill a plan to shore up  the health insurance exchanges.  No subsidies.  And without the government  money, insurance companies, well you know what they're going to do?   They're going to raise rates, right?</p><p>Gerri Willis joins us live from the newsroom with the latest on this.   Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Well, Ash, you've got that story  right.  Estimates of just how much premiums could rise, according to the  Congressional Budget Office, some 10 percent for a popular middle priced  option on the insurance exchanges and, you know, that doesn't even include  the hike to premiums that will likely occur as the mandate fades away.</p><p>Now, lawmakers on both sides are pointing fingers, Democrats blame the GOP  for failure in negotiations saying they demanded abortion restrictions  being included something they knew would be unacceptable to Democrats.  And  Republicans say this that they negotiated in good faith and Democrats  rejected reasonable rules on abortion.  Either way, the impasse means money  to shore up the Obamacare insurance exchanges was omitted from the $1.3  trillion spending plan that the President signed last week.</p><p>Failing to shore up, the exchanges could have big repercussions at the  ballot box.  A recent poll in Pennsylvania showed health care was a top  issue for 52 percent of voters according to Public Policy Polling.</p><p>Payments to insurers were stopped last year after President Trump said they  were illegal because the money had not been appropriated by Congress.   Meanwhile, insiders say that passage of legislation to stabilize the  exchanges, highly unlikely.</p><p>Ash, back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Interesting stuff.  The bottom line is those rates go up.  Gerri,  thank you very much.</p><p>Health care is expected to be one of the top issues for this year's midterm  elections.  Topping the latest \"Q-poll\" as the number one issue and poll  show that most voters feel Democrats would handle health care better, but a  new Fox poll shows the Democrats lead in the midterms is actually slipping  to just five points.  Interesting.</p><p>Joining me now, Former Bush Administration Aide, Matt Mackowiak, and  Democratic Strategist, Antjuan Seawright.  Thank you both for being here.</p><p>Matt, let me begin with you.  You could argue that health care continues to  be a problem and it was failure of the Republicans who have the House in  Senate and Oval Office to get this thing sorted out.  How would you  respond? </p><p>MATT MACKOWIAK, FORMER BUSH ADMINISTRATION AIDE:  Yes, there's no question  that Republicans promised to repeal and replace Obamacare.  The House took  two attempts and got it done.  The Senate took two attempts and failed by  one vote and so Republican voters have some frustration about that, there's  no question.  But that's going to be one be one issue the midterms are  going to be about.  They're going to be about economy, they're going to be  about direction of the country and they're ultimately going to be about the  candidates that running on both sides, you know, in each district.</p><p>The generic ballot is helpful directionally.  But ultimately every  individual race comes down to that district, comes down to the candidates  that are running, the campaigns they're running.  We saw that in  Pennsylvania 18 where the Democratic candidate ran as pro-gun, personally  anti-abortion, Democratic candidate.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  And that's not what you're going to see in a lot of other races  around the country.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Antjuan, let me ask you.  Why do you think the gap is closing in  the polls?  What do you put that down to?</p><p>ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, a couple of things here,  one, you should know that between now and November this will be a marathon,  not a sprint on both sides.</p><p>WEBSTER:  True.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  So you're going to see the polls change, go up and down from  here until November.  The second thing to remember is that the enthusiasm  gap favors the Democrats as well as history.  It is very uncommon for the  party in charge to keep their charge in the midterm elections.</p><p>And the third thing that I will tell you, if you look what is happening all  across the country, in special elections whether State House seats,  Alabama, New Jersey, Virginia, even in Pennsylvania, the voters are  speaking out very loudly.  They are rejecting the policies of Donald Trump  and the Republican Party.  I think the Republicans have a big issue in  November and what no poll will be able to tell you this point is the  massive enthusiasm we've seen from the Women's March movement just a few  months ago in Washington as well as these young people all across the  country who are organizing.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Antjuan, let me just follow up very quickly.  Matt mentioned the  economy.  The tax reform has put up more money in a lot of people's pockets  and the economy for all intents and purposes is doing very well.  If you  hang your hat on the economy, how are you going to make that argument?</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Well, I think the economy will be just one issue that voters  will decide on.  But here's the thing to remember about the economy, there  is a reason why the Republican Party did not run one single ad in  Pennsylvania about their tax scam that they passed a few months ago because  the voters do not agree what happened.</p><p>Look, that bonus they received in their check, I'm not saying it's not a  good thing but it was a shot in the arm.  What want people are raise in  wages that will sustain them long term and improve their quality of life,  and middle class families over the long term will not see that from the tax  bill that passed a few months ago by the Republicans.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Matt, let me have you respond to Antjuan.  I mean, you know, yes,  the bonuses were nice.  They weren't crumbs but they're also seeing  benefits from the tax reform paying lower taxes.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  No question.  You have about 5 million people who received  their bonus or received their wage increase because of the tax law, that's  significant.  You have the highest consumer confidence we've had in  decades.  And I can put Antjuan's mind at ease, wages are going up for  first time in a decade and that's very good news.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Well they're not, Matt, according to statistics.  According to  statistics wages are flat.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  Antjuan, I'd be happy to send you the statistics that have come  out on the last couple months that shown wages have begun rising.  So the  economy is improving.  It's strengthening.  We have 4.1 percent  unemployment and historically very, very low.</p><p>And I think Republicans everyday they aren't talking about the economy as a  waste.  They need to talk about the economy.  They need to sell the tax  law.  A majority of the public is now viewing it very favorably.  This has  a chance to save their majority even though it is very much up for grabs.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Antjuan, do you think that --</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Matt, keep in mind --</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- all right, go ahead.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  -- Matt, keep in mind, the one thing that you all have around  your neck is President Donald Trump, the most toxic President probably in  modern-day history at the top of the ticket.  Look, that is not a good  thing going into someone --</p><p>WEBSTER:  But why is his approval rating Antjuan?  Why is the President's  approval rating going up?</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  -- it may be rising from the graveyard but it has not hit  aboveground just yet.  And keep in mind, Virginia rejected, Alabama  rejected Trump, so did Pennsylvania and in districts where he carried about  20, 30 points in the last election cycle.  Democrats have been winning at  various levels of our government.  And so, you can decide however you want  to break that down, but I am telling you that something is brewing here in  this country and I don't think the way will be in favor of Republicans.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very quickly, Matt.  You know, if you're a candidate, do you want  Donald Trump to come to your town and stamp for you and, you know, get the  crowd fired up?  Would you distance yourself?</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  It totally depends on district and on the dynamics of the race  that you're in.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  In some districts, particularly in places like California you  probably don't want the President to come in.  If you're in the middle of  country, in states that Trump won, if you're running for U.S. Senate in  North Dakota or West Virginia or Montana, the President can be very  helpful.  So, they're going to have to be strategic on how they deploy him  next fall.</p><p>There's no question, his improvement has been narrowly increasing.  He's in  the middle of 30s last year.  It's in the low 40s now.  They needed to get  in the mid-40s by the midterms.  They'll have a chance to hold the House  and that's very important.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Guys, we have to leave it right there.  You know, bottom line is  a day is a long time in politics.  So, there is a long time between now and  November.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  A marathon, not a sprint.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Matt and Antjuan, great stuff as always.  Thank you  both for joining us today.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Thank you.</p><p>MACKOWIAK:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Coming up next, we got preview of tonight's new episodes of the  \"Strange Inheritance,\" including a son of a NASA chaplain who inherits more  than a 100 Bibles that went to the moon.  I kid you not.  Stay with us.   We're back in two.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Monday night on Fox Business are getting a just little bit  stranger.  Strange Inheritance is back tonight with two new episodes, one,  involving some Bibles that went all the way to the moon.  I kid you not.   Take a look.</p><p>(BEGINNING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMIE COLBY, HOST, \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\":  It's a small postage stamp.   What's on there?</p><p>JONATHAN STOUT:  That's the entire Bible.</p><p>COLBY:  On one little tiny microfiche?</p><p>STOUT:  On each sheet.</p><p>COLBY:  When it's magnified under a microscope, sure enough there is the  Holy Scripture.</p><p>STOUT:  That was my dad's dream, to get the Bible to the moon.</p><p>COLBY:  Wait, your inheritance is this little teeny-tiny Bibles went to the  moon?</p><p>COLBY:  Yes, it did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, it's fascinating.  Joining me now in the studio to chat  about all of the Strange Inheritance stamp, and it is fascinating, is the  host, Jamie Colby.</p><p>Jamie, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>COLBY:  Absolutely, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Define Bible.</p><p>COLBY:  Did you know I did not know Bibles went to the moon.</p><p>WEBSTER:  No.</p><p>COLBY:  But Reverend Stout was.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And they came back.  They weren't left there for someone to read.</p><p>COLBY:  Well, it took several attempts to get them there successfully to be  on the lunar surface.  He was really determined.  He was NASA engineer who  happened to be at Reverend and he decided this is something he wanted to  do.</p><p>So, Edgar Mitchell was the astronaut that actually took it as part of his  personal items, hundreds of them, because they were that small.  I don't  even know how many people remember microfiche but I read and the entire  Bible was there.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I'm old enough to remember microfiche at the library, you know,  you go through.</p><p>COLBY:  But here's the problem.  You want to know what their worst because  this is a business channel.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Always.</p><p>COLBY:  They are so valuable.  The individual ones have sold anywhere from  10,000 to 70,000.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You are kidding.</p><p>COLBY:  He has several hundred of them but there wasn't a will and even  though when there's a will there's a way.  When there's no will it's get  very complicated on Strange Inheritance.</p><p>So, tonight, you'll meet the family.  You'll also meet an author, Carol  Mersch, who did some investigation and story on the Bibles with Reverend  and she says, the Bibles belonged to her.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Interesting.</p><p>COLBY:  It's a little messy.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  That's the best you say.</p><p>COLBY:  The good book on demand.</p><p>WEBSTER:  When it comes with the territory, when you're talking about  things that are, you know, left behind, if the ownership part is not clear  it can get, well, down right ugly at times.  Anyway, --</p><p>COLBY:  In Texas, they're good people.  They're going to work it out.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- of course they will.  Now, also, there's another topic you're  getting into involving race cars.</p><p>COLBY:  Rave up you engine because --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Best car?</p><p>COLBY:  -- this family, actually the father, Mickey Thompson, broke the  land speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats on what he called the  Challenger.  It's a piston-driven engine that goes 400 plus miles.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Look at that.  Oh my God!</p><p>COLBY:  Wait till you see me in it.  But anyway I degrease that so much  fun.  I could almost knock it out.  It's so high speed.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You still be in and out.</p><p>COLBY:  It was amazing.  So, Danny is his son and he was determined to  break his dad's land speed record because for all the years his father told  him, no racing, it's dangerous.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Oh, my God.  Yes.</p><p>COLBY:  The last thing his father said to him is I'm giving you the  Challenger.  I want you to race it and now, he's determined to make sure  that the Thompson family keeps that record.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Fascinating.

Jamie, thank you very much.</p><p>Let's take a look at the market for you.  What a day.  We said it's a Jamie  Colby effect.  It was going to hit 600 points, nearly Jamie.  Good.  We're  up 564 points.</p><p>Liz Claman, by the way, is back from, I think, she went skiing.  I think  she went old fancy and went out west to go skiing.</p><p>We saw some picture, Liz.

Yes, they'll  send a car right over to take him down there, I think.  Neil Cavuto.   Thanks, Neil.  Appreciate it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CAVUTO:  All right, bud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> WEBSTER:  Breaking right now, stocks are soaring after new reports suggest  that the White House is quietly negotiating with China as both sides tried  to avoid an all-out trade war.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Hello, everybody.  I'm Ashley Webster, in today for Trish Regan.  And  welcome, everyone, to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p> Well, investors are encourage by the prospect of the world's two largest  economies reaching the deal on trade as stocks bounce back from their worst  week in more than two years and optimism apparently spreading beyond Wall  Street.  Here is Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin speaking to Fox News just  yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  I think we're working on a pathway to  see if we can reach an agreement as to what fair trade is for them to open  up their markets, reduce their tariffs, stop force-technology transfer.   These are all the things we want to do.  But in a negotiation, you have to  be prepared to take action and that's what President Trump is doing.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WEBSTER:  He certainly is.  The President displaying his confidence in our  economy in a tweet this morning saying, \"The economy is looking really  good.  It has been years that we have seen these kind of numbers.  The  underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.\"  And we'll  find out ow those companies are doing, of course, next month with the  latest round of earnings.</p><p> Joining me now Forbes Media Chairman, the man himself, Steve Forbes.  And,  Steve, thank you very much for joining us today in the studio.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  OK.  Let's just pick up from what the President said, are you  happy with the U.S. economy heading in the right direction.  Is it healthy?</p><p> FORBES:  I think it is healthy.  And I think there were news coming out  about negotiating with China and these trade disputes is a good thing  because one of the things this imposition of tariffs would have done is  create uncertainty.  Is this thing going to spin out of control?</p><p> On the steel side for Japan and China is now been exempted to further  negotiations.  On the Chinese side, working behind the scenes see what can  be done.  So I think the markets and investors will be reassured, OK, we  can invest.  They're not going to let this thing spin out of control.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Even though, let's be honest, the way its approach is a little  chaotic.  The Trump administration and it was on this campaign promise  list, if you like, so it's not a big surprise but it really did shake the  markets.  But is this, in your opinion, a classic Donald Trump maneuver?   Shoot very high, come out strong, and then bring someone to the table and  negotiate perhaps something a little lower?</p><p> FORBES:  Well, I think, that it would have been better for him and for the  economy and investing confidence if they had first, especially with China,  negotiated with our European allies, saying we know there are abusers.  Our  allies know there are abusers.  We're going to present the United Front.</p><p> Here's what we're going to put on the table.  So, you've done that kind of  preparation, one, the market wouldn't have freaked out and, two, everyone  would have acknowledged, yes, this thing has to be addressed.</p><p> WEBSTER:  These market actions are remarkable.  I was on the 3:00 show last  week when we had a 400 point drop and a 700 point drop.  Here we go again,  the volatility is back.  Everything seems now is headline driven.  Is that  going to be the way for awhile now, do you believe?</p><p> FORBES:  Well, this is going to depend on what you've referred to early.   These earnings are starting to come out next month.  But it looks like  Corporate America is starting to still turning in good profits.</p><p> People say, OK, things are still being done, things are moving ahead.   Heck, there was even a story this weekend about \"Brexit\" in Britain.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  But for all the hoopla in parliament and the disarray and the  ineffective prime minister, things are happening in the economy.  It's  amazing.  Government leaves it alone.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Despite everything.</p><p> FORBES:  People do things.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Well, it's interesting.  How much attention does the market or  investors pay to what's going on in Washington, because every day there's  some headline coming out, whether it's the President's personal lawyer  quits or whatever it'd be the story de jure.  Does that have an impact on  the markets?  Are people able to put the noise aside?</p><p> FORBES:  Most of the noise they put aside, as we've seen with the markets  reaction to recently, when concerns about what's going to happen on the  trade front came to the forefront.  That's when markets thought, my golly,  are they going to let this thing spin out of control?  Are they going to  control it?  And so, they respond to that kind of news, not to the latest  thing on \"60 Minutes\" or anything else.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I know.  That's not even news as far I can see it.  But anyway,  we'll move on.</p><p> I have to ask you about Facebook, because in light of the 444 point gain  today on Wall Street, it's been striking what we've seen with the selling  on Facebook and the hits it continues to take today.  We found out the  Federal Trade Commission has begun the investigation.  Do you have a  Facebook page?</p><p> FORBES:  I do and even own a few shares of Facebook.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.  What's your take on all of this?</p><p> FORBES:  But I think it's a case where management has flubbed the ball.   This thing could have been contained from the beginning, be upfront about  it.  Outline what you're going to do to prevent abuses by users.</p><p> Yes, the users violated the contract.  But what follow-up did you have?   What kind of auditing did you have?</p><p> Reassure that you're on top of the things, instead of look like you're  floundering, you don't know what to do.  You want to go on apology tour.   That freaks people out that you're not in charge.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Is this redeemable at this stage because it's a very good chance  to, as Neil Cavuto said, look, he's going to be down in Washington  testifying?</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, and that's like I have an offer you can't refuse kind of  invitation.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  That's going to be critical because that will determine the fate  of the stocks in the months ahead, if he goes before the committee and  says, here's what happened, here's what we're outlining doing.  We think  we're on top of this thing, present a role that he is in charge and  reassuring and confident, instead of floundering.</p><p> WEBSTER:  We haven't seen it so far.</p><p> FORBES:  We haven't seen it, but this is his chance to do it.  I hope he is  prepping for this thing in a way people say, OK, the government is not  going to really move in a big way because if the government moves in, that  stock is going to be killed.</p><p> WEBSTER:  It is.  And we're talking about new regulations which could  further crimp the business model of Facebook and other social media  companies.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, and not only Facebook but it means they're going to end up  gumming up a lot of other high-tech companies and high-tech start-ups.  We  don't have the resources to fight this kind thing.  So a lot is on his  shoulder.  I hope the shoulders are broad --</p><p> WEBSTER:  But don't blow it as they say, Steve.</p><p> FORBES:  -- well, he brought it on.</p><p> WEBSTER:  He did, that's very true.  Steve, thank you very much.  Great  stuff as always.</p><p> FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  For more on these markets, let's bring in the Stock Swoosh  Founder, Melissa Armo, along with Surevest Wealth Management CEO, Rob Luna.</p><p> Melissa, let me get to you.  What's your take on the markets right now?   You need some Pepto-Bismol, don't you?  We had a big selloff last week and  now here were are up 443 points.  Is pretty much this volatility here to  stay?</p><p> MELISSA ARMO, THE STOCK SWOOSH:  Volatility is here to stay.  Came in in  2018.  I don't think it's going anywhere.</p><p> I really didn't look today as a strong day.  I know we gapped up a lot this  morning.  But overall, this is just kind of like a dead-cat bounce, it's  something that traders use the terminology.</p><p> I really think we might still be lower, because the fact is that overall  the market is strong but everything that happens, every headline that comes  out, every news thing, the market is reacting very volatile to it, selling  off quickly and then bouncing again and selling off quickly.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> ARMO:  And the range is broadening.  We're still strong but the range from  the high to where we're at in this base is like wide, it's getting wider  and wider and wider.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Well, it's interesting because, Rob, you say, look, we are  trading in a range but to Melissa's point, that range is like the size of  the Grand Canyon right now.</p><p> ROB LUNA, CEO, SUREVEST WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Well, it's like the size of the  Grand Canyon.  If you look at the minuscule ranges that we're trading in  over the prior 18 to 24 months but I think, you know, in general, there's  11 to 12 percentage point range that we're trading in, you know, quiet  honestly, Ashley, is normal.  And we got up towards the end at the top of  that range, all this headline risk, whether it's tariffs, it's raising  interest rates, the market is looking for reason to sell.  It got it, now  we're back towards the bottom in this range.</p><p> And what you're seeing is, as we hit the 200-day moving average support,  buyers are starting to come back in this morning.  But I look at that last  hour, the last hour is going to be very telling to see if we can hold up  today.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  Good luck predicting where it's going go.  Let me follow-up  with you then, Rob.  You say, look, as far as where the economy goes it's  all flashing green.</p><p> We just spoke with Steve Forbes.  He agrees the economy is doing well.  We  get the earnings next month, assuming they're pretty solid, how important  is that for this market?</p><p> LUNA:  I think it's extremely important, right, because there is a lot of  headline risk out there.  Right now, investors are definitely nervous.  So  they need this reassurance from Wall Street, from the companies, from the  CEOs out there telling them the things are still good.  And I think if that  happens, we can head back towards the top of that range, and like we said,  that could be eight to 10 percentage-point move.  So, if you're an investor  you don't necessarily would be on the sidelines and miss out on that.</p><p> WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  Melissa, I spoke with a Money manager this  morning who said, look, I'm looking for a sector that has the least  downside, the most upside.  And I'm thinking, well, yes, we're all doing  that, right?  He said that sector was energy is being beaten down too much  and has a long way to go on the upside.  What do you say?</p><p> ARMO:  I don't agree with that.  I like the idea of banks strengths.  So  right now, the strongest things out there are banks and the tech sector  except for Facebook.  Take Facebook out of that equation, which is  unfortunate.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> ARMO:  But someone like Amazon, Netflix, Apple, I still like Google still  looks good and the banks, J.P. Morgan Chase.  I mean, I still think that  you buy strong stocks.  They're coming in, weak though.  Don't buy yet.   Wait until they're showing strength for about a week, two weeks.</p><p> You want to see consecutive green, green days just like we follow-through  and rally today and all next week into the start of April, that will be a  good time, come second-quarter earnings season to start getting back into  the strong stuff.  I don't want to buy stuff that's weak, that's down a  lot, that has a huge upside.  I want to buy stuff that's proving, that is  strong even when the market was falling last week.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.  And, Rob, you know, that has been the tech stocks.  A lot  of money has gone into tech over the last 18 months and beyond.  Is that  still the leading sector, these big tech companies, or are you seeing money  go elsewhere?</p><p> LUNA:  Yes, you know, I think so, Ashley.  You know, really if you were  looking at rising interest rates right now, the only way that your  portfolio is going to be able to combat that is through growth.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> LUNA:  And it's very tough to get top-line growth outside of technology  right now.  The financials could definitely do it but, you know, they're  actually been struggling here quite a bit.  So, I'm a little bit nervous  about what's going on with them.</p><p> But the old technology stocks, Amazon, Google, two of our top, you know,  largest holdings right now, we're continuing to stick with them.  And, I  agree, momentum is where you want to be but I don't know that you  necessarily wait for them to completely break out.  Use this opportunity  when they're pulling back technically to enter into positions.  And, you  know, 10 percent to 15 percent from where they were at before is a pretty  attractive entry point in our view.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Melissa, I want to ask you the same question I asked Steve  Forbes.  Do you think all the noise is coming out of Washington that at  this point investors pay much attention or does it have an impact on the  market?</p><p> ARMO:  Of course, it does have an impact on the market.  All you have to do  is look last week or even look back the February.  It's unfortunate because  I think the market is going to shake all of this off.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> ARMO:  But you can't ignore it.  We live in 24 hour, seven day week news  cycle.  Every time you get up, you see this thing, that thing, the other  thing.  Mr. Forbes is talking about \"60 Minutes,\" I mean even something  like that could affected the market this morning.</p><p> WEBSTER:  That's true.</p><p> ARMO:  You can't escape it.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  Rob, what do you tell to your clients?  Ignore it, just  focus on fundamentals of these companies?</p><p> LUNA:  Yes, that's exactly it.  I mean, when you look at this whole noise  about the trade tariffs, we have $375 billion deficit right now.  You know,  what was on the table is only $60 billion.  These are not huge numbers  right now.</p><p> And let's face it, Trump is not going to get any, you know, style points  for finesse here.  This is his negotiation style.</p><p> WEBSTER:  No.</p><p> LUNA:  He's trying to get China to the table.  I think it's a lot of noise  right now and investors should just pay attention to the fundamentals.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Wise words indeed from both of you.  Melissa, Rob, thanks you  very much for joining us today.</p><p> ARMO:  Thanks.</p><p> LUNA:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  The Dow up, by the way, 500 points above 24,000.  One of those  days.</p><p> Well, indeed, there may be a rally on Wall Street but shares of Facebook  taking another hit after the FTC says it is investigating the company.  Can  Mark Zuckerberg fix this mess?  Our panel discusses it next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Facebook start taking another leg down after the Federal Trade  Commission announced it was investigating Facebook's privacy practices.   Plus, 37 states attorneys general want to know when Facebook actually knew  about that massive data breach.  And the Senate Judiciary Committee goes on  and on, doesn't it, as invited, I say invited, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and  other tech leaders to testify April 10th, an offer they can't refuse as  someone put it.</p><p> And yes, the headaches keep coming.  A new report claims that Facebook logs  all your calls and texts, it is.  And you probably have no idea that's  happening either.</p><p> Joining me now to talk about this \"Wall Street Journal\" Senior Reporter,  Shelby Holliday, and our very own, Deirdre Bolton.  Thank you both for  being here.</p><p> Shelby, let me begin with you.  I don't know if you heard what Steve Forbes  had to say but he basically said, Mark Zuckerberg dropped the ball on this  and has to really be very careful this time on how he approaches it from  now on.  He has to instill confidence and he has to get it right.  What  we've seen up to now doesn't necessarily suggest he's able to do that.</p><p> SHELBY HOLLIDAY,  SENIOR REPORTER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  He's got to  be honest because there are number of issues Facebook is dealing with right  now, whether it's Russian meddling, Cambridge Analytica use of data, the  cellphone and messages scraping if you will.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  But the underlying theme for all of this is that users were not  aware their data was being used against them.  So now there's a lot of  outrage.  People are pledging to quit Facebook.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  They're calling for answers.  You're hearing lawmakers really  wanting the CEOs to get on the Hill and answer some of these questions.   But Mark Zuckerberg is still continuing to sort of let this drip instead of  just getting all the answers out there, confronting all of the problems  they have and, quite frankly, being honest with all of the users, the two  billion users Facebook has.</p><p> A lot of them when I talk to them, and I'm doing my reporting, still have  no idea that they followed Russian accounts.  So they're getting it from  journalists, rather than the company itself.</p><p> WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  And Deirdre, you know, we hear today the  FTC is getting involved.  What could that mean?</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  So that's like we're going to be --  one of the bigger questions is shall we -- you know, they had an agreement  going back to 2011.  So we should just say this is not the first time that  the FTC and Facebook have sat down together.  This is actually Facebook's  second strike at that with the FTC.</p><p> So in 2011, they had an agreement about privacy, about use of data that  Facebook agreed to.  So I think one of the questions that Facebook is now  going to have to answer is, did they follow the guidelines that they said  they would in 2011?</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> BOLTON:  If it's found not, just start tacking on millions of dollars in  fees, without even talking about potential regulation.  But it's just  actually literally going to cost them.  So I think that's going to be one  of the bigger questions.</p><p> I know with the android, so-called scraping.  I actually spoke with  somebody who said Facebook in legal thing, oh, but users did have the opt  out.  So once again, it's always the own us is on the user and we just  keeping reminding ourselves, right, authors or media is you're not paying  for the products, you are the product.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> BOLTON:  So there is a bit of a buyer beware, which I think the Facebook  legal side is going to try its best to argue.  But I think long story  short, honestly, this just opens the doors, as you said, invited to D.C.  are now Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, of course, for Twitter and Larry Page  for Google.  So I think, you know, what are these companies doing, how are  they protecting our data?  That's why the FTC is involved.</p><p> And you have spoken often with Scott Galloway, who's a professor at NYU --</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, yes.</p><p> BOLTON:  -- who actually believes there will be a call to break up big  tech.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> BOLTON:  And he just wrote a book about this saying, it's going to come  from Europe, because as he points out, Europe has all of the downside and  none of the upside of big tech.  Whereas, at least, we, in our country can  brag like, oh, these are great businesses, we grow it here but Europe has  none of that.  They just have the downside.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, they just rely on finding the big American companies as part  of their budget.</p><p> BOLTON:  Right, yes.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Shelby, let me ask you, should there be a presumption of privacy  when you're posting on something that's so public as Facebook?</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  That's a good question.  You know, I think, throughout this  debate what's getting lost is that users do have responsibility.  We share  TMI, to much information, all the time.  So I definitely think if nothing  else alerts people to the fact that their data is being used and they're  sharing perhaps --</p><p> BORTON:  Cambridge Analytica is saying, though, it was like quiz, though --</p><p> WEBSTER:  It was.</p><p> BOLTON:  -- and was like a personality profile.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  -- when you took this quiz years ago you had no idea it would  come back to be served in your face in a political sense.  And I think --  someone I spoke to last week made a really great point.  Democracy is sort  of built on this idea of open ideas, open debate.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  And when you're sending targeted messages to people that no one  knows what they say, no one knows how they might be manipulated there's no  way for candidates or companies to refute these claims.  They don't know  what's being sent.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I get the sense.  We have to wrap this up.  But I get the sense  with Facebook is they really don't have any idea how much of your  information is out there as we speak.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  No clue.  And Zuckerberg is actually admitted that.</p><p> BOLTON:  I think they built a machine that they can't manage.  It's two  billion users.  It's too big even for them.</p><p> And you recall after our scandal, right, in the run-up to the U.S.  Presidential election, 125 million U.S. voters saw that data.  They hired  1000 editors, 1000 editors with two billion users?  That proportion needs  to be up.  But then it cuts into profit margins if you're going to hire  more humans.</p><p> WEBSTER:  It's going to be very interesting.  And we're going to be talking  about it for a while.  Great stuff.  Shelby, Deirdre, thank you so much.   Appreciate it.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  Thank you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  President Trump, well, he's getting tough on Russia.  The  President ordering 60 Russian diplomats to pack their bags and get out of  the U.S.  It's in retaliation for the toxic nerve agent attack on a former  Russian spy and his daughter on British soil.  So what does this mean for  U.S.-Russia relations from here?  We'll talk about it next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  President Trump is expelling 60 Russian diplomats from the U.S.  and is closing a Russian consulate in Seattle.  This is in response to the  nerve agent attack on an ex-Russian spy in the U.K. earlier this month.   Now, the U.S. is joining at least 17 other countries in kicking out Russian  diplomats making it the biggest western expulsion of Russian  representatives since the height of the Cold War.  Interesting stuff.</p><p> Here now with more, Philip Wegmann.  He's a Commentary Writer for the  \"Washington Examiner.\"</p><p> Philip, do you think, do you get the sense that Vladmir Putin  underestimated the response to this nerve agent attack in Britain?  What is  going through in his mind right now?</p><p> PHILIP WEGMANN, COMMENTARY WRITER, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  Well if Putin  underestimated the response to that attack, he certainly understands the  message that the Trump administration is sending right now.  Remember,  Putin is an old KGB hand and he is not going to miss the significance of  the Trump administration kicking out 60 Russian diplomats and also closing  that consulate in Seattle.</p><p> The message here is clear.  It's that Russian cannot expect to manhandle  our allies and get away with it.  You can't perform these extra judicial  executions on our allies' foreign soil.  And, I think, we're just going to  turn a blind eye.</p><p> WEBSTER:  But is it symbolic?  I mean, what impact does it really have?   Sixty Russian diplomats and representatives go back to Moscow.  Does it put  a serious dent in the intelligence-gathering network?</p><p> WEGMANN:  Absolutely.  If you look at those diplomats, there were 60 of  them and they were in Seattle, Washington, close to not only some of our  sub-bases but also close to Boeing Manufacturing.  So for us to push them  out, that is significant blow to their intelligence gathering network.</p><p> And I think that what the Trump administration needs to do right now is  they need to follow-up this strong action with strong words from the  President.  He needs to show that he's serious about this threat, because,  frankly, a lot of people still don't know that this President now, by  expelling those 60 Russian agents, has sent more Russians out of the  country than President Obama did after the election with regard to the  election meddling.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.  So we're fully expecting a tit-for-tat.  We've seen the  Russians do that with the U.K. when the U.K. kicked out 23 diplomats, same  thing happened in Moscow.  Probably the same thing is going to happen in  the U.S.  Does that not hurt our intelligence-gathering abilities in  Russia?</p><p> WEGMANN:  Well, you're absolutely right.  Already the Russian embassy is  tweeting this morning somewhat tongue-in-cheek, where and which consulates  should be kicked out of Russia.  You know, which of our agents should get  the boot.  And I think that because this is so pointed and this definitely  is a blow at Russian intelligence, that Putin and company, they are going  to strike back hard but the Trump administration has shown resolve, steel  in this area.  And now that John Bolton is joining the administration,  someone who is a Russia hawk, I think we're going to see a much stronger  response from the White House.</p><p> WEBSTER:  How could have -- assuming this went all the way to Mr. Putin and  he gave the OK for this, and we don't know that for sure, but it certainly  appears that way, what was he trying to achieve?  He had to know that  something like this so brazen would have consequences.</p><p> WEGMANN:  Well, the Russians are always trying to push the envelope and  they're also very symbolic in the way that they carryout these executions.   If you look at the type of nerve agent that was used, that was a clear  calling card because that is an agent that was manufactured specifically in  Russia.  So he had to know there were these insidious bread crumbs that  were going to lead back to the Kremlin.</p><p> I think what we're seeing here is that after the 2016 election, Putin is  trying to feel out what he can do, how hard he can go after the United  States.  What we're seeing here is that Trump at least, with this reaction  is showing that we are not going to back down from the world stage.  That  we are going to stand strong in our relations with some of our longest  standing allies.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I have to leave it right there.  It'd be fascinating to follow  what happens next.  Philip, thank you so much for joining us.  Appreciate  it and thanks for your comments.</p><p> We are, of course, keeping a close eye on the markets for years.  Stocks  rally over trade talks, not a trade war.  The market up 556 points now on  the Dow, up at 24,083.</p><p> Also ahead, the court battle is underway to decide the fate of the AT&amp;T  merger with Time Warner.  Right now, top broadcasting executives are  testifying on what this merger would mean for them.  We'll have the intel  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Witnesses are taken the stand today as the Department of Justice  tries to block a potential multibillion dollar deal between AT&amp;T and Time  Warner.  Joining me from the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., is  our very own Connell McShane with the latest.</p><p> Hey, Connell.</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey there, Ashley.  Well, the  court is just about to resume, to be back in session, coming back from one  of your favorite activities, an extended lunch break which the judge took  and for him the judge in this case, Richard Leon, this is a working lunch.   It's kind of a strange morning.</p><p> We're waiting to hear from these two key executives in the cable industry.   One of these guys named Warren Schlichting, a head of a Sling T.V., a DISH  Network and the other is John Martin, the Chairman of CEO at Turner.</p><p> As the government tries to build this antitrust case and tries to block  this merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, I say it's a strange morning because  what happened to us, just before the Department of Justice was to call its  first witness of the day, the government lawyer asked the judge to approach  the bench.  And then for two hours, all the lawyers and the judge were  talking.</p><p> Now, we're in the courtroom, we couldn't hear what they were saying so we  don't know exactly what the issues were but we were told by judge, Leon,  that some issues did come up and he had a number of e-mails to review.  So  he said let's take a longer break than usual.  I'll review those e-mails  and I'll come back and have some rulings and maybe we can proceed in the  afternoon.  So we'll see if we get that testimony.  It could be important.</p><p> Just to get you up to speed, Ashley, in where we are.  In this last week,  the Justice Department started to make its case.  Its basic case is that if  these companies are allowed to combine, AT&amp;T and Time Warner, it would be  unfair and consumers would pay the price.  They'd paid higher prices that  AT&amp;T would be able to kind of weaponize Time Warner to use the Justice  Department's terms there and takes its networks HBO, and CNN, TNT, TBS to  be able to leverage those with DirecTV service and increase prices.</p><p> The companies are comeback and argued that the Justice Department's case is  fundamentally stuck in the past.  They say the game is completely changed  what to do competition from the tech companies whether the, Hulu, Netflix  and the likes.  So we're just getting started here, what could be a six to  eight week trial.  We'll see what this afternoon brings.</p><p> Back to you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  So a lot of talking so far today, Connell, and you couldn't hear  one word of it?</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Great stuff.  All right.  It's going to be a long six weeks, my  friend.  Enjoy those working lunches.</p><p> MCSHANE:  I know.</p><p> WEBSTER:  All right, Connell McShane down in D.C. on the latest development  in AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger case.</p><p> Stops our rallying as investors cheer on reports of trade negotiations,  nice press negotiations between the U.S. and China.  Let's go to the floor  of the New York Stock Exchange, where our very own Nicole Petallides has  the latest.</p><p> Big sell-off last week?  We're up 545 points.  Nicole?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  That's right.  So cooler  heads prevailed for today but big picture, people think of the hard time  committing to that is going to be a great 2018 because there are so many  factors up in the air, they're looking at technicals.</p><p> Right now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 545 points, the S&amp;P 500 is  up, 2.1 percent.  Third day in a row of two percent move.  Thursday, Friday  down two percent each of those days and today up two percent.  So the  volatility is here.</p><p> Tech, we have this interesting dichotomy, fang, right?  Facebook being the  F.  There's seems to be a separation on this one.

We'll have the intel on what this could mean for both parties in  the midterms next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Health care premiums are expected to go up yet again right before  the midterm elections in November.  Now this after a battle in Congress  failed to include in last week's massive spending bill a plan to shore up  the health insurance exchanges.  No subsidies.  And without the government  money, insurance companies, well you know what they're going to do?   They're going to raise rates, right?</p><p> Gerri Willis joins us live from the newsroom with the latest on this.   Gerri.</p><p> GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Well, Ash, you've got that story  right.  Estimates of just how much premiums could rise, according to the  Congressional Budget Office, some 10 percent for a popular middle priced  option on the insurance exchanges and, you know, that doesn't even include  the hike to premiums that will likely occur as the mandate fades away.</p><p> Now, lawmakers on both sides are pointing fingers, Democrats blame the GOP  for failure in negotiations saying they demanded abortion restrictions  being included something they knew would be unacceptable to Democrats.  And  Republicans say this that they negotiated in good faith and Democrats  rejected reasonable rules on abortion.  Either way, the impasse means money  to shore up the Obamacare insurance exchanges was omitted from the $1.3  trillion spending plan that the President signed last week.</p><p> Failing to shore up, the exchanges could have big repercussions at the  ballot box.  A recent poll in Pennsylvania showed health care was a top  issue for 52 percent of voters according to Public Policy Polling.</p><p> Payments to insurers were stopped last year after President Trump said they  were illegal because the money had not been appropriated by Congress.   Meanwhile, insiders say that passage of legislation to stabilize the  exchanges, highly unlikely.</p><p> Ash, back to you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Interesting stuff.  The bottom line is those rates go up.  Gerri,  thank you very much.</p><p> Health care is expected to be one of the top issues for this year's midterm  elections.  Topping the latest \"Q-poll\" as the number one issue and poll  show that most voters feel Democrats would handle health care better, but a  new Fox poll shows the Democrats lead in the midterms is actually slipping  to just five points.  Interesting.</p><p> Joining me now, Former Bush Administration Aide, Matt Mackowiak, and  Democratic Strategist, Antjuan Seawright.  Thank you both for being here.</p><p> Matt, let me begin with you.  You could argue that health care continues to  be a problem and it was failure of the Republicans who have the House in  Senate and Oval Office to get this thing sorted out.  How would you  respond? </p><p> MATT MACKOWIAK, FORMER BUSH ADMINISTRATION AIDE:  Yes, there's no question  that Republicans promised to repeal and replace Obamacare.  The House took  two attempts and got it done.  The Senate took two attempts and failed by  one vote and so Republican voters have some frustration about that, there's  no question.  But that's going to be one be one issue the midterms are  going to be about.  They're going to be about economy, they're going to be  about direction of the country and they're ultimately going to be about the  candidates that running on both sides, you know, in each district.</p><p> The generic ballot is helpful directionally.  But ultimately every  individual race comes down to that district, comes down to the candidates  that are running, the campaigns they're running.  We saw that in  Pennsylvania 18 where the Democratic candidate ran as pro-gun, personally  anti-abortion, Democratic candidate.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  And that's not what you're going to see in a lot of other races  around the country.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Antjuan, let me ask you.  Why do you think the gap is closing in  the polls?  What do you put that down to?</p><p> ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, a couple of things here,  one, you should know that between now and November this will be a marathon,  not a sprint on both sides.</p><p> WEBSTER:  True.</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  So you're going to see the polls change, go up and down from  here until November.  The second thing to remember is that the enthusiasm  gap favors the Democrats as well as history.  It is very uncommon for the  party in charge to keep their charge in the midterm elections.</p><p> And the third thing that I will tell you, if you look what is happening all  across the country, in special elections whether State House seats,  Alabama, New Jersey, Virginia, even in Pennsylvania, the voters are  speaking out very loudly.  They are rejecting the policies of Donald Trump  and the Republican Party.  I think the Republicans have a big issue in  November and what no poll will be able to tell you this point is the  massive enthusiasm we've seen from the Women's March movement just a few  months ago in Washington as well as these young people all across the  country who are organizing.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Antjuan, let me just follow up very quickly.  Matt mentioned the  economy.  The tax reform has put up more money in a lot of people's pockets  and the economy for all intents and purposes is doing very well.  If you  hang your hat on the economy, how are you going to make that argument?</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Well, I think the economy will be just one issue that voters  will decide on.  But here's the thing to remember about the economy, there  is a reason why the Republican Party did not run one single ad in  Pennsylvania about their tax scam that they passed a few months ago because  the voters do not agree what happened.</p><p> Look, that bonus they received in their check, I'm not saying it's not a  good thing but it was a shot in the arm.  What want people are raise in  wages that will sustain them long term and improve their quality of life,  and middle class families over the long term will not see that from the tax  bill that passed a few months ago by the Republicans.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Matt, let me have you respond to Antjuan.  I mean, you know, yes,  the bonuses were nice.  They weren't crumbs but they're also seeing  benefits from the tax reform paying lower taxes.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  No question.  You have about 5 million people who received  their bonus or received their wage increase because of the tax law, that's  significant.  You have the highest consumer confidence we've had in  decades.  And I can put Antjuan's mind at ease, wages are going up for  first time in a decade and that's very good news.</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Well they're not, Matt, according to statistics.  According to  statistics wages are flat.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  Antjuan, I'd be happy to send you the statistics that have come  out on the last couple months that shown wages have begun rising.  So the  economy is improving.  It's strengthening.  We have 4.1 percent  unemployment and historically very, very low.</p><p> And I think Republicans everyday they aren't talking about the economy as a  waste.  They need to talk about the economy.  They need to sell the tax  law.  A majority of the public is now viewing it very favorably.  This has  a chance to save their majority even though it is very much up for grabs.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Antjuan, do you think that --</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Matt, keep in mind --</p><p> WEBSTER:  -- all right, go ahead.</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  -- Matt, keep in mind, the one thing that you all have around  your neck is President Donald Trump, the most toxic President probably in  modern-day history at the top of the ticket.  Look, that is not a good  thing going into someone --</p><p> WEBSTER:  But why is his approval rating Antjuan?  Why is the President's  approval rating going up?</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  -- it may be rising from the graveyard but it has not hit  aboveground just yet.  And keep in mind, Virginia rejected, Alabama  rejected Trump, so did Pennsylvania and in districts where he carried about  20, 30 points in the last election cycle.  Democrats have been winning at  various levels of our government.  And so, you can decide however you want  to break that down, but I am telling you that something is brewing here in  this country and I don't think the way will be in favor of Republicans.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Very quickly, Matt.  You know, if you're a candidate, do you want  Donald Trump to come to your town and stamp for you and, you know, get the  crowd fired up?  Would you distance yourself?</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  It totally depends on district and on the dynamics of the race  that you're in.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  In some districts, particularly in places like California you  probably don't want the President to come in.  If you're in the middle of  country, in states that Trump won, if you're running for U.S. Senate in  North Dakota or West Virginia or Montana, the President can be very  helpful.  So, they're going to have to be strategic on how they deploy him  next fall.</p><p> There's no question, his improvement has been narrowly increasing.  He's in  the middle of 30s last year.  It's in the low 40s now.  They needed to get  in the mid-40s by the midterms.  They'll have a chance to hold the House  and that's very important.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Guys, we have to leave it right there.  You know, bottom line is  a day is a long time in politics.  So, there is a long time between now and  November.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  A marathon, not a sprint.</p><p> WEBSTER:  All right.  Matt and Antjuan, great stuff as always.  Thank you  both for joining us today.</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Thank you.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  Thank you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Coming up next, we got preview of tonight's new episodes of the  \"Strange Inheritance,\" including a son of a NASA chaplain who inherits more  than a 100 Bibles that went to the moon.  I kid you not.  Stay with us.   We're back in two.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Monday night on Fox Business are getting a just little bit  stranger.  Strange Inheritance is back tonight with two new episodes, one,  involving some Bibles that went all the way to the moon.  I kid you not.   Take a look.</p><p> (BEGINNING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAMIE COLBY, HOST, \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\":  It's a small postage stamp.   What's on there?</p><p> JONATHAN STOUT:  That's the entire Bible.</p><p> COLBY:  On one little tiny microfiche?</p><p> STOUT:  On each sheet.</p><p> COLBY:  When it's magnified under a microscope, sure enough there is the  Holy Scripture.</p><p> STOUT:  That was my dad's dream, to get the Bible to the moon.</p><p> COLBY:  Wait, your inheritance is this little teeny-tiny Bibles went to the  moon?</p><p> COLBY:  Yes, it did.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WEBSTER:  You know, it's fascinating.  Joining me now in the studio to chat  about all of the Strange Inheritance stamp, and it is fascinating, is the  host, Jamie Colby.</p><p> Jamie, thank you so much for being here.</p><p> COLBY:  Absolutely, Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Define Bible.</p><p> COLBY:  Did you know I did not know Bibles went to the moon.</p><p> WEBSTER:  No.</p><p> COLBY:  But Reverend Stout was.</p><p> WEBSTER:  And they came back.  They weren't left there for someone to read.</p><p> COLBY:  Well, it took several attempts to get them there successfully to be  on the lunar surface.  He was really determined.  He was NASA engineer who  happened to be at Reverend and he decided this is something he wanted to  do.</p><p> So, Edgar Mitchell was the astronaut that actually took it as part of his  personal items, hundreds of them, because they were that small.  I don't  even know how many people remember microfiche but I read and the entire  Bible was there.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I'm old enough to remember microfiche at the library, you know,  you go through.</p><p> COLBY:  But here's the problem.  You want to know what their worst because  this is a business channel.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Always.</p><p> COLBY:  They are so valuable.  The individual ones have sold anywhere from  10,000 to 70,000.</p><p> WEBSTER:  You are kidding.</p><p> COLBY:  He has several hundred of them but there wasn't a will and even  though when there's a will there's a way.  When there's no will it's get  very complicated on Strange Inheritance.</p><p> So, tonight, you'll meet the family.  You'll also meet an author, Carol  Mersch, who did some investigation and story on the Bibles with Reverend  and she says, the Bibles belonged to her.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Interesting.</p><p> COLBY:  It's a little messy.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  That's the best you say.</p><p> COLBY:  The good book on demand.</p><p> WEBSTER:  When it comes with the territory, when you're talking about  things that are, you know, left behind, if the ownership part is not clear  it can get, well, down right ugly at times.  Anyway, --</p><p> COLBY:  In Texas, they're good people.  They're going to work it out.</p><p> WEBSTER:  -- of course they will.  Now, also, there's another topic you're  getting into involving race cars.</p><p> COLBY:  Rave up you engine because --</p><p> WEBSTER:  Best car?</p><p> COLBY:  -- this family, actually the father, Mickey Thompson, broke the  land speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats on what he called the  Challenger.  It's a piston-driven engine that goes 400 plus miles.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Look at that.  Oh my God!</p><p> COLBY:  Wait till you see me in it.  But anyway I degrease that so much  fun.  I could almost knock it out.  It's so high speed.</p><p> WEBSTER:  You still be in and out.</p><p> COLBY:  It was amazing.  So, Danny is his son and he was determined to  break his dad's land speed record because for all the years his father told  him, no racing, it's dangerous.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Oh, my God.  Yes.</p><p> COLBY:  The last thing his father said to him is I'm giving you the  Challenger.  I want you to race it and now, he's determined to make sure  that the Thompson family keeps that record.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Fascinating.  The air tonight beginning at?</p><p> COLBY:  9:00 to 9:30.</p><p> WEBSTER:  9:00 to 9:30.</p><p> COLBY:  Come on over.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I'd love it.  I want to try that car, break the land speed record  or may be not.  At least you got of it, that's the main thing.</p><p> COLBY:  Wear your seatbelt, Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, always.  Jamie, thank you very much.</p><p> Let's take a look at the market for you.  What a day.  We said it's a Jamie  Colby effect.  It was going to hit 600 points, nearly Jamie.  Good.  We're  up 564 points.</p><p> Liz Claman, by the way, is back from, I think, she went skiing.  I think  she went old fancy and went out west to go skiing.</p><p> We saw some picture, Liz.  You looked terrific out there.  And you're into  friend.  I think you ride into Peter Toughman (ph) </p><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Can you believe that.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Of all of people, I mean, it's a small world because Peter  Toughman works down at the New York Exchange.  He's the guy with that crazy  hair and the glasses.  And he's taking picture when the markets doing crazy  thing.</p><p> CLAMAN:  He is the most photographed trader on the floor of the New York  Stock.  We're going to find that picture up the Twitter feed.</p><p> WEBSTER:  We do.  It's great to have you back.</p><p> LIZ:  But I can tell you, he wasn't wearing a helmet.</p><p> WEBSTER:  What?</p><p> CLAMAN:  Bad, Peter, bad.  That's how I recognize him because out there  with his hair.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Funny.  He looks funny in a helmet.  Yes.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Yes, they'll  send a car right over to take him down there, I think.  Neil Cavuto.   Thanks, Neil.  Appreciate it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CAVUTO:  All right, bud.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> WEBSTER:  Breaking right now, stocks are soaring after new reports suggest  that the White House is quietly negotiating with China as both sides tried  to avoid an all-out trade war.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Hello, everybody.  I'm Ashley Webster, in today for Trish Regan.  And  welcome, everyone, to \"The Intelligence Report.\"</p><p> Well, investors are encourage by the prospect of the world's two largest  economies reaching the deal on trade as stocks bounce back from their worst  week in more than two years and optimism apparently spreading beyond Wall  Street.  Here is Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin speaking to Fox News just  yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  I think we're working on a pathway to  see if we can reach an agreement as to what fair trade is for them to open  up their markets, reduce their tariffs, stop force-technology transfer.   These are all the things we want to do.  But in a negotiation, you have to  be prepared to take action and that's what President Trump is doing.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WEBSTER:  He certainly is.  The President displaying his confidence in our  economy in a tweet this morning saying, \"The economy is looking really  good.  It has been years that we have seen these kind of numbers.  The  underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.\"  And we'll  find out ow those companies are doing, of course, next month with the  latest round of earnings.</p><p> Joining me now Forbes Media Chairman, the man himself, Steve Forbes.  And,  Steve, thank you very much for joining us today in the studio.</p><p> STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  OK.  Let's just pick up from what the President said, are you  happy with the U.S. economy heading in the right direction.  Is it healthy?</p><p> FORBES:  I think it is healthy.  And I think there were news coming out  about negotiating with China and these trade disputes is a good thing  because one of the things this imposition of tariffs would have done is  create uncertainty.  Is this thing going to spin out of control?</p><p> On the steel side for Japan and China is now been exempted to further  negotiations.  On the Chinese side, working behind the scenes see what can  be done.  So I think the markets and investors will be reassured, OK, we  can invest.  They're not going to let this thing spin out of control.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Even though, let's be honest, the way its approach is a little  chaotic.  The Trump administration and it was on this campaign promise  list, if you like, so it's not a big surprise but it really did shake the  markets.  But is this, in your opinion, a classic Donald Trump maneuver?   Shoot very high, come out strong, and then bring someone to the table and  negotiate perhaps something a little lower?</p><p> FORBES:  Well, I think, that it would have been better for him and for the  economy and investing confidence if they had first, especially with China,  negotiated with our European allies, saying we know there are abusers.  Our  allies know there are abusers.  We're going to present the United Front.</p><p> Here's what we're going to put on the table.  So, you've done that kind of  preparation, one, the market wouldn't have freaked out and, two, everyone  would have acknowledged, yes, this thing has to be addressed.</p><p> WEBSTER:  These market actions are remarkable.  I was on the 3:00 show last  week when we had a 400 point drop and a 700 point drop.  Here we go again,  the volatility is back.  Everything seems now is headline driven.  Is that  going to be the way for awhile now, do you believe?</p><p> FORBES:  Well, this is going to depend on what you've referred to early.   These earnings are starting to come out next month.  But it looks like  Corporate America is starting to still turning in good profits.</p><p> People say, OK, things are still being done, things are moving ahead.   Heck, there was even a story this weekend about \"Brexit\" in Britain.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  But for all the hoopla in parliament and the disarray and the  ineffective prime minister, things are happening in the economy.  It's  amazing.  Government leaves it alone.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Despite everything.</p><p> FORBES:  People do things.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Well, it's interesting.  How much attention does the market or  investors pay to what's going on in Washington, because every day there's  some headline coming out, whether it's the President's personal lawyer  quits or whatever it'd be the story de jure.  Does that have an impact on  the markets?  Are people able to put the noise aside?</p><p> FORBES:  Most of the noise they put aside, as we've seen with the markets  reaction to recently, when concerns about what's going to happen on the  trade front came to the forefront.  That's when markets thought, my golly,  are they going to let this thing spin out of control?  Are they going to  control it?  And so, they respond to that kind of news, not to the latest  thing on \"60 Minutes\" or anything else.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I know.  That's not even news as far I can see it.  But anyway,  we'll move on.</p><p> I have to ask you about Facebook, because in light of the 444 point gain  today on Wall Street, it's been striking what we've seen with the selling  on Facebook and the hits it continues to take today.  We found out the  Federal Trade Commission has begun the investigation.  Do you have a  Facebook page?</p><p> FORBES:  I do and even own a few shares of Facebook.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.  What's your take on all of this?</p><p> FORBES:  But I think it's a case where management has flubbed the ball.   This thing could have been contained from the beginning, be upfront about  it.  Outline what you're going to do to prevent abuses by users.</p><p> Yes, the users violated the contract.  But what follow-up did you have?   What kind of auditing did you have?</p><p> Reassure that you're on top of the things, instead of look like you're  floundering, you don't know what to do.  You want to go on apology tour.   That freaks people out that you're not in charge.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Is this redeemable at this stage because it's a very good chance  to, as Neil Cavuto said, look, he's going to be down in Washington  testifying?</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, and that's like I have an offer you can't refuse kind of  invitation.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> FORBES:  That's going to be critical because that will determine the fate  of the stocks in the months ahead, if he goes before the committee and  says, here's what happened, here's what we're outlining doing.  We think  we're on top of this thing, present a role that he is in charge and  reassuring and confident, instead of floundering.</p><p> WEBSTER:  We haven't seen it so far.</p><p> FORBES:  We haven't seen it, but this is his chance to do it.  I hope he is  prepping for this thing in a way people say, OK, the government is not  going to really move in a big way because if the government moves in, that  stock is going to be killed.</p><p> WEBSTER:  It is.  And we're talking about new regulations which could  further crimp the business model of Facebook and other social media  companies.</p><p> FORBES:  Yes, and not only Facebook but it means they're going to end up  gumming up a lot of other high-tech companies and high-tech start-ups.  We  don't have the resources to fight this kind thing.  So a lot is on his  shoulder.  I hope the shoulders are broad --</p><p> WEBSTER:  But don't blow it as they say, Steve.</p><p> FORBES:  -- well, he brought it on.</p><p> WEBSTER:  He did, that's very true.  Steve, thank you very much.  Great  stuff as always.</p><p> FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  For more on these markets, let's bring in the Stock Swoosh  Founder, Melissa Armo, along with Surevest Wealth Management CEO, Rob Luna.</p><p> Melissa, let me get to you.  What's your take on the markets right now?   You need some Pepto-Bismol, don't you?  We had a big selloff last week and  now here were are up 443 points.  Is pretty much this volatility here to  stay?</p><p> MELISSA ARMO, THE STOCK SWOOSH:  Volatility is here to stay.  Came in in  2018.  I don't think it's going anywhere.</p><p> I really didn't look today as a strong day.  I know we gapped up a lot this  morning.  But overall, this is just kind of like a dead-cat bounce, it's  something that traders use the terminology.</p><p> I really think we might still be lower, because the fact is that overall  the market is strong but everything that happens, every headline that comes  out, every news thing, the market is reacting very volatile to it, selling  off quickly and then bouncing again and selling off quickly.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> ARMO:  And the range is broadening.  We're still strong but the range from  the high to where we're at in this base is like wide, it's getting wider  and wider and wider.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Well, it's interesting because, Rob, you say, look, we are  trading in a range but to Melissa's point, that range is like the size of  the Grand Canyon right now.</p><p> ROB LUNA, CEO, SUREVEST WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Well, it's like the size of the  Grand Canyon.  If you look at the minuscule ranges that we're trading in  over the prior 18 to 24 months but I think, you know, in general, there's  11 to 12 percentage point range that we're trading in, you know, quiet  honestly, Ashley, is normal.  And we got up towards the end at the top of  that range, all this headline risk, whether it's tariffs, it's raising  interest rates, the market is looking for reason to sell.  It got it, now  we're back towards the bottom in this range.</p><p> And what you're seeing is, as we hit the 200-day moving average support,  buyers are starting to come back in this morning.  But I look at that last  hour, the last hour is going to be very telling to see if we can hold up  today.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  Good luck predicting where it's going go.  Let me follow-up  with you then, Rob.  You say, look, as far as where the economy goes it's  all flashing green.</p><p> We just spoke with Steve Forbes.  He agrees the economy is doing well.  We  get the earnings next month, assuming they're pretty solid, how important  is that for this market?</p><p> LUNA:  I think it's extremely important, right, because there is a lot of  headline risk out there.  Right now, investors are definitely nervous.  So  they need this reassurance from Wall Street, from the companies, from the  CEOs out there telling them the things are still good.  And I think if that  happens, we can head back towards the top of that range, and like we said,  that could be eight to 10 percentage-point move.  So, if you're an investor  you don't necessarily would be on the sidelines and miss out on that.</p><p> WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  Melissa, I spoke with a Money manager this  morning who said, look, I'm looking for a sector that has the least  downside, the most upside.  And I'm thinking, well, yes, we're all doing  that, right?  He said that sector was energy is being beaten down too much  and has a long way to go on the upside.  What do you say?</p><p> ARMO:  I don't agree with that.  I like the idea of banks strengths.  So  right now, the strongest things out there are banks and the tech sector  except for Facebook.  Take Facebook out of that equation, which is  unfortunate.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> ARMO:  But someone like Amazon, Netflix, Apple, I still like Google still  looks good and the banks, J.P. Morgan Chase.  I mean, I still think that  you buy strong stocks.  They're coming in, weak though.  Don't buy yet.   Wait until they're showing strength for about a week, two weeks.</p><p> You want to see consecutive green, green days just like we follow-through  and rally today and all next week into the start of April, that will be a  good time, come second-quarter earnings season to start getting back into  the strong stuff.  I don't want to buy stuff that's weak, that's down a  lot, that has a huge upside.  I want to buy stuff that's proving, that is  strong even when the market was falling last week.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.  And, Rob, you know, that has been the tech stocks.  A lot  of money has gone into tech over the last 18 months and beyond.  Is that  still the leading sector, these big tech companies, or are you seeing money  go elsewhere?</p><p> LUNA:  Yes, you know, I think so, Ashley.  You know, really if you were  looking at rising interest rates right now, the only way that your  portfolio is going to be able to combat that is through growth.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> LUNA:  And it's very tough to get top-line growth outside of technology  right now.  The financials could definitely do it but, you know, they're  actually been struggling here quite a bit.  So, I'm a little bit nervous  about what's going on with them.</p><p> But the old technology stocks, Amazon, Google, two of our top, you know,  largest holdings right now, we're continuing to stick with them.  And, I  agree, momentum is where you want to be but I don't know that you  necessarily wait for them to completely break out.  Use this opportunity  when they're pulling back technically to enter into positions.  And, you  know, 10 percent to 15 percent from where they were at before is a pretty  attractive entry point in our view.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Melissa, I want to ask you the same question I asked Steve  Forbes.  Do you think all the noise is coming out of Washington that at  this point investors pay much attention or does it have an impact on the  market?</p><p> ARMO:  Of course, it does have an impact on the market.  All you have to do  is look last week or even look back the February.  It's unfortunate because  I think the market is going to shake all of this off.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> ARMO:  But you can't ignore it.  We live in 24 hour, seven day week news  cycle.  Every time you get up, you see this thing, that thing, the other  thing.  Mr. Forbes is talking about \"60 Minutes,\" I mean even something  like that could affected the market this morning.</p><p> WEBSTER:  That's true.</p><p> ARMO:  You can't escape it.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  Rob, what do you tell to your clients?  Ignore it, just  focus on fundamentals of these companies?</p><p> LUNA:  Yes, that's exactly it.  I mean, when you look at this whole noise  about the trade tariffs, we have $375 billion deficit right now.  You know,  what was on the table is only $60 billion.  These are not huge numbers  right now.</p><p> And let's face it, Trump is not going to get any, you know, style points  for finesse here.  This is his negotiation style.</p><p> WEBSTER:  No.</p><p> LUNA:  He's trying to get China to the table.  I think it's a lot of noise  right now and investors should just pay attention to the fundamentals.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Wise words indeed from both of you.  Melissa, Rob, thanks you  very much for joining us today.</p><p> ARMO:  Thanks.</p><p> LUNA:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  The Dow up, by the way, 500 points above 24,000.  One of those  days.</p><p> Well, indeed, there may be a rally on Wall Street but shares of Facebook  taking another hit after the FTC says it is investigating the company.  Can  Mark Zuckerberg fix this mess?  Our panel discusses it next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Facebook start taking another leg down after the Federal Trade  Commission announced it was investigating Facebook's privacy practices.   Plus, 37 states attorneys general want to know when Facebook actually knew  about that massive data breach.  And the Senate Judiciary Committee goes on  and on, doesn't it, as invited, I say invited, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and  other tech leaders to testify April 10th, an offer they can't refuse as  someone put it.</p><p> And yes, the headaches keep coming.  A new report claims that Facebook logs  all your calls and texts, it is.  And you probably have no idea that's  happening either.</p><p> Joining me now to talk about this \"Wall Street Journal\" Senior Reporter,  Shelby Holliday, and our very own, Deirdre Bolton.  Thank you both for  being here.</p><p> Shelby, let me begin with you.  I don't know if you heard what Steve Forbes  had to say but he basically said, Mark Zuckerberg dropped the ball on this  and has to really be very careful this time on how he approaches it from  now on.  He has to instill confidence and he has to get it right.  What  we've seen up to now doesn't necessarily suggest he's able to do that.</p><p> SHELBY HOLLIDAY,  SENIOR REPORTER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  He's got to  be honest because there are number of issues Facebook is dealing with right  now, whether it's Russian meddling, Cambridge Analytica use of data, the  cellphone and messages scraping if you will.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  But the underlying theme for all of this is that users were not  aware their data was being used against them.  So now there's a lot of  outrage.  People are pledging to quit Facebook.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  They're calling for answers.  You're hearing lawmakers really  wanting the CEOs to get on the Hill and answer some of these questions.   But Mark Zuckerberg is still continuing to sort of let this drip instead of  just getting all the answers out there, confronting all of the problems  they have and, quite frankly, being honest with all of the users, the two  billion users Facebook has.</p><p> A lot of them when I talk to them, and I'm doing my reporting, still have  no idea that they followed Russian accounts.  So they're getting it from  journalists, rather than the company itself.</p><p> WEBSTER:  That's a good point.  And Deirdre, you know, we hear today the  FTC is getting involved.  What could that mean?</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  So that's like we're going to be --  one of the bigger questions is shall we -- you know, they had an agreement  going back to 2011.  So we should just say this is not the first time that  the FTC and Facebook have sat down together.  This is actually Facebook's  second strike at that with the FTC.</p><p> So in 2011, they had an agreement about privacy, about use of data that  Facebook agreed to.  So I think one of the questions that Facebook is now  going to have to answer is, did they follow the guidelines that they said  they would in 2011?</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> BOLTON:  If it's found not, just start tacking on millions of dollars in  fees, without even talking about potential regulation.  But it's just  actually literally going to cost them.  So I think that's going to be one  of the bigger questions.</p><p> I know with the android, so-called scraping.  I actually spoke with  somebody who said Facebook in legal thing, oh, but users did have the opt  out.  So once again, it's always the own us is on the user and we just  keeping reminding ourselves, right, authors or media is you're not paying  for the products, you are the product.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> BOLTON:  So there is a bit of a buyer beware, which I think the Facebook  legal side is going to try its best to argue.  But I think long story  short, honestly, this just opens the doors, as you said, invited to D.C.  are now Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, of course, for Twitter and Larry Page  for Google.  So I think, you know, what are these companies doing, how are  they protecting our data?  That's why the FTC is involved.</p><p> And you have spoken often with Scott Galloway, who's a professor at NYU --</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, yes.</p><p> BOLTON:  -- who actually believes there will be a call to break up big  tech.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> BOLTON:  And he just wrote a book about this saying, it's going to come  from Europe, because as he points out, Europe has all of the downside and  none of the upside of big tech.  Whereas, at least, we, in our country can  brag like, oh, these are great businesses, we grow it here but Europe has  none of that.  They just have the downside.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, they just rely on finding the big American companies as part  of their budget.</p><p> BOLTON:  Right, yes.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Shelby, let me ask you, should there be a presumption of privacy  when you're posting on something that's so public as Facebook?</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  That's a good question.  You know, I think, throughout this  debate what's getting lost is that users do have responsibility.  We share  TMI, to much information, all the time.  So I definitely think if nothing  else alerts people to the fact that their data is being used and they're  sharing perhaps --</p><p> BORTON:  Cambridge Analytica is saying, though, it was like quiz, though --</p><p> WEBSTER:  It was.</p><p> BOLTON:  -- and was like a personality profile.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  -- when you took this quiz years ago you had no idea it would  come back to be served in your face in a political sense.  And I think --  someone I spoke to last week made a really great point.  Democracy is sort  of built on this idea of open ideas, open debate.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  And when you're sending targeted messages to people that no one  knows what they say, no one knows how they might be manipulated there's no  way for candidates or companies to refute these claims.  They don't know  what's being sent.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I get the sense.  We have to wrap this up.  But I get the sense  with Facebook is they really don't have any idea how much of your  information is out there as we speak.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  No clue.  And Zuckerberg is actually admitted that.</p><p> BOLTON:  I think they built a machine that they can't manage.  It's two  billion users.  It's too big even for them.</p><p> And you recall after our scandal, right, in the run-up to the U.S.  Presidential election, 125 million U.S. voters saw that data.  They hired  1000 editors, 1000 editors with two billion users?  That proportion needs  to be up.  But then it cuts into profit margins if you're going to hire  more humans.</p><p> WEBSTER:  It's going to be very interesting.  And we're going to be talking  about it for a while.  Great stuff.  Shelby, Deirdre, thank you so much.   Appreciate it.</p><p> HOLLIDAY:  Thank you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  President Trump, well, he's getting tough on Russia.  The  President ordering 60 Russian diplomats to pack their bags and get out of  the U.S.  It's in retaliation for the toxic nerve agent attack on a former  Russian spy and his daughter on British soil.  So what does this mean for  U.S.-Russia relations from here?  We'll talk about it next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  President Trump is expelling 60 Russian diplomats from the U.S.  and is closing a Russian consulate in Seattle.  This is in response to the  nerve agent attack on an ex-Russian spy in the U.K. earlier this month.   Now, the U.S. is joining at least 17 other countries in kicking out Russian  diplomats making it the biggest western expulsion of Russian  representatives since the height of the Cold War.  Interesting stuff.</p><p> Here now with more, Philip Wegmann.  He's a Commentary Writer for the  \"Washington Examiner.\"</p><p> Philip, do you think, do you get the sense that Vladmir Putin  underestimated the response to this nerve agent attack in Britain?  What is  going through in his mind right now?</p><p> PHILIP WEGMANN, COMMENTARY WRITER, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  Well if Putin  underestimated the response to that attack, he certainly understands the  message that the Trump administration is sending right now.  Remember,  Putin is an old KGB hand and he is not going to miss the significance of  the Trump administration kicking out 60 Russian diplomats and also closing  that consulate in Seattle.</p><p> The message here is clear.  It's that Russian cannot expect to manhandle  our allies and get away with it.  You can't perform these extra judicial  executions on our allies' foreign soil.  And, I think, we're just going to  turn a blind eye.</p><p> WEBSTER:  But is it symbolic?  I mean, what impact does it really have?   Sixty Russian diplomats and representatives go back to Moscow.  Does it put  a serious dent in the intelligence-gathering network?</p><p> WEGMANN:  Absolutely.  If you look at those diplomats, there were 60 of  them and they were in Seattle, Washington, close to not only some of our  sub-bases but also close to Boeing Manufacturing.  So for us to push them  out, that is significant blow to their intelligence gathering network.</p><p> And I think that what the Trump administration needs to do right now is  they need to follow-up this strong action with strong words from the  President.  He needs to show that he's serious about this threat, because,  frankly, a lot of people still don't know that this President now, by  expelling those 60 Russian agents, has sent more Russians out of the  country than President Obama did after the election with regard to the  election meddling.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.  So we're fully expecting a tit-for-tat.  We've seen the  Russians do that with the U.K. when the U.K. kicked out 23 diplomats, same  thing happened in Moscow.  Probably the same thing is going to happen in  the U.S.  Does that not hurt our intelligence-gathering abilities in  Russia?</p><p> WEGMANN:  Well, you're absolutely right.  Already the Russian embassy is  tweeting this morning somewhat tongue-in-cheek, where and which consulates  should be kicked out of Russia.  You know, which of our agents should get  the boot.  And I think that because this is so pointed and this definitely  is a blow at Russian intelligence, that Putin and company, they are going  to strike back hard but the Trump administration has shown resolve, steel  in this area.  And now that John Bolton is joining the administration,  someone who is a Russia hawk, I think we're going to see a much stronger  response from the White House.</p><p> WEBSTER:  How could have -- assuming this went all the way to Mr. Putin and  he gave the OK for this, and we don't know that for sure, but it certainly  appears that way, what was he trying to achieve?  He had to know that  something like this so brazen would have consequences.</p><p> WEGMANN:  Well, the Russians are always trying to push the envelope and  they're also very symbolic in the way that they carryout these executions.   If you look at the type of nerve agent that was used, that was a clear  calling card because that is an agent that was manufactured specifically in  Russia.  So he had to know there were these insidious bread crumbs that  were going to lead back to the Kremlin.</p><p> I think what we're seeing here is that after the 2016 election, Putin is  trying to feel out what he can do, how hard he can go after the United  States.  What we're seeing here is that Trump at least, with this reaction  is showing that we are not going to back down from the world stage.  That  we are going to stand strong in our relations with some of our longest  standing allies.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I have to leave it right there.  It'd be fascinating to follow  what happens next.  Philip, thank you so much for joining us.  Appreciate  it and thanks for your comments.</p><p> We are, of course, keeping a close eye on the markets for years.  Stocks  rally over trade talks, not a trade war.  The market up 556 points now on  the Dow, up at 24,083.</p><p> Also ahead, the court battle is underway to decide the fate of the AT&amp;T  merger with Time Warner.  Right now, top broadcasting executives are  testifying on what this merger would mean for them.  We'll have the intel  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Witnesses are taken the stand today as the Department of Justice  tries to block a potential multibillion dollar deal between AT&amp;T and Time  Warner.  Joining me from the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., is  our very own Connell McShane with the latest.</p><p> Hey, Connell.</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey there, Ashley.  Well, the  court is just about to resume, to be back in session, coming back from one  of your favorite activities, an extended lunch break which the judge took  and for him the judge in this case, Richard Leon, this is a working lunch.   It's kind of a strange morning.</p><p> We're waiting to hear from these two key executives in the cable industry.   One of these guys named Warren Schlichting, a head of a Sling T.V., a DISH  Network and the other is John Martin, the Chairman of CEO at Turner.</p><p> As the government tries to build this antitrust case and tries to block  this merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, I say it's a strange morning because  what happened to us, just before the Department of Justice was to call its  first witness of the day, the government lawyer asked the judge to approach  the bench.  And then for two hours, all the lawyers and the judge were  talking.</p><p> Now, we're in the courtroom, we couldn't hear what they were saying so we  don't know exactly what the issues were but we were told by judge, Leon,  that some issues did come up and he had a number of e-mails to review.  So  he said let's take a longer break than usual.  I'll review those e-mails  and I'll come back and have some rulings and maybe we can proceed in the  afternoon.  So we'll see if we get that testimony.  It could be important.</p><p> Just to get you up to speed, Ashley, in where we are.  In this last week,  the Justice Department started to make its case.  Its basic case is that if  these companies are allowed to combine, AT&amp;T and Time Warner, it would be  unfair and consumers would pay the price.  They'd paid higher prices that  AT&amp;T would be able to kind of weaponize Time Warner to use the Justice  Department's terms there and takes its networks HBO, and CNN, TNT, TBS to  be able to leverage those with DirecTV service and increase prices.</p><p> The companies are comeback and argued that the Justice Department's case is  fundamentally stuck in the past.  They say the game is completely changed  what to do competition from the tech companies whether the, Hulu, Netflix  and the likes.  So we're just getting started here, what could be a six to  eight week trial.  We'll see what this afternoon brings.</p><p> Back to you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  So a lot of talking so far today, Connell, and you couldn't hear  one word of it?</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Great stuff.  All right.  It's going to be a long six weeks, my  friend.  Enjoy those working lunches.</p><p> MCSHANE:  I know.</p><p> WEBSTER:  All right, Connell McShane down in D.C. on the latest development  in AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger case.</p><p> Stops our rallying as investors cheer on reports of trade negotiations,  nice press negotiations between the U.S. and China.  Let's go to the floor  of the New York Stock Exchange, where our very own Nicole Petallides has  the latest.</p><p> Big sell-off last week?  We're up 545 points.  Nicole?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  That's right.  So cooler  heads prevailed for today but big picture, people think of the hard time  committing to that is going to be a great 2018 because there are so many  factors up in the air, they're looking at technicals.</p><p> Right now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 545 points, the S&amp;P 500 is  up, 2.1 percent.  Third day in a row of two percent move.  Thursday, Friday  down two percent each of those days and today up two percent.  So the  volatility is here.</p><p> Tech, we have this interesting dichotomy, fang, right?  Facebook being the  F.  There's seems to be a separation on this one.  In fact, some people are  even wondering is fang over because Facebook under pressure again, down 1.5  percent for the month, down 12.2 percent as it remain under fire.</p><p> Zuckerberg actually has been invited to testify in the U.S. Senate.  You  could see that it's down 1.6 percent.  But Apple, Alphabet, Google,  Microsoft, IBM all gaining today.</p><p> Financials, this could actually did slightly worse than even the techs on  Friday.  Without financials and technology these markets have a very hard  time trying to get off the ground.  But here's on what's J.P. Morgan,  Morgan Stanley, Goldman, all up more than three percent.  And Katie W. (ph)  put out a note today saying that they say mergers and acquisitions ahead,  and particularly for J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs being the acquirers.</p><p> Last but not least, a quick look at defense stocks as we know that the  President and assigning in new obviously military spending a massive a  boost to this group on Friday.  You can see here, Lockheed, Northrop,  Bowman, General Dynamics all up more than two percent each.  So that trend  continues.</p><p> Back to you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Lots of green arrows.  Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p> Meanwhile, one of the oldest gunmakers in the U.S. is filing for  bankruptcy.  Remington Arms is restructuring its massive debt after a 30  percent drop in gun sales this year.  The filing will allow the 200-year- old company to stay in business while reducing its debt by $700 million.   It will, by the way, continue to make guns during the bankruptcy  proceedings.</p><p> And Elon Musk's boring company, and I don't mean boring as dull, I mean the  one that makes tunnels in the ground is going to sell Lego-like bricks made  from tunneling rock.  The life-sized interlocking blocks will be used to  build low-cost homes and other structures.  Those bricks will be  lightweight and durable, making them easy to assemble, Lego bricks.</p><p> Obamacare premiums are set to go up right before the midterm elections in  November.  We'll have the intel on what this could mean for both parties in  the midterms next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Health care premiums are expected to go up yet again right before  the midterm elections in November.  Now this after a battle in Congress  failed to include in last week's massive spending bill a plan to shore up  the health insurance exchanges.  No subsidies.  And without the government  money, insurance companies, well you know what they're going to do?   They're going to raise rates, right?</p><p> Gerri Willis joins us live from the newsroom with the latest on this.   Gerri.</p><p> GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Well, Ash, you've got that story  right.  Estimates of just how much premiums could rise, according to the  Congressional Budget Office, some 10 percent for a popular middle priced  option on the insurance exchanges and, you know, that doesn't even include  the hike to premiums that will likely occur as the mandate fades away.</p><p> Now, lawmakers on both sides are pointing fingers, Democrats blame the GOP  for failure in negotiations saying they demanded abortion restrictions  being included something they knew would be unacceptable to Democrats.  And  Republicans say this that they negotiated in good faith and Democrats  rejected reasonable rules on abortion.  Either way, the impasse means money  to shore up the Obamacare insurance exchanges was omitted from the $1.3  trillion spending plan that the President signed last week.</p><p> Failing to shore up, the exchanges could have big repercussions at the  ballot box.  A recent poll in Pennsylvania showed health care was a top  issue for 52 percent of voters according to Public Policy Polling.</p><p> Payments to insurers were stopped last year after President Trump said they  were illegal because the money had not been appropriated by Congress.   Meanwhile, insiders say that passage of legislation to stabilize the  exchanges, highly unlikely.</p><p> Ash, back to you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Interesting stuff.  The bottom line is those rates go up.  Gerri,  thank you very much.</p><p> Health care is expected to be one of the top issues for this year's midterm  elections.  Topping the latest \"Q-poll\" as the number one issue and poll  show that most voters feel Democrats would handle health care better, but a  new Fox poll shows the Democrats lead in the midterms is actually slipping  to just five points.  Interesting.</p><p> Joining me now, Former Bush Administration Aide, Matt Mackowiak, and  Democratic Strategist, Antjuan Seawright.  Thank you both for being here.</p><p> Matt, let me begin with you.  You could argue that health care continues to  be a problem and it was failure of the Republicans who have the House in  Senate and Oval Office to get this thing sorted out.  How would you  respond? </p><p> MATT MACKOWIAK, FORMER BUSH ADMINISTRATION AIDE:  Yes, there's no question  that Republicans promised to repeal and replace Obamacare.  The House took  two attempts and got it done.  The Senate took two attempts and failed by  one vote and so Republican voters have some frustration about that, there's  no question.  But that's going to be one be one issue the midterms are  going to be about.  They're going to be about economy, they're going to be  about direction of the country and they're ultimately going to be about the  candidates that running on both sides, you know, in each district.</p><p> The generic ballot is helpful directionally.  But ultimately every  individual race comes down to that district, comes down to the candidates  that are running, the campaigns they're running.  We saw that in  Pennsylvania 18 where the Democratic candidate ran as pro-gun, personally  anti-abortion, Democratic candidate.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  And that's not what you're going to see in a lot of other races  around the country.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Antjuan, let me ask you.  Why do you think the gap is closing in  the polls?  What do you put that down to?</p><p> ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, a couple of things here,  one, you should know that between now and November this will be a marathon,  not a sprint on both sides.</p><p> WEBSTER:  True.</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  So you're going to see the polls change, go up and down from  here until November.  The second thing to remember is that the enthusiasm  gap favors the Democrats as well as history.  It is very uncommon for the  party in charge to keep their charge in the midterm elections.</p><p> And the third thing that I will tell you, if you look what is happening all  across the country, in special elections whether State House seats,  Alabama, New Jersey, Virginia, even in Pennsylvania, the voters are  speaking out very loudly.  They are rejecting the policies of Donald Trump  and the Republican Party.  I think the Republicans have a big issue in  November and what no poll will be able to tell you this point is the  massive enthusiasm we've seen from the Women's March movement just a few  months ago in Washington as well as these young people all across the  country who are organizing.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Antjuan, let me just follow up very quickly.  Matt mentioned the  economy.  The tax reform has put up more money in a lot of people's pockets  and the economy for all intents and purposes is doing very well.  If you  hang your hat on the economy, how are you going to make that argument?</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Well, I think the economy will be just one issue that voters  will decide on.  But here's the thing to remember about the economy, there  is a reason why the Republican Party did not run one single ad in  Pennsylvania about their tax scam that they passed a few months ago because  the voters do not agree what happened.</p><p> Look, that bonus they received in their check, I'm not saying it's not a  good thing but it was a shot in the arm.  What want people are raise in  wages that will sustain them long term and improve their quality of life,  and middle class families over the long term will not see that from the tax  bill that passed a few months ago by the Republicans.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Matt, let me have you respond to Antjuan.  I mean, you know, yes,  the bonuses were nice.  They weren't crumbs but they're also seeing  benefits from the tax reform paying lower taxes.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  No question.  You have about 5 million people who received  their bonus or received their wage increase because of the tax law, that's  significant.  You have the highest consumer confidence we've had in  decades.  And I can put Antjuan's mind at ease, wages are going up for  first time in a decade and that's very good news.</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Well they're not, Matt, according to statistics.  According to  statistics wages are flat.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  Antjuan, I'd be happy to send you the statistics that have come  out on the last couple months that shown wages have begun rising.  So the  economy is improving.  It's strengthening.  We have 4.1 percent  unemployment and historically very, very low.</p><p> And I think Republicans everyday they aren't talking about the economy as a  waste.  They need to talk about the economy.  They need to sell the tax  law.  A majority of the public is now viewing it very favorably.  This has  a chance to save their majority even though it is very much up for grabs.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Antjuan, do you think that --</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Matt, keep in mind --</p><p> WEBSTER:  -- all right, go ahead.</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  -- Matt, keep in mind, the one thing that you all have around  your neck is President Donald Trump, the most toxic President probably in  modern-day history at the top of the ticket.  Look, that is not a good  thing going into someone --</p><p> WEBSTER:  But why is his approval rating Antjuan?  Why is the President's  approval rating going up?</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  -- it may be rising from the graveyard but it has not hit  aboveground just yet.  And keep in mind, Virginia rejected, Alabama  rejected Trump, so did Pennsylvania and in districts where he carried about  20, 30 points in the last election cycle.  Democrats have been winning at  various levels of our government.  And so, you can decide however you want  to break that down, but I am telling you that something is brewing here in  this country and I don't think the way will be in favor of Republicans.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Very quickly, Matt.  You know, if you're a candidate, do you want  Donald Trump to come to your town and stamp for you and, you know, get the  crowd fired up?  Would you distance yourself?</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  It totally depends on district and on the dynamics of the race  that you're in.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  In some districts, particularly in places like California you  probably don't want the President to come in.  If you're in the middle of  country, in states that Trump won, if you're running for U.S. Senate in  North Dakota or West Virginia or Montana, the President can be very  helpful.  So, they're going to have to be strategic on how they deploy him  next fall.</p><p> There's no question, his improvement has been narrowly increasing.  He's in  the middle of 30s last year.  It's in the low 40s now.  They needed to get  in the mid-40s by the midterms.  They'll have a chance to hold the House  and that's very important.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Guys, we have to leave it right there.  You know, bottom line is  a day is a long time in politics.  So, there is a long time between now and  November.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  A marathon, not a sprint.</p><p> WEBSTER:  All right.  Matt and Antjuan, great stuff as always.  Thank you  both for joining us today.</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Thank you.</p><p> MACKOWIAK:  Thank you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Coming up next, we got preview of tonight's new episodes of the  \"Strange Inheritance,\" including a son of a NASA chaplain who inherits more  than a 100 Bibles that went to the moon.  I kid you not.  Stay with us.   We're back in two.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Monday night on Fox Business are getting a just little bit  stranger.  Strange Inheritance is back tonight with two new episodes, one,  involving some Bibles that went all the way to the moon.  I kid you not.   Take a look.</p><p> (BEGINNING VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAMIE COLBY, HOST, \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\":  It's a small postage stamp.   What's on there?</p><p> JONATHAN STOUT:  That's the entire Bible.</p><p> COLBY:  On one little tiny microfiche?</p><p> STOUT:  On each sheet.</p><p> COLBY:  When it's magnified under a microscope, sure enough there is the  Holy Scripture.</p><p> STOUT:  That was my dad's dream, to get the Bible to the moon.</p><p> COLBY:  Wait, your inheritance is this little teeny-tiny Bibles went to the  moon?</p><p> COLBY:  Yes, it did.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WEBSTER:  You know, it's fascinating.  Joining me now in the studio to chat  about all of the Strange Inheritance stamp, and it is fascinating, is the  host, Jamie Colby.</p><p> Jamie, thank you so much for being here.</p><p> COLBY:  Absolutely, Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Define Bible.</p><p> COLBY:  Did you know I did not know Bibles went to the moon.</p><p> WEBSTER:  No.</p><p> COLBY:  But Reverend Stout was.</p><p> WEBSTER:  And they came back.  They weren't left there for someone to read.</p><p> COLBY:  Well, it took several attempts to get them there successfully to be  on the lunar surface.  He was really determined.  He was NASA engineer who  happened to be at Reverend and he decided this is something he wanted to  do.</p><p> So, Edgar Mitchell was the astronaut that actually took it as part of his  personal items, hundreds of them, because they were that small.  I don't  even know how many people remember microfiche but I read and the entire  Bible was there.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I'm old enough to remember microfiche at the library, you know,  you go through.</p><p> COLBY:  But here's the problem.  You want to know what their worst because  this is a business channel.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Always.</p><p> COLBY:  They are so valuable.  The individual ones have sold anywhere from  10,000 to 70,000.</p><p> WEBSTER:  You are kidding.</p><p> COLBY:  He has several hundred of them but there wasn't a will and even  though when there's a will there's a way.  When there's no will it's get  very complicated on Strange Inheritance.</p><p> So, tonight, you'll meet the family.  You'll also meet an author, Carol  Mersch, who did some investigation and story on the Bibles with Reverend  and she says, the Bibles belonged to her.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Interesting.</p><p> COLBY:  It's a little messy.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  That's the best you say.</p><p> COLBY:  The good book on demand.</p><p> WEBSTER:  When it comes with the territory, when you're talking about  things that are, you know, left behind, if the ownership part is not clear  it can get, well, down right ugly at times.  Anyway, --</p><p> COLBY:  In Texas, they're good people.  They're going to work it out.</p><p> WEBSTER:  -- of course they will.  Now, also, there's another topic you're  getting into involving race cars.</p><p> COLBY:  Rave up you engine because --</p><p> WEBSTER:  Best car?</p><p> COLBY:  -- this family, actually the father, Mickey Thompson, broke the  land speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats on what he called the  Challenger.  It's a piston-driven engine that goes 400 plus miles.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Look at that.  Oh my God!</p><p> COLBY:  Wait till you see me in it.  But anyway I degrease that so much  fun.  I could almost knock it out.  It's so high speed.</p><p> WEBSTER:  You still be in and out.</p><p> COLBY:  It was amazing.  So, Danny is his son and he was determined to  break his dad's land speed record because for all the years his father told  him, no racing, it's dangerous.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Oh, my God.  Yes.</p><p> COLBY:  The last thing his father said to him is I'm giving you the  Challenger.  I want you to race it and now, he's determined to make sure  that the Thompson family keeps that record.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Fascinating.  The air tonight beginning at?</p><p> COLBY:  9:00 to 9:30.</p><p> WEBSTER:  9:00 to 9:30.</p><p> COLBY:  Come on over.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I'd love it.  I want to try that car, break the land speed record  or may be not.  At least you got of it, that's the main thing.</p><p> COLBY:  Wear your seatbelt, Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, always.  Jamie, thank you very much.</p><p> Let's take a look at the market for you.  What a day.  We said it's a Jamie  Colby effect.  It was going to hit 600 points, nearly Jamie.  Good.  We're  up 564 points.</p><p> Liz Claman, by the way, is back from, I think, she went skiing.  I think  she went old fancy and went out west to go skiing.</p><p> We saw some picture, Liz.  You looked terrific out there.  And you're into  friend.  I think you ride into Peter Toughman (ph) </p><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Can you believe that.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Of all of people, I mean, it's a small world because Peter  Toughman works down at the New York Exchange.  He's the guy with that crazy  hair and the glasses.  And he's taking picture when the markets doing crazy  thing.</p><p> CLAMAN:  He is the most photographed trader on the floor of the New York  Stock.  We're going to find that picture up the Twitter feed.</p><p> WEBSTER:  We do.  It's great to have you back.</p><p> LIZ:  But I can tell you, he wasn't wearing a helmet.</p><p> WEBSTER:  What?</p><p> CLAMAN:  Bad, Peter, bad.

Although ING had long supported the introduction of PSD2   the second European payment services directive   in the belief that it would foster innovation and lower barriers for small fintech providers, the prospect of big technology firms coming into the market is \"not necessarily desirable,\" he said.</p><p>\"We are basically serving all the data on a [platter] to the ones who already have a lot of data,\" he said. The additional data provided by banks would give big technology firms a full profile of the clients and make it easier for them to become the \"go-to platforms\" for those clients, he added.</p><p>Big tech already a competitor</p><p>\"I was asked the question [recently] 'Do you think they will enter the banking [space]?'\" Hamers said of the world's technology giants. \"They are already there ... Alibaba runs the biggest money market fund in the world, they have deposit [and] lending services.\"</p><p>Hamers stressed the need to have a \"fundamental discussion\" about data   how it is managed by the banks and their clients and who owns it. Primary clients create 2.5x more value than the average customer for ING, explaining why such clients are a big focus for the bank, he added.</p><p>Fintech M&amp;A and blockchain initiatives</p><p>Hamers also confirmed that ING plans more acquisitions in the fintech space, having just agreed to acquire a 75% stake in payments services provider Payvision. ING said the deal, which values Payvision at  360 million, will enable it to boost its footprint in omnichannel payments services and expand its merchant services for business customers, particularly in e-commerce.</p><p>\"The acquisition of Payvision will help us gain new clients and generate new loans as well,\" Hamers said, noting the group's intention to seek growth in segments besides mortgages. Outstanding residential mortgages in the Netherlands have fallen at ING in every quarter for the past four years, from  134 billion at the end of 2014 to  115 billion at the end of 2015.</p><p>ING has long focused on technological improvements, and it recently joined blockchain technology initiatives in cooperation with other banks and industry partners to offer energy and agriculture products trading.</p><p>\"It is more safe, it is faster and more efficient. [However], before this becomes a game-changer for banks in terms of cost and for the other parties in the platform in terms of speed and efficiency, this needs to be adopted as a market standard,\" Hamers said. \"In the end, trade processes are global and for them you need more banks than just a few that collaborate on the blockchain initiatives that we have launched.\"</p><p>ING reported a full-year 2017 group net result of  4.91 billion, up from  4.65 billion in 2016.

Nice acronym although I prefer Coca-Cola, the Co-ordinated Car Co-operative Association. Or something like that. Anyways, whichever Cola you prefer, this new initiative is interesting. </p><p>Backed by over twenty mainly French and German banks, the aim is to create a network to rival Visa and MasterCard, as well as the potential threat of Big Tech giants like Amazon. Rather than me waffle on about it, I thought it easier to share the full text of the speech by Benot C\u0153ur, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Joint Conference of the ECB and the National Bank of Belgium from the end of November 2019.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Towards the retail payments of tomorrow: a European strategy[1] Brussels, 26 November 2019 Europe has made important progress towards a true banking union in recent years. We now have a single banking supervisor for significant institutions, a single framework for resolving failing institutions, a single fund to finance those resolution activities, and we will soon have a single backstop for that fund. There are also renewed hopes that political negotiations could soon begin on a European deposit insurance scheme. The European Commission has also launched an ambitious agenda for creating a capital markets union. Although the pace at which co-legislators, and Member States in particular, have progressed on individual Commission initiatives has often been sluggish, the recent establishment of a high-level expert group might help overcome the remaining impediments and reinforce efforts to make European capital markets deeper and more liquid.[1[2]] Step by step, we are improving our financial structures to support a single market of half a billion consumers, underpin the stability of our single currency and channel savings towards financing sustainable growth. One area that has received less attention from policymakers in recent years, however, is the European retail payments market, in particular point-of-sale and online payments. It is true that a lot has been achieved at the back-end of European retail payments systems, most notably under the umbrella of the Single Euro Payments Area, or SEPA. SEPA allows payments to be processed across borders at the same cost, and as efficiently and safely, as national payments. More recently, the Eurosystem has also introduced TARGET Instant Payment Settlement, or TIPS. This service, which was launched a year ago, enables payment service providers to transfer funds to their customers in real time, around the clock, every single day of the year. And it settles the payments in central bank money. But progress at the back-end has not translated into similar progress at the front-end, which remains fragmented, with no European solution emerging for point-of-sale and online payments. National providers in particular have not been able, or willing, to act in a pan-European manner. 20 years after the introduction of the single currency, we still do not have a European card scheme. Ten European countries currently have national card schemes that do not accept cards from other EU countries. This has led to a notable rise in the use of non-European cards for non-cash payments. At the end of 2016, the share of transactions made with international card schemes was a little more than two-thirds. It is unfortunate that past harmonisation initiatives have failed to explore the significant economies of scale that the Single Market offers. In addition, the current situation has attracted new initiatives that aim to overcome shortcomings in cross-border retail payments by building a new separate payments ecosystem. These initiatives highlight the rapidly rising consumer demand for payment services that work across borders and that are also faster, cheaper and easier to use. Among younger people in particular, there is a willingness and curiosity to use new technologies and try new providers. Relying exclusively on non-European and new ecosystems presents two risks, however. The first relates to the untested nature of some initiatives. Global stablecoin arrangements, for example, raise potential risks across a broad range of policy domains, such as legal certainty, investor protection, financial stability and compliance with anti-money laundering requirements. Public authorities have made clear that the bar will be set very high for these stablecoin initiatives to be allowed to operate.[2[3]] The second risk relates to the autonomy and resilience of European payments systems. Dependence on non-European global players creates a risk that the European payments market will not be fit to support our Single Market and single currency, making it more susceptible to external disruption such as cyber threats, and that service providers with global market power will not necessarily act in the best interest of European stakeholders. Strategic autonomy in payments is part and parcel of the European agenda to assert the euro's international role.[3[4]]The rising challenges to our global governance system have contributed to the belief that the EU may be more exposed to the risk that the monetary power of others is not used in its best interests, or is even used against it.[4[5]] The Eurosystem's retail payments strategy: a pan-European vision The only effective response to these risks is for European stakeholders to step up their collaboration and act together to provide payment solutions that both reflect the demands of consumers and strengthen the Single Market. With this in mind, earlier this month the ECB's Governing Council decided to relaunch its retail payments strategy. The aim of our strategy is to inter alia actively foster pan-European market initiatives for retail payments at the location of the purchase or interaction - so-called point-of-interaction, or POI, payments. In the view of the Governing Council, these market initiatives would have to fulfil five key objectives. Pan-European reach and customer experience Customers should be able to make POI payments throughout the entire European Union just as efficiently and safely as in their home country. To this end, pan-European reach with wide merchant acceptance and a sound and efficient governance (see below) is needed to achieve critical mass, which is necessary for a network industry, and to fully exploit the benefits of the Single Market. Scale will drive consumer adoption and trust, which is pivotal in e-commerce. Convenient and cost-efficient A European retail payments solution will only be accepted if it fully addresses user needs and demands. So the solution needs to enable an easy, flexible, secure and user-friendly payment experience for both consumers and merchants. This requires that payments can be performed using different tools and instruments, such as payment cards, mobile phones, wearables and instant payments, as well through other channels and technologies, such as near-field communication. Relying on previously unavailable instant payments technology could be the key to designing a solution that is more efficient than existing ones. Subsequent cost savings for merchants will eventually lower consumer prices and benefit every citizen. Safety and security A new European payments solution must comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements. It should provide the highest levels of fraud prevention and offer consumer protection with robust complaint and refund procedures.[5[6]] European identity and governance A common brand and logo should be adopted to foster European identity. A European governance structure could enable European payment stakeholders to have a direct influence on the strategic direction and business models. These stakeholders should be incentivised to design a payment solution under their governance that meets the needs of European customers. Global acceptance To fully meet the needs of end users, a new European solution should also be accessible to merchants based outside the EU, which will reinforce economies of scale and domestic adoption. Global acceptance should therefore be a long-term goal. The need for a pan-European market-led solution These five key objectives form the heart of the Eurosystem's retail payments strategy. They provide a conceptual vision that should be fleshed out by the private sector. The Eurosystem therefore welcomes the strategic initiative of a number of major European banks to create a true pan-European retail payment solution that has the potential to meet the vision of our strategy. The proposed solution would be based on the SEPA credit transfer instant (SCT Inst) scheme, which is in our view the correct approach as it is future-oriented. And it could capitalise from day one on existing powerful and sophisticated infrastructures, such as the Eurosystem's TIPS. What is now needed, however, is a strong commitment from the proponents of the new initiative, and a clear roadmap to meet the envisaged objectives, so that we can see tangible actions emerge soon. Proponents should also work closely with the European Commission to ensure that any project will be open and comply with EU competition rules. This also means that if and when other initiatives emerge, they will of course be considered equally. Public initiatives may be useful and needed from time to time to support industry-led solutions. The European Commission, for example, could propose legislation obliging payment service providers to adopt instant payments within a certain period if a critical mass has not been reached by, say, the end of 2020. Other regulatory changes may be needed in due course. For its part, the Eurosystem stands ready to provide additional technical assistance where useful and required. For example, we will analyse how we could support the search for solutions that ensure that SCT Inst-compliant clearing mechanisms can be fully integrated. Current private solutions for the clearing of instant payments still have not addressed interoperability issues in a satisfactory manner. This requires further analysis and action. The ECB will also continue to monitor how new technologies change payment behaviour in the euro area, for example through a reduced demand for cash. We will explore how, and to which extent, central banks would need to adapt their policies and instruments to face challenges to consumer protection and monetary policy transmission that could arise from such changes. For example, a central bank digital currency could ensure that citizens remain able to use central bank money even if cash is eventually no longer used. A digital currency of this sort could take a variety of forms, the benefits and costs of which the ECB and other central banks are currently investigating, being mindful of their broader consequences on financial intermediation. But potential central bank initiatives should not discourage or crowd out private market-led solutions for fast and efficient retail payments in the euro area. Conclusion Let me conclude. Global payments markets are undergoing a transformation. Rapid technological progress, regulatory reforms and rising cross-industry initiatives, in particular by large global digital firms, have led to unprecedented dynamics and are putting established banks and payment service providers under considerable pressure. In this environment, there are clear signs that Europe is at risk of losing its economic edge. Country-specific solutions lack the necessary size and scale, and national fragmentation has paralysed competition and stifled innovation on the pan-European level. In the worst case scenario, this may endanger the autonomy of European payment systems. The vision of an industry-led, pan-European retail payment solution is therefore at the heart of the Eurosystem's retail payment strategy that I have outlined this morning. A pan-European strategy that facilitates instant, secure and inexpensive payments - both online and in brick and mortar stores - has the potential to make up lost ground and meet the rising needs of consumers for efficient cross-border payments. Better affordability, quality and choice will also promote financial inclusion. The Eurosystem therefore welcomes the recent initiative of European banks to join forces and envisage a payment solution for the euro area as a whole. Thank you. [1]See also C\u0153ur, B.

Ten years ago, 24 European banks collaborated in a consortium called Monnet[7] to create an alternative payments scheme for Europe. There was also the Euro Alliance of Payment Schemes (Eaps) and PayFair. These did not succeed and the large card schemes insist that increased competition in payment services would be a costly waste of time. So far, so true, although there are many schemes out there. <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Card-schemes.png\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Card-schemes.png</url> The two largest[8]are in India and China. India has RuPay and China has Union Pay. Described as Alternative Payment Methods, or APMs, there are many such schemes emerging around the world[9] to try to avoid the foreign exchange and transaction costs of the major card processors. Having said that, the major card processors believe their breadth and depth of coverage globally makes it uneconomic for any local processor to compete with them. It will therefore be interesting to see how the PEPSI project plays out, bearing in mind that Europe has tried several times in the past to create an alternative card scheme that covers the region and failed. That is not just because of the lack of a co-ordinated and co-operative approach (the Coca-Cola way), but because there are domestic card schemes around Europe that don't want a Pan-European replacement. For example, there may be French banks behind PEPSI but they are also behind Cartes Bancaires[10],a major domestic scheme co-branded with Visa and MasterCard. This conflicted approach is why Europe has failed to create an alternative to Visa and MasterCard in the past. Will they succeed this time? I have my doubts, but then my country voted to leave all these guys to do their own thing so you never know.

Europe is particularly sensitive to privacy issues because spying by the Nazi-era Gestapo and the secret services in the Soviet Union is still within living memory.</p><p>\"For us, it's all about citizens and citizens have the right to privacy,\" said Eric Leandri, chairman of Paris-based Qwant. He said that view contrasts with the mindset across the Atlantic, where internet users are seen as consumers whose rights are dictated by the terms of their agreements with tech companies.</p><p>Traffic numbers show interest is rising. Qwant handled nearly 10 billion queries in 2017, more than triple the previous year. On a monthly basis, it's getting 80 million visits while requests are growing 20 percent. Leandri says the site now accounts for 6 percent of search engine market share in France, its biggest market.</p><p>Qwant is even getting official support. Last month the French army and parliament both said they would drop Google and use Qwant as their default search engine, as part of efforts to reclaim European \"digital sovereignty.\"</p><p>The site doesn't use tracking cookies or profile users, allowing it to give two different users the exact same result. It has built its own index of 20 billion pages covering French, German and Italian. It plans to expand the index to about two dozen other languages, for which it currently relies on results from Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>Mojeek, based in Brighton, England, operates on similar principles and has so far cataloged 2 billion webpages. The company says it gets 200,000 unique visitors a month and search queries have quintupled over the past year.</p><p>Germany's Unbubble is a \"meta-search\" engine, sending encrypted queries to more than 30 other search engines and hiding its users' locations. It promises neutral search results rather than ones filtered by an algorithm catering to personal biases.</p><p>To be sure, Google's in no danger of toppling. The company based in Mountain View, California, accounts for three-quarters or more of global market share, depending on whom you ask, and rules the mobile market with its Android operating system.</p><p>Some privacy search operators say an equally big motivation behind these startups is to avoid \"filter bubbles,\" in which internet content is pre-selected for users by the likes of Google and Facebook based on previous searches and other data.</p><p>\"The main idea is to provide neutral information and allow people to depend less on machine learning-based filters,\" said Unbubble founder Tobias Sasse. \"If you are using Google today, perhaps you'll notice that there is always the same mainstream information,\" preventing people from seeing the \"great diversity\" online, he said.</p><p>Netherlands-based Startpage anonymizes Google search results, stripping out ads and tracking. Another British startup, Oscobo , does anonymous searches for U.K. users, with results licensed from Yahoo/Bing. Outside Europe, there's also U.S. site DuckDuckGo .</p><p>Some of these sites rely financially on donations, others from \"affiliate advertising\" - links from Amazon, eBay or other shopping sites that pay a commission but don't target or track users.

Europe is particularly sensitive to privacy issues because spying by the Nazi-era Gestapo and the secret services in the Soviet Union is still within living memory.</p><p>\"For us, it's all about citizens and citizens have the right to privacy,\" said Eric Leandri, chairman of Paris-based Qwant. He said that view contrasts with the mindset across the Atlantic, where internet users are seen as consumers whose rights are dictated by the terms of their agreements with tech companies.</p><p>Traffic numbers show interest is rising. Qwant handled nearly 10 billion queries in 2017, more than triple the previous year. On a monthly basis, it's getting 80 million visits while requests are growing 20 per cent. Leandri says the site now accounts for 6 per cent of search engine market share in France, its biggest market.</p><p>Qwant is even getting official support. Last month the French army and parliament both said they would drop Googleand use Qwant as their default search engine, as part of efforts to reclaim European \"digital sovereignty.\"</p><p>The site doesn't use tracking cookies or profile users, allowing it to give two different users the exact same result. It has built its own index of 20 billion pages covering French, German and Italian. It plans to expand the index to about two dozen other languages, for which it currently relies on results from Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>Mojeek, based in Brighton, England, operates on similar principles and has so far cataloged 2 billion webpages. The company says it gets 200,000 unique visitors a month and search queries have quintupled over the past year.</p><p>Germany's Unbubble is a \"meta-search\" engine, sending encrypted queries to more than 30 other search engines and hiding its users' locations. It promises neutral search results rather than ones filtered by an algorithm catering to personal biases.</p><p>To be sure, Google's in no danger of toppling. The company based in Mountain View, California, accounts for three-quarters or more of global market share, depending on whom you ask, and rules the mobile market with its Android operating system.</p><p>Some privacy search operators say an equally big motivation behind these startups is to avoid \"filter bubbles,\" in which internet content is pre-selected for users by the likes of Googleand Facebook based on previous searches and other data.</p><p>\"The main idea is to provide neutral information and allow people to depend less on machine learning-based filters,\" said Unbubble founder Tobias Sasse. \"If you are using Googletoday, perhaps you'll notice that there is always the same mainstream information,\" preventing people from seeing the \"great diversity\" online, he said.</p><p>Netherlands-based Startpage anonymizes Googlesearch results, stripping out ads and tracking. Another British startup, Oscobo , does anonymous searches for U.K. users, with results licensed from Yahoo/Bing. Outside Europe, there's also U.S. site DuckDuckGo .</p><p>Some of these sites rely financially on donations, others from \"affiliate advertising\" - links from Amazon, eBay or other shopping sites that pay a commission but don't target or track users. That's different from Google's behavioural, or targeted, ads that come up based on your search history, which many find creepy and invasive.</p><p>Mojeek has private investors. Founder Marc Smith, who began in 2004 with two servers in his bedroom, is \"very much anti-advertising,\" said Finn Brownbill, Mojeek's head of marketing. \"It's a necessary evil and we'll look for whatever route we can to avoid it.\"</p><p>In Switzerland, a country whose banking sector became a byword for secrecy, Swisscows has grown rapidly, handling 20 million search queries a month, up from 14 million a year ago, said founder Andreas Wiebe.</p><p>Even so, Wiebe said there was plenty of skepticism when he started the site. \"In 2014, I had people talking to me (saying) 'you're crazy',\" and that the project would be dead within a year.

Europe is particularly sensitive to privacy issues because spying by the Nazi-era Gestapo and the secret services in the Soviet Union is still within living memory.<br/> \"For us, it's all about citizens and citizens have the right to privacy,\" said Eric Leandri, chairman of Paris-based Qwant. He said that view contrasts with the mindset across the Atlantic, where internet users are seen as consumers whose rights are dictated by the terms of their agreements with tech companies.<br/> Traffic numbers show interest is rising. Qwant handled nearly 10 billion queries in 2017, more than triple the previous year. On a monthly basis, it's getting 80 million visits while requests are growing 20 percent. Leandri says the site now accounts for 6 percent of search engine market share in France, its biggest market.<br/> Qwant is even getting official support. Last month the French army and parliament both said they would drop Google and use Qwant as their default search engine, as part of efforts to reclaim European \"digital sovereignty.\"<br/> The site doesn't use tracking cookies or profile users, allowing it to give two different users the exact same result. It has built its own index of 20 billion pages covering French, German and Italian. It plans to expand the index to about two dozen other languages, for which it currently relies on results from Microsoft's Bing.<br/> Mojeek, based in Brighton, England, operates on similar principles and has so far cataloged 2 billion webpages. The company says it gets 200,000 unique visitors a month and search queries have quintupled over the past year.<br/> Germany's Unbubble is a \"meta-search\" engine, sending encrypted queries to more than 30 other search engines and hiding its users' locations. It promises neutral search results rather than ones filtered by an algorithm catering to personal biases.<br/> To be sure, Google's in no danger of toppling. The company based in Mountain View, California, accounts for three-quarters or more of global market share, depending on whom you ask, and rules the mobile market with its Android operating system.<br/> Some privacy search operators say an equally big motivation behind these startups is to avoid \"filter bubbles,\" in which internet content is pre-selected for users by the likes of Google and Facebook based on previous searches and other data.<br/> \"The main idea is to provide neutral information and allow people to depend less on machine learning-based filters,\" said Unbubble founder Tobias Sasse. \"If you are using Google today, perhaps you'll notice that there is always the same mainstream information,\" preventing people from seeing the \"great diversity\" online, he said.<br/>Netherlands-based Startpage anonymizes Google search results, stripping out ads and tracking. Another British startup, Oscobo , does anonymous searches for UK users, with results licensed from Yahoo/Bing. Outside Europe, there's also US site DuckDuckGo .<br/> Some of these sites rely financially on donations, others from \"affiliate advertising\" - links from Amazon, eBay or other shopping sites that pay a commission but don't target or track users. That's different from Google's behavioral, or targeted, ads that come up based on your search history, which many find creepy and invasive.<br/> Mojeek has private investors. Founder Marc Smith, who began in 2004 with two servers in his bedroom, is \"very much anti-advertising,\" said Finn Brownbill, Mojeek's head of marketing. \"It's a necessary evil and we'll look for whatever route we can to avoid it.\"<br/> In Switzerland, a country whose banking sector became a byword for secrecy, Swisscows has grown rapidly, handling 20 million search queries a month, up from 14 million a year ago, said founder Andreas Wiebe.<br/> Even so, Wiebe said there was plenty of skepticism when he started the site. \"In 2014, I had people talking to me (saying) 'you're crazy',\" and that the project would be dead within a year. Instead, National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations of U.S. government surveillance the following year gave it a kickstart.<br/>  Swisscows has built its own German-language web index.

Europe is particularly sensitive to privacy issues because spying by the Nazi-era Gestapo and the secret services in the Soviet Union is still within living memory.</p><p>\"For us, it's all about citizens and citizens have the right to privacy,\" said Eric Leandri, chairman of Paris-based Qwant. He said that view contrasts with the mindset across the Atlantic, where internet users are seen as consumers whose rights are dictated by the terms of their agreements with tech companies.</p><p>Traffic numbers show interest is rising. Qwant's queries tripled to 10 billion in 2017. On a monthly basis, it's getting 80 million visits while requests are growing 20 percent. Leandri says the site now accounts for 6 percent of search engine market share in France, its biggest market.</p><p>Qwant is even getting official support. Last month the French army and parliament both said they would drop Google and use Qwant as their default search engine, as part of efforts to reclaim European \"digital sovereignty.\"</p><p>The site doesn't use tracking cookies or profile users, allowing it to give two different users the exact same result. It has built its own index of 20 billion pages covering French, German and Italian and plans to expand it to about two dozen other languages, for which results currently come from Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>To be sure, Google's in no danger of toppling. The company based in Mountain View, California, accounts for three-quarters or more of global market share, depending on whom you ask, and rules the mobile market with its Android operating system.</p><p>Mojeek, based in Brighton, England, operates on similar principles and has so far cataloged 2 billion webpages. The company says it gets 200,000 unique visitors a month and search queries have quintupled over the past year.</p><p>Another British startup, Oscobo, does anonymous searches for U.K. users with results licensed from Yahoo/Bing. Netherlands-based Startpage anonymizes Google search results, stripping out ads and tracking.</p><p>Pat Walshe, a U.K.-based privacy consultant, has been using Startpage and Qwant for years and says has never felt their services were inferior to Google's.</p><p>\"I don't think people would go back if they started using these sites,\" Walshe said. They're \"allowing you to have greater choice and control and should hopefully minimize the tracking,\" which means you'll no longer see, for example, the same ad for a pair of shoes following you around online, he said.</p><p>Walshe likes Startpage's new \"anonymous view\" feature, which goes a step further by letting users browse a copy of a website from its search results, not the actual site.</p><p>Germany's Unbubble is a \"meta-search\" site, sending encrypted queries to more than 30 other search engines. It promises neutral search results rather than ones filtered by an algorithm catering to personal biases.</p><p>Outside Europe, there's also U.S. site DuckDuckGo.</p><p>Some privacy search operators say it's equally important to help users avoid \"filter bubbles,\" in which content is pre-selected by the likes of Google and Facebook based on previous searches and other data.</p><p>\"The main idea is to provide neutral information and allow people to depend less on machine learning-based filters,\" said Unbubble founder Tobias Sasse. \"If you are using Google today, perhaps you'll notice that there is always the same mainstream information,\" preventing people from seeing the \"great diversity\" online, he said.</p><p>Some sites rely on donations, others from \"affiliate advertising\" - links from shopping sites that pay a commission but don't target or track users. That's different from Google's behavioral, or targeted, ads that come up based on your search history, which many find creepy and invasive.</p><p>Mojeek has private investors. Founder Marc Smith, who began in 2004 with two servers in his bedroom, believes advertising is \"a necessary evil and we'll look for whatever route we can to avoid it,\" said marketing chief Finn Brownbill.</p><p>In Switzerland, a country whose banking sector became a byword for secrecy, Swisscows has thrived, with monthly search queries jumping by nearly half to 20 million from a year ago, said founder Andreas Wiebe, who also runs software company Hulbee.</p><p>Even so, Wiebe said he met plenty of skepticism at the start. \"In 2014, I had people talking to me (saying) 'you're crazy',\" and that the project would be dead within a year. Instead, National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations of U.S. government surveillance in 2015 gave it a kickstart.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Kelvin Chan at twitter.com/chanman</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-dd8824e6f9424439b66e3992882b5c0b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSW-P0W1-JC65-5094-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><timeReceived>12:33 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Europe is particularly sensitive to privacy issues because spying by the Nazi-era Gestapo and the secret services in the Soviet Union is still within living memory.</p><p>\"For us, it's all about citizens and citizens have the right to privacy,\" said Eric Leandri, chairman of Paris-based Qwant. He said that view contrasts with the mindset across the Atlantic, where internet users are seen as consumers whose rights are dictated by the terms of their agreements with tech companies.</p><p>Traffic numbers show interest is rising. Qwant's queries tripled to 10 billion in 2017. On a monthly basis, it's getting 80 million visits while requests are growing 20 percent. Leandri says the site now accounts for 6 percent of search engine market share in France, its biggest market.</p><p>Qwant is even getting official support. Last month the French army and parliament both said they would drop Google and use Qwant as their default search engine, as part of efforts to reclaim European \"digital sovereignty.\"</p><p>The site doesn't use tracking cookies or profile users, allowing it to give two different users the exact same result. It has built its own index of 20 billion pages covering French, German and Italian and plans to expand it to about two dozen other languages, for which results currently come from Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>To be sure, Google's in no danger of toppling. The company based in Mountain View, California, accounts for three-quarters or more of global market share, depending on whom you ask, and rules the mobile market with its Android operating system.</p><p>Mojeek, based in Brighton, England, operates on similar principles and has so far cataloged 2 billion webpages. The company says it gets 200,000 unique visitors a month and search queries have quintupled over the past year.</p><p>Another British startup, Oscobo, does anonymous searches for U.K. users with results licensed from Yahoo/Bing. Netherlands-based Startpage anonymizes Google search results, stripping out ads and tracking.</p><p>Pat Walshe, a U.K.-based privacy consultant, has been using Startpage and Qwant for years and says has never felt their services were inferior to Google's.</p><p>\"I don't think people would go back if they started using these sites,\" Walshe said. They're \"allowing you to have greater choice and control and should hopefully minimize the tracking,\" which means you'll no longer see, for example, the same ad for a pair of shoes following you around online, he said.</p><p>Walshe likes Startpage's new \"anonymous view\" feature, which goes a step further by letting users browse a copy of a website from its search results, not the actual site.</p><p>Germany's Unbubble is a \"meta-search\" site, sending encrypted queries to more than 30 other search engines. It promises neutral search results rather than ones filtered by an algorithm catering to personal biases.</p><p>Outside Europe, there's also U.S. site DuckDuckGo.</p><p>Some privacy search operators say it's equally important to help users avoid \"filter bubbles,\" in which content is pre-selected by the likes of Google and Facebook based on previous searches and other data.</p><p>\"The main idea is to provide neutral information and allow people to depend less on machine learning-based filters,\" said Unbubble founder Tobias Sasse. \"If you are using Google today, perhaps you'll notice that there is always the same mainstream information,\" preventing people from seeing the \"great diversity\" online, he said.</p><p>Some sites rely on donations, others from \"affiliate advertising\" - links from shopping sites that pay a commission but don't target or track users. That's different from Google's behavioral, or targeted, ads that come up based on your search history, which many find creepy and invasive.</p><p>Mojeek has private investors. Founder Marc Smith, who began in 2004 with two servers in his bedroom, believes advertising is \"a necessary evil and we'll look for whatever route we can to avoid it,\" said marketing chief Finn Brownbill.</p><p>In Switzerland, a country whose banking sector became a byword for secrecy, Swisscows has thrived, with monthly search queries jumping by nearly half to 20 million from a year ago, said founder Andreas Wiebe, who also runs software company Hulbee.</p><p>Even so, Wiebe said he met plenty of skepticism at the start. \"In 2014, I had people talking to me (saying) 'you're crazy',\" and that the project would be dead within a year. Instead, National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations of U.S. government surveillance in 2015 gave it a kickstart.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Kelvin Chan at twitter.com/chanman</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APNE-dd8824e6f9424439b66e3992882b5c0b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSW-P7C1-DYN6-W0R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><timeReceived>12:33 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Qwant's queries tripled to 10 billion in 2017. On a monthly basis, it's getting 80 million visits while requests are growing 20 percent.

They also benefit from strong balance sheets, and are expected to enjoy rising revenues in future. But still, some of the valuations are eye-wateringly high.</p><p> John Teahan, portfolio manager, RWC Partners Equity Income fund, writes that Amazon's growth is particularly remarkable.</p><p>Amazon Inc is surely a candidate for the eighth wonder of the world. It is a manmade creation that has so far defied the laws of finance.</p><p>The share price return of 199,908% since its IPO in 1997 (from a split adjusted share price of $1.50 to $3,000), equating to 39% compound annual return, is only part of the story.</p><p>The stock has had an outsized influence on the global stock market; over the last ten years it has contributed 3% to the MSCI World Index total return (MSCI World returned 100% for ten years to end of March), behind only Apple and Microsoft and that due to their larger starting weights (0.95% and 1.05% respectively, versus 0.21% for Amazon). The average stock contribution to the Index was 4bps.</p><p>What is truly wonderous is the consistent revenue growth. In the 2000s the company grew at 29% per annum so that by March 2010 it had annual revenues of $27b. At this point we normally expect the fade in growth to kick in. Not so Amazon - in the 2010s it has generated revenue growth of 27% p.a. The quarter to March 2020 witnessed a 26.4% growth rate over the first quarter in 2019, no sign of slowing in the headline numbers.</p><p>Another wonder is the valuation.

By showing determination and stepping up to the unique challenge posed by the coronavirus, EU leaders will hope this eases political tensions in the years to come.\"</p><p> Anna Stupnytska,  global macro economist at Fidelity International, says the plan will take some pressure off the European Central Bank to keep rescuing the eurozone.</p><p>\"Importantly, the governance of the Recovery Plan has been made more complex. While no member state has a veto power to stop the distribution of aid to another member state, the newly adopted 'super emergency brake' gives any member state the power to oppose a recovery plan, requiring a decision by EU finance ministers or EU leaders. This could result in delay to disbursements. In addition, a weighted majority of EU governments could decide to suspend disbursements altogether to a country in case of evidence of the rule of law violations.</p><p>\"Despite the compromises involved, the agreement on the Recovery Fund sends a strong political signal which could mark a new chapter in the Union's history. EU bond issuance will create a precedent which could become a permanent feature of the institutional framework going forward. With fiscal policy finally stepping up to facilitate the post-COVID recovery, the ECB is no longer 'the only game in town'. This powerful combination of monetary and fiscal policy, as well as the strong political will to not just ensure the union's survival but indeed its success on a number of dimensions, now has the potential - perhaps higher than ever - to lead to more superior economic outcomes in the years ahead.\"</p><p> Nick Wall, alternative fixed income manager at Jupiter Asset Management,  says Europe continues to evolve at moments of crisis - as one founding father predicted </p><p>The collective will to keep the European monetary union alive has proved resilient through the global financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis, the second Greek debt crisis and Brexit. The structural framework of the monetary union improved after each test, and Jean Monnet's mantra that Europe will be \"forged in crisis\" looks like it will still hold true this time, after a very rocky start.</p><p>COVID-19 has been an external shock that exposed the flaws in the EU's institutional framework, but its nature rendered arguments about moral hazard null and void.

But it also shows relief that EU leaders signed off a (EURO)750bn Covid-19 rescue package overnight. As Morgan Stanley analysts puts it: Europe has agreed a (EURO)750bn recovery fund, with a majority of the funds provided as grants, underpinning a stable and more balanced recovery, and a positive outlook for European assets.... Overall, we see the recovery fund - joint issuance to finance transfers at scale to the worst impacted countries - as a game changer for Europe, supporting a synchronised recovery and stronger growth over a sustained period, while making monetary union more stable and the euro more attractive. (and that really is all for today). Late newsflash: The Euro has now hit an 18-month high against the US dollar, reaching $1.15 for the first time since January 2019. Finally....the strong rally in Europe's stock markets faded in late trading, as the jump in the value of the euro and the pound hit stocks. But European stocks have still closed at their highest level since early March, as the recovery from the Covid-19 slump continued. Germany's DAX claimed the prize for the best-performing index, closing up 0.9% today at a five-month high. That means it has very nearly recovered this year's losses, and is now just 0.6% lower than on January 1st thanks to its recent strong recovery. The Italian FTSE MIB also ended higher, on relief that its economy should benefit from new grants and loans from the EU Covid-19 recovery fund. But France's CAC and Spain's IBEX ended the day just 0.2% higher. The deal on the (EURO)750bn EU rescue package, and hopes of a Covid-19 vaccine, both lifted equities, although the initial rush has fizzled slightly. Jeremy Gatto, investment manager at the Cross Asset Solutions team at Unigestion, explains why the deal has boosted European equities: The agreement from EU leaders on the EU recovery fund was welcomed news; despite a rocky start, it ultimately showed unity among the block and commitment to get a deal through. The total size of the package at (EURO)750bn is significant and despite some complexity when breaking down the details this will give a further boost to the post-Covid 19 recovery in the Eurozone. The agreement is also yet another confirmation that leaders from both a fiscal and monetary standpoint stand ready to do whatever it takes to support the economy. In light of the extraordinary stimulus, improving sentiment and macro picture, we remain constructive on growth-orientated assets and believe in the V shape recovery scenario. We have reduced our bond exposure and remain friendly towards credit and equities. We have also recently increased our exposure to Europe as the region is showing an increasingly supportive picture and seems well-positioned for the recovery, given limited second wave impact at this stage. With uncertainty, nevertheless, remaining high and the recovery not uniform, increasing political risk with the approaching US election, and a recent increase in geopolitical tensions, we have complemented our pro-growth allocation with hedges notably in the option space. The UK stock exchange also ended pretty flat. Gambling firm GVC was the top FTSE 100 faller, down 11%, after the UK tax authorities widened their investigation into its former online gambling business in Turkey. But investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown surged 10%, after potential rival Robinhood abandoned its UK launch: The other significant news of the day was that chancellor Rishi Sunak has asked Whitehall departments to find budget savings after launching a review of government spending. Sunak also warned that \"tough choices\" will be made in response to the Covid-19 outbreak. which is driving UK borrowing to record levels. That's probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The US dollar is now coming under pressure, losing ground against major currencies. This has pushed the euro up to $1.1486 (a new four-month high). Sterling has risen to a six-week high, at $1.275. This dollar weakness is bad for European equities, which are losing some of their earlier gains (a stronger euro or pound means overseas earnings are worth less). It's also pushing commodity prices up, keeping oil at a four-month high and gold at a nine-year peak (as covered earlier). Investment platform Willis Owen suspects the dollar is suffering from the huge money-printing programme launched by the US central bank, and America's huge deficit (which hit a record of $864bn in June). The US dollar had been strong for the best part of a decade, but since its March high the currency has been falling. A combination of stimulus from the Federal Reserve creating more US dollars, low savings, and high levels of government debt could mean a weaker US dollar is here to stay. That would be good news for emerging markets where companies borrow in US dollars, as a weaker currency makes their borrowing costs cheaper. Tech companies aren't immune to the Covid-19 recession, of course. Microsoft, for example, is cutting 960 jobs at its LinkedIn business, which has suffered from the slump in vacancies. CEO Ryan Roslansky told staff yesterday that the coronavirus was having \"a sustained impact on the demand for hiring\". The jobs will be cut across its sales and hiring divisions of the group globally. More here. In other tech news, Apple has pledged to be 100 percent carbon neutral across its business, supply chain and product cycle by 2030. The technology giant's corporate operations are already carbon neutral, but it's now pledging that within a decade every Apple device sold will have net zero climate impact. That's a much bolder target. To achieve it, Apple says it will use more low carbon and recycled material, recycle its devices more efficiently and become more energy efficient. It will also support the development of the first-ever direct carbon-free aluminium smelting process. Plus, over 70 suppliers have committed to use 100 percent renewable energy for Apple production. That will avoid over 14.3 million metric tons of CO2e annually - the equivalent of taking more than 3 million cars off the road each year, the firm says. More details here. The US S&amp;P 500 index has also rallied, and is now up over 1% for this year. Quite a recovery.......but not compared to the Nasdaq, which is actually up 20% this year, as traders have poured money into tech stocks. Firms like Microsoft, Amazon and Apple are clear winners in a pandemic that leads to more home working and a greater reliance on technology. They also benefit from strong balance sheets, and are expected to enjoy rising revenues in future. But still, some of the valuations are eye-wateringly high. John Teahan, portfolio manager, RWC Partners Equity Income fund, writes that Amazon's growth is particularly remarkable. Amazon Inc is surely a candidate for the eighth wonder of the world. It is a manmade creation that has so far defied the laws of finance. The share price return of 199,908% since its IPO in 1997 (from a split adjusted share price of $1.50 to $3,000), equating to 39% compound annual return, is only part of the story. The stock has had an outsized influence on the global stock market; over the last ten years it has contributed 3% to the MSCI World Index total return (MSCI World returned 100% for ten years to end of March), behind only Apple and Microsoft and that due to their larger starting weights (0.95% and 1.05% respectively, versus 0.21% for Amazon). The average stock contribution to the Index was 4bps. What is truly wonderous is the consistent revenue growth. In the 2000s the company grew at 29% per annum so that by March 2010 it had annual revenues of $27b. At this point we normally expect the fade in growth to kick in. Not so Amazon - in the 2010s it has generated revenue growth of 27% p.a. The quarter to March 2020 witnessed a 26.4% growth rate over the first quarter in 2019, no sign of slowing in the headline numbers. Another wonder is the valuation. In the last 12 months (to end of March) Amazon made $21 of earnings per share, putting it on a historic price-earnings ratio of over 143 times, and it trades on 5.1 times price to sales. It currently earns a group EBIT margin of around 5%, and within this it earns 2.2% for its non-cloud businesses. But for all that, investors may be wary of getting too close to this wonder of nature: If the trajectory continues it would truly make Amazon the eighth wonder of the world. For investors, I think it is one safer watched from the side lines. Wall Street has joined the rally, with the Nasdaq index hitting yet another record high in opening trading. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 0.7% at the open.... although it's then dipped back a little. The Dow Jones industrial average has pushed higher too, up 0.9% or 247 points at 26,928. Edward Moya, analyst at OANDA, reckons that the virus situation in the US is showing signs of improvement, helping the mood on Wall Street. The virus data in the US suggests coronavirus cases are peaking, California, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina showed meaningful declines..... The case curve seems to be flattening and hospitalizations continue to trend lower. President Trump also reversed his stance on masks and tweeted an image of himself wearing a face mask and indirectly called it patriotic. Over half of the US has mandatory mask orders in place. Trump's troubling poll numbers have created a sense of urgency in changing the narrative so it is no surprise he is also bringing back his 5pm coronavirus task force briefings. In another step towards normality, fast food chain McDonald's will reopen around 700 dine-in restaurants across the UK from Wednesday. My colleague Rebecca Smithers has the details: Food will be served by table service only with customers able to order directly via the My McDonald's app, at the till or kiosk. Diners will also need to leave their contact details - using their phone to scan a QR code or visiting a dedicated webpage - in line with government guidance. The fast food giant said its restaurants will also be taking part in the \"Eat Out to Help Out\" scheme from the chancellor when it starts next month. Rishi Sunak's deal - which aims to encourage families to start eating out - will offer 50% off dine-in bills up to a maximum of \u00a310 per head on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August. Oil has hit a four-month high today, as optimism about the economic outlook drive up energy prices. Brent crude has gained 2.75% today, or $1.2 per barrel, to $44.47. That's the highest since early March. Fiona Frick, chief executive of Unigestion, reckons investors will be happy to lend to the EC, to fund its (EURO)750bn recovery fund. Speaking on Sky News, she says Brussels will be seen as a solid borrower when it taps the debt markets, to fund grants and loans to help members recovery from Covid-19. Frick explains: For the first time there will be a union of countries in Europe in a merger of credit risks. It makes the euro a stronger currency, and make the European block an extremely solid borrower. Hetal Mehta, senior European economist at Legal &amp; General Investment Management is hopeful that this morning's deal on the EU Recovery Fund will bring calm to the region. \"The deal reached on the EU Recovery Fund is historic and a step toward debt mutualisation that was thought highly unlikely just a few months ago. Within the compromises, there was something for everyone; the Frugal Four will get large rebates and lowered the split of grants versus loans while the overall size at (EURO)750bn was unchanged. By showing determination and stepping up to the unique challenge posed by the coronavirus, EU leaders will hope this eases political tensions in the years to come.\" Anna Stupnytska, global macro economist at Fidelity International, says the plan will take some pressure off the European Central Bank to keep rescuing the eurozone. \"Importantly, the governance of the Recovery Plan has been made more complex. While no member state has a veto power to stop the distribution of aid to another member state, the newly adopted 'super emergency brake' gives any member state the power to oppose a recovery plan, requiring a decision by EU finance ministers or EU leaders. This could result in delay to disbursements. In addition, a weighted majority of EU governments could decide to suspend disbursements altogether to a country in case of evidence of the rule of law violations. \"Despite the compromises involved, the agreement on the Recovery Fund sends a strong political signal which could mark a new chapter in the Union's history. EU bond issuance will create a precedent which could become a permanent feature of the institutional framework going forward. With fiscal policy finally stepping up to facilitate the post-COVID recovery, the ECB is no longer 'the only game in town'. This powerful combination of monetary and fiscal policy, as well as the strong political will to not just ensure the union's survival but indeed its success on a number of dimensions, now has the potential - perhaps higher than ever - to lead to more superior economic outcomes in the years ahead.\" Nick Wall, alternative fixed income manager at Jupiter Asset Management, says Europe continues to evolve at moments of crisis - as one founding father predicted The collective will to keep the European monetary union alive has proved resilient through the global financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis, the second Greek debt crisis and Brexit. The structural framework of the monetary union improved after each test, and Jean Monnet's mantra that Europe will be \"forged in crisis\" looks like it will still hold true this time, after a very rocky start. COVID-19 has been an external shock that exposed the flaws in the EU's institutional framework, but its nature rendered arguments about moral hazard null and void. Europe's silver lining in this tragic crisis may be that these shortcomings are now being addressed. Here's our news story on Robinhood cancelling its UK launch, by Rob Davies. Incidentally, shares in investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown started to climb when the news broke, and are now up 9% at their highest level since early June. It risked losing UK customers to Robinhood. The US S&amp;P 500 is on track to hit a new five-month high - a day after it turned positive for the year. The price of gold has climbed to a nine-year high today and it may only be \"a matter of time\" before the gold market reaches a record high, analysts believe. The spot market price for the 'safe haven' commodity surged past highs last seen in September 2011 to reach $1,827 per ounce this lunchtime. Gold prices have climbed by about 20% this year as investors increasingly turn to bullion as a fail-safe harbour from the impact of Covid-19. Citi believe the yellow metal may reach a new record by rising to the $2,000 mark before the end of 2020. While the markets are bullish today, with European stocks at five-month highs, gold could provide protection if the pandemic intensifies and shares tumble again. Gold prices have already reached record highs in some developing countries, and the dollar-denominated benchmark may follow suit as the US currency softens in the face of rising coronavirus cases. Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades, said investors are \"looking for a parachute in case of future stock market collapses and are buying gold as insurance\". Drinks giant Coca-Cola has reported that sales slumped in the pandemic, but it's optimistic that the worst is over. Quarterly revenues slumped by 28.5% in the April-June quarter, as sales were hit by global lockdowns as cinemas, bars and restaurants were closed. Net income slid by a third, from 61 cents per share to just 41 cents - slightly higher than expected. Chief executive James Quincey struck an upbeat tone, saying: We believe the second quarter will prove to be the most challenging of the year; however, we still have work to do as we drive our pursuit of 'Beverages for Life' and meet evolving consumer needs. Sales of Coke held up relatively well, certainly compared to coffee (Coca-Cola bought the Costa Coffee chain last year). Here's the details: Sparkling soft drinks declined 12%, led by a decline in India, Western Europe and the fountain business in North America due to pressure in away-from-home channels. Trademark Coca-Cola declined 7%. Coca-Cola\u00ae Zero Sugar declined 4% in the quarter while growing 2% year to date. ? Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages declined 20%, driven by pressure in the Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa operating groups. Water, enhanced water and sports drinks declined 24%, led by Asia Pacific, primarily due to a decline in lower margin water brands. Tea and coffee declined 31%, driven by the impact of the temporary closures of nearly all of the Costa retail stores in Western Europe In another sign of the time, investors are prepared to pay to lend to the UK - even though the country is borrowing at a historic pace. The Debt Management Office sold \u00a33bn of six-year UK government bonds this morning at an average yield, or interest rate, of -0.064%. That means investors will receive slightly less than the price paid today. That will reassure the Treasury, given we learned this morning it borrowed almost \u00a3130bn in April-June. And it shows the impact of the Bank of England's asset-purchase scheme, which was expanded in June to buy \u00a3745bn of UK bonds. That gives investors confidence to buy gilts, as they can sell them onto the central bank. Robinhood will not be riding through the City anytime soon after all. The smartphone stock trading app, which has shaken up Wall Street, has just announced that it has taken the \"difficult decision\" to postpone its UK launch indefinitely, and take down its UK website. It has emailed people who had pre-registered, explaining that it is focusing on its 'core business' in the US, and beefing up its systems: The world has changed a lot over the past several months and we're adapting with it. On a company level, we've come to recognise that our efforts are currently best spent on strengthening our core business in the US and making further investments in our foundational systems. Since we announced our intent to launch in the UK, we've been fueled by your excitement for Robinhood and humbled by your response. We're sorry that we cannot deliver the product we promised you this year. Although our global expansion plans are on hold for now, we will continue our work to democratise finance for all and we look forward to the day when we can bring this mission to the UK. Around 250,000 people had signed up for the UK launch. The site has been extremely popular in America, especially with new traders who bought shares during the Covid-19 crash and are sitting on impressive profits since. But it has also been heavily criticised for exposing people to financial systems and instruments without proper education and safeguards, especially after a student tragically killed himself after wrongly thinking he'd run up a $700,000 loss. The US stock market is also on track to rally, when it opens in three hours time. That would propel the Nasdaq to a fresh record high, as investors clamour to buy big tech stocks. The German stock market has been on a remarkable ride this year. The DAX touched a record high in February 2020, before plunging almost 40% to its lowest level since 2013. But the recovery then began in late March, as governments and central banks took unprecedented action to prop up their economies. The DAX led the way, recovering almost all its losses - and is now slightly higher than on 1st January. Here's the Financial Times's take: The Dax index of German blue-chip stocks rallied nearly 2 per cent on Tuesday, to produce a gain so far this year of 0.4 per cent. It had been down more than 35 per cent during the darkest days of March. Investors also snapped up the debt of EU countries that have endured an especially hard hit to their public finances from the virus. The reaction suggests that the EU has surpassed investors' expectations and laid the framework for tighter co-ordination on fiscal policy in its efforts to overcome the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. \"We see the recovery fund... as a game changer for Europe, supporting a synchronised recovery and stronger growth over a sustained period, while making monetary union more stable and the euro more attractive,\" said Reza Moghadam, a Morgan Stanley economist. A few photos from the climax of the EU summit: Perhaps surprisingly, the euro hasn't kicked on today, now the EU Recovery Fund is in the bag. The single currency is hovering around $1.144 against the US dollar, having hit a four-month high yesterday. Sam Cooper, vice president of Market Risk Solutions at Silicon Valley Bank, reckons the euro will head higher in the coming weeks. \"The positive conclusion of the marathon Brussels summit will be a relief to many market participants who's hopes were pinned on the agreement of the (EURO)750bn recovery fund. Although the euro initially sold off in the aftermath in what appears to be a classic case of buy the rumor, sell the fact, many will welcome the developments and view the intraday weakness as an opportunity to buy a ticket for a long-term euro rally.\" Although the markets are celebrating, there's real disappointment that the EU deal includes cuts for some key projects, and little direct support for the climate emergency. The Just Transition Fund (a key part of Europe's 'Green deal') will get tens of billions of euros less than hoped - with the Horizon innovation scheme also ravaged, as EU leaders tried to find an acceptable package. Euractiv has the details: One of the biggest losers is the Just Transition Fund, which was downgraded from the Commission's (EURO)40 billion climate action war-chest to just (EURO)10 billion, illustrating how low down the pecking order environmental policies ultimately fell during the talks. The final deal maintained the stipulation that only countries that have signed up to the EU-wide goal of climate neutrality by 2050 will be eligible for funding. The recovery fund is meant to tackle the fallout of an unprecedented pandemic but the only instrument meant to support the health sector was scrapped entirely and Horizon Europe, designed to boost innovation, suffered severe cuts as well. Funding for neighbourhood policy and the Solvency Support Instrument, a (EURO)26 billion fund aimed at supporting economically viable private companies, both fell by the wayside. Naomi O'Leary of the Irish Times has also tweeted the details of these cuts, which fall short of the plans drawn up by the European Commission: Today's tide of optimism has just driven the German stock market into positive territory for 2020 -- quite an achievement, given the year we've had. The German DAX is now 1.6% higher today at 13,259 points, or slightly above its closing price on 31 December 2019 (when the world was quite different). Companies which make consumer goods, such as BMW, Continental and Volkswagen, are among the risers. Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains how the EU deal has lifted stocks: The agreement is a classic EU fudge that papers over the schisms but is nonetheless a step forward towards ever closer union, and this time it's fiscal. This has been hailed as Europe's 'Hamiltonian moment' as it involves mutual debt issuance. It's not quite that - we are not talking about mutualisation of countries existing debts. Nevertheless, it sets an important precedent in securing the idea of fiscal coordination, if not union. Italian yields fell to their lowest level in months... European equities were higher on a cocktail of the EU budget deal and the ongoing daily dose of vaccine news. AstraZeneca and Oxford University's candidate is showing promise, whilst there are positive signals from several other quarters. The DAX in Frankfurt surged 1.5% to make a fresh post-Covid high at 13,250 The DAX was already outperforming other major stock markets this year. German companies seem to be benefiting from Berlin's solid handling of the crisis, and expectations of rising exports as the global economy heals. In contrast, European stock markets are down around 9% on average. The UK's FTSE is still 16% lower this year, being dragged down by major players like oil companies and banks (BT and HSBC, for example, are both down a third in 2020). Italian government debt is strengthening, as bond traders hail the EU recovery fund deal. This has pulled the interest rate, or yield, on Italy's 10-year bonds to just 1.05%, the lowest since early March. The cost of the coronavirus pandemic is clear to see in the latest UK public finances, released this morning. The UK borrowed \u00a335.5bn to balance the books last month, around five times as much as in June 2019. That increase was driven by stimulus measures such as the furlough scheme, and increased healthcare costs. This pushed borrowing since April up to \u00a3127.9bn, \u00a3103.9bn more than in the same period last year and the highest borrowing in any April to June period on record. As my colleague Richard Partington explains: The government has been forced to borrow almost \u00a3130bn between April and June to combat the coronavirus pandemic, more than double the amount it did over the whole of last year. Setting out the scale of the economic shock unleashed by the virus, the Office for National Statistics said public borrowing in the first quarter of the 2020-21 financial year jumped to \u00a3127.9bn, the highest quarterly sum since comparable records began in 1993. According to the latest snapshot, borrowing in June was \u00a335.5bn, roughly five times the level in the same month a year ago, albeit a gradual decline from even higher levels of borrowing in April and May during the earlier stages of the pandemic. This year, the deficit could exceed \u00a3320bn, forecasters believe, as it's already approaching the record deficit of nearly \u00a3160bn run-up in 2009-2010 financial year. Here's the full story: Ouch. Shares in gambling company GVC, which owns Ladbrokes Coral, have tumbled by 8% after it told the City it is being probed by the UK tax authorities. The investigation relates to GVC's former Turkish facing online gambling business. For some time, HMRC has been looking at how online gambling payments in Turkey were handled, and yesterday it told the company that it is examining \"potential corporate offending\" by an entity (or entities) within the GVC group. Those entities haven't been identified, but the probe seems to relate to potential failure to prevent bribery. GVC say they are \"surprised by the decision\" to extend the investigation and \"disappointed by the lack of clarity provided by HMRC as to the scope of its investigation\", adding: HMRC has not yet provided details of the nature of the historic conduct it is investigating, with the exception of a reference to section 7 Bribery Act 2010, nor has it clarified which part of the GVC group is under investigation. The UK stock market is lagging behind its perky continental rivals today, but at least it's managed a small gain. The FTSE 100 index has risen by 29 points, or 0.5%, to 6291. Travel and hospitality companies are among the risers, reflecting optimism that a vaccine could help the economy to fully reopen. IAG, which owns British Airways, is the top gainer, up 5%. Hotel and restaurant chain Whitbread has gained 3%, with catering operator Compass up 2.5% and retailer JD Sports 2.4% higher. Take note, investors. Professor Sarah Gilbert, who is leading the Oxford vaccine trial, says there's no certainty that it will be rolled out this year - but it might. Reuters has the details: \"The end of the year target for getting vaccine rollout, it's a possibility but there's absolutely no certainty about that because we need three things to happen,\" Sarah Gilbert told BBC Radio, saying it needed to be shown to work in late stage trials, there needed to be large quantities manufactured and regulators had to agree quickly to licence it for emergency use. \"All of these three things have to happen and come together before we can start seeing large numbers of people vaccinated.\" Those late-stage Phase II/III trials are currently underway in the UK, Brazil and South Africa and are due to start in the US soon. Italy's FTSE MIB index has surged by 1.5% to a four-month high, as traders celebrate the prospect of billions of euros of grants to help fund its recovery. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte sounds optimistic too, saying that the package of grants and loans will help his government to \"change the face of the country.\" Conte said (via Reuters). \"Now we have to run and use these funds for investments and structural reforms. We have a real chance to make Italy greener, more digital, more innovative, more sustainable, inclusive. We have the chance to invest in schools, universities, research and infrastructures.\" In Frankfurt, Germany's DAX index has surged by 1% to its highest level since February 24th. That was the first day of the Covid-19 market crash, which began after Italy imposed local lockdowns, in a desperate bid to control the virus. Ding ding! Europe's major stock markets are open, with gains across the board. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 has jumped 0.7% in early trading, hitting its highest level since March 5 (when markets were wobbling). Asia-Pacific stock markets are all showing gains today. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 is the top performer, up 2.5%, while South Korea's KOSPI 200 has gained 1.5%. China's CSI 300, which took some nasty bumps last week, is up 0.4%. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the EU deal and vaccine optimism are both lifting the mood. Encouraging results from Oxford's vaccine candidate, in addition to EU leaders agreeing to a (EURO)750 billion Recovery Fund is overshadowing rising tension between the UK and China and soaring covid numbers in California. As the marathon EU leaders' talks entered the fifth straight day, an agreement was finally reached. The EU Recovery Fund will be (EURO)390 billion in grants and the remaining (EURO)360 billion in loans to help those countries most affected by the coronavirus pandemic and help the region out of its deepest recession since World War 2. Italy, Spain and Poland are set to gain the most after leaders compromised over the proportions of the fund which would be grants and or loans to please the frugal four. This is being hailed a historic moment for the EU, which is more than a little late to the stimulus party. However, given the boost to risk sentiment this is definitely a case of better late than never. Here's our Brussels team Daniel Boffey and Jennifer Rankin on the EU recovery fund deal: The deal was hard won and the negotiations divided north against south, and east against west, as governments haggled over the terms of both the bloc's seven-year budget and an one-off economic stimulus. The summit, stretching from Friday morning into the early hours of Tuesday, was so prolonged that two leaders, Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg and Ireland's Miche\u00e1l Martin, had to briefly return home before coming back to Brussels. But despite initial opposition from the so-called frugal states of the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark, agreement was finally found, following a final 5.15am session of the 27 on Tuesday morning, to disburse vast sums in the form of non-repayable grants to countries most stricken by the coronavirus pandemic. The breakthrough followed a new proposal from Michel, for the EU to pay out (EURO)390bn in grants countries and (EURO)360bn in loans from the new economic reconstruction fund. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are pushing higher this morning after the EU agreed a landmark deal on a Covid-19 recovery fund. After the longest summit in 20 years, Europe's leaders finally signed off on the (EURO)750bn package to help protect and rebuilt economies hurt by the pandemic. Crucially, it includes a (EURO)390bn programme of grants for the member states hit hardest. That's below the (EURO)500bn package originally proposed by Berlin and Paris in May - but still a very important moment. EU leaders, even the 'frugal' Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland, have agreed that the bloc can borrow collectively to fund the recovery. Leaders also signed off on the EU's next seven-year budget, which will be worth (EURO)1.074tn. European Council president Charles Michel has said the negotiations (which began back on Friday morning), were difficult, but ultimately successful. This is a good deal, a strong deal, the right deal for Europeans now. I believe this will be seen as a pivotal moment on Europe's journey.\" This is going to lift shares in Europe, and strengthen peripheral government debt. Germany's DAX index, for example, is tipped to rise by over 1%. Asia-Pacific stocks have already rallied, led by Australia, as traders welcome the news. But the deal has come at a price, and not just loss of sleep for the leaders and the hard-working Brussels press pack. Funding for some EU projects has been cut, including the Horizons programme designed to boost innovation. Hopes of a Covid-19 vaccine are also rising, after AstraZeneca and Pfizer both reported positive results from their early human trials. This lifted stocks on Wall Street last night, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumping another 2.5%. Traders were encouraging that the Oxford vaccine, which AstraZeneca is producing, is safe and generates an immune response. The team don't yet know that it fights the virus (this is being tested now in larger trials). But hopes are building, as my colleague Sarah Boseley reports: After intensive research, Prof Sarah Gilbert, from Oxford's Jenner Institute, said they were more than happy with the first results, which showed good immunity after a single dose of vaccine. \"We're really pleased that it seems to be behaving just as we thought it would do. We have quite a lot of experience of using this technology to make other vaccines, so we knew what we expected to see, and that's what we have seen,\" she told the Guardian. Any good vaccine news generates a strong response in investors - sending them rushing to buy shares, on hopes that the world economy could return to normality in time. That is allowing investors to largely ignore the fact the pandemic is still raging, with cases surging alarmingly in the US and WHO increasingly worried it is gaining momentum in Africa. As Stephen Innes of AxiCorp puts it: Risk assets are moving to the vaccine pump's beat after it was raining positive vaccine trials overnight, and investors are still dancing in that rain. Ebullience around positive vaccine and the recent round of robust macro data continues to float markets in rough seas. The worsening outlook on the virus front continues to churn in the background. But the fear of the virus is less than it was, so the economic beat down is expected to be less this time around.

As of May 25, people in Europe have a number of important new online privacy rights with the<url normalizedValue=\"http://implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation\">implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation</url>, a powerful and thoughtful effort to provide more control over personal information.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">California families also deserve the right to informed consent when it comes to their personal information: to see what data about them is being collected, shared or sold - and to delete, transfer or block the sale of that data if they desire. They deserve the right to control and access their data, including the ability to move it to another service. They deserve to know that their information is being kept secure.</p><p>How will the General Data Protection Regulation help European families? They win new rights to control how their personal information is collected and whether that data can be shared. Companies have new responsibilities to keep their data secure, and government has a clear role in enforcing the law, which means extracting real penalties when necessary. The European law is not perfect, but it's a huge step toward recognizing that privacy is a fundamental human right that protects all people.</p><p>So why don't families in the United States get the same rights? It's certainly a concern: <url normalizedValue=\"http://84 percent\">84 percent</url>of Americans are worried about privacy. The Facebook breach alone affected more than 87 million individuals, and showed how such enormous data breaches can harm our democracy.</p><p>Today's young people are the most surveilled and tracked generation ever, meaning they are especially vulnerable. Kids are constantly under watch by advertisers and media companies looking for an edge. Their personal information, activities, hobbies and networks are exposed - and for sale - from birth. Today's digital age offers kids opportunities to thrive, but at significant cost to their privacy.</p><p>There is a glaring lack of transparency, as well as inconsistent privacy and security practices, across the entire tech industry, but Big Tech is not a monolith. Not every tech company is beholden to an ad-driven bottom line that turns our kids' clicks into dollars. There are many companies that lead with innovation, without harming our democracy with their business models. Put simply, it is high time that those companies step up and demand the privacy protections that Americans deserve.</p><p>California is the birthplace of the tech revolution, and should lead in creating reforms that protect consumers. There's even a<url normalizedValue=\"http://privacy initiative proposed\">privacy initiative proposed</url>for November's ballot, but that measure won't be enough to protect state residents from another       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://Facebook and CambridgeAnalytica-style data breach\">Facebook and CambridgeAnalytica-style data breach</url>. Instead, the Legislature should take preemptive action. Washington seems incapable of action, and pending initiatives don't go far enough.</p><p>Because the European data regulations apply to any enterprise doing business in the region, many companies have systems in place that comply with those stronger privacy protections. This is California's chance to lead the nation and enact strong, modern, pro-kid privacy protections that provide a regulatory system for all to follow. Common Sense Media exists to educate and advocate for families, so we have long fought for stronger student and children's privacy laws. Now is a unique moment to win stronger privacy rights for every member of the family.</p><p>The parents and kids of California call on our Legislature to pass comprehensive, commonsense privacy reforms this year. Why wait? Companies are already making European kids and families safer online. Why should California, and the rest of America, settle for any less?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SFCHRN-B61749003Z</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SFCHRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SFK-GWJ1-JC8F-554D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8172</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Francisco Chronicle (California)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4092\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 31, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>PRIVACY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>INTERNET</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

In a rather unexpected move, the EU Commission informed the company, on the same day, of its intention to impose interim measures, a long-forgotten tool.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Broadcom, which is a major supplier of components for TV and modem chipsets, is being suspected of having put in place contractual restrictions to exclude its competitors from the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hearings were held in late August.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On October 16, 2019, the EU Commission, likely unconvinced by Broadcom's arguments, ordered Broadcom to unilaterally cease applying exclusivity clauses contained in its agreements with six manufacturers of TV set-top boxes and modems, withhold commercial advantages granted to some of its customers, and refrain from agreeing to the same provisions or like provisions for the time being.</p><p>The investigation on the merits is still ongoing.</p><p>Commenting on the October decision, Commissioner Vestager justified the recourse to interim measures, which had not been used for almost two decades, by saying that DG COMP had \"strong indications\" of Broadcom having engaged in exclusive or quasi-exclusive dealings with key customers and that \"in the absence of intervention, Broadcom's behavior [was] likely to create serious and irreversible harm to competition.\"</p><p>In her official statement about the Broadcom case, Commissioner Vestager made it clear that it would not remain a one-off case and that she was \"committed to making the best possible use of this important tool,\" whose advantages (efficiency, quickness) seemed to have been \"re-discovered\" on this occasion.</p><p>So, why such a change?</p><p>Interim measures, a tool long neglected by the EU Commission</p><p>The EU Commission's power to impose interim measures was first recognized by the EU judge in 1980 in the Camera Care case. In this case, the judge ruled that the EU Commission had the power \"to take interim measures which are indispensable for the effective exercise of its functions and, in particular, for ensuring the effectiveness of any decisions requiring undertakings to bring to an end infringements which it has found to exist.\"</p><p>The conditions to impose such interim measures were further clarified by subsequent caselaw.</p><p>Regulation 1/2003 later codified them as follows: \"In cases of urgency due to the risk of serious and irreparable harm to competition, the Commission, acting on its own initiative may by decision, on the basis of a prima facie finding of infringement, order interim measures\" (Article 8).</p><p>This codification, which could have been viewed as an opportunity to develop the use of this tool, has, instead, discouraged the EU Commission from doing so.</p><p>The conditions set forth in Article 8 of Regulation 1/2003 were indeed perceived as significantly harder to fulfill than the caselaw conditions until then applicable. The risk of a false positive (or Type 1 errors) was another reason for the EU Commission's reluctance to use interim measures.</p><p>Thus, while decisions imposing such measures were already rare, there have simply been none since the entry into force of Regulation 1/2003.</p><p>The Commission is regularly asked to revisit its overly cautious approach to interim measures to no avail - until the Broadcom case.</p><p>Interim measures is a tool already used with some success by EU national competition authorities and is intended to be further developed at a national level</p><p>The EU Commission's status quo contrasted with the dynamism of certain EU Member States' competition authorities.</p><p>With an impressive track record of 27 cases of interim measures imposed between 2002 and 2019, the French Competition Authority (\"FrCA\") has been by far one of the most active. While the greater use of interim measures by the FrCA may be explained by a lower burden of proof (condition of \"likelihood of competition infringement\" for the FrCA versus \"prima facie finding of infringement\" for the EU Commission; condition of \"serious and immediate harm\" construed broadly for the FrCA versus serious and irreparable damage to competition as a whole for the EU Commission), it is also the result of a greater interventionism.</p><p>The fact that certain national competition authorities, like the FrCA, have used interim measures for years, with some success (including in the high-tech industry), has necessarily inspired the EU Commission.</p><p>It may also well be that, with the upcoming implementation of the ECN+ Directive that requires all Member States to enable their competition authorities to resort to interim measures, the EU Commission felt increased pressure to lead by example.</p><p>Dusted off tools for new challenges</p><p>The development of fast-moving markets and the hot debate as to whether the traditional tools of antitrust law are sufficient to tackle the issues posed by some big tech companies also explain the timely resurgence of interim measures.</p><p>While, around the world, legislators, academics, practitioners and competition authorities themselves continue to devise the best possible answer(s), competition authorities must find solutions to address everyday concerns voiced by consumers, clients and competitors confronted with potentially unlawful conduct adopted by big tech companies.</p><p>Dusting off some tools from the existing toolbox clearly forms part of the solution. It has been the case with the notion of exploitative abuse, voluntarily left aside from the Commission's enforcement priorities back in 2009, and now revived.</p><p>It may now be the case with interim measures.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The EU Commission's change of approach to interim measures is good news: certain circumstances do require prompt action to preserve competition on the markets and avoid irreversible harm to consumers, something which can only be achieved by interim measures given the long duration of the investigation on the merits.</p><p>This renewed interest for interim measures should not however make the EU Commission forget too quickly what it has long feared, namely Type 1 errors. Interim measures are prone to these errors which are very costly for the companies concerned and the economy in general. They can discourage companies from innovating and have the power to adversely affect public opinion for years to the detriment of the investigated companies even if the companies are cleared at the end of the day.</p><p>We can, of course, count on companies facing such measures to remind the EU Commission of these limits, as necessary.</p><p>In any event, to know whether this tool has definitively found its place in the EU Commission's arsenal, one will have to wait for the EU judge's reaction either in the Broadcom case, if Broadcom appeals the October decision (which seems highly likely), or in the following case of appeal against interim measures. If the EU Judge sets the bar too high in terms of the standard of proof required from the EU Commission, it will probably consign interim measures to oblivion. If the EU Judge is less demanding, it will open a rift that the EU Commission is sure to rush into.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) is now a reality for over 500 million citizens using uniform credit transfers and direct debits. In contrast, card payments still lack the same degree of market integration and harmonisation of business practices and rules, as well as technical standards. Although cards have been the fastest growing means of payment in Europe for some time, some users (cardholders and merchants) have not benefited as much as they could have if a SEPA for cards had been achieved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The card industry has made significant efforts to achieve the objectives outlined in the 2014 report Card payments in Europe - a renewed focus on SEPA for cards, which presented the Eurosystem's views, policies and objectives. Since the publication of this report, new legislation and substantial technological progress have reshaped the environment for card payments. However, so far this has not led to a harmonised, competitive and innovative European cards payment area. Overall, a SEPA for cards has not yet been achieved.</p><p>The Eurosystem therefore decided to analyse the current state of card payments in Europe and review its policies. This report includes the views of cards market participants from the supply side, obtained during a market consultation conducted in late 2017. It enumerates measures by cards market participants that are conducive to a SEPA for cards. In a SEPA for cards, a number of impediments would be abolished, including: (i) a lack of interoperability between cards and terminals, (ii) limitations on merchants accepting certain cards, and (iii) cardholders being confused by different payment experiences across Europe.</p><p>To achieve the above objectives, coordination among cards market players is of the utmost importance, in particular in the area of cards standardisation. However, multiple players actively promote their own services based on proprietary standards, thereby hindering progress in this area. Players from the supply side of the cards market believe the migration towards harmonised standard needs to be market-driven and justified by business case considerations. The Eurosystem takes note of this reasoning and acknowledges that most existing national card schemes actually operate on a relatively low cost basis, which has benefited users in the past. However, to some extent, this has constrained investment in the modernisation of their services and prevented efforts towards achieving a pan-European approach. Taking this into account, the SEPA for cards objectives could be better served by supply-side stakeholders investing in current, or possibly new, processing infrastructure. In addition, such developments could facilitate technical interoperability, provided they are based on common standards and incorporate state-of-the-art technology and innovations.</p><p>The Eurosystem acknowledges that, in general, European cardholders are able to pay with one card all over Europe. However, at present the pan-European acceptance of cards issued under a national card scheme is entirely reliant on co-badging with an international card scheme. Increasingly, payment service providers only issue cards from international card schemes. Such an arrangement calls into question market efficiency in terms of costs, competition and governance, as European payment service providers have little or no influence on the market's development. In the past, all attempts to establish a common European card payment scheme have failed, as national card schemes and banks did not see a viable business case in the short term.</p><p>The implementation of a European instant payments scheme and the development of common or interoperable instant payments infrastructure to process such payments may create new momentum to interconnect existing national card schemes. The use of this newly installed instant payments infrastructure could be a way to support the interlinking and interoperability of national card schemes and, if full pan-European coverage is ensured, would provide a possible alternative to establishing a European card scheme. To promote the use of such cards, it would be helpful to have a common European logo indicating the possibility of using the cards of national card schemes at EU level.</p><p>Furthermore, innovative technologies will bring more competition to the cards market and boost the range of choices for consumers. They are also expected to affect the evolution of card-based products, including changes in merchants' payment acceptance technologies. However, innovations may be capital intensive and thus smaller market participants might experience difficulties in keeping up with technological progress. There is therefore a risk of innovations not being introduced in some markets in Europe, while others may already benefit from them. The Eurosystem welcomes innovative solutions that enable efficient, convenient and secure card payments. In principle, these should be designed (i) to enable pan-European reach, even if at first they target national environments, and (ii) to not perpetuate fragmentation of the cards market. Thus, deeper cooperation and dialogue among relevant market players, in particular incumbents and newcomers, is highly supported.</p><p>Finally, it should be borne in mind that the European cards industry has already implemented or is currently implementing two important pieces of EU legislation aimed at supporting a harmonised, competitive and innovative cards market. These are the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR) and the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). The Eurosystem welcomes both legal acts, as they provide the legal foundation for an integrated cards market aimed at increasing efficiency, competitiveness and safety. While market players from the supply side generally welcome the objectives of the acts and the rules stipulated therein, they also call for the rules to be implemented in a harmonised fashion by Member States and caution against further regulation of the market. In their view, any amendments to the current legislation should take into account the results of a thorough and comprehensive impact assessment of the entire applicable legal and regulatory framework as well as market concerns and business requirements. To ensure that the interests of the card industry are represented, the Eurosystem encourages all relevant stakeholders to actively take part in public consultations on reviews of existing regulation and drafts of potential new legal acts.</p><p>For almost two decades various market players have striven for payments harmonisation in Europe. This goal was achieved for credit transfers and direct debits, while harmonisation for card payments is still lagging behind. Although numerous important objectives for card payments have been achieved, a SEPA for cards has not yet been achieved. Therefore, further action by various players to address outstanding issues hampering a SEPA for cards is much needed. The implementation of instant payments may help to achieve this goal sooner, as it can be instrumental in interconnecting national card schemes, thereby creating pan-European reach and a stronger basis for innovation. Thus interconnectivity and interoperability of existing national card schemes, based on common and open standards and taking advantage of standards and solutions used in SEPA, would facilitate card payments at EU level. The Eurosystem is committed to supporting the activities still needed to achieve a SEPA for cards as soon as possible and to facilitating dialogue amongst market players.</p><p>1 Introduction</p><p>Over the last few years, an evolution towards a more integrated retail payments market has taken place in Europe. In the context of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), the European Payments Council (EPC) has developed schemes setting rules and standards that allow harmonised credit transfers and direct debits at pan-European level. By means of the SEPA End-Date Regulation, payment service users have been able to make such payments under the same conditions everywhere in SEPA since August 2014.</p><p>Despite being seen as a third pillar of the SEPA project, a SEPA for cards, aimed at creating a harmonised, competitive and innovative card payment area, has not been fully achieved. Under the auspices of the EPC, and now the European Cards Stakeholders Group (ECSG), cards market players have made substantial efforts to set common rules and standards. As migration to these is voluntary, harmonisation in the field of cards is continuing to lag behind credit transfers and direct debits. Consequently, national cards markets have to some extent remained fragmented, not allowing European cardholders to use their national cards elsewhere in Europe. The European-wide acceptance of cards issued under national card schemes is only possible due to prevalent co-badging with international card payment schemes.</p><p>Although technically feasible, a number of efforts and initiatives undertaken in the last few years to establish a European card scheme or to achieve European-wide cross-border coverage of national card schemes have so far not been successful. The absence of a European card scheme, combined with the well-established presence of international card schemes, has accelerated the extensive practice of co-badging. In addition, the number of national card schemes has also been diminishing.</p><p>Card usage, however, is growing significantly in Europe. With nearly 70 billion payments in 2017, payment cards are the most widely used electronic payment instrument in the European Union, already totalling more than half (52%) of all non-cash transactions, with credit transfers accounting for 24% and direct debits for 19%. Furthermore, payment cards are also the fastest growing cashless payment instrument, with the number of transactions more than doubling in the last decade. This rapid growth has also been fuelled by the introduction of contactless cards in recent years. Due to its convenience for payment service users, contactless payment can provide an even stronger incentive to use electronic payments at the point of sale and has the potential to replace a substantial number of low-value cash transactions.</p><p>As shown in Chart 1, although large variations can be identified among European countries with respect to the level of card usage, solid annual growth rates can be observed in all of them. In 2017, there were 135 card payments per capita on average in the European Union, ranging from a low of 18 in Bulgaria to a high of 366 in Denmark.</p><p>Growth, albeit marginal, can also be observed for cross-border card payments at the EU level, with the EU average increasing from 6.8% in 2014 to 8.3% in 2017. It is considered to be one of the signs that a SEPA for cards is incomplete when users are not yet fully comfortable using their cards abroad. Increasing cross-border acceptance of national scheme cards could potentially contribute to further growth in cross-border card transactions and the completion of a SEPA for cards.</p><p>Cards play a major role for European citizens and businesses conducting their daily payment transactions. Thus, the Eurosystem continues to strongly support the creation of a SEPA for cards. Despite some positive steps in recent years, the Eurosystem has observed that a SEPA for cards has not been achieved yet and progress towards establishing it has been slower than hoped. In addition, recent developments in the payments market have the potential to substantially affect the cards business.</p><p>In the light of the above, the Eurosystem has in the present report reviewed the progress towards a SEPA for cards and identified barriers hampering its establishment by market players. On this basis, the Eurosystem has re-evaluated its policies and objectives to facilitate the activities of market players and help promote the development of a SEPA for cards. As a SEPA for cards can best be achieved in a co-operative manner, all market players are invited to intensify their efforts.</p><p>This report is structured as follows: Chapter 2 addresses the fundamental topic of the reachability of national card schemes. Chapter 3 reviews the legal and regulatory framework. Chapter 4 provides a description of initiatives recently taken on cards standardisation. Chapter 5 looks at the way current innovations in payments could impact the card business.</p><p>To produce the present report, a market consultation was launched in the third quarter of 2017. To take stock of the progress since 2014, and in view of additional efforts still needed to achieve a SEPA for cards, the Eurosystem reached out to cards market participants from the supply side, namely card payment schemes, issuers, processors and acquirers. Over 40 replies were obtained, both from individual respondents and from industry groups. These provided substantial information crucial for the work on the report, for assessing the current market situation in different domains and for analysing the way forward.</p><p>2 Reachability of European card schemes</p><p>Today, cross-border card payments in Europe are mainly made through two international card payment schemes: Visa and MasterCard. In order to guarantee cross-border acceptance, national card schemes are reliant on co-badging with international card schemes.</p><p>An alternative solution to co-badging lies in cross acceptance of national card schemes, which are still active in ten European countries. Despite their number declining from 22 in 2013 to 17 in 2018, some still have a significant share of their national markets. To achieve cross acceptance the respective card schemes need to agree on a strategy for cross-border acceptance of their brands.</p><p>Market players have been hesitant so far in pursuing this path, mainly because of the initial investments required for a relatively small number of cross-border transactions. These figures are, however, steadily increasing. Up until today, short-term business viability was a major roadblock to the implementation of various initiatives in this area. However, if European cardholders were offered the possibility of using their cards abroad, national schemes would have the chance to expand their business.</p><p>Furthermore, new technical solutions and regulatory and market developments are paving the way for changes in market arrangements by providing coexistence and increasing competition between different payment solutions. The launch of the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) scheme in November 2017 and the introduction of the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2)[3] may give European payment service providers new options to accept and offer new payment solutions in competition to cards.</p><p>2.1 National and cross-border card payments</p><p>The European cards market is characterised by two separate and markedly different markets: the market for national payments and the market for cross-border payments. In national markets both national and international card schemes may compete for transactions through co-badged and single-branded cards. The cross-border payments market, conversely, is dominated by international card schemes, which capitalise on the lack of European-wide acceptance of national card schemes and guarantee cross-border acceptance of their brand.</p><p>Today, international card schemes are present in all Member States with respect to issuance and acceptance. Whilst they were once mostly confined to the relatively small cross-border market, international card schemes have now also gained traction in national markets and are steadily increasing their share of the cards market at EU level. At the end of 2016, the share of transactions made with international card schemes on payment cards issued in the EU was 67.5%. A number of factors contributed to this. First, co-badging and choice of brand provided a user-friendly solution to the demand for a single payment instrument for national and cross-border payments. Second, the early implementation of online and contactless payments by international card schemes provided users with new payment opportunities. Third, with the aim of achieving cross-border acceptance, new banks opted to issue cards with only an international card scheme, even in countries where a national card scheme was available. Finally, the introduction of interchange fee caps in 2015 reduced national card schemes' price advantage on the acquiring side (previously, the interchange fee of national schemes was lower than that of international schemes). As a consequence of these four developments, the profitability of maintaining separate infrastructures was reduced and some national card schemes merged or ceased to exist.</p><p>There are both market efficiency and governance arguments in favour of increasing cross-border reachability of national card schemes. From a market efficiency perspective, reachability would increase national card schemes' volumes and help support competition on the acquiring side; the extent to which volumes could increase would be contingent on whether gaining cross-border reachability would also enhance national card schemes' competitiveness in other national markets. Bringing national card schemes into cross-border acquiring might also increase the number of competitive players in an inherently oligopolistic market. Increasing cross-border reachability could further increase competition in processing and acquiring services, which tend to be fragmented along national lines. Finally, increased competition and market consolidation could help the market along the path of product and process standardisation and support investment in innovation.</p><p>From a governance perspective, European banks and institutions currently have little control over the cross-border payments market, or even the national market if relying on an international card scheme, and cross-border reachability of national schemes would provide an alternative payment route subject to European governance. The Eurosystem has previously promoted the creation of a European card scheme, which would offer its services at pan-European level in competition with international card schemes. The 2014 card report provided an overview of four initiatives, namely Euro Alliance of Payment Schemes (EAPS), PayFair, EUFISERV and Monnet. However, these projects failed, and banks' commercial interests prevailed over a pan-European solution. Visa Europe, the only card scheme that broadly met the definition of a European card scheme, was acquired by Visa Inc. in June 2016.</p><p>The market players that responded to the consultation do not perceive cross-border acceptance for national schemes as a core factor for their continued success. However, they acknowledge that cross-border acceptance could provide an alternative to international card schemes and enhance the European position in the global payment landscape. Furthermore, respondents highlighted two possible ways of achieving direct cross-border reachability: (i) interlinking or co-badging national schemes, and/or (ii) establishing a SEPA card scheme.</p><p>2.2 Interlinking or co-badging of national schemes</p><p>Interlinking national schemes and creating EU-wide acceptance for these schemes, is a topic that emerges cyclically in the European card payments market. Indeed, as mentioned above, there have been some unsuccessful attempts to achieve this.</p><p>Some respondents report that interlinking would preserve competitiveness due to the lower card scheme fees. They also argue that it would help control the (increasing) fees charged by international card schemes and, as such, give European stakeholders more influence over the functioning of the European cards market.</p><p>The main concern of the market is whether the costs associated with interlinking are justified by a business case. Cross acceptance involves arrangements such as technical and operational interlinking of participants in national schemes and implementing legal and financial requirements (see the Annex for further details on interoperability necessary for national schemes' cards to be accepted on a cross-border level). Processors and acquirers generally confirm that technical difficulties can be resolved. As far as the business case is concerned, they claim that demand for cross-border acceptance is still low and the low proportion of cross-border card transactions (cross-border card transactions account for around 8.3% of the total in the European Union) has not yet justified the significant investments. However, if European cardholders were offered the possibility of using their national cards abroad, new business opportunities would open up for national networks and cross-border transactions might increase. A common European logo, indicating pan-European interoperability of national card schemes and the possibility of using cards of respective national schemes at EU level, might be helpful in promoting the use of such cards. This would provide transparency and clarity to European cardholders on the possibility of also using national cards in other Member States and could promote the use of national cards abroad. Furthermore, recent developments in the payments market, namely the introduction of the SCT Inst scheme and the development of the related clearing and settlement infrastructure, may limit the investments needed to interconnect national card schemes. Given the fact that not every European country has a national card scheme, those countries should also be taken into consideration by the initiatives for interlinking national card schemes. In this respect, the payment industries in those countries may consider liaising with existing European national schemes. By doing so, they could lower the national banking communities' operational costs in view of lower card scheme fees and enable card transactions in the whole EU to be made using European payment solutions.</p><p>The market responses indicate that co-badging among national card schemes does not appear to be a workable alternative to interlinking. On the one hand, it would provide limited economies of scale, while acquirers and processors prefer to concentrate their services on a few card brands with high volumes than to accept many brands with a low volume of transactions. On the other hand, co-badging would imply a sizable investment in getting co-badged national cards accepted on national terminals.</p><p>2.3 Establishing a SEPA card scheme</p><p>Another option contemplated by market consultation respondents would be the possibility of creating a SEPA card scheme. This could be a fresh scheme, in partnership with an internationally accepted card scheme, in order to get international acceptance, or an interlinking of national card schemes into a single internationally accepted card scheme.</p><p>If such a SEPA scheme could achieve acceptance in the countries where national card schemes are present, and even at some point expand to cover the whole of Europe, it might prove to be a business case. Entering a two-sided market could, however, be challenging as co-badging with international schemes already guarantees issuers pan-European and global acceptance.</p><p>Regardless of the way in which a SEPA scheme is formed, start-up, organisational and marketing costs would be large and cost recovery uncertain. In the view of market participants, reduced interchange fees, as mandated by the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR), can make cost recovery even more difficult. While competition from international card schemes in national markets might eventually squeeze national card schemes' margins to the point where they consider an international merger (when it is already too late), building a SEPA card scheme is likely to remain a political construct rather than a sound business case in the short term, similar to the fate of past approaches to such a potential scenario. However, in view of the gradual phasing out of several national card schemes, in the long-run the lack of a pan-European card solution may lead to the phasing out of European national card schemes and the loss of European stakeholders' strategic influence over the European cards market.</p><p>2.4 Market initiative on interconnecting national card schemes</p><p>There are a number of market initiatives that aim to promote the interoperability of national card schemes. In addition to the initiatives trying to achieve interoperability through standardisation (described in more detail in Chapter 4), the European Card Payment Association (ECPA) is looking into the possibility of interconnecting card processing in Europe.</p><p>A decade after the Eurosystem first called for the development of the SEPA card processing framework and two years after the IFR provision on technical interoperability came into force, progress in the area of card processing interoperability still appears to be limited. In this regard, the ECPA presented a European card payment interconnection (ECPI) initiative to connect national card schemes using existing card infrastructures for authorisation (using standards ISO 8583 and ISO 20022) and the new SCT Inst infrastructure for clearing and settlement, allowing for synergies by making the operation and maintenance of a separate infrastructure for inter-scheme card transactions superfluous.</p><p>The ECPI initiative concerned the possibility of using SCT Inst infrastructure to clear and settle card-based transactions between issuers and acquirers. Investments in the infrastructure for transaction processing could thus be limited only to achieving an authorisation service at European level by providing gateway services between national schemes' switches based on ISO 20022 message exchange.</p><p>The ECPI project could potentially provide an alternative to international card schemes, allowing European national card schemes to extend their offer beyond national borders and introduce competition in the market for cross-border transactions. The inclusion of all national card schemes in the ECPI initiative can thus provide the same functionalities as a European card scheme, e.g. cross-border reachability, and ensure European independence for all internal market transactions, bringing such transactions fully under EU jurisdiction in terms of data protection, confidentiality and security.</p><p>It is, however, of the utmost importance that clarity is provided on the business model used to execute the payment transaction (card payments, credit transfers or direct debits) in order to ascertain the set of applicable rules for all actors involved and make users aware of which payment service they are using so that they can refer to the relevant rights, obligations and transparency provisions. As a next step, the initiative would need to set up a separate legal entity responsible for managing the scheme's rules (e.g. acceptance rules, payment scheme branding and fee structures), inter-scheme specifications, certification, operational management of disputes and arbitrage and financial settlement arrangements between different members.</p><p>Progress on creating a solution that would enable cross-border payments with cards issued under European schemes has been considerably slower than hoped. Several national card schemes have been replaced by international card schemes and more schemes may face the risk of extinction. Thus, competition in the European cards market (not only cross-border but also national) might be reduced and, in an extreme scenario, end up in a duopoly of international card schemes. The current status of the cards market is already hampering its efficiency and calls for further action. The Eurosystem encourages cards market players to take a more ambitious approach to a SEPA for cards, allowing them to maintain their strategic influence over the European cards market, and supports market initiatives working towards it.</p><p>As a result, the Eurosystem:</p><p>acknowledges that national card payment schemes working towards pan-European reachability could result in increased competition and efficiency in the European cards market; welcomes market initiatives to interlink national card payment schemes, including through processing arrangements, provided that full pan-European reach is achieved, and notes that a common European logo indicating the possibility of using the cards of national card schemes at EU level might be helpful in promoting the use of such cards; notes that the already interoperable European SCT Inst infrastructure for the settlement and/or clearing of card transactions may be a possible way to support interlinking of national card payment schemes, provided that clarity concerning the operating business model used to execute the payment transaction (i.e. the underlying payment instrument) is provided to all parties involved. 3 The current legal and regulatory framework</p><p>Since the publication of the 2014 card report, the legal and regulatory framework has been extensively enhanced to support the establishment of a SEPA for cards. As shown in Chart 5, the European Commission proposed the IFR and PSD2, which were adopted by the Council and the European Parliament. The Commission has also adopted the relevant regulatory technical standards (RTS) developed by the European Banking Authority (EBA), which is also establishing guidelines to support the implementation of the new rules. Market players have implemented a large share of this new legal and regulatory framework already or are currently in the course of doing so.</p><p>In addition, a number of recent legislative initiatives, including delegated legislation, also have an impact on the card payments market. These include:</p><p>the Payment Accounts Directive (PAD); the Second Wire Transfer Regulation (WTR2); the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AML5); the eIDAS Regulation. These legal acts aim to increase safety, efficiency and competition, though it is acknowledged that they may also increase complexity in the legal and regulatory environment for the European cards market. In line with the questionnaire, this section focuses mainly on the perception of the IFR and PSD2 among cards market players from the supply side. In general, any assessment of the framework that has emerged so far would suffer from the fact that it is not yet being fully implemented. This cautionary note is also made by a majority of the consultation respondents.</p><p>Overall, most market participants welcome the overarching objectives of the rules stipulated in the new legal and regulatory framework. They consider the existing framework as adequate and/or sufficient to achieve the SEPA objectives. However, some are of the opinion that, given the status of cards in SEPA, little justification is left to impose further requirements on market players. Consequently, about half of market participants believe that no further legislation is needed. Some even state that the extensive regulation has led to a situation where national schemes are disappearing. Moreover, the rules are regarded as stifling innovation and hampering the ability of national schemes to compete with big tech players and international card schemes.</p><p>According to market players, the main difficulties experienced with the new rules are as follows: (i) the implementation across Member States is inconsistent, (ii) the supervisory approach chosen by the national competent authorities seems to differ to some extent, and (iii) the time gaps and deviations between the implementation deadlines of the primary legislation compared to the associated delegated acts are confusing and create unnecessary uncertainty. Hence, the priority should be consistent implementation as well as gaining experience with the rules while closely studying their impact.</p><p>Most respondents strongly advocate a market-driven approach to more harmonisation and integration based on business reasoning and accounting for the resources required for implementation. If further legislation is considered, market participants advocate that this needs to: (i) be strictly balanced with business requirements, (ii) respect the views of all card market players, and (iii) be implemented in a harmonised fashion across Member States.</p><p>Besides these more general remarks, some specific areas of potential improvements were outlined by providers in the cards market with respect to the IFR and PSD2.</p><p>Based on the market consultation, it remains to be seen whether the objectives of the IFR have been successfully addressed. A number of answers relate to the separation of scheme and processing, which is described as not being fully implemented by international schemes. This is stated as being the case for innovation, such as tokenisation, but also for regular card transactions in a national environment. In addition, some respondents pointed out that issuing banks had changed their pricing models by raising cardholder fees, while merchant prices did not decrease in the course of the IFR. This is partly explained by the fact that the interchange fees are only one component of merchant service charges, the other ones being the fees charged by card schemes to acquirers and the fees stemming from the acquirers themselves (see Chart 6). In particular, some respondents report increasing scheme fees charged by international card schemes largely offsetting the forced decrease in interchange fees. Moreover, smaller and medium-sized merchants may also not be able to negotiate lower merchant service charges proportionate to the interchange fee reduction, as they lack sufficient bargaining power compared to merchants processing more transactions of an overall higher value.</p><p>Overall, perception of the IFR adoption appears rather mixed based on the replies from the market consultation. Hence, the review study planned by the European Commission for 2020[12] is of the utmost importance to provide more insight into market dynamics.</p><p>With respect to the PSD2, the respondents address in particular the RTS on Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and Common and Secure Communication. A number of market consultation respondents view the RTS as hampering e-commerce and not being technologically neutral, as for instance: (i) exemptions from SCA are very complex and not easy to comprehend from a consumer's perspective, (ii) the same low-value transactions are treated differently when initiated with different payment instruments (such as contactless vs. contact card payments), and (iii) merchant liability is diminished, which could lead to higher fraud rates. The European Commission will review the PSD2 by 13 January 2021. Also reviews of its delegated acts are foreseen.</p><p>The Eurosystem acknowledges that the IFR and PSD2 have addressed some of the outstanding issues identified as obstacles to achieving a SEPA for cards. The objectives of the IFR are to enhance competition and increase the efficiency of the European cards market. A harmonised implementation of these rules would pave the way for a more efficient cards market.</p><p>As a result, the Eurosystem:</p><p>underlines the need for consistent and harmonised application of EU legislation as well as alignment of supervisory activities of national competent authorities in Member States in order to allow payment service providers to consider, in their strategy, adapting business processes and developing efficient, convenient and secure card payment solutions, which would allow payment service users to take advantage of the new legal and regulatory framework; welcomes the initiative of cards market players to participate more actively in public consultations on forthcoming regulatory reviews as well as on draft legal acts, thereby ensuring that their interests are taken into account. 4 European stakeholder involvement initiatives for cards</p><p>The involvement of various stakeholders and industry groups in the payments market is of the utmost importance. All achievements, whether attained as a consequence of adopted legislation or market-driven initiatives, demand the involvement and cooperation of different stakeholders. This especially holds true for the cards market, where a large number of different market players with different and sometimes conflicting positions and interests are present. Therefore, these players need to cooperate when establishing standards and environments to help them achieve interoperability and consequently enable acceptance of cards all over Europe, regardless of the issuing country.</p><p>In its 7th SEPA progress report and the 2014 card report, the Eurosystem emphasised the importance of cards standardisation in the development of a SEPA for cards and identified standardisation activities as a prerequisite to ensuring that any card can be used at any terminal in Europe. The 2014 card report pointed out that the slow progress is mainly due to the lack of decision-making on future SEPA standards and the absence of a concrete migration plan. It further stated that a decision on the standards to be used and their implementation is both urgent and sensitive, as it may help to open up the market and foster a level playing field across Europe. In its 2014 card report the Eurosystem also mentioned different cooperation initiatives, some of which have already terminated due to an inability to deliver results, while others are still running and successfully continuing their work to ensure the steps needed towards a harmonised cards market in Europe. In general, the Eurosystem has seen an improvement in cooperation between stakeholders in the area of standardisation compared to 2014, especially within the European Cards Stakeholders Group.</p><p>4.1 The European Cards Stakeholders Group</p><p>The European Cards Stakeholders Group (ECSG), which replaced the Cards Stakeholders Group in 2016 as a multi-stakeholder association dedicated to harmonising card payments in Europe, comprises organisations from multiple industries and sectors, including processors, retailers, vendors, schemes and payment service providers. The European Commission and the European Central Bank have an observer role.</p><p>The main aim of the ECSG is to develop and maintain the SEPA Cards Standardisation Volume (the Volume). The requirements and implementation guidelines in the Volume aim to harmonise data elements, functional aspects of card payment products/services and security requirements. If taken up, which is a voluntary exercise based on self-commitment, the Volume's requirements may provide a basis for interoperability.</p><p>The Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB) acknowledged[16] the ECSG's work on formulating harmonised requirements for cards standardisation as being very important and invited the group to keep the ERPB informed of its progress on a regular basis. Therefore, the ECSG tracks progress indicators in its annual progress report to the ERPB. Additionally, in December 2014, the ERPB invited the ECSG to implement the relevant procedures and start monitoring the conformance of implementation specifications for payment card products and services to the Volume.</p><p>A Volume Conformance Management Committee (VCMC) has been set up within the ECSG to monitor the market adoption of Volume-conformant specifications. A procedure to verify compliance with the standardisation requirements in the Volume has been set out by the ECSG. This consists of a labelling process for the specifications to comply with the requirements. To date Volume standards have been adopted for seven sets of specifications by three organisations and more are likely to follow. The certification process to verify that a solution (e.g. point of interaction (POI) or card) complies with a set of specifications is conducted by certification bodies from outside the ECSG.</p><p>It is important to note that the labelling process is based on a self-assessment by the implementation specification providers. The Eurosystem sees the labelling process as a step towards further harmonisation in the area of standardisation. However, if this was based on the assessment by an independent third party, a more impartial judgement could be achieved. Conformance with the Volume is a voluntary decision by each stakeholder, but would become meaningful if the relevant stakeholders align services and products with the Volume.</p><p>The Eurosystem also notes that the ECSG has taken the initiative to work on subjects that go beyond the strict domain of traditional card payments (e.g. wallets, tokenisation and person-to-person (P2P) card payments). It welcomes initiatives working on harmonised and competitive implementation specifications with the aim of avoiding further fragmentation of the market. In this respect, the active involvement of cards market players in the work of relevant standardisation bodies, regardless of their scale or organisational status, and in decision-making processes is welcomed. Only a balanced representation of all relevant stakeholders in the field of cards standardisation can ensure that the cards industry pursues the objectives for a fully integrated and harmonised retail payments market in the field of card payments.</p><p>As a result, the Eurosystem:</p><p>welcomes initiatives that have been taken within the ECSG to foster and ensure harmonisation, such as the setting up of a Volume Conformance Management Committee (VCMC) to monitor the market development of Volume-conformant specifications; welcomes the performance of a self-assessment by relevant stakeholders to verify the compliance of their specifications with the standardisation requirements set out in the ECSG Volume; is of the opinion that this labelling process could be improved by ensuring that an independent entity conducts a more impartial assessment of whether Volume requirements are being fully met by institutions, which would increase transparency in the market; welcomes the ECSG activities aimed at standardising derivative card services (e.g. P2P card-based payments, digital wallets, tokenisation) while maintaining the level of card payment security; welcomes the activities of smaller card stakeholders in relevant standardisation bodies, e.g. joining forces with other stakeholders to promote common interests and achieve common objectives. 4.2 Initiatives and achievements in the area of standardisation</p><p>Processing of card payments consists of two distinct steps: the authorisation of payments and the handling of the financial flows (clearing and settlement). These processes involve different stakeholders, namely merchants/retailers, acquirers, processors, issuers and card schemes. Common standards for communication between stakeholders facilitate the processing of card payments. The current situation regarding standardisation of communication between stakeholders in the relevant domains is set out below.</p><p>4.2.1 Card-to-terminal domain</p><p>The payment instrument industry is constantly exploring new solutions to attract new customers and to make the act of purchasing easier. Contactless card payments, as well as mobile-based card transactions, are the best known examples. For some years now, cards market players have been seeking solutions to ensure their technological independence, which is essential for them to survive.</p><p>In the card-to-terminal domain, the European Card Payment Cooperation (ECPC), which is composed of the main national schemes in Europe, has been established to develop a generic card and mobile payment application specification, the CPA contactless extension (CPACE), which can be used in different environments (contact and contactless cards, mobile near field communication (NFC), remote transactions). CPACE adds card and mobile extensions for both contactless and remote payments to the EMVCo CPA standard specification and enables national schemes to develop interoperable extensions for contactless transactions with EMV-based cards. It also allows European card issuers and schemes to become independent from proprietary contactless applications currently available. This European contactless payment application goes together with the provision of a European kernel (core software for POS terminals) for payment acceptance.</p><p>At the same time, other private stakeholders' specifications (e.g. PURE) and related products and services offer white label solutions to national schemes or local labels. The suite includes a scheme-agnostic EMV payment application adopted by many actors for various white label payment offers involving contact/contactless mobile/cards devices and wearables. The core specifications address both issuance (cloud-based and secure element) and acceptance (POS kernel) fields.</p><p>4.2.2 Terminal-to-acquirer domain</p><p>The terminal-to-acquirer domain (T2A) applies to the communication between a terminal at the point of sale and a payee's payment service provider (i.e. the acquirer). In this domain, the aim of standardisation is to ensure the possibility for merchants to change an acquirer without any transition costs and as such reduce the business lock-in.</p><p>A major initiative has been undertaken by the Nexo organisation which bases its specification on ISO 20022 CAPE (card payments exchanges) messages. Nexo proposes a series of standards for many practical applications. Standards have already been implemented by an increasing number of retailers to set up international payment processing platforms.</p><p>4.2.3 Acquirer-to-issuer domain</p><p>The acquirer-to-issuer domain (A2I) applies to the communication between a payee's payment service provider (i.e. the acquirer) and a payer's payment service provider (i.e. the issuer). In its 2016 Acquirer to Issuer Processing Study, the ECSG, responding to the invitation of the ERPB to assess the opportunity of migrating to a single standard in the acquirer-to-issuer domain, reports that today most of the protocols used in the market are variants of the ISO 8583 standard (e.g. messages are based on various versions of the ISO 8583 standard).</p><p>Indeed, the processing of transactions (e.g. message standards and processing practices) is often specific to each card scheme, due to their legacy evolution. In addition, acquirers and issuers have developed proprietary solutions for cross-scheme communication, such as bilateral or multilateral architectures, intra-processor processing and gateway services, leading to a plethora of different types of messages.</p><p>Some initiatives aim to harmonise the usage of message standards and eliminate the lack of standardisation in this domain.</p><p>The acquirer-to-issuer cards messages (ATICA) initiative was set up to design a standard that captures business processes currently addressed by ISO 8583, but by using ISO 20022 methodologies. This simplifies the conversion process between message standards. ATICA produced an initial version of the standard in December 2014. While this early version of the standard is still a proof of concept, ATICA is working towards a second version of its standard where schemes have to ensure technical compatibility, but not necessarily functional compatibility, leading to a situation where a set of specific messages could be different among the different schemes. Standardisation remains the result of a business decision to use the same specifications and increase interoperability.</p><p>The Berlin Group, on the other hand, has defined a card clearing model based on using SEPA direct debit infrastructure, known as SEPA Cards Clearing (SCC). In many payment systems in Europe, the clearing of card transactions is carried out analogously to the clearing of credit transfers and direct debits. The Berlin Group has developed an SCC framework that offers a simple message extension to the SEPA direct debit definition to include the additional card originated data in ISO 20022 payment messages. The framework has been adopted in Germany, where banks decided to migrate from domestic legacy clearing systems for Girocard transactions to the SCC services by February 2016.</p><p>In the absence of a common message set for all card transactions, and given the difficulty of providing one that suits all industry players, the ECSG is developing a message translation guide between different standards, such as different versions of ISO 8583 and ISO 20022. While this initiative will not solve the issues of interoperability, it could help overcome divergence in standards and improve harmonisation.</p><p>A majority of the market consultation respondents were of the opinion that standards like ISO 20022 are beneficial for interoperability, but most parties indicated that these standards should be implemented in a market-driven manner only and will probably only be used for new projects. Respondents claimed that this is particularly true for large incumbents who are looking at the cost of migration and do not see clear business benefits, such as new functionalities. Indeed, according to the ECSG study, even in the case of a global mandate for all card schemes to migrate to a common standard, the payback period is estimated at a decade in the best case scenario. As indicated previously for ISO 20022 ATICA messages, the adoption of the standard by most of the actors helps, but does not guarantee, business interoperability between systems.</p><p>An alternative solution to address issues of standardisation in the acquirer-to-issuer domain might be the use of interoperable SCT Inst clearing and settlement infrastructure. This may strengthen the foundation of the European payments market by fostering efficiency and European independence in the field of payments. It represents an opportunity to achieve the unification of the A2I domain based on European players and solutions. As mentioned in Chapter 2, this is the solution that has been proposed by the ECPI initiative to connect national card schemes. For such a solution to be viable, the pan-European reach of SCT Inst clearing and settlement infrastructure is required.</p><p>In the area of card payments processing, an emerging trend towards integration of a growing number of market players can be observed. In particular, merchants, technical service providers and financial technology entities (fintechs), aiming to become more competitive, are extending the scope of their activities by providing additional services (e.g. merchants are implementing payment platforms and offering payment solutions). This movement has resulted in a concentration of larger European players, while smaller national players are being challenged by competition from larger ones. In addition, international players are benefiting from the ongoing standardisation in Europe, enabling them to enter a previously fragmented market and compete with incumbents.</p><p>4.2.4 Terminal security domain</p><p>As the entry point to the financial system, payment cards and card payment terminals have always needed attention from a security perspective. Whereas payment cards were already subject to harmonised and adequate security standards, terminals did not have a common set of requirements or a harmonised process for their evaluation and certification. The ECSG has worked to further standardise this domain.</p><p>The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), originally formed by the main international card schemes, is mainly responsible for managing the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and sub-standards, against which businesses may measure their own payment card security policies, procedures and guidelines. In the field of terminal security, the PCI PIN Transaction Security/Point of Interaction requirements (PCI PTS POI) are intended to reduce the likelihood of, and limit the consequences of, fraud involving POI devices. Over recent years, terminal manufacturers have gradually been led towards adopting standards to comply with security requirements set by the PCI SSC.</p><p>Common Criteria (CC) is an internationally recognised set of standards (ISO 15408) whose objective is to impartially assess the security of computer systems and software. This framework has been born out of a partnership between Canada, the United States and Europe. A certificate issued by the common certification body responsible for certifying that an evaluated product meets the Common Criteria ensures that the evaluated product fulfils particular security criteria. Some features of the Common Criteria standard prevented it from being adopted for payment terminals by the majority of card industry stakeholders; the evaluation process appeared to be costly and cumbersome, in opposition to a time-to-market principle.</p><p>The Volume now provides a harmonised set of requirements for terminal security and ensures a single process for the evaluation and certification of new types of payment terminals. The Common Criteria standard has been adopted in the United Kingdom and Germany, whereas other countries have opted for the PCI standard. However, for the PCI standard, the security requirements against which a new product or a new technical solution are evaluated in order to obtain approval, should be more inclusive and take more account of the expertise of all PCI SCC members, especially in the field of security.</p><p>The Eurosystem acknowledges that work in the area of standardisation is complex, mainly due to the existence of many and sometimes conflicting interests, and that it is a time-consuming process. Progress towards harmonised standards has been observed, and deploying common standards that are able to provide interoperable solutions for the European cards market will be a key factor in achieving a SEPA for cards. To ensure the interoperability of European solutions and that the European payment industry has adequate influence over SEPA card standards, non-proprietary standards are seen as the basis for current and future activities in the area of cards standardisation. However, recent developments, like implementation of the SCT Inst scheme, also deserve special attention, as they may be seen as an opportunity to address standardisation issues using the SCT Inst infrastructure to clear and settle card-based payments.</p><p>As a result, the Eurosystem:</p><p>welcomes the implementation of specifications which have been developed through industry-driven standardisation initiatives based on open standards such as ISO 20022 and which are able to provide interoperable solutions in the European cards market; supports the work on the potential use of European SCT Inst infrastructure to clear and settle card-based payments in the acquirer-to-issuer domain to foster efficiency and interoperability in the European cards market; notes that it is important for stakeholders to remain vigilant as regards terminal security and to continue to work towards common terminal security, evaluation and certification requirements that are in the interest of European stakeholders. 4.3 Latest technologies as a potential factor for further market fragmentation</p><p>Until a few years ago, national card schemes benefited from the technological contributions of international card schemes under different types of agreement, such as grandfathering (contracts under which the parties agree to share services, such as the provision of technical expertise in return for access to a national network).</p><p>More recently, relationships have become more competitive and pressures on national schemes have increased with the development of mobile payment solutions and their different sorts of wallets by international card schemes and other providers, which are then adopted by European issuers. This started with EMV specifications, whose implementation varies significantly according to the scheme's special features. Indeed, these schemes had different technical approaches from the beginning to overcome production issues, resulting in the development of different kernels that can hardly reach the full range of hardware platforms (processors, operating systems, etc.), thus hindering interoperability.</p><p>Although the development of strong customer authentication solutions based on the 3D Secure protocol has provided an example of technology transfer from international card schemes to different stakeholders, the market could become very competitive in terms of the diversity of the platforms that will implement the second version of the protocol.</p><p>More recently, proprietary payment solutions like Original Credit Transaction (OCT), based on the push payment capabilities (credit accounting messages from an issuing bank to an acquiring bank through card infrastructures) relying on existing card payment systems, allow senders to make near real-time payments to beneficiaries for person-to-person (P2P) or business-to-person (B2P) usages. These solutions allow cross-border and cross-payment-instrument transactions (cards, bank accounts, mobile wallet, cash payout) for intra- and, theoretically, inter-scheme transactions or for payments initiated via social networks. Each scheme is developing its own solution with different market players (banks, merchants, social networks, etc.) without considering interoperability issues. Consideration should be given to whether this type of transaction is to be seen as a credit transfer in a legal sense, even if it is made under the rules of a card payment scheme. As previously mentioned, it is of the utmost importance for the business model adopted to be clear to all players involved, including end-users.</p><p>Regarding contactless payments, in its latest report the ECSG records the growing use of contactless card payments and raises concerns regarding the multiplicity of kernels. In order to reduce the complexity of contactless acceptance, the ECSG analysed the possibility of converging either to one single existing kernel (out of over seven kernels available on the market) or to the EMV 2nd Gen, which is likely to require large investments and an implementation period of several years. Regarding migration to one of the existing single kernels as an interim solution, the disadvantages would largely outweigh any benefits. Therefore, the ECSG recommended pushing the industry to proceed with a joint plan for the EMV 2nd Gen in the long term.</p><p>On the contactless issuing specification side, the two initiatives, namely CPACE and PURE, are making specifications available to the market (in one case subject to a licensing agreement), showing that open initiatives are possible. According to the ECSG, after agreement between the card/mobile application owner and the kernel owner, any existing EMVCo kernel can now be configured to ensure the acceptance of the card/mobile application.</p><p>Tokenisation is another example of technology that may allow players to indirectly impose their proprietary solution. This is a new technology that raises the security of card-based payments by replacing the primary account number (PAN) with a value which can only be used in a controlled way (the token). This enables the safe storage of payment card details in mobile wallets, wearables, merchant checkout systems and Internet of Things payment solutions. A tokenised PAN cannot be used outside its original context, such as a specific mobile wallet or specific merchant. However, in order to enable financial transactions to be processed in the interbank domain, the tokenised card details have to be translated back to the PAN. At the moment, this service is mainly offered by international card schemes, while it should be provided by several scheme-independent token service providers in order to maintain competitiveness. However, further analysis is needed to better understand tokenisation practices in the cards market.</p><p>The payments market is becoming more competitive and innovative, with players wishing to develop efficient and appealing solutions to attract users and reduce costs. In this context, it can be expected that initiatives for technology sharing will come up against the economic interests of the various players. It seems that, although market players show a willingness to collaborate, competition is increasing, especially for the latest innovations. The Eurosystem acknowledges that innovation which improves the efficiency of the cards market and leads to convenient and secure solutions is, after integration, the second major driver of change, provided that common and open standards are used by payment service providers when setting up new solutions. This will enable interoperability with other solutions and ensure pan-European reachability, while the use of the core SEPA schemes will allow the achievement of European independence.</p><p>As a result, the Eurosystem:</p><p>welcomes the activities of payment service providers aimed at delivering innovations to increase the efficiency, convenience and security of card payments for payment service users; notes that it is important that all card schemes support tokenisation, including by third party processors; notes that, to avoid further fragmentation in the cards market, innovations need to be based on common standards and preferably also on European (instant) credit transfer schemes; welcomes the further activities of European stakeholders aimed at providing innovative payment solutions in a harmonised way (e.g. in terms of standards and security) to achieve European independence. 5 Direction of innovations</p><p>5.1 Agents of innovation</p><p>Considering the rapid development of the payments landscape and other financial innovations in recent years, innovation seems to be key to maintaining or improving the competitiveness of cards within the broader payments market. In recent years, innovation relating to cards has been mainly headed by card schemes. However, this trend seems to be about to shift in the coming years, as new players have emerged in the payments market, spurred by financial innovation and the new regulatory environment driven by the PSD2. In the near future, innovation will contribute to broader acceptance of cards involving issuers and acquirers, but innovation might also spur alternatives to the existing card schemes.</p><p>All participants in the payment chain, both new and traditional players, may incorporate innovation through new services and products, and foster it within the EU payments market. Using rapid progress in technology, market players ultimately drive payment innovations, which need to meet customer expectations in order to be adopted. For example, the ubiquity of the smartphone and other mobile devices created strong demand for payment systems that could integrate with these. The majority of use cases so far have involved the application of new technologies to traditional products or services, as opposed to using those technologies to create entirely new products.</p><p>However, when dealing with innovations, the security implications must always be taken into account. Even though some initiatives may enable additional acceptance for card payments, a downgrade in the level of security must be avoided. Innovation must not hamper current security and guarantees of current payments.</p><p>5.2 Main drivers of innovation in the European cards market</p><p>In the market consultation, five key factors were identified as either fostering or hampering innovation in the European cards market.</p><p>Business priorities: As previously stated, different stakeholders located along the card payments value chain will certainly participate in the innovation process that is currently affecting the whole financial sector and, more specifically, the payments market. Their ability to innovate might be affected by their physical location, the category they belong to (e.g. payment service providers, technological companies, merchants, etc.) and their size, due to the substantial resources needed to make investments. Security and fraud risk management: Most new features that have been launched in recent years seek to add security and fraud risk management measures. Successful cases of innovation relating to security and fraud issues include EMV chip cards, which provide strong two-factor authentication and counterfeit protection, and 3D Secure, which increases transaction security for e-commerce. One of the elements of strong customer authentication under PSD2 is the verification of a customer using biometric features (e.g. fingerprints, iris and facial recognition). Efficiency and customer convenience: Customer convenience and the need to improve customer experience at the point of interaction becomes a driver for any market player, as providing a better service (customer experience) could reduce payment friction, generate greater customer loyalty and attract new customers. Increasing competition from non-card payment instruments (e.g. instant payments): Financial innovation has developed technical solutions which enable new payment methods, such as those started from a smartphone through a digital wallet or based on an instant payment. Such competition is also being assisted by legislation (i.e. the PSD2), which is opening up the market by including under the regulatory framework new actors, such as payment initiation service providers (PISP) and account information service providers (AISP). Both new payment methods and new entrants impact the card payments market directly, as they could potentially take market share from traditional cards. Moreover, new market infrastructures for processing SCT Inst, such as the launch of the TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS) service, might also affect this scenario. Mobile wallets using cards as the underlying instrument: The use of smartphones to perform payment transactions using card-based mobile wallets as the underlying instrument is spreading rapidly. However, the overall usage is still low, as it is limited by the necessary technological deployment of devices capable of accepting this type of proximity payment. There is the potential that the market will progressively move from plastic to mobile-based solutions in the coming years, which could allow cards to maintain a significant role in the payments market or even boost card-based payments using new form factors. 5.3 Implications of innovation trends for card payments</p><p>There are at least two general considerations that should be made when trying to analyse the future implications of current innovation trends for card payments. The first is the risk in terms of further fragmentation arising from technological developments and the second is the opportunities emerging from such innovation.</p><p>Considering that innovation is driven by various stakeholders involved in the payments ecosystem through individual or joint initiatives, when it comes to a SEPA for cards, innovation could become a challenge for interoperability. There are plenty of innovations which are usually deployed first at the local or regional level, potentially causing a high degree of fragmentation in each market and at European level before, eventually, consolidated solutions emerge. Making such fragmented innovations interoperable adds complexity, which must be taken into account in order to achieve a harmonised European market. Some respondents to the market consultation also pointed out that solutions developed by global players could discourage local and European initiatives.</p><p>Fragmentation could also arise from technological developments that are not homogenously spread throughout SEPA. It has already been noted in Chapter 4 that efforts are being made to increase standardisation in the market. These collaborative efforts are constantly challenged by innovative solutions and by competition itself. This issue was already addressed in the 2014 card report and is an important objective of the ECSG. Promotion of the smooth operation of payment systems is one of the Treaty tasks of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) to be carried out via the Eurosystem. In carrying out this task, the Eurosystem aims to ensure pan-European reach or, at least, interoperability of card payment solutions. Although this might not be an initial priority for start-ups that develop in national environments, any new solutions should be designed with the potential for pan-European reach in mind.</p><p>Despite the aforementioned fragmentation risks, innovation is often considered to be one of the most competitive factors in open markets. Innovations which share a common interest, like security features providing confidence in the payments market, have in the past been driven by cooperative projects involving payment market players (such as EMV) and have been a major driver of card payments growth and ubiquity. Other payment solutions, such as instant payments at the point of sale, may also increase competition, encouraging the payments market to become more efficient and interoperable. However, current card payments in the EU are clearly dominated by international schemes that also lead innovation in this sector. Although this might mean improvements in payment efficiency and security, it must be closely monitored by policymakers to prevent a lock-out effect for smaller players or newcomers, which might be forced into co-badging to access the market, and to ensure that the interests of European market players are adequately reflected.</p><p>Proportionate regulation is key when it comes to fostering competition between traditional and new actors, so as to guarantee a level playing field. Competition in an environment based on novelty and technology depends heavily on capital. It can be difficult for small players starting in national markets to achieve a critical size in order to survive.</p><p>Innovations have been transforming the cards market and payments market in general. The Eurosystem welcomes innovative solutions that enable efficient, convenient and secure card payments. The Eurosystem stresses the importance for innovative payment products and services not to reintroduce fragmentation into the European cards market. While it is comprehensible for innovative solutions to appear and focus on regional markets initially, the Eurosystem emphasises the need for solutions to have the potential to extend their acceptance to the pan-European level or to become interoperable with other solutions, using commonly accepted, international standards. The emergence of fragmented national solutions needs to be avoided.</p><p>As a result, the Eurosystem:</p><p>invites cards market participants, such as payment service providers and card schemes, to develop new products and strategies based on common and open standards with a pan-European perspective, focusing on an interoperable-by-design attitude that should benefit from faster access to economies of scale, and would welcome all relevant stakeholders becoming familiar with and actively involved in the work of standardisation bodies when developing new solutions; welcomes the development of innovative solutions that offer EU-wide capabilities/acceptance or interoperate with existing local initiatives, even if they are not specifically card-related solutions; stresses the importance that innovations in card payments should not lead to fragmentation in the cards market or the broader payments market. 6 Conclusion</p><p>Payment cards are perceived as an efficient and convenient way of making retail payments. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that they are the most widely used and the fastest-growing electronic payment instrument in Europe. However, the differences between cards usage in the various European countries is strikingly high and the percentage of cross-border card payment transactions is still relatively low in volume terms. This observation indicates that there is still vast potential for cards usage growth, both within many individual countries and across European borders. The cross-border acceptance of cards issued under national card payment schemes could contribute to achieving the SEPA for cards any card at any terminal objective, and foster a further take-off of card payments in Europe. So far, despite significant efforts by the industry in recent years, this aim has not been achieved and cross-border acceptance relies on co-badging with international card payment schemes.</p><p>Technological innovations, combined with new legislation that spurs competition among stakeholders, have influenced and will continue to influence the landscape of card payments in Europe. These developments have large-scale effects in the fields of (i) security, with the appearance of not yet mature solutions on the market that may impose a security risk for users; (ii) sovereignty, with the increasing adoption of payment solutions from non-European market players; and (iii) market integration, with the risk of fragmentation of the European market due to the emergence of proprietary local solutions that do not allow pan-European reach. European innovations improve the efficiency of the market and lead to new, more versatile and secure services for users. Therefore, the use of European SCT Inst infrastructure for the clearing and settlement of card payments could be, amongst other possibilities, a solution to ensure the pan-European reach of national schemes at a potentially low cost and to increase efficiency in the European cards market. At the very least, using interoperable or common clearing and settlement SCT Inst infrastructure for card payments and interlinking national card schemes and processing entities has the potential to increase efficiency and competition.</p><p>New entrants and new payment services may considerably affect the traditional card payments business model. In particular, new payment services and instant payment solutions, combined with innovative channels such as mobile phones and wearables, might diminish cards' share of the payments market. In this increasingly competitive market, only payment solutions providing efficient services at competitive prices for customers and merchants will manage to attract new users.</p><p>Therefore, cooperation between incumbents and new market entrants is key to developing the missing elements of a SEPA for cards and for preventing fragmentation of the European single market. Innovative and standardised industry-driven solutions based on open standards could enable pan-European reach of (card) payment products and services and ensure European technological independence.</p><p>Over recent years, the Eurosystem has monitored developments in different areas of the cards market and facilitated the activities of relevant stakeholders, while promoting and extending cooperation where possible. In order to address the issues identified and help the market to achieve a harmonised, competitive and innovative European card payments area, as envisaged in a SEPA for cards, the Eurosystem will continue to pursue its activities to facilitate dialogue among market players and will continue to provide support for their activities in line with the aforementioned objectives. Nonetheless, SEPA for cards is market-driven, so only the ambition and determination of relevant market players will bring about a harmonised, competitive and innovative European cards market in which they will be able to maintain their strategic influence.</p><p>(European Central Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VX6-K5N1-JB5P-J37D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"12494\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Initiative &amp; Referendum</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0Y2REExMDg3NTBBNDJDNDk0MzcwNDc1RTNEMUIyQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0M3QUYzNjlBN0UzNEVBMDk4OEIyMzdBMDlGQzA2RjI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009EVJ</classCode><className>EURO ZONE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D17D</classCode><className>NEWS BRIEFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009HMV</classCode><className>STANDARDS &amp; MEASUREMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp; MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009EVJ</classCode><className>EURO ZONE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001912</classCode><className>RETAIL &amp; WHOLESALE TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST00099QF</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) is now a reality for over 500 million citizens using uniform credit transfers and direct debits. In contrast, card payments still lack the same degree of market integration and harmonisation of business practices and rules, as well as technical standards. Although cards have been the fastest growing means of payment in Europe for some time, some users (cardholders and merchants) have not benefited as much as they could have if a SEPA for cards had been achieved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The card industry has made significant efforts to achieve the objectives outlined in the 2014 report Card payments in Europe - a renewed focus on SEPA for cards, which presented the Eurosystem's views, policies and objectives. Since the publication of this report, new legislation and substantial technological progress have reshaped the environment for card payments. However, so far this has not led to a harmonised, competitive and innovative European cards payment area. Overall, a SEPA for cards has not yet been achieved.</p><p>The Eurosystem therefore decided to analyse the current state of card payments in Europe and review its policies. This report includes the views of cards market participants from the supply side, obtained during a market consultation conducted in late 2017. It enumerates measures by cards market participants that are conducive to a SEPA for cards. In a SEPA for cards, a number of impediments would be abolished, including: (i) a lack of interoperability between cards and terminals, (ii) limitations on merchants accepting certain cards, and (iii) cardholders being confused by different payment experiences across Europe.</p><p>To achieve the above objectives, coordination among cards market players is of the utmost importance, in particular in the area of cards standardisation. However, multiple players actively promote their own services based on proprietary standards, thereby hindering progress in this area. Players from the supply side of the cards market believe the migration towards harmonised standard needs to be market-driven and justified by business case considerations. The Eurosystem takes note of this reasoning and acknowledges that most existing national card schemes actually operate on a relatively low cost basis, which has benefited users in the past. However, to some extent, this has constrained investment in the modernisation of their services and prevented efforts towards achieving a pan-European approach. Taking this into account, the SEPA for cards objectives could be better served by supply-side stakeholders investing in current, or possibly new, processing infrastructure. In addition, such developments could facilitate technical interoperability, provided they are based on common standards and incorporate state-of-the-art technology and innovations.</p><p>The Eurosystem acknowledges that, in general, European cardholders are able to pay with one card all over Europe. However, at present the pan-European acceptance of cards issued under a national card scheme is entirely reliant on co-badging with an international card scheme. Increasingly, payment service providers only issue cards from international card schemes. Such an arrangement calls into question market efficiency in terms of costs, competition and governance, as European payment service providers have little or no influence on the market's development. In the past, all attempts to establish a common European card payment scheme have failed, as national card schemes and banks did not see a viable business case in the short term.</p><p>The implementation of a European instant payments scheme and the development of common or interoperable instant payments infrastructure to process such payments may create new momentum to interconnect existing national card schemes. The use of this newly installed instant payments infrastructure could be a way to support the interlinking and interoperability of national card schemes and, if full pan-European coverage is ensured, would provide a possible alternative to establishing a European card scheme. To promote the use of such cards, it would be helpful to have a common European logo indicating the possibility of using the cards of national card schemes at EU level.</p><p>Furthermore, innovative technologies will bring more competition to the cards market and boost the range of choices for consumers. They are also expected to affect the evolution of card-based products, including changes in merchants' payment acceptance technologies. However, innovations may be capital intensive and thus smaller market participants might experience difficulties in keeping up with technological progress. There is therefore a risk of innovations not being introduced in some markets in Europe, while others may already benefit from them. The Eurosystem welcomes innovative solutions that enable efficient, convenient and secure card payments. In principle, these should be designed (i) to enable pan-European reach, even if at first they target national environments, and (ii) to not perpetuate fragmentation of the cards market. Thus, deeper cooperation and dialogue among relevant market players, in particular incumbents and newcomers, is highly supported.</p><p>Finally, it should be borne in mind that the European cards industry has already implemented or is currently implementing two important pieces of EU legislation aimed at supporting a harmonised, competitive and innovative cards market. These are the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR) and the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). The Eurosystem welcomes both legal acts, as they provide the legal foundation for an integrated cards market aimed at increasing efficiency, competitiveness and safety. While market players from the supply side generally welcome the objectives of the acts and the rules stipulated therein, they also call for the rules to be implemented in a harmonised fashion by Member States and caution against further regulation of the market. In their view, any amendments to the current legislation should take into account the results of a thorough and comprehensive impact assessment of the entire applicable legal and regulatory framework as well as market concerns and business requirements. To ensure that the interests of the card industry are represented, the Eurosystem encourages all relevant stakeholders to actively take part in public consultations on reviews of existing regulation and drafts of potential new legal acts.</p><p>For almost two decades various market players have striven for payments harmonisation in Europe. This goal was achieved for credit transfers and direct debits, while harmonisation for card payments is still lagging behind. Although numerous important objectives for card payments have been achieved, a SEPA for cards has not yet been achieved. Therefore, further action by various players to address outstanding issues hampering a SEPA for cards is much needed. The implementation of instant payments may help to achieve this goal sooner, as it can be instrumental in interconnecting national card schemes, thereby creating pan-European reach and a stronger basis for innovation. Thus interconnectivity and interoperability of existing national card schemes, based on common and open standards and taking advantage of standards and solutions used in SEPA, would facilitate card payments at EU level. The Eurosystem is committed to supporting the activities still needed to achieve a SEPA for cards as soon as possible and to facilitating dialogue amongst market players.</p><p>1 Introduction</p><p>Over the last few years, an evolution towards a more integrated retail payments market has taken place in Europe. In the context of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), the European Payments Council (EPC) has developed schemes setting rules and standards that allow harmonised credit transfers and direct debits at pan-European level. By means of the SEPA End-Date Regulation, payment service users have been able to make such payments under the same conditions everywhere in SEPA since August 2014.</p><p>Despite being seen as a third pillar of the SEPA project, a SEPA for cards, aimed at creating a harmonised, competitive and innovative card payment area, has not been fully achieved. Under the auspices of the EPC, and now the European Cards Stakeholders Group (ECSG), cards market players have made substantial efforts to set common rules and standards. As migration to these is voluntary, harmonisation in the field of cards is continuing to lag behind credit transfers and direct debits. Consequently, national cards markets have to some extent remained fragmented, not allowing European cardholders to use their national cards elsewhere in Europe. The European-wide acceptance of cards issued under national card schemes is only possible due to prevalent co-badging with international card payment schemes. </p><p>Although technically feasible, a number of efforts and initiatives undertaken in the last few years to establish a European card scheme or to achieve European-wide cross-border coverage of national card schemes have so far not been successful. The absence of a European card scheme, combined with the well-established presence of international card schemes, has accelerated the extensive practice of co-badging. In addition, the number of national card schemes has also been diminishing.</p><p>Card usage, however, is growing significantly in Europe. With nearly 70 billion payments in 2017, payment cards are the most widely used electronic payment instrument in the European Union, already totalling more than half (52%) of all non-cash transactions, with credit transfers accounting for 24% and direct debits for 19%. Furthermore, payment cards are also the fastest growing cashless payment instrument, with the number of transactions more than doubling in the last decade. This rapid growth has also been fuelled by the introduction of contactless cards in recent years. Due to its convenience for payment service users, contactless payment can provide an even stronger incentive to use electronic payments at the point of sale and has the potential to replace a substantial number of low-value cash transactions.</p><p>As shown in Chart 1, although large variations can be identified among European countries with respect to the level of card usage, solid annual growth rates can be observed in all of them. In 2017, there were 135 card payments per capita on average in the European Union, ranging from a low of 18 in Bulgaria to a high of 366 in Denmark.</p><p>Growth, albeit marginal, can also be observed for cross-border card payments at the EU level, with the EU average increasing from 6.8% in 2014 to 8.3% in 2017. It is considered to be one of the signs that a SEPA for cards is incomplete when users are not yet fully comfortable using their cards abroad. Increasing cross-border acceptance of national scheme cards could potentially contribute to further growth in cross-border card transactions and the completion of a SEPA for cards.</p><p>Cards play a major role for European citizens and businesses conducting their daily payment transactions. Thus, the Eurosystem continues to strongly support the creation of a SEPA for cards. Despite some positive steps in recent years, the Eurosystem has observed that a SEPA for cards has not been achieved yet and progress towards establishing it has been slower than hoped. In addition, recent developments in the payments market have the potential to substantially affect the cards business.</p><p>In the light of the above, the Eurosystem has in the present report reviewed the progress towards a SEPA for cards and identified barriers hampering its establishment by market players. On this basis, the Eurosystem has re-evaluated its policies and objectives to facilitate the activities of market players and help promote the development of a SEPA for cards. As a SEPA for cards can best be achieved in a co-operative manner, all market players are invited to intensify their efforts. </p><p>This report is structured as follows: Chapter 2 addresses the fundamental topic of the reachability of national card schemes. Chapter 3 reviews the legal and regulatory framework. Chapter 4 provides a description of initiatives recently taken on cards standardisation. Chapter 5 looks at the way current innovations in payments could impact the card business.</p><p>To produce the present report, a market consultation was launched in the third quarter of 2017. To take stock of the progress since 2014, and in view of additional efforts still needed to achieve a SEPA for cards, the Eurosystem reached out to cards market participants from the supply side, namely card payment schemes, issuers, processors and acquirers. Over 40 replies were obtained, both from individual respondents and from industry groups. These provided substantial information crucial for the work on the report, for assessing the current market situation in different domains and for analysing the way forward.</p><p>2 Reachability of European card schemes</p><p>Today, cross-border card payments in Europe are mainly made through two international card payment schemes: Visa and MasterCard. In order to guarantee cross-border acceptance, national card schemes are reliant on co-badging with international card schemes.</p><p>An alternative solution to co-badging lies in cross acceptance of national card schemes, which are still active in ten European countries. Despite their number declining from 22 in 2013 to 17 in 2018, some still have a significant share of their national markets. To achieve cross acceptance the respective card schemes need to agree on a strategy for cross-border acceptance of their brands.</p><p>Market players have been hesitant so far in pursuing this path, mainly because of the initial investments required for a relatively small number of cross-border transactions. These figures are, however, steadily increasing. Up until today, short-term business viability was a major roadblock to the implementation of various initiatives in this area. However, if European cardholders were offered the possibility of using their cards abroad, national schemes would have the chance to expand their business.</p><p>Furthermore, new technical solutions and regulatory and market developments are paving the way for changes in market arrangements by providing coexistence and increasing competition between different payment solutions. The launch of the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) scheme in November 2017 and the introduction of the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2)[3] may give European payment service providers new options to accept and offer new payment solutions in competition to cards.</p><p>2.1 National and cross-border card payments</p><p>The European cards market is characterised by two separate and markedly different markets: the market for national payments and the market for cross-border payments. In national markets both national and international card schemes may compete for transactions through co-badged and single-branded cards. The cross-border payments market, conversely, is dominated by international card schemes, which capitalise on the lack of European-wide acceptance of national card schemes and guarantee cross-border acceptance of their brand.</p><p>Today, international card schemes are present in all Member States with respect to issuance and acceptance. Whilst they were once mostly confined to the relatively small cross-border market, international card schemes have now also gained traction in national markets and are steadily increasing their share of the cards market at EU level. At the end of 2016, the share of transactions made with international card schemes on payment cards issued in the EU was 67.5%. A number of factors contributed to this. First, co-badging and choice of brand provided a user-friendly solution to the demand for a single payment instrument for national and cross-border payments. Second, the early implementation of online and contactless payments by international card schemes provided users with new payment opportunities. Third, with the aim of achieving cross-border acceptance, new banks opted to issue cards with only an international card scheme, even in countries where a national card scheme was available. Finally, the introduction of interchange fee caps in 2015 reduced national card schemes' price advantage on the acquiring side (previously, the interchange fee of national schemes was lower than that of international schemes). As a consequence of these four developments, the profitability of maintaining separate infrastructures was reduced and some national card schemes merged or ceased to exist.</p><p>There are both market efficiency and governance arguments in favour of increasing cross-border reachability of national card schemes. From a market efficiency perspective, reachability would increase national card schemes' volumes and help support competition on the acquiring side; the extent to which volumes could increase would be contingent on whether gaining cross-border reachability would also enhance national card schemes' competitiveness in other national markets. Bringing national card schemes into cross-border acquiring might also increase the number of competitive players in an inherently oligopolistic market. Increasing cross-border reachability could further increase competition in processing and acquiring services, which tend to be fragmented along national lines. Finally, increased competition and market consolidation could help the market along the path of product and process standardisation and support investment in innovation.</p><p>From a governance perspective, European banks and institutions currently have little control over the cross-border payments market, or even the national market if relying on an international card scheme, and cross-border reachability of national schemes would provide an alternative payment route subject to European governance. The Eurosystem has previously promoted the creation of a European card scheme, which would offer its services at pan-European level in competition with international card schemes. The 2014 card report provided an overview of four initiatives, namely Euro Alliance of Payment Schemes (EAPS), PayFair, EUFISERV and Monnet. However, these projects failed, and banks' commercial interests prevailed over a pan-European solution. Visa Europe, the only card scheme that broadly met the definition of a European card scheme, was acquired by Visa Inc. in June 2016.</p><p>The market players that responded to the consultation do not perceive cross-border acceptance for national schemes as a core factor for their continued success. However, they acknowledge that cross-border acceptance could provide an alternative to international card schemes and enhance the European position in the global payment landscape. Furthermore, respondents highlighted two possible ways of achieving direct cross-border reachability: (i) interlinking or co-badging national schemes, and/or (ii) establishing a SEPA card scheme.</p><p>2.2 Interlinking or co-badging of national schemes</p><p>Interlinking national schemes and creating EU-wide acceptance for these schemes, is a topic that emerges cyclically in the European card payments market. Indeed, as mentioned above, there have been some unsuccessful attempts to achieve this.</p><p>Some respondents report that interlinking would preserve competitiveness due to the lower card scheme fees. They also argue that it would help control the (increasing) fees charged by international card schemes and, as such, give European stakeholders more influence over the functioning of the European cards market. </p><p>The main concern of the market is whether the costs associated with interlinking are justified by a business case. Cross acceptance involves arrangements such as technical and operational interlinking of participants in national schemes and implementing legal and financial requirements (see the Annex for further details on interoperability necessary for national schemes' cards to be accepted on a cross-border level). Processors and acquirers generally confirm that technical difficulties can be resolved. As far as the business case is concerned, they claim that demand for cross-border acceptance is still low and the low proportion of cross-border card transactions (cross-border card transactions account for around 8.3% of the total in the European Union) has not yet justified the significant investments. However, if European cardholders were offered the possibility of using their national cards abroad, new business opportunities would open up for national networks and cross-border transactions might increase. A common European logo, indicating pan-European interoperability of national card schemes and the possibility of using cards of respective national schemes at EU level, might be helpful in promoting the use of such cards. This would provide transparency and clarity to European cardholders on the possibility of also using national cards in other Member States and could promote the use of national cards abroad. Furthermore, recent developments in the payments market, namely the introduction of the SCT Inst scheme and the development of the related clearing and settlement infrastructure, may limit the investments needed to interconnect national card schemes. Given the fact that not every European country has a national card scheme, those countries should also be taken into consideration by the initiatives for interlinking national card schemes. In this respect, the payment industries in those countries may consider liaising with existing European national schemes. By doing so, they could lower the national banking communities' operational costs in view of lower card scheme fees and enable card transactions in the whole EU to be made using European payment solutions.</p><p>The market responses indicate that co-badging among national card schemes does not appear to be a workable alternative to interlinking. On the one hand, it would provide limited economies of scale, while acquirers and processors prefer to concentrate their services on a few card brands with high volumes than to accept many brands with a low volume of transactions. On the other hand, co-badging would imply a sizable investment in getting co-badged national cards accepted on national terminals.</p><p>2.3 Establishing a SEPA card scheme</p><p>Another option contemplated by market consultation respondents would be the possibility of creating a SEPA card scheme. This could be a fresh scheme, in partnership with an internationally accepted card scheme, in order to get international acceptance, or an interlinking of national card schemes into a single internationally accepted card scheme.</p><p>If such a SEPA scheme could achieve acceptance in the countries where national card schemes are present, and even at some point expand to cover the whole of Europe, it might prove to be a business case. Entering a two-sided market could, however, be challenging as co-badging with international schemes already guarantees issuers pan-European and global acceptance.</p><p>Regardless of the way in which a SEPA scheme is formed, start-up, organisational and marketing costs would be large and cost recovery uncertain. In the view of market participants, reduced interchange fees, as mandated by the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR), can make cost recovery even more difficult. While competition from international card schemes in national markets might eventually squeeze national card schemes' margins to the point where they consider an international merger (when it is already too late), building a SEPA card scheme is likely to remain a political construct rather than a sound business case in the short term, similar to the fate of past approaches to such a potential scenario. However, in view of the gradual phasing out of several national card schemes, in the long-run the lack of a pan-European card solution may lead to the phasing out of European national card schemes and the loss of European stakeholders' strategic influence over the European cards market.</p><p>2.4 Market initiative on interconnecting national card schemes</p><p>There are a number of market initiatives that aim to promote the interoperability of national card schemes. In addition to the initiatives trying to achieve interoperability through standardisation (described in more detail in Chapter 4), the European Card Payment Association (ECPA) is looking into the possibility of interconnecting card processing in Europe.</p><p>A decade after the Eurosystem first called for the development of the SEPA card processing framework and two years after the IFR provision on technical interoperability came into force, progress in the area of card processing interoperability still appears to be limited. In this regard, the ECPA presented a European card payment interconnection (ECPI) initiative to connect national card schemes using existing card infrastructures for authorisation (using standards ISO 8583 and ISO 20022) and the new SCT Inst infrastructure for clearing and settlement, allowing for synergies by making the operation and maintenance of a separate infrastructure for inter-scheme card transactions superfluous.</p><p>The ECPI initiative concerned the possibility of using SCT Inst infrastructure to clear and settle card-based transactions between issuers and acquirers. Investments in the infrastructure for transaction processing could thus be limited only to achieving an authorisation service at European level by providing gateway services between national schemes' switches based on ISO 20022 message exchange.</p><p>The ECPI project could potentially provide an alternative to international card schemes, allowing European national card schemes to extend their offer beyond national borders and introduce competition in the market for cross-border transactions. The inclusion of all national card schemes in the ECPI initiative can thus provide the same functionalities as a European card scheme, e.g. cross-border reachability, and ensure European independence for all internal market transactions, bringing such transactions fully under EU jurisdiction in terms of data protection, confidentiality and security.</p><p>It is, however, of the utmost importance that clarity is provided on the business model used to execute the payment transaction (card payments, credit transfers or direct debits) in order to ascertain the set of applicable rules for all actors involved and make users aware of which payment service they are using so that they can refer to the relevant rights, obligations and transparency provisions. As a next step, the initiative would need to set up a separate legal entity responsible for managing the scheme's rules (e.g. acceptance rules, payment scheme branding and fee structures), inter-scheme specifications, certification, operational management of disputes and arbitrage and financial settlement arrangements between different members.</p><p>Progress on creating a solution that would enable cross-border payments with cards issued under European schemes has been considerably slower than hoped. Several national card schemes have been replaced by international card schemes and more schemes may face the risk of extinction. Thus, competition in the European cards market (not only cross-border but also national) might be reduced and, in an extreme scenario, end up in a duopoly of international card schemes. The current status of the cards market is already hampering its efficiency and calls for further action. The Eurosystem encourages cards market players to take a more ambitious approach to a SEPA for cards, allowing them to maintain their strategic influence over the European cards market, and supports market initiatives working towards it. </p><p>As a result, the Eurosystem:</p><p>acknowledges that national card payment schemes working towards pan-European reachability could result in increased competition and efficiency in the European cards market;  welcomes market initiatives to interlink national card payment schemes, including through processing arrangements, provided that full pan-European reach is achieved, and notes that a common European logo indicating the possibility of using the cards of national card schemes at EU level might be helpful in promoting the use of such cards;   notes that the already interoperable European SCT Inst infrastructure for the settlement and/or clearing of card transactions may be a possible way to support interlinking of national card payment schemes, provided that clarity concerning the operating business model used to execute the payment transaction (i.e. the underlying payment instrument) is provided to all parties involved. 3 The current legal and regulatory framework</p><p>Since the publication of the 2014 card report, the legal and regulatory framework has been extensively enhanced to support the establishment of a SEPA for cards. As shown in Chart 5, the European Commission proposed the IFR and PSD2, which were adopted by the Council and the European Parliament. The Commission has also adopted the relevant regulatory technical standards (RTS) developed by the European Banking Authority (EBA), which is also establishing guidelines to support the implementation of the new rules. Market players have implemented a large share of this new legal and regulatory framework already or are currently in the course of doing so.</p><p>In addition, a number of recent legislative initiatives, including delegated legislation, also have an impact on the card payments market. These include:</p><p>the Payment Accounts Directive (PAD);  the Second Wire Transfer Regulation (WTR2);  the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR);  the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AML5);  the eIDAS Regulation. These legal acts aim to increase safety, efficiency and competition, though it is acknowledged that they may also increase complexity in the legal and regulatory environment for the European cards market. In line with the questionnaire, this section focuses mainly on the perception of the IFR and PSD2 among cards market players from the supply side. In general, any assessment of the framework that has emerged so far would suffer from the fact that it is not yet being fully implemented. This cautionary note is also made by a majority of the consultation respondents.</p><p>Overall, most market participants welcome the overarching objectives of the rules stipulated in the new legal and regulatory framework. They consider the existing framework as adequate and/or sufficient to achieve the SEPA objectives. However, some are of the opinion that, given the status of cards in SEPA, little justification is left to impose further requirements on market players. Consequently, about half of market participants believe that no further legislation is needed. Some even state that the extensive regulation has led to a situation where national schemes are disappearing. Moreover, the rules are regarded as stifling innovation and hampering the ability of national schemes to compete with big tech players and international card schemes.</p><p>According to market players, the main difficulties experienced with the new rules are as follows: (i) the implementation across Member States is inconsistent, (ii) the supervisory approach chosen by the national competent authorities seems to differ to some extent, and (iii) the time gaps and deviations between the implementation deadlines of the primary legislation compared to the associated delegated acts are confusing and create unnecessary uncertainty. Hence, the priority should be consistent implementation as well as gaining experience with the rules while closely studying their impact.</p><p>Most respondents strongly advocate a market-driven approach to more harmonisation and integration based on business reasoning and accounting for the resources required for implementation. If further legislation is considered, market participants advocate that this needs to: (i) be strictly balanced with business requirements, (ii) respect the views of all card market players, and (iii) be implemented in a harmonised fashion across Member States.</p><p>Besides these more general remarks, some specific areas of potential improvements were outlined by providers in the cards market with respect to the IFR and PSD2.</p><p>Based on the market consultation, it remains to be seen whether the objectives of the IFR have been successfully addressed. A number of answers relate to the separation of scheme and processing, which is described as not being fully implemented by international schemes. This is stated as being the case for innovation, such as tokenisation, but also for regular card transactions in a national environment. In addition, some respondents pointed out that issuing banks had changed their pricing models by raising cardholder fees, while merchant prices did not decrease in the course of the IFR. This is partly explained by the fact that the interchange fees are only one component of merchant service charges, the other ones being the fees charged by card schemes to acquirers and the fees stemming from the acquirers themselves (see Chart 6). In particular, some respondents report increasing scheme fees charged by international card schemes largely offsetting the forced decrease in interchange fees. Moreover, smaller and medium-sized merchants may also not be able to negotiate lower merchant service charges proportionate to the interchange fee reduction, as they lack sufficient bargaining power compared to merchants processing more transactions of an overall higher value.</p><p>Overall, perception of the IFR adoption appears rather mixed based on the replies from the market consultation. Hence, the review study planned by the European Commission for 2020[12] is of the utmost importance to provide more insight into market dynamics.</p><p>With respect to the PSD2, the respondents address in particular the RTS on Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and Common and Secure Communication. A number of market consultation respondents view the RTS as hampering e-commerce and not being technologically neutral, as for instance: (i) exemptions from SCA are very complex and not easy to comprehend from a consumer's perspective, (ii) the same low-value transactions are treated differently when initiated with different payment instruments (such as contactless vs. contact card payments), and (iii) merchant liability is diminished, which could lead to higher fraud rates. The European Commission will review the PSD2 by 13 January 2021. Also reviews of its delegated acts are foreseen.</p><p>The Eurosystem acknowledges that the IFR and PSD2 have addressed some of the outstanding issues identified as obstacles to achieving a SEPA for cards. The objectives of the IFR are to enhance competition and increase the efficiency of the European cards market. A harmonised implementation of these rules would pave the way for a more efficient cards market.</p><p>As a result, the Eurosystem:</p><p>underlines the need for consistent and harmonised application of EU legislation as well as alignment of supervisory activities of national competent authorities in Member States in order to allow payment service providers to consider, in their strategy, adapting business processes and developing efficient, convenient and secure card payment solutions, which would allow payment service users to take advantage of the new legal and regulatory framework;  welcomes the initiative of cards market players to participate more actively in public consultations on forthcoming regulatory reviews as well as on draft legal acts, thereby ensuring that their interests are taken into account. 4 European stakeholder involvement initiatives for cards</p><p>The involvement of various stakeholders and industry groups in the payments market is of the utmost importance. All achievements, whether attained as a consequence of adopted legislation or market-driven initiatives, demand the involvement and cooperation of different stakeholders. This especially holds true for the cards market, where a large number of different market players with different and sometimes conflicting positions and interests are present. Therefore, these players need to cooperate when establishing standards and environments to help them achieve interoperability and consequently enable acceptance of cards all over Europe, regardless of the issuing country. </p><p>In its 7th SEPA progress report and the 2014 card report, the Eurosystem emphasised the importance of cards standardisation in the development of a SEPA for cards and identified standardisation activities as a prerequisite to ensuring that any card can be used at any terminal in Europe. The 2014 card report pointed out that the slow progress is mainly due to the lack of decision-making on future SEPA standards and the absence of a concrete migration plan. It further stated that a decision on the standards to be used and their implementation is both urgent and sensitive, as it may help to open up the market and foster a level playing field across Europe. In its 2014 card report the Eurosystem also mentioned different cooperation initiatives, some of which have already terminated due to an inability to deliver results, while others are still running and successfully continuing their work to ensure the steps needed towards a harmonised cards market in Europe. In general, the Eurosystem has seen an improvement in cooperation between stakeholders in the area of standardisation compared to 2014, especially within the European Cards Stakeholders Group.</p><p>4.1 The European Cards Stakeholders Group</p><p>The European Cards Stakeholders Group (ECSG), which replaced the Cards Stakeholders Group in 2016 as a multi-stakeholder association dedicated to harmonising card payments in Europe, comprises organisations from multiple industries and sectors, including processors, retailers, vendors, schemes and payment service providers. The European Commission and the European Central Bank have an observer role.</p><p>The main aim of the ECSG is to develop and maintain the SEPA Cards Standardisation Volume (the Volume). The requirements and implementation guidelines in the Volume aim to harmonise data elements, functional aspects of card payment products/services and security requirements. If taken up, which is a voluntary exercise based on self-commitment, the Volume's requirements may provide a basis for interoperability.</p><p>The Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB) acknowledged[16] the ECSG's work on formulating harmonised requirements for cards standardisation as being very important and invited the group to keep the ERPB informed of its progress on a regular basis. Therefore, the ECSG tracks progress indicators in its annual progress report to the ERPB. Additionally, in December 2014, the ERPB invited the ECSG to implement the relevant procedures and start monitoring the conformance of implementation specifications for payment card products and services to the Volume.</p><p>A Volume Conformance Management Committee (VCMC) has been set up within the ECSG to monitor the market adoption of Volume-conformant specifications. A procedure to verify compliance with the standardisation requirements in the Volume has been set out by the ECSG. This consists of a labelling process for the specifications to comply with the requirements. To date Volume standards have been adopted for seven sets of specifications by three organisations and more are likely to follow. The certification process to verify that a solution (e.g. point of interaction (POI) or card) complies with a set of specifications is conducted by certification bodies from outside the ECSG. </p><p>It is important to note that the labelling process is based on a self-assessment by the implementation specification providers. The Eurosystem sees the labelling process as a step towards further harmonisation in the area of standardisation. However, if this was based on the assessment by an independent third party, a more impartial judgement could be achieved. Conformance with the Volume is a voluntary decision by each stakeholder, but would become meaningful if the relevant stakeholders align services and products with the Volume.</p><p>The Eurosystem also notes that the ECSG has taken the initiative to work on subjects that go beyond the strict domain of traditional card payments (e.g. wallets, tokenisation and person-to-person (P2P) card payments). It welcomes initiatives working on harmonised and competitive implementation specifications with the aim of avoiding further fragmentation of the market. In this respect, the active involvement of cards market players in the work of relevant standardisation bodies, regardless of their scale or organisational status, and in decision-making processes is welcomed. Only a balanced representation of all relevant stakeholders in the field of cards standardisation can ensure that the cards industry pursues the objectives for a fully integrated and harmonised retail payments market in the field of card payments.</p><p>As a result, the Eurosystem:</p><p>welcomes initiatives that have been taken within the ECSG to foster and ensure harmonisation, such as the setting up of a Volume Conformance Management Committee (VCMC) to monitor the market development of Volume-conformant specifications;  welcomes the performance of a self-assessment by relevant stakeholders to verify the compliance of their specifications with the standardisation requirements set out in the ECSG Volume;  is of the opinion that this labelling process could be improved by ensuring that an independent entity conducts a more impartial assessment of whether Volume requirements are being fully met by institutions, which would increase transparency in the market;  welcomes the ECSG activities aimed at standardising derivative card services (e.g. P2P card-based payments, digital wallets, tokenisation) while maintaining the level of card payment security;  welcomes the activities of smaller card stakeholders in relevant standardisation bodies, e.g. joining forces with other stakeholders to promote common interests and achieve common objectives. 4.2 Initiatives and achievements in the area of standardisation</p><p>Processing of card payments consists of two distinct steps: the authorisation of payments and the handling of the financial flows (clearing and settlement). These processes involve different stakeholders, namely merchants/retailers, acquirers, processors, issuers and card schemes. Common standards for communication between stakeholders facilitate the processing of card payments. The current situation regarding standardisation of communication between stakeholders in the relevant domains is set out below.</p><p>4.2.1 Card-to-terminal domain </p><p>The payment instrument industry is constantly exploring new solutions to attract new customers and to make the act of purchasing easier. Contactless card payments, as well as mobile-based card transactions, are the best known examples. For some years now, cards market players have been seeking solutions to ensure their technological independence, which is essential for them to survive.</p><p>In the card-to-terminal domain, the European Card Payment Cooperation (ECPC), which is composed of the main national schemes in Europe, has been established to develop a generic card and mobile payment application specification, the CPA contactless extension (CPACE), which can be used in different environments (contact and contactless cards, mobile near field communication (NFC), remote transactions). CPACE adds card and mobile extensions for both contactless and remote payments to the EMVCo CPA standard specification and enables national schemes to develop interoperable extensions for contactless transactions with EMV-based cards. It also allows European card issuers and schemes to become independent from proprietary contactless applications currently available. This European contactless payment application goes together with the provision of a European kernel (core software for POS terminals) for payment acceptance.</p><p>At the same time, other private stakeholders' specifications (e.g. PURE) and related products and services offer white label solutions to national schemes or local labels. The suite includes a scheme-agnostic EMV payment application adopted by many actors for various white label payment offers involving contact/contactless mobile/cards devices and wearables. The core specifications address both issuance (cloud-based and secure element) and acceptance (POS kernel) fields.</p><p>4.2.2 Terminal-to-acquirer domain </p><p>The terminal-to-acquirer domain (T2A) applies to the communication between a terminal at the point of sale and a payee's payment service provider (i.e. the acquirer). In this domain, the aim of standardisation is to ensure the possibility for merchants to change an acquirer without any transition costs and as such reduce the business lock-in.</p><p>A major initiative has been undertaken by the Nexo organisation which bases its specification on ISO 20022 CAPE (card payments exchanges) messages. Nexo proposes a series of standards for many practical applications. Standards have already been implemented by an increasing number of retailers to set up international payment processing platforms.</p><p>4.2.3 Acquirer-to-issuer domain </p><p>The acquirer-to-issuer domain (A2I) applies to the communication between a payee's payment service provider (i.e. the acquirer) and a payer's payment service provider (i.e. the issuer). In its 2016 Acquirer to Issuer Processing Study, the ECSG, responding to the invitation of the ERPB to assess the opportunity of migrating to a single standard in the acquirer-to-issuer domain, reports that today most of the protocols used in the market are variants of the ISO 8583 standard (e.g. messages are based on various versions of the ISO 8583 standard).</p><p>Indeed, the processing of transactions (e.g. message standards and processing practices) is often specific to each card scheme, due to their legacy evolution. In addition, acquirers and issuers have developed proprietary solutions for cross-scheme communication, such as bilateral or multilateral architectures, intra-processor processing and gateway services, leading to a plethora of different types of messages.</p><p>Some initiatives aim to harmonise the usage of message standards and eliminate the lack of standardisation in this domain.</p><p>The acquirer-to-issuer cards messages (ATICA) initiative was set up to design a standard that captures business processes currently addressed by ISO 8583, but by using ISO 20022 methodologies. This simplifies the conversion process between message standards. ATICA produced an initial version of the standard in December 2014. While this early version of the standard is still a proof of concept, ATICA is working towards a second version of its standard where schemes have to ensure technical compatibility, but not necessarily functional compatibility, leading to a situation where a set of specific messages could be different among the different schemes. Standardisation remains the result of a business decision to use the same specifications and increase interoperability.</p><p>The Berlin Group, on the other hand, has defined a card clearing model based on using SEPA direct debit infrastructure, known as SEPA Cards Clearing (SCC). In many payment systems in Europe, the clearing of card transactions is carried out analogously to the clearing of credit transfers and direct debits. The Berlin Group has developed an SCC framework that offers a simple message extension to the SEPA direct debit definition to include the additional card originated data in ISO 20022 payment messages. The framework has been adopted in Germany, where banks decided to migrate from domestic legacy clearing systems for Girocard transactions to the SCC services by February 2016.</p><p>In the absence of a common message set for all card transactions, and given the difficulty of providing one that suits all industry players, the ECSG is developing a message translation guide between different standards, such as different versions of ISO 8583 and ISO 20022. While this initiative will not solve the issues of interoperability, it could help overcome divergence in standards and improve harmonisation.</p><p>A majority of the market consultation respondents were of the opinion that standards like ISO 20022 are beneficial for interoperability, but most parties indicated that these standards should be implemented in a market-driven manner only and will probably only be used for new projects. Respondents claimed that this is particularly true for large incumbents who are looking at the cost of migration and do not see clear business benefits, such as new functionalities. Indeed, according to the ECSG study, even in the case of a global mandate for all card schemes to migrate to a common standard, the payback period is estimated at a decade in the best case scenario. As indicated previously for ISO 20022 ATICA messages, the adoption of the standard by most of the actors helps, but does not guarantee, business interoperability between systems.</p><p>An alternative solution to address issues of standardisation in the acquirer-to-issuer domain might be the use of interoperable SCT Inst clearing and settlement infrastructure. This may strengthen the foundation of the European payments market by fostering efficiency and European independence in the field of payments. It represents an opportunity to achieve the unification of the A2I domain based on European players and solutions. As mentioned in Chapter 2, this is the solution that has been proposed by the ECPI initiative to connect national card schemes. For such a solution to be viable, the pan-European reach of SCT Inst clearing and settlement infrastructure is required.</p><p>In the area of card payments processing, an emerging trend towards integration of a growing number of market players can be observed. In particular, merchants, technical service providers and financial technology entities (fintechs), aiming to become more competitive, are extending the scope of their activities by providing additional services (e.g. merchants are implementing payment platforms and offering payment solutions). This movement has resulted in a concentration of larger European players, while smaller national players are being challenged by competition from larger ones. In addition, international players are benefiting from the ongoing standardisation in Europe, enabling them to enter a previously fragmented market and compete with incumbents. </p><p>4.2.4 Terminal security domain </p><p>As the entry point to the financial system, payment cards and card payment terminals have always needed attention from a security perspective. Whereas payment cards were already subject to harmonised and adequate security standards, terminals did not have a common set of requirements or a harmonised process for their evaluation and certification. The ECSG has worked to further standardise this domain.</p><p>The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), originally formed by the main international card schemes, is mainly responsible for managing the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and sub-standards, against which businesses may measure their own payment card security policies, procedures and guidelines. In the field of terminal security, the PCI PIN Transaction Security/Point of Interaction requirements (PCI PTS POI) are intended to reduce the likelihood of, and limit the consequences of, fraud involving POI devices. Over recent years, terminal manufacturers have gradually been led towards adopting standards to comply with security requirements set by the PCI SSC.</p><p>Common Criteria (CC) is an internationally recognised set of standards (ISO 15408) whose objective is to impartially assess the security of computer systems and software. This framework has been born out of a partnership between Canada, the United States and Europe. A certificate issued by the common certification body responsible for certifying that an evaluated product meets the Common Criteria ensures that the evaluated product fulfils particular security criteria. Some features of the Common Criteria standard prevented it from being adopted for payment terminals by the majority of card industry stakeholders; the evaluation process appeared to be costly and cumbersome, in opposition to a time-to-market principle.</p><p>The Volume now provides a harmonised set of requirements for terminal security and ensures a single process for the evaluation and certification of new types of payment terminals. The Common Criteria standard has been adopted in the United Kingdom and Germany, whereas other countries have opted for the PCI standard. However, for the PCI standard, the security requirements against which a new product or a new technical solution are evaluated in order to obtain approval, should be more inclusive and take more account of the expertise of all PCI SCC members, especially in the field of security.</p><p>The Eurosystem acknowledges that work in the area of standardisation is complex, mainly due to the existence of many and sometimes conflicting interests, and that it is a time-consuming process. Progress towards harmonised standards has been observed, and deploying common standards that are able to provide interoperable solutions for the European cards market will be a key factor in achieving a SEPA for cards. To ensure the interoperability of European solutions and that the European payment industry has adequate influence over SEPA card standards, non-proprietary standards are seen as the basis for current and future activities in the area of cards standardisation. However, recent developments, like implementation of the SCT Inst scheme, also deserve special attention, as they may be seen as an opportunity to address standardisation issues using the SCT Inst infrastructure to clear and settle card-based payments.</p><p>As a result, the Eurosystem:</p><p>welcomes the implementation of specifications which have been developed through industry-driven standardisation initiatives based on open standards such as ISO 20022 and which are able to provide interoperable solutions in the European cards market;  supports the work on the potential use of European SCT Inst infrastructure to clear and settle card-based payments in the acquirer-to-issuer domain to foster efficiency and interoperability in the European cards market;  notes that it is important for stakeholders to remain vigilant as regards terminal security and to continue to work towards common terminal security, evaluation and certification requirements that are in the interest of European stakeholders. 4.3 Latest technologies as a potential factor for further market fragmentation</p><p>Until a few years ago, national card schemes benefited from the technological contributions of international card schemes under different types of agreement, such as grandfathering (contracts under which the parties agree to share services, such as the provision of technical expertise in return for access to a national network).</p><p>More recently, relationships have become more competitive and pressures on national schemes have increased with the development of mobile payment solutions and their different sorts of wallets by international card schemes and other providers, which are then adopted by European issuers. This started with EMV specifications, whose implementation varies significantly according to the scheme's special features. Indeed, these schemes had different technical approaches from the beginning to overcome production issues, resulting in the development of different kernels that can hardly reach the full range of hardware platforms (processors, operating systems, etc.), thus hindering interoperability.</p><p>Although the development of strong customer authentication solutions based on the 3D Secure protocol has provided an example of technology transfer from international card schemes to different stakeholders, the market could become very competitive in terms of the diversity of the platforms that will implement the second version of the protocol.</p><p>More recently, proprietary payment solutions like Original Credit Transaction (OCT), based on the push payment capabilities (credit accounting messages from an issuing bank to an acquiring bank through card infrastructures) relying on existing card payment systems, allow senders to make near real-time payments to beneficiaries for person-to-person (P2P) or business-to-person (B2P) usages. These solutions allow cross-border and cross-payment-instrument transactions (cards, bank accounts, mobile wallet, cash payout) for intra- and, theoretically, inter-scheme transactions or for payments initiated via social networks. Each scheme is developing its own solution with different market players (banks, merchants, social networks, etc.) without considering interoperability issues. Consideration should be given to whether this type of transaction is to be seen as a credit transfer in a legal sense, even if it is made under the rules of a card payment scheme. As previously mentioned, it is of the utmost importance for the business model adopted to be clear to all players involved, including end-users.</p><p>Regarding contactless payments, in its latest report the ECSG records the growing use of contactless card payments and raises concerns regarding the multiplicity of kernels. In order to reduce the complexity of contactless acceptance, the ECSG analysed the possibility of converging either to one single existing kernel (out of over seven kernels available on the market) or to the EMV 2nd Gen, which is likely to require large investments and an implementation period of several years. Regarding migration to one of the existing single kernels as an interim solution, the disadvantages would largely outweigh any benefits. Therefore, the ECSG recommended pushing the industry to proceed with a joint plan for the EMV 2nd Gen in the long term.</p><p>On the contactless issuing specification side, the two initiatives, namely CPACE and PURE, are making specifications available to the market (in one case subject to a licensing agreement), showing that open initiatives are possible. According to the ECSG, after agreement between the card/mobile application owner and the kernel owner, any existing EMVCo kernel can now be configured to ensure the acceptance of the card/mobile application.</p><p>Tokenisation is another example of technology that may allow players to indirectly impose their proprietary solution. This is a new technology that raises the security of card-based payments by replacing the primary account number (PAN) with a value which can only be used in a controlled way (the token). This enables the safe storage of payment card details in mobile wallets, wearables, merchant checkout systems and Internet of Things payment solutions. A tokenised PAN cannot be used outside its original context, such as a specific mobile wallet or specific merchant. However, in order to enable financial transactions to be processed in the interbank domain, the tokenised card details have to be translated back to the PAN. At the moment, this service is mainly offered by international card schemes, while it should be provided by several scheme-independent token service providers in order to maintain competitiveness. However, further analysis is needed to better understand tokenisation practices in the cards market.</p><p>The payments market is becoming more competitive and innovative, with players wishing to develop efficient and appealing solutions to attract users and reduce costs. In this context, it can be expected that initiatives for technology sharing will come up against the economic interests of the various players. It seems that, although market players show a willingness to collaborate, competition is increasing, especially for the latest innovations. The Eurosystem acknowledges that innovation which improves the efficiency of the cards market and leads to convenient and secure solutions is, after integration, the second major driver of change, provided that common and open standards are used by payment service providers when setting up new solutions. This will enable interoperability with other solutions and ensure pan-European reachability, while the use of the core SEPA schemes will allow the achievement of European independence.</p><p>As a result, the Eurosystem:</p><p>welcomes the activities of payment service providers aimed at delivering innovations to increase the efficiency, convenience and security of card payments for payment service users;  notes that it is important that all card schemes support tokenisation, including by third party processors;  notes that, to avoid further fragmentation in the cards market, innovations need to be based on common standards and preferably also on European (instant) credit transfer schemes;   welcomes the further activities of European stakeholders aimed at providing innovative payment solutions in a harmonised way (e.g. in terms of standards and security) to achieve European independence. 5 Direction of innovations</p><p>5.1 Agents of innovation</p><p>Considering the rapid development of the payments landscape and other financial innovations in recent years, innovation seems to be key to maintaining or improving the competitiveness of cards within the broader payments market. In recent years, innovation relating to cards has been mainly headed by card schemes. However, this trend seems to be about to shift in the coming years, as new players have emerged in the payments market, spurred by financial innovation and the new regulatory environment driven by the PSD2. In the near future, innovation will contribute to broader acceptance of cards involving issuers and acquirers, but innovation might also spur alternatives to the existing card schemes.</p><p>All participants in the payment chain, both new and traditional players, may incorporate innovation through new services and products, and foster it within the EU payments market. Using rapid progress in technology, market players ultimately drive payment innovations, which need to meet customer expectations in order to be adopted. For example, the ubiquity of the smartphone and other mobile devices created strong demand for payment systems that could integrate with these. The majority of use cases so far have involved the application of new technologies to traditional products or services, as opposed to using those technologies to create entirely new products.</p><p>However, when dealing with innovations, the security implications must always be taken into account. Even though some initiatives may enable additional acceptance for card payments, a downgrade in the level of security must be avoided. Innovation must not hamper current security and guarantees of current payments.</p><p>5.2 Main drivers of innovation in the European cards market</p><p>In the market consultation, five key factors were identified as either fostering or hampering innovation in the European cards market.</p><p>Business priorities: As previously stated, different stakeholders located along the card payments value chain will certainly participate in the innovation process that is currently affecting the whole financial sector and, more specifically, the payments market. Their ability to innovate might be affected by their physical location, the category they belong to (e.g. payment service providers, technological companies, merchants, etc.) and their size, due to the substantial resources needed to make investments.  Security and fraud risk management: Most new features that have been launched in recent years seek to add security and fraud risk management measures. Successful cases of innovation relating to security and fraud issues include EMV chip cards, which provide strong two-factor authentication and counterfeit protection, and 3D Secure, which increases transaction security for e-commerce. One of the elements of strong customer authentication under PSD2 is the verification of a customer using biometric features (e.g. fingerprints, iris and facial recognition).  Efficiency and customer convenience: Customer convenience and the need to improve customer experience at the point of interaction becomes a driver for any market player, as providing a better service (customer experience) could reduce payment friction, generate greater customer loyalty and attract new customers.  Increasing competition from non-card payment instruments (e.g. instant payments): Financial innovation has developed technical solutions which enable new payment methods, such as those started from a smartphone through a digital wallet or based on an instant payment. Such competition is also being assisted by legislation (i.e. the PSD2), which is opening up the market by including under the regulatory framework new actors, such as payment initiation service providers (PISP) and account information service providers (AISP). Both new payment methods and new entrants impact the card payments market directly, as they could potentially take market share from traditional cards. Moreover, new market infrastructures for processing SCT Inst, such as the launch of the TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS) service, might also affect this scenario.  Mobile wallets using cards as the underlying instrument: The use of smartphones to perform payment transactions using card-based mobile wallets as the underlying instrument is spreading rapidly. However, the overall usage is still low, as it is limited by the necessary technological deployment of devices capable of accepting this type of proximity payment. There is the potential that the market will progressively move from plastic to mobile-based solutions in the coming years, which could allow cards to maintain a significant role in the payments market or even boost card-based payments using new form factors. 5.3 Implications of innovation trends for card payments</p><p>There are at least two general considerations that should be made when trying to analyse the future implications of current innovation trends for card payments. The first is the risk in terms of further fragmentation arising from technological developments and the second is the opportunities emerging from such innovation.</p><p>Considering that innovation is driven by various stakeholders involved in the payments ecosystem through individual or joint initiatives, when it comes to a SEPA for cards, innovation could become a challenge for interoperability. There are plenty of innovations which are usually deployed first at the local or regional level, potentially causing a high degree of fragmentation in each market and at European level before, eventually, consolidated solutions emerge. Making such fragmented innovations interoperable adds complexity, which must be taken into account in order to achieve a harmonised European market. Some respondents to the market consultation also pointed out that solutions developed by global players could discourage local and European initiatives.</p><p>Fragmentation could also arise from technological developments that are not homogenously spread throughout SEPA. It has already been noted in Chapter 4 that efforts are being made to increase standardisation in the market. These collaborative efforts are constantly challenged by innovative solutions and by competition itself. This issue was already addressed in the 2014 card report and is an important objective of the ECSG. Promotion of the smooth operation of payment systems is one of the Treaty tasks of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) to be carried out via the Eurosystem. In carrying out this task, the Eurosystem aims to ensure pan-European reach or, at least, interoperability of card payment solutions. Although this might not be an initial priority for start-ups that develop in national environments, any new solutions should be designed with the potential for pan-European reach in mind.</p><p>Despite the aforementioned fragmentation risks, innovation is often considered to be one of the most competitive factors in open markets. Innovations which share a common interest, like security features providing confidence in the payments market, have in the past been driven by cooperative projects involving payment market players (such as EMV) and have been a major driver of card payments growth and ubiquity. Other payment solutions, such as instant payments at the point of sale, may also increase competition, encouraging the payments market to become more efficient and interoperable. However, current card payments in the EU are clearly dominated by international schemes that also lead innovation in this sector. Although this might mean improvements in payment efficiency and security, it must be closely monitored by policymakers to prevent a lock-out effect for smaller players or newcomers, which might be forced into co-badging to access the market, and to ensure that the interests of European market players are adequately reflected.</p><p>Proportionate regulation is key when it comes to fostering competition between traditional and new actors, so as to guarantee a level playing field. Competition in an environment based on novelty and technology depends heavily on capital. It can be difficult for small players starting in national markets to achieve a critical size in order to survive.</p><p>Innovations have been transforming the cards market and payments market in general. The Eurosystem welcomes innovative solutions that enable efficient, convenient and secure card payments. The Eurosystem stresses the importance for innovative payment products and services not to reintroduce fragmentation into the European cards market. While it is comprehensible for innovative solutions to appear and focus on regional markets initially, the Eurosystem emphasises the need for solutions to have the potential to extend their acceptance to the pan-European level or to become interoperable with other solutions, using commonly accepted, international standards. The emergence of fragmented national solutions needs to be avoided.</p><p>As a result, the Eurosystem:</p><p>invites cards market participants, such as payment service providers and card schemes, to develop new products and strategies based on common and open standards with a pan-European perspective, focusing on an interoperable-by-design attitude that should benefit from faster access to economies of scale, and would welcome all relevant stakeholders becoming familiar with and actively involved in the work of standardisation bodies when developing new solutions;  welcomes the development of innovative solutions that offer EU-wide capabilities/acceptance or interoperate with existing local initiatives, even if they are not specifically card-related solutions;  stresses the importance that innovations in card payments should not lead to fragmentation in the cards market or the broader payments market. 6 Conclusion</p><p>Payment cards are perceived as an efficient and convenient way of making retail payments. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that they are the most widely used and the fastest-growing electronic payment instrument in Europe. However, the differences between cards usage in the various European countries is strikingly high and the percentage of cross-border card payment transactions is still relatively low in volume terms. This observation indicates that there is still vast potential for cards usage growth, both within many individual countries and across European borders. The cross-border acceptance of cards issued under national card payment schemes could contribute to achieving the SEPA for cards any card at any terminal objective, and foster a further take-off of card payments in Europe. So far, despite significant efforts by the industry in recent years, this aim has not been achieved and cross-border acceptance relies on co-badging with international card payment schemes.</p><p>Technological innovations, combined with new legislation that spurs competition among stakeholders, have influenced and will continue to influence the landscape of card payments in Europe. These developments have large-scale effects in the fields of (i) security, with the appearance of not yet mature solutions on the market that may impose a security risk for users; (ii) sovereignty, with the increasing adoption of payment solutions from non-European market players; and (iii) market integration, with the risk of fragmentation of the European market due to the emergence of proprietary local solutions that do not allow pan-European reach. European innovations improve the efficiency of the market and lead to new, more versatile and secure services for users. Therefore, the use of European SCT Inst infrastructure for the clearing and settlement of card payments could be, amongst other possibilities, a solution to ensure the pan-European reach of national schemes at a potentially low cost and to increase efficiency in the European cards market. At the very least, using interoperable or common clearing and settlement SCT Inst infrastructure for card payments and interlinking national card schemes and processing entities has the potential to increase efficiency and competition.</p><p>New entrants and new payment services may considerably affect the traditional card payments business model. In particular, new payment services and instant payment solutions, combined with innovative channels such as mobile phones and wearables, might diminish cards' share of the payments market. In this increasingly competitive market, only payment solutions providing efficient services at competitive prices for customers and merchants will manage to attract new users.</p><p>Therefore, cooperation between incumbents and new market entrants is key to developing the missing elements of a SEPA for cards and for preventing fragmentation of the European single market. Innovative and standardised industry-driven solutions based on open standards could enable pan-European reach of (card) payment products and services and ensure European technological independence.</p><p>Over recent years, the Eurosystem has monitored developments in different areas of the cards market and facilitated the activities of relevant stakeholders, while promoting and extending cooperation where possible. In order to address the issues identified and help the market to achieve a harmonised, competitive and innovative European card payments area, as envisaged in a SEPA for cards, the Eurosystem will continue to pursue its activities to facilitate dialogue among market players and will continue to provide support for their activities in line with the aforementioned objectives. Nonetheless, SEPA for cards is market-driven, so only the ambition and determination of relevant market players will bring about a harmonised, competitive and innovative European cards market in which they will be able to maintain their strategic influence.</p><p>(European Central Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2210725162</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XF8-W8R1-DY0W-4362-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"12502\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service Group Apr 18, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Innovations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Standards</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technological change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Legislation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Interoperability</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Infrastructure</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Objectives</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cooperation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Efficiency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Competition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Initiative &amp;

In the report, the three authors, all academics, share their views on the application of competition rules to platforms, data, and digital and tech killer acquisitions. While confirming that the fundamental goals of competition law remain the same in relation to the digital economy, the Advisers advocate vigorous enforcement and certain adjustments to the way competition law is currently applied, including:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tougher treatment of a dominant platform's alleged self-preferencing of its own products and services;Potential data-sharing or interoperability remedies for dominant technology companies if required to ensure effective competition by breaking down network effects and data-related entry barriers;No change to the EU merger control thresholds to capture so-called killer acquisitions (where a supposedly dominant incumbent buys out a nascent technology that might have emerged as a competitive threat), but suggesting that if these types of deals are identified, it should be for the companies to prove no anti-competitive effects or offsetting efficiencies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Background</p><p>On March 28, 2018, Commissioner Vestager appointed the academics  Heike Schweitzer, professor of law at the Humboldt University of Berlin; Jacques Cr\u00e9mer, professor of economics at the Toulouse School of Economics; and Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, assistant professor of data science at Imperial College London  as special advisers for a period of one year (mandate ended on March 31, 2019) to help explore how competition policy should evolve to continue to promote innovation in the digital age. In their much-awaited final report, the three experts describe what they see as the main characteristics and challenges of the digital economy and they make general suggestions on the application of EU competition rules to platforms, data, and digital and tech killer acquisitions.</p><p>The Advisers identify strong economies of scope across the digital economy, which favors the development of ecosystems, giving incumbents a strong competitive advantage that makes them very difficult to dislodge. The Advisers also identify a reasonable concern that dominant digital companies have strong incentives to engage in anti-competitive behaviour that require vigorous competition enforcement and adjustments to the way competition law is currently applied. Current under-enforcement in the digital sphere is a concern and thus strategies by dominant companies to reduce competition should be forbidden unless the company can clearly demonstrate benefits for consumers.</p><p>While the Advisers consider that the existing basic framework of EU competition law remains relevant and sufficiently flexible to protect competition in the digital age, they advocate a departure from certain established concepts, doctrines and methodologies  such as consumer welfare, market definition and market power  and more emphasis on theories of harm and identification of anti-competitive strategies.</p><p>Platforms</p><p>In markets where network effects and returns to scale are strong, the Advisers consider there might be room in the market for only a limited number of platforms. In such context it is essential to both protect competition for the market and protect competition in the market (i.e., on the platform itself). The Advisers argue that large platforms have a quasi-regulatory role as they determine the rules according to which their users interact. The fact that they determine rules is not an issue per se, but when acting as regulators, they have a responsibility to use their power in a pro-competitive manner and should take this role seriously.</p><p>The Advisers further advocate that actions by a dominant platform to impede market entry without competing on the merits (e.g., through the use of most favored nation clauses, best price clauses, restrictions on multi-homing and switching) should be suspect under competition law and that the dominant platform should bear the burden of demonstrating the efficiency of such measures as defense.</p><p>The Advisers note that self-preferencing by a dominant platform (i.e., giving preferential treatment to the platform's own products or services when they are in competition with products and services of other entities using the platform) is not abusive per se but should be subject to an effects test. Self-preferencing by a vertically integrated dominant digital platform can be abusive when it is not justified by a pro-competitive rationale. The Advisers propose that, to the extent that the platform performs a regulatory function, it should bear the burden of demonstrating that self-preferencing has no long-term exclusionary effects on product markets. Where self-preferencing has significantly benefited a platform's subsidiary by improving its market position vis-\u00e0-vis competitors, remedies might need to include a restorative element.</p><p>Data</p><p>The Advisers note that timely access to relevant data is increasingly becoming a parameter for competitiveness. However, a broad dissemination of data must be balanced against the need to ensure sufficient investment incentives for firms to collect and process data, as well as the need to protect privacy and business secrets. Commenting on the report, Commissioner Vestager stated as data becomes the key to success, the huge quantities of information that some big businesses have can give them an edge that smaller rivals can't match. And the importance of network effects can mean that it's hard for smaller firms to compete, even with a better product, if they don't have a critical mass of users,<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote2\"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p>Defending Competition in a Digitised World, a speech by Margrethe Vestager at the European Consumer and Competition Day, Bucharest, April 4, 2019.</p></bodyText></footnote> but also that collecting data also takes effort and time. So if we insist that companies share it with others, without proper compensation, we could discourage others from putting in those efforts in the future.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote3\"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p>Ibidem.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Data sharing and data pooling arrangements are not fully developed. While a legal framework is yet to be clearly defined, the Advisers consider that a block exemption regulation on data sharing and data pooling may be appropriate. In a number of cases, data access will not be indispensable to competition and if so, public authorities should refrain from intervention. However, there are cases where an obligation to ensure data access  and possibly data interoperability  may need to be imposed. This would be the case for data needed to serve complementary markets or aftermarkets, i.e., markets that are part of the broader ecosystem served by the data controller. The Advisers consider that data access/interoperability can be a remedy against anti-competitive leveraging of market into markets for complementary services and add that [w]here vertical and conglomerate integration and the rise of powerful ecosystems may raise concerns, requiring dominant players to ensure data interoperability may be an attractive and efficient alternative to calling for the break-up of firms  a way that allows us to continue to benefit from the efficiencies of integration.</p><p>Digital and Tech 'Killer Acquisitions'</p><p>The Advisers examine whether the current EU merger control rules need to be revised to address concerns relating to early elimination of potential rivals by dominant firms, through acquisitions of small startups with a quickly growing user base and significant competitive potential, commonly called killer acquisitions. Many of these acquisitions may escape the European Commission's jurisdiction because they take place when the targets do not yet generate sufficient revenue to meet the conditions of the EU Merger Regulation. The Advisers consider it too early to contemplate any changes to the rules. They consider it more appropriate, for the time being, to monitor the performance of new thresholds linked to transaction value that were recently introduced in certain member states, such as Germany and Austria. Amendments to the EU rules may become justified in the future.</p><p>The Advisers consider however that there is a need to revisit the substantive theories of harm to properly assess acquisitions in the digital sector. The report states that competition law should be particularly concerned about protecting the ability of competitors to enter markets. This would imply a heightened degree of control of acquisitions of small startups by dominant platforms and/or ecosystems, to analyze whether they are used as a possible strategy against partial user desertion from the ecosystem. The report adds that where an acquisition is plausibly part of such a strategy, the notifying parties should bear the burden of showing that the adverse effects on competition are offset by merger-specific efficiencies. The report specifies that this theory of harm does not create a presumption against the legality of such mergers but that it takes due account of new business strategies and the competitive risks they raise.</p><p>Similar UK initiative</p><p>On March 13, 2019, the Digital Competition Expert Panel appointed by the U.K. chancellor and chaired by professor Jason Furman, former chief economist to President Obama, issued a similar report making strategic recommendations for changes to the U.K.'s competition framework to face the opportunities and challenges of the digital economy.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote4\"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p>Unlocking Digital Competition: Report of the Digital Competition Expert Panel, March 2019.</p></bodyText></footnote> The report recommends updating the rules governing merger and antitrust enforcement. In particular, the report advocates the need for the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to take more frequent and firmer action to examine digital and tech acquisitions and calls for a review of the CMA merger assessment guidelines based on the latest economic understanding and an update of the legislation clarifying the standards for blocking or conditioning a merger.</p><p>The report also stresses the need to prioritize and fast-track enforcement in digital markets, placing less reliance on large fines and enabling action that targets and remedies issues more directly. The report also proposes a set of pro-competition measures to open up digital markets, such as the establishment of a pro-competition digital markets unit tasked with securing competition, innovation and beneficial outcomes for consumers and businesses.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The Advisers' report makes general suggestions on the application of the EU competition rules to the digital sphere. While it does not suggest a complete overhaul of existing competition policy, it proposes adjustments to established concepts and assessment tools. In some areas, the report suggests that regulatory changes may be needed in the longer run. However, the Advisers do not envision a new type of public utility regulation to emerge for the digital economy: [T]he risks associated with such a regime  rigidity, lack of flexibility, and risk of capture  are too high. At the same time, the report advocates that competition agencies can contribute to the better functioning of the digital economy by providing more guidance, thereby creating more legal certainty for companies. For instance, guidance may be needed on the definition of dominance in the digital environment, the duties of dominant platforms as regulators, data sharing and data pooling, data access and interoperability requirements.</p><p>Rather than offering a final word on how the EU rules on competition should adapt to the fast-moving and fast-growing digital economy, the report provides a significant contribution to the ongoing debate between competition authorities, academics and other stakeholders on both sides of the Atlantic as to whether existing competition rules are fit to address the many challenges and opportunities of the digital economy. The report offers a clear contrast to recent proposals promoted by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren to break up big tech companies and impose big, structural changes to the sector. Commissioner Vestager has recently stated that in the EU, structural changes in the tech industry are met with great skepticism and breaking up big tech companies would be the last resort, as EU enforcers are focused on using existing antitrust rules to address issues in the market.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote5\"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p>Warren Says She'll Break Up Amazon, Facebook, Google if Elected President in 2020, MLex, March 8, 2019; Warren Proposal to Break Up Big Tech Is 'Very Far-Reaching, Vestager Says, MLex, March 11, 2019.</p></bodyText></footnote> The report suggests that access to data and data interoperability may be an efficient alternative to breaking up big tech companies.</p><p>Commenting on the publication of the report, Commissioner Vestager said that the European Commission will need to take some time to think about those ideas and to discuss and debate before conclusions are reached.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote6\"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p>Defending Competition in a Digitised World, a speech by Margrethe Vestager, op. cit.</p></bodyText></footnote> It might be some time before we see drastic proposals for change.

That's not just within the EU, but everywhere else.According to Bloomberg,[4] the powderkeg that blew open this latest call took place in Austria, where former Green member of the European Parliament, Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, was the subject of offensive Facebook posts. In response, she demanded the platform block any further posts featuring images of her if they have offensive captions.Facebook is wary of the impending court case, citing in an email that this hypothetical regulation 'undermines the long-standing principle that one country should not have the right to limit free expression in other countries.'The company added later on in the email that it hopes the court will respect the sovereignty of nations and platforms to self govern, 'even in the age of the internet, the scope of court orders from one country must be limited to its borders.'Controversial political commentator and Infowars contributor Paul Joseph Watson, who was booted from Facebook,[5] called the move ironic, tweeting[6]: 'Facebook warns that the EU's demand it remove 'offensive content' is a 'threat to freedom of speech'. Give me strength.'As it is, Facebook is already under heavy scrutiny in the U.S. for precisely the opposite reason. </p><p>Facebook has been accused of being trigger-happy with censorship, and even worse, accused of censoring based upon political ideology. The platform was accused of censoring articles[7] in February which expressed skepticism over the Jussie Smollett hate hoax incident.The platform flagged a Texas GOP pro-life post[8] in March, claiming after it was called out that it mistook the post as 'clickbait.' The company has gone on record saying that it's priority 'is always to keep people on Facebook safe.'Both sides of American politics, divided as ever, agree that tech companies have unchecked power. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz threw down a challenge against the platforms during an April hearing when he said 'If we have tech companies using the power of monopoly to censor political speech, I think that raises real antitrust issues.'Democratic presidential candidate and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren[9] has repeatedly called for these Big Tech companies to be broken up, as they have 'too much power.'In response The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have decided to take action[10], to devastating effect. American Big Tech companies Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and Google lost more than $140 billion in market value after the Justice Department and FTC announced impending antitrust investigations.

That's not just within the EU, but everywhere else.According to Bloomberg,[4] the powderkeg that blew open this latest call took place in Austria, where former Green member of the European Parliament, Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, was the subject of offensive Facebook posts. In response, she demanded the platform block any further posts featuring images of her if they have offensive captions.Facebook is wary of the impending court case, citing in an email that this hypothetical regulation 'undermines the long-standing principle that one country should not have the right to limit free expression in other countries.'The company added later on in the email that it hopes the court will respect the sovereignty of nations and platforms to self govern, 'even in the age of the internet, the scope of court orders from one country must be limited to its borders.'Controversial political commentator and Infowars contributor Paul Joseph Watson, who was booted from Facebook,[5] called the move ironic, tweeting[6]: 'Facebook warns that the EU's demand it remove 'offensive content' is a 'threat to freedom of speech'. Give me strength.'As it is, Facebook is already under heavy scrutiny in the U.S. for precisely the opposite reason. </p><p>Facebook has been accused of being trigger-happy with censorship, and even worse, accused of censoring based upon political ideology. The platform was accused of censoring articles[7] in February which expressed skepticism over the Jussie Smollett hate hoax incident.The platform flagged a Texas GOP pro-life post[8] in March, claiming after it was called out that it mistook the post as 'clickbait.' The company has gone on record saying that it's priority 'is always to keep people on Facebook safe.'Both sides of American politics, divided as ever, agree that tech companies have unchecked power. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz threw down a challenge against the platforms during an April hearing when he said 'If we have tech companies using the power of monopoly to censor political speech, I think that raises real antitrust issues.'Democratic presidential candidate and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren[9] has repeatedly called for these Big Tech companies to be broken up, as they have 'too much power.'In response The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have decided to take action[10], to devastating effect. American Big Tech companies Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and Google lost more than $140 billion in market value after the Justice Department and FTC announced impending antitrust investigations.

LONDON, UK \u2014 The European Union\u2019s top court ruled Thursday that an agreement that allows big tech companies to transfer data to the United States is invalid, and that national regulators need to take tougher action to protect the privacy of users' data.      The ruling to invalidate Privacy Shield will complicate the transfer of a lot of data outside the EU, and it could require regulators to vet any new transfers due to concerns that the U.S. government can snoop on people's data for national security reasons.      It will no longer simply be assumed that tech companies like Facebook will adequately protect the privacy of its European users' data when it sends it to the U.S. Rather, the EU and U.S. will likely have to find a new agreement that guarantees that Europeans' data is afforded the same privacy protection in the U.S. as it is in the EU, which has some of the toughest standards in the world.      The case began after former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed in 2013 that the American government was snooping on people\u2019s online data and communications. The revelations included detail on how Facebook gave U.S. security agencies access to the personal data of Europeans.      Austrian activist and law student Max Schrems that year filed a complaint against Facebook, which has its EU base in Ireland, arguing that personal data should not be sent to the U.S., as many companies do, because the data protection is not as strong as in Europe.      Though the legal case was triggered by concerns over Facebook in particular, it could have far-reaching implications for all tech companies that move large amounts of data over the internet if regulators find that U.S. privacy protections are insufficient and block the transfers. Things like email, flight and hotel reservations would not be affected.      Schrems said the ruling amounted to a victory for privacy. \u201cThe U.S. will have to engage in serious surveillance reform to get back to a \u2018privileged\u2019 status for US companies,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.      Companies use legal mechanisms called standard contractual clauses that force businesses to abide by strict EU privacy standards when transferring messages, photos and other information. Companies like Facebook routinely move such data among its servers around the world, and the clauses \u2014 stock terms and conditions \u2014 are used to ensure the EU rules are maintained when data leaves the bloc.      The Court of Justice of the EU ruled Thursday that those clauses are still valid. However, it declared invalid the umbrella agreement between the U.S. and EU on data transfers, called Privacy Shield.      The court noted in its rulings that there are \u201climitations on the protection of personal data arising from the domestic law of the United States on the access and use by U.S. public authorities of such data transferred from the European Union to that third country.\u201d      Alexandre Roure, a senior manager at Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, said the decision \u201ccreates legal uncertainty for the thousands of large and small companies on both sides of the Atlantic that rely on Privacy Shield for their daily commercial data transfers.      \"We trust that EU and U.S. decision-makers will swiftly develop a sustainable solution, in line with EU law, to ensure the continuation of data flows which underpins the trans-Atlantic economy.\u201d      RELATED: EU reopens its borders to 14 nations but not to US tourists      RELATED: World joins US protests but leaders restrained about President Trump      RELATED: EU: George Floyd's death was 'an abuse of power'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42610946068</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C9-W5F1-JCSC-J53Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>WUSA 9</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

LONDON, UK \u2014 The European Union\u2019s top court ruled Thursday that an agreement that allows big tech companies to transfer data to the United States is invalid, and that national regulators need to take tougher action to protect the privacy of users' data.      The ruling to invalidate Privacy Shield will complicate the transfer of a lot of data outside the EU, and it could require regulators to vet any new transfers due to concerns that the U.S. government can snoop on people's data for national security reasons.      It will no longer simply be assumed that tech companies like Facebook will adequately protect the privacy of its European users' data when it sends it to the U.S. Rather, the EU and U.S. will likely have to find a new agreement that guarantees that Europeans' data is afforded the same privacy protection in the U.S. as it is in the EU, which has some of the toughest standards in the world.      The case began after former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed in 2013 that the American government was snooping on people\u2019s online data and communications. The revelations included detail on how Facebook gave U.S. security agencies access to the personal data of Europeans.      Austrian activist and law student Max Schrems that year filed a complaint against Facebook, which has its EU base in Ireland, arguing that personal data should not be sent to the U.S., as many companies do, because the data protection is not as strong as in Europe.      Though the legal case was triggered by concerns over Facebook in particular, it could have far-reaching implications for all tech companies that move large amounts of data over the internet if regulators find that U.S. privacy protections are insufficient and block the transfers. Things like email, flight and hotel reservations would not be affected.      Schrems said the ruling amounted to a victory for privacy. \u201cThe U.S. will have to engage in serious surveillance reform to get back to a \u2018privileged\u2019 status for US companies,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.      Companies use legal mechanisms called standard contractual clauses that force businesses to abide by strict EU privacy standards when transferring messages, photos and other information. Companies like Facebook routinely move such data among its servers around the world, and the clauses \u2014 stock terms and conditions \u2014 are used to ensure the EU rules are maintained when data leaves the bloc.      The Court of Justice of the EU ruled Thursday that those clauses are still valid. However, it declared invalid the umbrella agreement between the U.S. and EU on data transfers, called Privacy Shield.      The court noted in its rulings that there are \u201climitations on the protection of personal data arising from the domestic law of the United States on the access and use by U.S. public authorities of such data transferred from the European Union to that third country.\u201d      Alexandre Roure, a senior manager at Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, said the decision \u201ccreates legal uncertainty for the thousands of large and small companies on both sides of the Atlantic that rely on Privacy Shield for their daily commercial data transfers.      \"We trust that EU and U.S. decision-makers will swiftly develop a sustainable solution, in line with EU law, to ensure the continuation of data flows which underpins the trans-Atlantic economy.\u201d      RELATED: EU reopens its borders to 14 nations but not to US tourists      RELATED: World joins US protests but leaders restrained about President Trump      RELATED: EU: George Floyd's death was 'an abuse of power'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42610845913</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C9-W5F1-JCSC-J517-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>KHOU</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Austrian activist and law student Max Schrems that year filed a complaint against Facebook, which has its EU base in Ireland, arguing that personal data should not be sent to the U.S., as many companies do, because the data protection is not as strong as in Europe.      Though the legal case was triggered by concerns over Facebook in particular, it could have far-reaching implications for all tech companies that move large amounts of data over the internet if regulators find that U.S. privacy protections are insufficient and block the transfers. Things like email, flight and hotel reservations would not be affected.      Schrems said the ruling amounted to a victory for privacy. \u201cThe U.S. will have to engage in serious surveillance reform to get back to a \u2018privileged\u2019 status for US companies,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.      Companies use legal mechanisms called standard contractual clauses that force businesses to abide by strict EU privacy standards when transferring messages, photos and other information. Companies like Facebook routinely move such data among its servers around the world, and the clauses \u2014 stock terms and conditions \u2014 are used to ensure the EU rules are maintained when data leaves the bloc.      The Court of Justice of the EU ruled Thursday that those clauses are still valid. However, it declared invalid the umbrella agreement between the U.S. and EU on data transfers, called Privacy Shield.      The court noted in its rulings that there are \u201climitations on the protection of personal data arising from the domestic law of the United States on the access and use by U.S. public authorities of such data transferred from the European Union to that third country.\u201d      Alexandre Roure, a senior manager at Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, said the decision \u201ccreates legal uncertainty for the thousands of large and small companies on both sides of the Atlantic that rely on Privacy Shield for their daily commercial data transfers.      \"We trust that EU and U.S. decision-makers will swiftly develop a sustainable solution, in line with EU law, to ensure the continuation of data flows which underpins the trans-Atlantic economy.\u201d      RELATED: EU reopens its borders to 14 nations but not to US tourists      RELATED: World joins US protests but leaders restrained about President Trump      RELATED: EU: George Floyd's death was 'an abuse of power'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42610855717</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C9-W5F1-JCSC-J51X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>WFAA.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

LONDON, UK \u2014 The European Union\u2019s top court ruled Thursday that an agreement that allows big tech companies to transfer data to the United States is invalid, and that national regulators need to take tougher action to protect the privacy of users' data.      The ruling to invalidate Privacy Shield will complicate the transfer of a lot of data outside the EU, and it could require regulators to vet any new transfers due to concerns that the U.S. government can snoop on people's data for national security reasons.      It will no longer simply be assumed that tech companies like Facebook will adequately protect the privacy of its European users' data when it sends it to the U.S. Rather, the EU and U.S. will likely have to find a new agreement that guarantees that Europeans' data is afforded the same privacy protection in the U.S. as it is in the EU, which has some of the toughest standards in the world.      The case began after former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed in 2013 that the American government was snooping on people\u2019s online data and communications. The revelations included detail on how Facebook gave U.S. security agencies access to the personal data of Europeans.

The proposed EU Cybersecurity Directive will extend security regulation beyond the confines of personal data and telcos. Operators of critical infrastructure will be aff ected, as will online platforms that support other online services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is anyone unsure about the EU agenda for cyber and data security? If you want some insight you could easily check the UK Information Commissioner's website and you see that in 2012 over 20 data controllers were hit with big fines for security breaches affecting personal data.</p><p>Or you could rewind to January 2012, when the EU published the Draft General Data Protection Regulation, which will impose mandatory breach disclosure on every data controller operating in the EU, backed up with potential fines of up to 2% of annual worldwide turnover for those organisations who fail badly.</p><p>Or you could go back a little further still, to October 2009, when the EU introduced the mandatory breach disclosure rule for telcos and ISPs, which has been operating since early 2011.</p><p>Actually, you don't need to do any of that. Instead, just focus on the draft EU Cybersecurity Directive, which was published on 7 February 2013. It's a short document, easy to get to grips with, and within a few minutes the implications will be obvious to you.</p><p>The new Directive makes it compulsory for all \"market operators\", including utilities, transport and financial services businesses, as well as public authorities who use \"network and information systems\" within their businesses to implement technical and organisations measures to manage cyber risks. These organisations will be subject to independent regulation, they will have to disclose security breaches to the regulators, they will have to submit to compulsory regulatory audits and they will be sanctioned if they fail to comply with the law.</p><p>The scope and magnitude of this new Directive is huge. Obviously, the regulation of cyber risks in utilities, transport, financial services and public authorities is massive in its own right, but it's the wider concept of \"market operator\" that really needs to be looked at.</p><p>A market operator includes a provider of information society services \"that enable the provision of other information society services\".</p><p>Information society services are colloquially called ecommerce services in the EU, but this is about much more than online shopping, because in the EU an information society service is essentially a service that is provided over the internet, whether or not a fee is charged. In other words, an information society service can be a shopping site, a social network, a search engine, or an \"over the top\" communications systems (like Skype) and so on, whether or not they are web or app based.</p><p>Looking again at the definition of market operator, what really counts is whether the information society service is supporting another information society service. Our privacy blog,  privacylawblog.ffw.com, is an information society service, but it's not supporting another, so it's not caught by the Cybersecurity Directive. What the Directive is looking for is the platform of support - if you are a platform for an ISS, then you are regulated.</p><p>If all of this sounds too complicated, don't worry, the Directive provides some indicative examples. These are: ecommerce platforms, internet payment gateways, social networks, search engines, cloud computing services and application stores.</p><p>This is an incredible list and the magnitude of the Directive becomes obvious when you start adding names to the list:</p><p><list><listItem><bodyText><p>ecommerce platform = Amazon and eBay provide market platforms for traders and iTunes has to be captured too</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>internet payment gateways = PayPal is the most obvious one, but there loads of others, like Worldpay</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>social networks = Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and so on</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>search engines = Google</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>cloud = basically every tech co in the World!!!</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><bodyText><p>application stores = I think Apple has one (!), Google too, Amazon again and what about the telcos ... isn't Blackberry launching one now too?</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>This seems quite incredible at first, but it's real. And its obvious really, isn't it, because it is the Cybersecurity Directive after all! It wouldn't deserve this name if it didn't regulate these household names.</p><p>There is a lot to like in the Directive, but businesses will have concerns about the nature of regulation and the competence of the regulators. There are also some worrying grey areas in the Directive, such as the delegation of many powers to quangos, which is never good for legal certainty. I would expect many big tech companies to be looking hard at how to engage with the EU on this, because there is much to be shaped-up.</p><p>But wrapping this altogether and tying up the various strands, what we see within the EU is radical lawmaking for security. Any organisation that misses this point will come unstuck. That's why the law is being reformed, specifically to cause behavioural change. Whether you look at security from a data protection angle or a cyber angle, it does not matter; you just have to be more secure.</p><p>I've posted a diagram below which shows the core legal pillars for data and cybersecurity in the EU, now and coming. What you are seeing here is a coalescence of approach and obligation. The end game is a single legal test - take appropriate technical and organisational measures to secure your networks and data. That's the European approach.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.
