This managed cloud platform service covers Backbase's entire portfolio of banking products, helping banks to innovate with speed whilst reducing their costly operational hurdles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> At present, banks face a twofold threat; both from more technologically-capable neo-bank competitors and, more recently, from the expansion of big tech into banking. In this new digital environment, agility and fast time to market is key. To support banks in keeping pace, Backbase-as-a-Service provides financial institutions with the technological infrastructure to develop and release new services to their customers more swiftly. With less time dedicated to set-up, updates and security, banks can focus on innovating and allocating more resources to new features that enhance the overall experience for customers.</p><p> Lowering time to market, while eliminating upfront capital investments on hardware and maintenance of aging technology, Backbase-as-a-Service becomes the ideal innovation partner. As banks grow, they can increase or decrease computing capacity as needed as Backbase-as-a-Service is based on usage-based spending. This allows for higher business flexibility and a faster response to market shifts.</p><p> Commenting on the launch, Jouk Pleiter, CEO, said: \"Backbase is committed to being the leading innovation partner for global banks and credit unions. We believe the move to cloud is an unstoppable one, and one which every financial institution needs to embrace. Our clients want the freedom to innovate and maintain their competitive edge, so launching Backbase-as-a-Service is the logical step for us. It is our duty to maximise their ROI when it comes to becoming digital-first and meeting the digital demands of their customers. Cloud is an exceptional tool for taking that leap.\"</p><p> Thomas Fuss, VP Technology, added: \"The improved service will significantly benefit banks both in terms of reducing overhead on IT and delivering superior digital banking experiences to their clients. It's another step forward in helping clients unlock their digital potential. Undertaking the transition to the Backbase cloud means our clients are always tapping into the latest innovations and features that our platform offers. Cloud adoption has been relatively slow in banking so we're proud to provide clients with a state-of-the-art managed service which is always available, always secure and always packed with the latest innovations.\"</p><p> Along with the business value of innovating at scale and reducing IT overhead, the newly announced Backbase-as-a-Service will offer banks:</p><p> - Managed Software &amp; Hardware Updates</p><p> - 99.9%+ Uptime</p><p> - Shared or Dedicated Backbase Environment</p><p> - Multiple Sandbox Environments</p><p> - Database Backups &amp; Redundancy</p><p> - Scalable Infrastructure</p><p> - End-to-End Encryption</p><p> - Regulatory Compliance</p><p> The platform is immediately available worldwide.</p><p> # # # </p><p> About Backbase</p><p> Backbase's Digital-First Banking Platform powers seamless customer experiences, unifying data and functionality from core banking systems and innovative fintech partners. We believe it is vital that banks evolve and maintain superior digital experiences in order to retain privileged control of the customer relationship, drive efficiency, stave off new competition and continue to grow.</p><p> More than 100 large financials around the world have benefitted from Backbase's omni-channel, Digital-First Banking Platform, including ABN AMRO, AIB, Barclays, Banamex, Bank United, BNP Paribas, Central1, Citi bank, Citizens bank, CheBanca!, HDFC, Hiscox, IDFC First, KeyBank, Lloyds Banking Group, Metrobank, Navy Federal Credit Union, PostFinance, RBC, Societe Generale and Westpac.</p><p> Industry analysts continue to recognize Backbase's front runner position. Backbase was named a Leader in the Forrester Wave (TM): Digital Banking Engagement Platforms, Q3 2019. The 2019 Ovum Decision Matrix lists Backbase as the Ultimate Digital Banking Platform Market Leader.</p><p> View source version on businesswire.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200114005050/en/\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200114005050/en/</url></p><p>ClickThru URL: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.backbase.com\">https://www.backbase.com</url>/ </p><p>Multimedia Gallery URL: </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RITZAU-CRR701466966</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RITZAU2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y08-3WG1-JDKJ-153W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468065</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Ritzau All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Ritzau</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"14972\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>DANISH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>DANSK</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000569</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC BANKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTk5RDIyOTlFMEQzNEIxMjlBQkIyQTA4RDY2Q0QzM0U7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDJDQjg1RTk0N0RFNEQ3MkJGRTk2OUZDMEZBN0QzOTA</classCode><className>External Audits</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001211</classCode><className>NEW PRODUCTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOQM</classCode><className>DIGITAL ONLY BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009WXX</classCode><className>PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000253</classCode><className>CAPITAL EXPENDITURES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000569</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC BANKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTk5RDIyOTlFMEQzNEIxMjlBQkIyQTA4RDY2Q0QzM0U7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDJDQjg1RTk0N0RFNEQ3MkJGRTk2OUZDMEZBN0QzOTA</classCode><className>External Audits</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

That was the key takeaway from the opening session of the In2 Innovation Summit Mena, held in Dubai on Thursday.  <br/><br/>Hosted by public relations agency ASDA'A Burson-Marsteller, the panel, titled PR &amp; The New Trust Equation, gathered experts from the fields of communications and media from the region.  <br/><br/>Moderator Sunil John, founder and CEO of ASDA'A Burson-Marsteller, warned that the media landscape was at a tipping point, with the rise of fake news and algorithm-driven content creating echo chambers and threatening to further erode trust between the public and media, governments and organisations. \"Big tech is not neutral,\" he said. \"Some people are comparing its influence to 'big tobacco' of old. Do we need regulation to deal with that? That is one of the big questions of the day.\"  <br/><br/>Asked \"who is more trusted? PR or news media?\" panelist Brian Lott, head of corporate communication, Mubadala, said that despite the rise of fake news, he thought the public still believed in media more than PR, adding that communications had a big role to play in rebuilding trust. <br/><br/>Faisal J. Abbas, editor-in-chief of Arab News, warned that new media platforms were undermining the legitimacy and reputation of traditional media. He warned that the role of censor or regulator should not be played by government, and that the platforms themselves should better police their content. <br/><br/>Valerie Tan, vice-president public relations, social media, internal communications, at Emirates, said media had much more to lose in the current debate. \"People have always understood that PR and advertising has an agenda . now they realise that news outlets come with an agenda too.\" <br/><br/>Paul Holmes, chair and founder, The Holmes Report, warned that the biggest danger came not from fake news itself but from attacks on legitimate news stories. <br/><br/>Abbas criticised the industry for \"being on the defensive\" over the allegations of 'spin'. \"We need to agree that perhaps most of the world looks at the PR industry as lobbyists,\" he said. \"You are hired on behalf of client, not the people, and you are paid to do a particular job, and they want value for money.\" <br/><br/>John added there was a responsibility for PR professionals and media to ensure a free and honest exchange of ideas. - <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:business@khaleejtimes.com\">business@khaleejtimes.com</email></p><p><br/>Copyright \u00a9 2018 Khaleej Times.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/28/44/1/151930802361.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/28/44/1/151930802361.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-110466146</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RPR-VCH1-JDJN-63NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"465\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

Af h\u00f8ringssvaret fremg\u00e5r det, at det er Copenhagen Fintech Policy's overordnede holdning, at fintechregulering som udgangspunkt:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\\xB7 Skal tilstr\u00e6bes at ske p\u00e5 europ\u00e6isk, hvis ikke globalt niveau</p><p>\\xB7 i videst muligt omfang b\u00f8r v\u00e6re teknologineutral</p><p>\\xB7 skal sikre et h\u00f8jt niveau af forbrugerbeskyttelse</p><p>\\xB7 skal sikre lige spilleregler mellem markedsdeltagerne</p><p>\\xB7 ikke un\u00f8digt m\u00e5 hindre innovation og udvikling.</p><p>\"Vi skal f\u00f8rst og fremmest have skabt klarhed over, om der er behov for ny regulering, eller om aktiviteterne omfattes af eksisterende lovgivning. Dansk enegang p\u00e5 omr\u00e5det skal vi s\u00e5 vidt muligt undg\u00e5. Det helt afg\u00f8rende er, at vi f\u00e5r f\u00e6lles regler p\u00e5 europ\u00e6isk plan eller m\u00e5ske ligefrem globalt plan\", siger Lars Frelle-Petersen, direkt\u00f8r DI.</p><p>Lige spilleregler b\u00f8r v\u00e6re et b\u00e6rende princip i Finanstilsynets virke og al regulering. Det vil sige at samme aktivitet skal reguleres ens. Det g\u00e6lder ikke mindst i forhold til big tech-virksomheder. Hvad ang\u00e5r mindre, nystartede virksomheder, kan det i h\u00f8jere grad begrundes at give regulatoriske frirum.</p><p>\"Det er vigtigt, at europ\u00e6iske virksomheder sikres lige adgang til data. Bedre dataadgang og st\u00e6rkere datadeling i b\u00e5de den offentlige og den private sektor er et afg\u00f8rende skridt for en konkurrencedygtig data\u00f8konomi. Det skal naturligvis p\u00e5 en m\u00e5de, s\u00e5 virksomheders og forbrugeres sikres privatliv.</p><p>Den nuv\u00e6rende regulering skaber asymmetrier, hvorved nogle virksomheder skal dele deres data, mens andre skal dele data uden gensidighed. Derfor b\u00f8r alle virksomheder, der opererer i EU, stille deres data til r\u00e5dighed for andre sektorer. Det b\u00f8r ske via standardiserede, sikre API'er, som er den bedste vej frem i forhold til at skabe en fair og sikker datadrevet \u00f8konomi\", siger Ulrik N\u00f8dgaard, adm. direkt\u00f8r i Finans Danmark.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Copenhagen Fintech Policy</emphasis></p><p>COPENHAGEN FINTECH - POLICY lanceres som et partnerskab mellem Finansdanmark, DI og Finansforbundet og Copenhagen Fintech.</p><p>Copenhagen Fintech Policy er et nyt samarbejdsinitiativ mellem DI, Finansdanmark, Finansforbundet og teamet i Copenhagen Fintech. Copenhagen Fintech Policy skal fungere som en politiske taler\u00f8r for de mange fintech startups og SMV'er. Copenhagen Fintech Policy arbejder for at styrke fintech-\u00f8kosystemet samt at bidrage til, at K\u00f8benhavn og Danmark kan styrke sin position som fintech-hub i Skandinavien.</p><p>'Dansk FinTech har igennem de senere \u00e5r v\u00e6ret et unikt v\u00e6kst- og jobskabelseseventyr, og vi ser en positiv synergi mellem den etablerede finanssektor og FinTech v\u00e6kstgazeller. Det skaber nye muligheder for ansatte inden for finans og Tech - og bidrager i det hele taget til yderligere v\u00e6kst og jobskabelse. Copenhagen FinTechs succes skyldes i h\u00f8j grad, at mange akt\u00f8rer har samlet kr\u00e6fterne, og n\u00e5r DI, Finans Danmark og vi nu ogs\u00e5 g\u00e5r sammen om policy-arbejdet for dansk FinTech h\u00e5ber vi, at det vil bane vejen for yderligere v\u00e6kst, jobskabelse og fremdrift inden for FinTech i Danmark', siger Kent Petersen, formand for Finansforbundet.</p><p>Dansk Fintech har v\u00e6ret inde i en eksponentiel udvikling, siden Copenhagen Fintech gik i luften i 2016. Som v\u00e6kstorganisation har Copenhagen Fintech udviklet en unik model baseret p\u00e5 et innovativt samspil mellem startups, etablerede virksomheder, vidensmilj\u00f8er og investorer, som p\u00e5 f\u00e5 \u00e5r har medvirket til at flytte Dansk Fintech fra at v\u00e6re \"ikke eksisterende\" som styrkeposition til if\u00f8lge en aktuel rapport fra Startup Genome at v\u00e6re blandt de 20 st\u00e6rkeste globale centre.</p><p>\"Copenhagen Fintech har fra begyndelsen fokuseret p\u00e5 at udnytte de innovative synergier mellem agile, kreative startups, der t\u00e6nker nyt og mere veletablerede virksomheder, som har musklerne og erfaringen til at f\u00e5 de nye id\\xC3er ud p\u00e5 markederne og brugerne. Det er v\u00e6sentligt at organisationerne bag Copenhagen Fintech Policy vil bruge deres politiske erfaring til at viderebringe budskaber for de sm\u00e5 virksomheder.

The new report \"Forging new frontiers: advanced technologies will revolutionize banking \" highlights that COVID-19 is likely to accelerate the digital transformation of banks, which already face intense competition from payment players, Big Tech and e-commerce firms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The report trends will be discussed on the webinar 'The Future of Digital Banking: Revolution Accelerated \" on 25 June, with the CEO and Founder of Varo Money, the EIU and Temenos.</p><p> With COVID-19 accelerating the digitization of banking, 45% of banking respondents say their strategic response is to build a 'true digital ecosystem' and integrate their self-built digital services and third-party offerings. AI will undoubtedly play a key role in accelerating this digital shift. Over three-quarters (77%) of respondents agree that unlocking value from Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be a key differentiator between winning and losing banks. And improving user experience through greater personalization ranked highest (28%) among the most valuable uses for AI.</p><p> The focus is shifting towards enterprise agility with DevOps, which brings together software development and IT operations using modern cloud-based platforms. In fact, 84% of respondents agree that DevOps will drive transformation in core banking, while 81% of banking executives believe a multi-cloud strategy will become a regulatory pre-requisite. The primary focus of banks' technology investment is on cybersecurity (35%), followed by developing AI platforms such as digital advisors and voice assisted engagement channels (33%), and cloud-based technologies (27%).</p><p> Max Chuard, Chief Executive Officer, Temenos, said: \"Banks were under huge pressure due to new competitors, ongoing regulation and slowing profit growth - these pressures have intensified as a result of the pandemic. The report highlights that senior banking executives believe that new technologies such as AI will have the greatest impact in banking in the coming years. As the digitization of banking continues, these new technologies can help banks fend off competitors and gain competitive advantage.</p><p> \"Temenos' cloud-advanced, AI technology and rich banking functionality can help banks deliver value to their customers in the immediate term and accelerate their digital transformation to build sustainable growth in the future. Trends toward digital banking, cloud and SaaS models will only become more pronounced - in the new normal, the need for modern banking technology will be greater than ever.\"</p><p> Pete Swabey, Editorial Director EMEA - Thought Leadership, The Economist Intelligence Unit, added: \"Retail, corporate and private banks were already under pressure to deploy new technologies quickly and change their cultures in order to compete with big tech firms and payment players and deliver an engaging digital experience. Now, as digital banking surges as a result of the coronavirus crisis, this task is more pressing than ever.\"</p><p> About the survey</p><p> Now in its seventh year, the Economist Intelligence Unit report includes for the first time respondents from commercial and private banks, alongside retail banks. The EIU surveyed 305 global banking executives throughout February and March 2020 about the challenges banks are facing relating to the digitization of the sector, and the strategies they are deploying in response. Almost half of respondents (49%) were at C-Suite level. Respondents came from Europe (25%), North America (24%), Asia-Pacific (18%), Africa and the Middle East (16%), and Latin America (17%).</p><p> - Ends -</p><p> About Temenos</p><p>Temenos AG (SIX: TEMN), headquartered in Geneva, is the world's leader in banking software, partnering with banks and other financial institutions to transform their businesses and stay ahead of a changing marketplace.

They say they won't be able to comply with existing and future EU laws and regulations within the applicable deadlines set in the regulations. Some of these regulations include the much-discussed new standards for CO2 emissions.Airline industry: Wishes for upcoming environmental taxation e.g fuel taxes to be put on hold. Seeking governmental bailouts. Also seeking to counter obligations to refund passengers whose flights have been cancelled but the EU Commission is sticking to the EU passenger rights legislation which forces airlines to refund consumers with cancelled flights.Agribusiness and chemicals: Want to delay environmental and sustainability standards and sustainability strategy for food production e.g Farm To Fork .Plastics Producers: Want to delay implementation of the EU\u2019s ban on specific single use plastics, agreed in 2019. The European Commission holds the view that good hygiene practices should be applied to all products, including substitutes of banned SUPs [Single Use Plastics].Finance: Representatives of the banking industry have been asking central banks (including the European Central Bank) to relax or delay rules that were put in place after the financial crisis to limit potential new crises. The measures cover everything from capital and liquidity to accounting and climate change. At the European level, a key concern seems to the new BASEL IV, a requirement for banks to build up capital levels to be able to absorb shocks without collapsing, due to be implemented by 2027.Defence and civil aeronautics: Seeking financial aid from governments and the EU Institutions as well as relief on various technical/regulatory issues.Big Tech: Calls for more public funds towards digitisation of different sectors but also to speed up measures to: allow deployment of technology like 5G networks; speeding up the creation of a European health data space to facilitate sharing of data between public sector, researchers, and the private sector; and boost investment of artificial intelligence (AI) in the health sector. Wishes for the European Commission to re-consider some of the requirements it has set out in its White Paper for AI, specifically when it comes down to testing and the use of European data.Medical Technology Industry: Asking governments and the EU Institutions to delay the implementation of new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR). These standards were agreed in 2017 to increase oversight, market surveillance, and transparency on medical devices. Also asking that In Vitro Diagnostics Regulation (IVDR) be delayed (they are due to be implemented in May 2022). The European Commission is now decided to postpone the Medical Devices Regulation implementation by a full year. So far, the May 2022 deadline for In Vitro Diagnostics Regulation has been kept.Pharma: Asking for public subsidies with no affordability conditions. Wants to ensure that financing is as easy-going as possible while preserving the most industry-friendly intellectual property (IP) rules. i.e an IP framework with a faster research and development process in order to compensate the financial risk. But one way of ensuring affordability is by attaching conditionality to public research funding. Nonexclusive licensing can help achieve broader access to health technologies. When exclusive licenses are negotiated, adequate safeguards should be in place to prevent abuses. Grant agreements can also include specific commitments on affordability. It seems that the position of industry and civil society are far apart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3256775</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTX-SYR1-F0YC-N3DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"619\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 4, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

April 26, 2018 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Earnings season is in full swing. We will see earnings releases from Microsoft, Amazon, Intel today. Stocks sold off on Tuesday, but yesterday's trading session was pretty neutral. Is this a short-term bottoming pattern or just quick flat correction before another leg down? We may see some more uncertainty ahead of earnings releases and investors will continue to react to bonds yield changes. </p><p>There are still two possible medium-term scenarios. The main U.S. stock market indexes were mixed between -0.1% and +0.3% on Wednesday, as investors hesitated following Tuesday's move down. The broad stock market traded along Wednesday's closing prices. The S &amp; P 500 index is currently 8.1% below its January 26 record high of 2,872.87. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3% and the technology Nasdaq Composite lost 0.1% yesterday. The nearest important level of resistance of the S &amp; P 500 index remains at 2,645-2,655, marked by recent fluctuations. The next resistance level is at 2,680-2,700, among others. On the other hand, support level is at 2,615-2,620, marked by local lows. The next level of support is at 2,590-2,600, marked by upward trend line. The support level is also at 2,530-2,550, marked by previous local lows. The broad stock market got closer to its medium-term upward trend line again. Stocks bounced off this line in the early April. Will they bounce again? If the index breaks lower, it could quickly continue towards the February 9 low of 2,532.69. However, stocks remain within their over two-month-long consolidation following early February sell-off. Is this a bottoming pattern before another leg higher within the long-term bull market? Or just pause before another wave of selling? So, there are still two possible future scenarios - bearish that will lead us below February low following trend line breakdown, and the bullish one in a form of medium-term double top pattern or breakout towards 3,000 mark. Stocks bounced off the resistance level in the middle of last week, and they accelerated lower on Tuesday:<br/>Bottoming Pattern or Just Flat Correction? The index futures contracts trade between +0.2% and +0.5% vs. their yesterday's closing prices. So, expectations before the opening of today's trading session are positive. Tech stocks may open higher following yesterday's better-than-expected Facebook, Inc. quarterly earnings release. The European stock market indexes have been mixed so far. Investors will wait for some economic data announcements: Initial Claims, Durable Goods Orders, Wholesale Inventories, Trade Balance at 8:30 a.m. Will the broad stock market bounce today? There may be some buying pressure ahead of several big cap tech stocks' after-hours quarterly earnings releases. The S &amp; P 500 futures contract trades within an intraday consolidation following overnight move up. The market retraces some of its Tuesday's move down, but it continues to trade below recent local lows. The nearest important level of resistance is at around 2,660, and the next resistance level is at 2,680-2,690, marked by recent local highs. On the other hand, support level is at 2,640, and the next level of support is at 2,610-2,620, marked by short-term local lows. The futures contract trades close to its short-term downward trend line, as the 15-minute chart shows:<br/>Nasdaq Trades Along 6,600 The technology Nasdaq 100 futures contract follows a similar path, as it trades within an intraday consolidation. Investors await series of quarterly earnings releases. The market retraced a part of its recent decline and it fluctuates along 6,600 mark. Volatility remains relatively high following yesterday's bounce off daily low at around 6,430. The nearest important level of resistance is at 6,610-6,620, and support level is at 6,550-6,560, among others. The Nasdaq futures contract retraced some of its recent move down, as we can see on the 15-minute chart:<br/>Apple, Amazon: Uncertainty Ahead of Earnings Releases Let's take a look at Apple, Inc. stock (AAPL) daily chart (chart courtesy of http://stockcharts.com ). It sold off on Friday, following Thursday's move down, and it broke below the support level of $165 on Tuesday. Apple will release its earnings report on May 1, so expectations before that release seem to be negative. Will we see some \"sell the rumor, buy the fact\" action? Potential support level is at around $160:<br/>Now let's take a look at Amazon.com, Inc. stock (AMZN) daily chart. The price bounced off support level of medium-term upward trend line yesterday, following Tuesday's breakout below the price of $1,500. We can see a triangle pattern, as the stock trades below two-month-long downward trend line. Amazon will release its quarterly earnings report today, so we may see some volatility after-hours. The support level remains at around $1,400:<br/>Dow Jones Still Below Medium-term Downward Trend Line The Dow Jones Industrial Average came back below its medium-term downward trend line on Tuesday, as it invalidated its bullish scenario. The price bounced off resistance level of around 24,800-25,000 over a week ago. Will it get back to its late March - early April lows again? If it breaks below the level of 24,000, it could continue lower. Potential support level is at around 23,500. The blue-chip stocks' gauge fluctuated along the level of 24,000 yesterday:<br/>The broad stock market retraced most of its early April move up in the last trading days. Is this a new downtrend or just quick downward correction? It looked like a correction on Tuesday, but the market accelerated its downtrend. So, medium-term bearish case is more likely again. Just like we wrote in our several Stocks Trading Alerts, the early February sell-off set the negative tone for weeks or months to come. Concluding, the S &amp; P 500 index will probably retrace some of its recent move down today. There have been no confirmed positive signals so far. Rising bond yields outweighed quarterly earnings releases on Tuesday, but we may see a rebound ahead of series of big tech cap earnings releases. The broad stock market index may keep bouncing off 2,600 mark.

Mr Sims, who is not on Facebook but intends to open an account, said the ACCC's inquiry would involve asking consumers how much they thought the digital platforms knew about them and comparing that to what was in fact being gathered.</p><p>\"Some people have asserted that consumers know what's going on and don't care.

The European Commission showed on Tuesday that those days are gone, opening an in-depth probe into Google\u2019s $2.1 billion takeover of Fitbit \u2014 an investigation that focuses on the potentially huge value of its trove of customer data.      The EU authority will investigate how Google could bolster its \u201cdata advantage\u201d in online advertising with information it collects from Fitbit fitness. The probe, which has an initial December 9 deadline, raises the risk of a potential veto.    The commission \u201cseems to be finally seizing a unique opportunity to stand up to digital dominance that seeks to exploit our most intimate data for profit\u201d, said Ioannis Kouvakas of Privacy International, which lobbied for a longer EU probe. The deal would strengthen Google\u2019s access to health data \u201cat what might be a critical point for the development of this increasingly important market\u201d.

Antitrust authorities have been criticised for waving through deals such as Facebook\u2019s takeover of Instagram and even Google\u2019s 2007 bid for display advertising platform DoubleClick.    The EU\u2019s wide focus on online ads clashes with Google\u2019s view that the \u201cdeal is about devices, not data\u201d and that it\u2019s adding a service \u2014 wearable health devices \u2014 where it currently isn\u2019t active and faces plenty of rivals from Apple, Samsung Electronics, Garmin and others.     Google sought to avoid an extended EU review by promising to create a so-called data silo to keep some Fitbit data separate from other Google datasets that built profiles of internet users to serve them ads they might find attractive. EU regulators said they rejected the offer because it didn\u2019t address their concerns and didn\u2019t include all Fitbit data that could be used for advertising.

After Google\u2019s acquisition of DoubleClick, a huge online advertising firm, in 2007 it promised to never combine DoubleClick data with its own. But in January 2016 it did precisely this,\u201d Ryan said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Facebook and Google are two of the world's largest and most ubiquitous tech companies. The billions who use their services for creating social media posts, uploading videos or searching ads are targeted by the tech companies for their personal data - a prized asset that enhances the companies' power. Regulators are examining whether the companies have used their market power to crimp competition, potentially raising prices and hurting consumers. </p><p>Dissatisfaction with what federal authorities have done so far may be pushing some states to band together to run their own investigations, possibly eyeing more aggressive sanctions. The Federal Trade Commission's recent $5 billion fine against Facebook over privacy violations, for example, was criticized by consumer advocates and a number of public officials as too lenient. \"The states see it as part of their role to fill a vacuum,\" said Jay Himes, an antitrust lawyer in New York. Himes, a former head of the antitrust bureau in the New York attorney general's office, worked on the states' antitrust case against Microsoft about 20 years ago. New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, said Friday her probe will look into Facebook's dominance and any resulting anti-competitive conduct. A separate group of state attorneys general is announcing Monday in Washington the launch of an investigation into \"whether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access and harmed consumers,\" an advisory from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Friday. The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, citing sources they didn't identify, have reported that target will be Google. Both groups of state attorneys general include Democrats and Republicans. Joining James in the Facebook investigation are the attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia. With some 2.4 billion users around the globe and a huge social media presence, Facebook has sparked outrage with a series of privacy scandals and its use by Russian operatives in the 2016 presidential campaign. \"Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers,\" James said. She said the probe would seek to determine if Facebook endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumer choices or increased the price of advertising. The states have the power to make big changes to the tech industry - especially if enough of them band together, said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a group that advocates for the breakup of corporate monopolies. Though states have limited jurisdictions, he said, once a few of the bigger states get involved, changes can come that can affect most of the country. \"You really have to break their power, and I think the states are more likely to do that than anyone else,\" Stoller said in an interview. Facebook said it plans to \"work constructively\" with the state attorneys general and welcomes a conversation with policymakers about competition. Google issued a statement that didn't comment directly on the antitrust concerns but said its services \"help people every day, create more choice for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country.\" \"We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector,\" Google's statement said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN70408678</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X15-B731-DYRV-42BC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"621\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

The U.S. House of Representatives has requested that the respective chief executives testify in Congress in its probe. The Department of Justice is reportedly getting ready to file antitrust lawsuits against Google over its control of advertising. And the EU is targeting Apple over the large revenue cuts it takes from subscriptions generated by third-party apps in its App Store.</p><p>The potential consequences might be damning, with everything from fines that could equal 10 per cent of a company's annual revenues to regulatory changes that break up their monopolies possibly on the table.</p><p>Yet, analysts aren't concerned. \"There are things that are far more dangerous to Google's economic outlook in the next six months,\" said Needham &amp;; Co. analyst Laura Martin, pointing out the company generates 35 per cent of its revenue from struggling areas such as travel, cinemas and hotels.</p><p>\"Regulatory risk is not in the top three risks for Google in the second half of 2020.\"</p><p>Investors appear to agree with her. Amazon, Apple and Facebook have each hit all-time highs in June. Alphabet is the only laggard in the group, but it is only a seven-percentage-point rally away from hitting a historic mark of its own.</p><p>Because of the U.S. upcoming election, Martin doesn't think the U.S. hearings will take place in 2020 as the focus for both political parties will be elsewhere. Even those who believe the hearings will take place this year aren't putting much substance behind them.</p><p>Hans Albrecht, a portfolio manager at Horizons ETFs Management (Canada) Inc., said the hearings in the U.S. and any penalties that come from them will be \"for show.\" Any fines levied on these companies will not make much of a dent in the billions they generate in revenue. He also doesn't think the U.S. will want to weaken its major technology players as China becomes a more dangerous threat to the country's dominance in innovation and technology.</p><p>\"I think you're going to get some posturing and some appeasing, but these companies are going to remain powerful,\" Albrecht said.</p><p>That's certainly the precedent that has been set in the U.S. For instance, Microsoft Corp. faced a similar probe in 2000 and was initially ordered to break up, but it avoided that fate after an appeal went its way.</p><p>Albrecht is confident in the longterm thesis for each of the four Big Tech companies and suggests investors should look to buy more shares if prices slip during the eventual hearings that will most likely be broadcast around the world.</p><p>But declining share prices might not be in the cards if Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's 2018 testimony before the U.S. Senate is any indication. Facebook shares actually rose by five per cent during the process.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said the investigations in Europe are no different. But Ives cautions investors against immediately dismissing the investigations being conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice. \"There's more meat on those bones,\" he said.

In another development, the US government's decision to go ahead with its plans to revoke the work authorisation document (EAD) of spouses of the H-1B visa holders is likely to impact the family income of the Indian techies. The fate of these applicants now rests with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the White House and federal appeals court.</p><p><br/> The US government has issued a notice for the proposed rule to ban the H4 EAD that will come into effect after comments from the public are received on the H-4 visas, a work visa that was launched by the previous Obama administration. While explaining the reasons behind the proposed move, the DHS has said that it is doing so to protect the interest of the American citizens, \"by having a better chance at obtaining jobs that some of the population of the H-4 workers currently hold\".<br/> The US visa authority is set to publish the new rule shortly. Researchers from the University of Tennessee estimate that over 1 lakh India women in the US hold work authorisation on their H4 visas. Several Indian families in the US that are dependent on dual income will face the biggest impact of this decision.<br/> The announcement was made through the 'Unified agenda' webpage created by the federal government. The DHS believes that US skilled workers will be benefitted as the ban will vacate jobs held by the H-4 visa holders. In February, DHS had sent a final draft to the Office of Management and Budget for a review on this Obama-era policy decision.<br/> The rule to ban H4 EAD now awaits sanction from the White House's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The house has time till June 20 to review and sanction the plan. Once the rules are published, they will also be subjected to a public commenting period of 30 to 60 days, it can even extend up to 180 or more days. It seems highly unlikely that the rule will take effect this month.<br/> Majority of the H-4 visa holders reside in the Bay Area, which houses several big tech companies. These tech firms hire the majority of H-1B visa holders. The plan to revoke work authorisation of H-4 visa holders was first proposed in 2017 but it's been delayed since then several times.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n11023485</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W77-PWF1-JBYT-H358-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"394\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 30, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Currently, consumers give away their data in exchange for free services, but what if regulators start putting a price on people\u2019s data?  \u201cBig tech firms have a Californian mindset: they assume that people will generally do the right thing but this is being challenged. Now, they\u2019re having to stop focusing on the sunny side of human behaviour and start recognising the more sinister side. They are scrambling to keep up by developing techniques for hunting down fake news, harmful content and online bullying.  \u201cTech firms are now going to be under pressure to show the thousands of businesses who are plugged into their platform that they are complying with their policies. This could mean a rapid expansion of compliance bureaucracy. For the company, this is likely to mean more cost. For users, more terms and conditions they don\u2019t understand.  \u201cThe really big issue is if regulators start questioning the business model of tech firms. Currently, consumers give away their data in exchange for free services, but what if regulators start putting a price on people\u2019s data?

How do you think this hearing will compare to [Facebook CEO Mark] Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony to Congress a couple years ago?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>Scott Galloway: Big Tech has negotiated rules and engagement that favor them. It weakens the entire experience or makes the experience less effective or less revealing. It\u2019s safety in numbers. They shouldn\u2019t have done all four at the same time. To call in all of Big Tech is a bit reductionist\u2014the issues facing Apple are different than the issues facing Facebook.</p><p>The biggest winners here are [Apple CEO Tim] Cook, [Amazon CEO Jeff] Bezos and [Google parent Alphabet CEO] Sundar [Pichai] because the majority of the ire will be saved for Zuckerberg. This was a mistake. Now, it\u2019s going to be a bit of a food fight. We\u2019re going to have to change gears so much that the public will never get a clear signal. I think it\u2019ll be interesting; good theater with all famous celebrities. But, in terms of actually getting to the root cause or making any progress, it\u2019ll be more spectacle than historic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you think the conversation has evolved since Zuckerberg testified in 2018?</emphasis>We need the legislators at the antitrust phase, and we should\u2019ve come to it five years ago.</p><p>There will be a couple unscripted moments, and that\u2019s why these things are powerful. Where the rubber meets the road here is not in these hearings, but the Department of Justice and the FTC [Federal Trade Commission].\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Where do you see tangible, fundamental intervention taking place?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>I\u2019m not sure I do. If you can tell me who gets elected in November \u2026</p><p>I feel that essentially Zuckerberg and [President Donald] Trump have entered into an unholy alliance. Facebook has said we\u2019ll continue to let Trump weaponize the platform and, in exchange, Trump will keep the FTC and DOJ dogs at bay. If Trump gets reelected, I don\u2019t know if anything is going to happen. If [Joe] Biden does get elected, we\u2019ll probably see regulation by the end of 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you think of the big-name brands boycotting advertising on Facebook this month?</emphasis>It\u2019s heartening and admirable that big companies have boycotted Facebook, and the symbolism is much greater than the financial impact.</p><p>It\u2019s the Terminator 2 [Judgment Day] movie where The terminator would remove its arm and re-form. That\u2019s what the Facebook advertising base is: If somebody stops advertising, a competitor will fill that hole. The elasticity and the diversity and the robustness of Facebook\u2019s advertising base is what I\u2019d call the most liquid and the most self-repairing of any advertiser base ever assembled in the history of business.</p><p>Granted, this is a glass half full. They\u2019ll pretend to make some changes, but Facebook has a lot more power on the advertisers than they have on them. That\u2019s the danger of the monopoly. The monopoly doesn\u2019t have an incentive to respond.</p><p>It\u2019s just more spectacle. The hearings, the boycott, this is literally pissing into the ocean.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How has the Covid-19 pandemic affected these players?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>It has highlighted the problem, an accelerant instead of a change agent. If you look at Big Tech, the general feeling is these companies were performing incredibly well in good times and would be especially vulnerable in bad times. The exact opposite has happened.</p><p>They\u2019re responsible for all the gains this year. The safe place to put your money is in a monopoly or in a company that\u2019s too big to fail. These companies are doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing: They\u2019re keeping regulators at bay, they\u2019re acquiring companies that are threats or putting them out of business. It\u2019s great to work at Apple or be a shareholder; it\u2019s just the rest of the economy that sucks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do the next 10 weeks look like?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>I don\u2019t know.\u00a0</p><p>We are really moving toward such a dramatic, all the \u2018haves\u2019 and \u2018have nots,\u2019 and the \u2018winner take all\u2019 dynamics that we were getting worried about have become full-blown. Wealthy people don\u2019t like to say this aloud, but they\u2019re living their best lives right now.</p><p>There\u2019s the wealthy who get to spend more time with their kids and the bottom half who has to put themselves in harm\u2019s way because they couldn\u2019t work from home. The wealthy are wealthier and happier and the poor are poorer and sicker.</p><p>We have gone from an unhealthy economy to a dystopia in 10 weeks. Because we have a pandemic and someone who has adopted bigotry as their platform, it creates this enormous distraction. This is a low point.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">At the beginning of this crisis, I was hopeful it would make us more empathic, but it seemed to have moved us in the opposite direction.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>All the government action isn\u2019t around coordinating a unified response, but flattening the curve for rich people. Governors are blaming each other for their different responses and the politicization of masks. Every ugly thing that was predicted about capitalism by [Karl] Marx and other philosophers, we seem to be proving them right.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1179630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DH-6YJ1-DYRK-H0M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 21, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

It also reaffirmed that games can be for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Hawreliak says video game streaming was also a major trend over the past decade.</p><p>\u201cStreaming services like Twitch have dramatically transformed games into a spectator sport,\u201d he said. \u201cTied to this is the movement away from games as a product to games as a service.\u201d</p><p>That shift, Hawreliak says, has transformed from buying a copy of a game, playing and finishing it to getting a copy of a game \u2014 often digitally and for free \u2014 and having it be continually updated.</p><p>\u201cIn many ways, development on a game never really stops anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cUpdating already-released games is a major revenue model now and it will only get bigger. I think we\u2019ll see major game studios end their support for physical copies of games altogether.\u201d</p><p>Assistant Professor of Digital Media Aaron Mauro, who is currently writing a book about cybersecurity, says data privacy and big tech\u2019s loss of trust have also been a dominant story in the tech world over the past 10 years.</p><p>\u201cFears of the Y2K bug seem almost preferable to today\u2019s online election meddling, bullying, ransomware attacks, as well as widespread surveillance and tracking campaigns waged by corporations and governments,\u201d Mauro says.</p><p>Looking ahead to the next decade, he believes social and political activism will bring an increased awareness on issues such as GPS tracking, facial recognition, biometrics, artificial intelligence and data sovereignty.</p><p>\u201cThe next generation of activists and politicians will be better able to articulate the necessary freedoms and regulations governing the internet,\u201d says Mauro, adding that Brock students are being prepared to be leaders in tech sectors. \u201cThe Centre for Digital Humanities does a fantastic job training these technically savvy citizens, ready to take on today\u2019s seemly intractable problems that bridge simple human experience and our increasingly complicated digital lives.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2759018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSR-HWX1-JDG9-Y2VW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He had, during the course of his research for an assignment, discovered just how much information the tech company had held about him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The office opted for a rap on the knuckles, accepting Facebook\u2019s assurances that it would be more transparent about how third parties used the personal data of its users. Seven years on, the company finds itself at the centre of an international storm over its failure to do just that.</p><p>The period charts a transformation in the role of the office of the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), which has not only moved to an additional and fancier premises in Dublin\u2019s Fitzwilliam Square, but has become, almost by default, one of the most powerful regulators in the world.</p><p>As a by-product of the influx of foreign direct investment, which brought tech companies including Google and Facebook into Dublin, the Irish regulator now has the power to determine how most of the world\u2019s data \u2013 outside of the US \u2013 is treated, and whether the rights of individuals are vindicated.</p><p>The current holder of the office is Helen Dixon, who took over in 2014. The sense among those involved in this area of public policy is that she is still growing into the position, which itself is growing in importance at an extraordinary rate.</p><p>Dixon made headlines last week after her decision to speak at a conference organised by Independent News and Media (INM) despite her plans to investigate an alleged data breach at the newspaper group. She has refused a request of the Oireachtas Communications Committee to answer questions on the issue when she appears before it on Tuesday, arguing to do so would \u201crisk allegations, or perceptions, of bias\u201d .</p><p>She will also be to the forefront of implementing a major shake-up of European privacy laws which comes into operation next month. Sometimes seen as overly cautious and conscious of Ireland\u2019s reputation as a soft touch when it comes to data regulation, she andher office are now examining not just Ireland\u2019s most powerful media group, but the world\u2019s most powerful social network.</p><p>Dixon arrived in the office in 2014 at a time when it was on the precipice of this major change. The whistleblower Edward Snowden had revealed that the data of Facebook users was being harvested by the US National Security Agency as part of a mass surveillance campaign. Suddenly, the debate about data protection and what companies like Facebook did with personal information, became mainstream.</p><p>The first woman to hold the position, she had no direct experience in the area of data protection, but had no shortage of other impressive qualifications. She was armed with a degree in applied languages, a master\u2019s degree in European economic and public affairs, a master\u2019s in governance, a postgraduate diploma in computer science, and a professional diploma in official statistics and policy evaluation.</p><p>Dixon had some knowledge of the private sector, having worked for ten years in the European office of an IT multinational (her office refused to disclose which company this was). But she joined the office of the DPC from the civil service where she had held a senior role in the area of economic migration policy in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>She could not have known that a perfect storm lay ahead. Just months before she took up the position, the Snowden leaks had been published and their contents prompted Max Schrems, the student who had written to the Portarlington office back in 2011, to make his 23rd complaint to the Irish data protection office, which awaited her arrival.</p><p>The Austrian claimed there was evidence his personal data was made available to US government authorities under various known and unknown legal provisions and spy programmes, in breach of his rights under EU law. The DPC had acquired the responsibility for regulating all the tech companies that had nominated their Dublin offices as \u201cdata controllers\u201d.</p><p>The DPC had decided to discard Schrems\u2019s complaint which it believed fell under the category of \u201cfrivolous and vexatious\u201d because such data transfers were covered by the so-called \u201csafe harbour\u201d agreement \u2013 a set of principles stating that data of EU citizens would be looked after just as well by the US.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t reckoned with the determination of Schrems, who took the case all the way to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Although the initial decision was made under her predecessor, Dixon had to pick up the baton. In October 2015, the Luxembourg court deemed that the \u201csafe harbour\u201d agreement was invalid and essentially a fig leaf behind which data protection agencies could hide when EU citizens worried that their privacy was being infringed.</p><p>The decision had far-reaching consequences for privacy law in Europe and raised questions about the initial decision to discard the complaint.</p><p>Dixon\u2019s counterpart in Germany, where data protection had always been a far bigger public policy issue than in Ireland, criticised her for placing \u201cblind trust\u201d in Facebook\u2019s promises about how it processed data, and said her office had helped the US tech giants based in Dublin to maintain the \u201cillusion\u201d of a safe harbour for data.</p><p>The ruling also prompted the Financial Times to describe her office as \u201can underfunded regulator based in a small rural town without a presence in Dublin where many Silicon Valley companies, including Google, have their European headquarters\u201d.</p><p>In the face of such criticism, Dixon went about making the office fit for the task at hand. She first brought its staff complement from 26 up to 90, a figure that is expected to reach 135 this year. Its allocation of money from central government funds has almost quadrupled since her arrival, from \u20ac4.7 million to \u20ac11.7 million this year. According to a spokesperson, she has led a \u201cwidely acknowledged transformation of the Irish DPC\u201d.</p><p>The European Court ruling also told us something about the posture of the office and its own understanding of its role, which was narrow and technical rather than seeing itself as an independent guarantor of fundamental rights.</p><p>While Dixon was building up her capability and resources, another case was brewing on the domestic front, and its protagonists believe it pointed to a need for her to be more proactive in taking on state agencies. In September 2014, developers John and Michael O\u2019Flynn made a request to Nama under the Data Protection Acts seeking the personal information that the agency held on them. The data should have been supplied to them within 40 days of their complaint, but to this day they are still waiting.</p><p>The data included 2,000 pages of documents containing company and personal details about the brothers which Nama got when it took over the O\u2019Flynn Construction Group\u2019s \u20ac1.8 billion bank debt in 2010. After a long engagement process with the DPC, the O\u2019Flynns lost patience and applied to the High Court to compel Dixon to discharge what they said was her mandatory duty in relation to their complaint.</p><p>They said the delay of two-and-a-half years was \u201cinordinate and inexcusable\u201d. They sought a declaration that Dixon had failed to discharge her duties under the Data Protection Act, failed to investigate their complaint in a timely fashion \u2013 in breach of their rights under the act \u2013 and that this alleged failure to investigate and determine their complaint in a timely manner was a breach of their human rights under the European convention.</p><p>The O\u2019Flynns later settled the case which required Dixon to rule on their complaint. Her decision was issued at the end of February and it was hard-hitting. While the strength of her decision was lauded, it also raised questions about why there was a delay in the first place.</p><p>Dixon\u2019s cautious and sometimes hesitant approach was also on display last week as she tentatively broached the subject of an alleged data breach involving the transfer of the personal information of journalists, and two barristers, by INM. She didn\u2019t mention the elephant in the room when she took to the podium of an event \u2013 organised by INM \u2013 at the height of the controversy last Monday. But she briefly touched on the topic when she was asked about it by journalists outside the event at the RDS.</p><p>She said while she will investigate the matter, there was no point in rushing an investigation into what happened. \u201cThe worst thing to do is to start an investigation before you have a clear idea of what you are looking at,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are awaiting further information from INM in order to scope out what the investigation will cover. At this stage, I can\u2019t give a precise timeframe in terms of when we will actually start it.\u201d</p><p>While her attendance at the event raised some eyebrows, some other people accepted it as something she could not easily get out of without appearing to prejudice the outcome of her investigation. Asked whether there was a conflict of interest, she said: \u201cNone whatsoever!\u201d, adding that she had accepted the invitation a number of months ago.</p><p>It was revealed in this newspaper last week that INM did not tell her about the full extent of the trawl of emails, or that personal data may have been at risk, when it notified her office of a potential data breach last August. At the time, her office made a quick decision that no data breach had occurred.</p><p>A further notification by INM in recent weeks provided \u201csignificant additional detail which has given rise to a scoping exercise on the part of this office in order to commence a targeted investigation\u201d. She is likely to face questions on the topic when she appears before the Oireachtas communications committee on Tuesday.</p><p>It may be prudent of her to allow the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) to do the heavy lifting in investigating the issue. But the different approach of the two offices, and the different treatment of those offices by INM, is a good indication of how the effectiveness and powers of the two corporate regulators compare . To some extent, Dixon is quite restricted because of her inability to impose fines on companies that do not comply with data regulations \u2013 that is to change with new laws to be passed in the D\u00e1il later this month.</p><p>For all of this, Dixon\u2019s biggest challenge is yet to come with the new, Europe-wide rules on data protection coming in next month. Owing to their presence in Dublin, she will oversee the application of the laws to companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, making her one of the world\u2019s most powerful regulators.</p><p>The rules will give her the ability to fine companies as much as four per cent of their global turnover if they do not comply and she has insisted she will not shirk the task at hand, warning that she will use \u201cthe full toolkit available\u201d to her.</p><p>These new powers will give her the opportunity to finally dispel the notion that Ireland has been a soft touch when it comes to data protection (and that this is one of the reasons tech companies chose to base themselves here) and to prove that she can be more proactive in taking on powerful organisations than her detractors would give her credit for.</p><p>Those who work closely with her say she is up to the task, having often impressed at international events. They say her \u201copenness\u201d to tech companies that she is responsible for overseeing sets her apart from other regulators.</p><p>\u201cHer preference is to engage in dialogue with companies, rather than saying: I want to catch you out,\u201d said one person closely involved in policy development at a European level. \u201cBut she is not afraid to be critical when necessary,\u201d they said, pointing to the fact that she had carried out two data protection audits on the Facebook offices in Dublin.</p><p>While the government plans to appoint two more commissioners to the role, some believe the DPC should be beefed up to the level of comparable organisations such as the Financial Regulator given the scale of the supervisory role it will have to undertake, the cross-border nature of the regulation and growing awareness around data rights.</p><p>While Dixon has come under criticism for not being aggressive enough in taking on complex cases, there is some sympathy for her given that she came into the role at a time of massive organisational change and managed to live up to the challenge and get her office up and running. Now she will have to face the even bigger change that\u2019s taking place in the world.

As more than 50 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance, billionaires became$637 billion richer. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg's wealth has ballooned59 percent. Amazon's Jeff Bezos's,39 percent. Walmart's Walton family has added$25 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big drug company CEOs and their major investors are doing nicely, too. Since the start of the pandemic, Big Pharma has raised prices on over250prescription drugs,61of which are being used to treat Covid-19. </p><p>Apologists say this is the \"free market\" responding to supply and demand \u2013 the barons of Big Tech, online retailing, and Big Pharma merely providing what consumers desperately need during the pandemic. </p><p>But the market also operates under laws that ban profiteering, price gouging, and monopolizing, and that tax excess profits in wartime. Where did they go?</p><p>The Trump administration hasn't enforced them.</p><p>Trump is also ignoring laws that ban trades on insider information. The White House is distributing billions in subsidies and loans to select corporations \u2013 enabling CEOs and boards to load up on stocks and stock options just before deals are announced, then rake in fat profits after stock prices surge.</p><p>Insiders from at least 11 companies have sold shares worth over $1 billion after such announcements, according to ananalysisby theNew York Times.</p><p>In late June, a San Francisco company called Vaxart announced that the Trump administration had selected it to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Presto. The value of stock options distributed to company insiders just weeks before increasedsix-fold. Stock options held by Vaxart's CEO went from$4.3 million to more than $28 million.</p><p>Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., has never brought a vaccine to market, but company insiders have sold some $248 million of shares \u2013 most of them after the companywas selected in Aprilto receive Trump funding. (Moderna plans to sell its vaccine for profit although taxpayers have footed its research and development.)</p><p>The most blatant involves the venerable old camera and film maker, Kodak. On July 28, Trump announced a$765 million dealwith the firm to bring drug production back to the United States. He called it \"one of the most important deals in the history of the U.S. pharmaceutical industries,\" even though Kodak isn't even a pharmaceutical company.</p><p>Before the announcement, Kodak had handed its board of directors240,000stock options, and just the day before had given its CEO1.75 million stock options. After Trump's announcement, Kodak shares shot up more than2,757 percent. Suddenly, the board's stock options were worth about $4 million, and the CEO's, about$50 million.</p><p>Is this sort of insider trading against the law? You bet. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the deal, now temporarily on hold.</p><p>But the SEC's co-director of enforcement, Steven Peikin, who had been investigating several of the deals involving the White House and corporate insiders \u2013 including Kodak \u2013 has resigned, without explanation. Another in the lengthening list of independent regulators and inspectors general forced out by Trump?</p><p>This much is clear: Trump and his Republican enablers won't provide $600 per week to tens of millions of Americans who need the money to survive the pandemic, because Trump and the GOP believe the money undermines incentives to work.</p><p>Yet Trump has no problem letting billionaires illegally profit off the pandemic. He thinks that as long as they buoy the stock market, they're helping the American economy.</p><p>That's pure rubbish. The stock market is not America. The richest1 percent of Americans own halfthe value of all shares of stock held by American households. The richest10 percent owns 92 percent. For years now, stock prices have risen largely becauseprofits have been siphoned from the wagesof ordinary workers.</p><p>In the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, stock prices are almost back to where they were before the pandemic began. Big corporations and major investors are doing fine. Billionaires are doing better than ever. But most Americans are sinking fast.</p><p>This isn't just unfair. Much of it is illegal.</p><p>The article Profiteering Off The Pandemic - OpEd appeared first on Eurasia Review.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-182208123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M3-6921-F11P-X1MK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"710\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002LAF</classCode><className>WAL-MART STORES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS452311 WAREHOUSE CLUBS &amp;

Thanks for joining  us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Tuesday, June 20th.  Here are your top  stories 6:00 A.M. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> President Trump takes aim at North Korea after Otto Warmbier dies days  after returning to the United States with severe brain damage.  The company  that took into the country now saying it will no longer take Americans  there.  It says a tragedy like this should never be repeated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, a push for reform this morning.  \"The Wall  Street Journal\" reporting a health care vote will take place next week.   The administration holding firm that tax reform will also get done this  year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF TREASURY:  I have no higher priority than  having tax reform done this year.  We're working every day.  We're working  with the house and the senate.  We're committed to get this done.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Plus, a contentious moment between Senators Mitch McConnell and  Chuck Schumer coming up.</p><p> It is technically not even summer.  But the southwest is facing a dangerous  heat wave this morning.  Temperatures already near triple digits today.  We  will give you the latest.</p><p> And the heat taking a toll.  American Airlines has cancelled more than a  dozen flights.  More than 1,000 needed medical attention at the Electric  Daisy Concert in Las Vegas.</p><p> Markets look like this this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a  mixed opening for the broader averages.  Fractionally better on the  session.  The Dow and the S&amp;P coming up of a record close yesterday.   Looking to extend that today with fractional moves in the upside.  Dow  Industrial sets to open up about 10 points.  Ditto for the NASDAQ.</p><p> In Europe, the indices look like this.  Take a look.  European indices  higher across the board with the CAC quarante in Paris, best performer up  about a third of a percent.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower, meanwhile.  Take a look.  As  you see the best performer was the Nikkei in Japan that was up one percent.   The others down fractionally.</p><p> Tom Brady wants to play an NFL game outside of the U.S.  We will reveal  where he says is his dream country to play one day.  All those stories  coming up this morning.</p><p> And joining me to talk about it, financial analyst Heather Zumarraga is  with us.  Wall Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James  Freeman is with us.  And the London Center for Policy Research, Vice  President Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer is here.  Great to see you.</p><p> TONY SHAFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Great seeing you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  Good morning.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's on top this morning, James?  What do you think of the  big stories?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, at long last, patients, doctors, taxpayers may finally see  the beginning of the end of ObamaCare.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  They were looking for a vote next week.  So  we'll see that.  We will talk about all of that this morning.</p><p> Coming up joining the conversation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is with  us today.  Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn is with us today.  Fox  News Military analyst, Jack Keane is here.  Harvard law professor emeritus  Alan Dershowitz is here.  And former Raegan campaign advisor, Ed Rollins is  here as well.  You don't want to miss moments of it.  So just stay with us  throughout the show.</p><p> We kick it off this hour right now with Otto Warmbier.  The American  student imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months and sent back to the United  States in a persistent vegetative state last week, died yesterday.  He died  at the tender age of 22 years old.  Doctors treating the University of  Virginia student said late last week that Warmbier had extensive loss of  brain tissue and he was in the state of unresponsive wakefulness.</p><p> Warmbier had been sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea for  allegedly stealing a propaganda poster during an organized tour to the  isolated country.  The Chinese company behind Young Pioneer Tours, the tour  company that sent him there now says it will stop taking U.S. citizens to  North Korea.</p><p> President Trump weighed in on the sad news from the White House.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Otto Warmbier has just  passed away.  He spent a year and a half in North Korea.  A lot of bad  things happened.  But at least we got him home to be with his parents where  they were so happy to see him, even though he was in very tough condition.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Warmbier's parents Fred and Cindy put the blame squarely at  North Korea writing in a statement, \"Unfortunately the awful torturous  mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensure that  no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today.</p><p> Tony, your take on these developments.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, look, there's no doubt in my mind he was tortured.  Let's  be very clear what happened here.  And I've already said another interviews  I think there needs to be some level of retaliation.  I'll just be that  direct about it.  My son is 23.  I cannot imagine the pain these parents  are going through.  This is truly tragic.</p><p> My understanding from talking to the experts, he was tortured not so much  the way where you'd be pulling fingernails out with tools, but by repeated  drugging, sodium pentothal.  The idea was they were trying to figure out if  he was a CIA spy or not.  He wasn't.  And the continued and repeated  exposure over that year to these drugs is what caused the consistent and  persistent damage of the entire brain.  So it was essentially the use of  these drugs over and over again which caused the brain damage.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, there were some reports that he went into the vegetative  state just recently, a couple of weeks ago.  So, was that -- </p><p> SHAFER:  I don't buy that.  I think this -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The whole time you think he was just drugged?</p><p> SHAFFER:  I think they started during his confinement and did it over and  over.  And I think of the reasons they released him --I mean no doubt,  President Trump saw this and started dealing with it early on.  But no  doubt they kind of like saw that some things are going to go tragically  wrong.  We better get this guy out of here, anyway.  So let's serve their  purpose to get him out.</p><p> The parents got their boy back, their son back.  But again, Maria, it does  not change the fact that he was tortured.  This is something that we should  not stand for.  And I believe that President Trump recognizes how hideous  this is and something requires a response.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And what kind of response do you expect? Should be  warranted.</p><p> SHAFFER:  We in the Cold War, we had organizations which focused on is what  they called dirty tricks in the old days.  Look, we need to rethink our  foreign policy.  We cannot simply sit back and let dictators, horrible  people like Kim Jong-un do these things and think they can get away with  it.  There's been no push back.  This is a remote analogy.  But we just  shut down a certain aircraft.  We haven't shut down an aircraft since 1999.    So I think it's time we re-insinuate ourselves in foreign policy in a way  that the -- those bad guys like Un understand there's going to be  consequences for bad behavior.  There's been no bad consequences for  decades.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Otto's parents said that.  Look, President Obama told us to  be quite.  President Trump took our son home.  James, how do you see it?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, this is one of the last to the old style dictatorships.   This is what communists, dictatorships so.  I think it was probably  surprising to a lot of people over the last year following this news that  you actually tend to travel to North Korea.  To this point, the state  department has a -- had a strong warning and I think maybe you'd expect  from now it would be something more like a -- like a band -- I mean,  obviously they don't treat visitors any better than they treat their own  people.  And this -- for anyone who didn't realize that, yes, this is a  wake up call.</p><p> HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  But so maybe we should it be there  though.  There are some -- to some extent, we shouldn't be going to these  places.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But this was a tour company from China, Heather.  I mean, if  you've got a tour company, you may be thinking that you're OK and that  you're with a safe group.</p><p> Let's switch gears to the standoff in the senate right now.  Because this  is also a piece of important business today.  Republicans are aiming for a  vote on the health care bill next week.  A full week ahead of the July 4th  recess since the democrats have begun using parliamentary maneuvers to slow  down business in the chamber though to protest any bill including a series  of back to back speeches on the floor yesterday.</p><p> In one exchange, minority leader Chuck Schumer press his counterpart, Mitch  McConnell to commit to an open debate.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER:  When we have time more than 10  hours, since this is a complicated bill to review the bill, will it be  available to us and the public, more than 10 hours before we have to vote  for it.</p><p> SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER:  I think we'll have an ample  opportunity to read and amend the bill.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you see republicans pushing through to get this done before  July 4th, James Freeman?  And also, what's your take on this ostracism?   They're basically telling you in advance.  Look, we're going to do long  speeches.  We're going to do whatever it takes to waste time so this  doesn't get done?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  So a lot of theatrics.  I think the republicans will get it  done.  It's interesting there.   You look at Chuck Schumer saying, I want  10 hours to read bill.  Of course, if you took another clip from that  speech he was saying, as he often does that this is a terrible bill and  he's opposed to it.  So he's not -- he's not an over minded voter here  looking to consider the measure.  He doesn't need 10 hours.  He's already  against it without even having seen it because this is the Obama legacy  project, no matter how bad it's failing.  They have tied themselves to it  politically and they're going to do well of the parliamentary moves they  can do to slow it down but they can't and it'll pass.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is there any chance though that they are able to stop any  business whatsoever that the Trump administration trust to put forth?   That's the whole plan.  Let his president be a president that gets nothing  done.  Let this congress be get nothing done congress that we take the  house in '18 and we impeach him in '20?</p><p> FREEMAN:  I don't think that will work.  Because if you basically make it  impossible to do business, what they're going to do is they're going to  kill the legislative filibuster which still exists and allows them to block  things like -- any measure that can't get 60 votes.  Now, health care is  different because they're going through this recompilation process.  But  basically if they put up a big roadblock like they did with Gorsuch, it'  going to hurt their agenda because they're not going to be able to stop  anything else.  It seems a lot of republicans are going to say, enough.   We're going to filibuster.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  So then you do think a health care vote happens?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me ask you about House Speaker Paul Ryan.  He  sets to deliver his first major speech on tax reform today.  According to  the excerpts of the speech that have been released, he's expected to urge  republicans, \"We need to get his done in 2017.  We cannot let this once in  a generation moment slip.\"</p><p> Now, Heather, if we don't see tax reform, big implications from markets?</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, the markets have been up hitting all-time highs.  Yet  again, I think Futures are up today.  We'll see if the Dow can hit new  highs today.  It's tax reform.  It's health care.  That's what it's all  about.  That's what the markets are running on right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  James, what do you want to hear from Paul Ryan today?</p><p> FREEMAN:  I'd like to hear him say that the number one priority is growing  this economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what he's going to say.  You know that.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, I'm worried that he's also going to say that this has got  to be revenue natural.  We've got to stick with the conventions of beltway  score keeping no matter how flawed they are.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And that means the border adjustment tax or higher  corporate rate or some kind of a revenue, right?</p><p> FREEMAN:  They've got to get the corporate rate into the teams if we want a  real game changer.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Tony?</p><p> SHAFFER:  Look, I think what we've seen over and over again is reluctant  facts to actually break out of what we know doesn't work.  The scoring  system, we know doesn't work, doesn't matter.  The democrats always refer  to it.  And what I don't understand why the republicans haven't gone back  and looked at the numbers that CBO did on the original estimates for  ObamaCare and look at how wildly of they were.  So it's kind of like how is  that you don't just look at what bad work they did and say throw it out  because it doesn't work.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  It's funny to hear Chuck Schumer say, well, when  you do things in the dark of night.  Excuse me, ObamaCare was done in the  dark of night.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  No.  Find out what's in the bill after we pass the bill.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Nancy Pelosi.  We have the Trump tweets to tell you about the  president is tweeting this morning.  And we want to bring you to you right  now President Trump just tweeting about the Georgia special election.   \"Democrat Jon Ossoff who wants to raise your taxes to the highest level and  is weak on crime and security doesn't even live in the district.  Karen  Handel for congress, she will fight for lower taxes, great health care,  strong security.  A hard worker who will never give up.  Vote today.</p><p> We've got more analysis on this.  The special election happening in  Georgia.  Of course it's real important.  It's the most money, right?  In  the congressional election.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Ossoff has raised more than 23 million bucks.  He's got about  five times the money that Karen Handel has.  He's raising his money  basically outside of Georgia.  So it's going to be a question of whether  people want to -- Georgia voters want to allow the rest of the country's  liberals to use them as a vehicle to oppose the president.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Does this tell us anything, I mean, if Ossoff wins or Handel  wins, does this tell us anything about the republican party or democratic  party today do you think?  Is this going to be sort of an indicator?</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, Georgia has been one of the states that the democrats have  been trying to turn for a while.  I mean, there was during the last  election cycle, I believe, which was not founded on anything real that they  could turn this state blue and they didn't.  But I think you see over and  over again, every election, we've seen special cycle election, outside  money's been donated heavily and they've lost every time.  And I think it's  going to happen again here because the overwhelming feeling still is that I  think people want to give President Trump time to get his act together.  I  think this is a microcosm of other things.  And Georgia still I think is  more red than blue.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We'll take a short break.  We have a lot more  on the congressional race today.</p><p> But first, let's take a break.  A heat wave is striking the southwest.  The  national weather service predicting highs of 120 degrees today with some  states already having canceled flights to the region.  We're on it next.   Stay with us.  Quick break.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A brutal heat wave hitting the southwest United  States.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Maria.  OK.   Temperatures could reach 120 degrees today in parts of Arizona for the  first time in more than 20 years.  This is a record-breaking 122 that  happened back in 1990.  Also, the city of Las Vegas and southern California  bracing for what authorities are calling a public health hazard.  Death  Valley could reach temperatures as high as 124 degrees.</p><p> Airlines also watching the weather, at least -- excuse me, 20 American  Airlines flights out of Arizona have already been cancelled because those  planes can't operate over a temperature of 118.  That's according to a  statement from the airline.  It's the smaller aircraft.  Americans saying  that flight changes are going to be free of charge for passengers.</p><p> Meanwhile, one person is dead and nearly 1,000 needed medical attention on  site at the Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas.  Sixteen other people  taken to a local hospital.  According to -- still can't determine the cause  of death for 34-year-old Michael Morse.  He passed away after attending the  festival on Saturday.  The heat though could have been a factor.  The  temperature in Las Vegas reach 110 degrees.  He experienced convulsions  about 3:23 in the morning.  According to police there, a total of 340  medical calls were handled on Saturday.</p><p> And you were just talking about this, Maria.  Over 140,000 ballots have  already been cast in the Georgia congressional race for democrat John  Ossoff is looking to defeat Karen Handel.  Ossoff raising, a record setting  15 million.  President Trump tweeting on the election just saying this, big  day tomorrow in Georgia and South Carolina.  ObamaCare is dead.  Dems wants  to raise taxes big.  They can only obstruct.  No ideas vote \"R.\"  And this  coming as a new ad pack - ad paid for by PAC supporting Handel is receiving  backlash for showing images of House Majority Whip Scalise after he was  shot in a baseball game last week.  The spokesperson for Handel condemning  that act saying, \"For any group to use the shootings this week for  political or personal benefit is shameful.  This group should be ashamed.\"</p><p> Meanwhile, South Carolina also holding elections.  Democrat Archie Parnell  faces republican Paul Norman to replace Mick Mulvaney.  And of course the  president tapped to be budget director.  That election is going to test if  the republican candidate can gain support from largely African-American  districts, Maria.  So a lot going on politically today.  Those were your  headlines.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl.  Thanks so much.  Coming up next, record  closing for the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 yesterday.  Technology stops once again  rebounding and leading this market high.  We're taking a closer look at  markets and the best performers, next.</p><p> Then play a game, win a job.  Jaguar L, Land Rover's new technique for  recruiting engineers straight ahead.  Stay with us right here \"Mornings  with Maria.\"  After this.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Stocks looking to extend yesterday's record run.   The gains driven by the technology sector yesterday.  Of course, tech has  been down and now it looks like it's stabilizing a bit in recent weeks.</p><p> Joining us right now is GFI Group chief macro strategist, John Spallanzani.   John good to see you.</p><p> JOHN SPALLANZANI, CHIEF MACRO STRATEGIST, GFI GROUP:  Good seeing you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's going on in markets right now?  Is money coming back  into technology after the Amazon announcement of the Whole Foods?</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  I think we saw some rotation out of tech and into some of the  big financial names.  Hopefully that they're expecting some tax relief.   Obviously a steeper occur because the Fed hike rates.  I think that we see  small caps catching a bit again.  Those have been flat for a while, for six  months.  We've been consolidating all those stocks that run up after the  election kind of went sideways and now we're starting to see some rotations  which is healthy in the market.</p><p> The NASDAQ is up 16 percent.  The S&amp;P is almost up 10 percent now.  So we  saw a lot of momentum into, again, the dime and so there was a bit  divergence between tech last week was down like 150 basis points.  But yet,  the diamonds were up 180 basis points.  So those are three percent swing in  one week where guys obviously rotating out of tech and then for someone  bigger names.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then bigger names and you say diamond.  Bigger names -- </p><p> SPALLANZANI:  The Dow stocks and also the S&amp;P stocks.  People are expecting  the effective tax rates and corporations to go down.  So those corporations  with the highest effective tax rates right now are being targeted because  they're going to get the biggest boost if we do get some taxes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  targeted to buy.  So Wall Street still believes in tax reform  in '17 is what you're saying?</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  I think the media is more interested in '17 and '18.  I think  right now we're just worried about the message.  But the message is good  right now.  And I think that whether it's '17 or '18, there's other good  things.  Earnings are obviously very good.  I don't think -- we didn't see  -- this rally is not based on multiple expansions.  It's really based on  earnings so far.</p><p> So if you look at stock multiples compared to credit and bonds, stocks are  still cheap relative to the other two.  So, where else are you going to put  your money?</p><p> FREEMAN:  OK.  But they are still expensive relative to their earnings  historically -- that's a hard metric to pin down.  Because -- OK.  Let's  say they're not relative to their earnings.  Here's on the upper level.   Here's where I'm wondering is how much of this is company's doing well, how  much is the optimism surrounding Trump and reform and how much is still  very loose monetary policy around the world?  We're -- in the U.S. kind of  taking baby steps toward going back to normal.  But in central banks, they  printed a lot of money.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Last week, even though we raised, a lot of people are point out  that the central banks around the world, including Europe and Japan are  still easing at a rate of $1 trillion, so global central banks are still  easing although we're increasing rates in the U.S.</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  Yes.  There's still a lot of capital around.  I think the  other reason why our yield curve is so flat because, again, treasuries are  tier one capital that everybody has not the balance sheets.  There's no  alternative to treasuries, really.  So, do you want to invest in goes to 27  basis points?  Which is like last night.  What do you want it by treasury  220?  That's the trade.  So there's not a lot of alternatives to what you  have going on.  So that's another thing that's keeping rates down that's  helping.</p><p> Just last night, just this morning, Carney said, I'm not going to tight in  -- the Bank of England is not going to tie because he fears that we have  still on present talks, want to go slow.  Les Evans.  Last night again that  listen, we're not going to tight in -- we might not tight in September,  maybe December because inflation is still undershooting the Feds.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  So the Fed is still a major factor here, is what you're  saying.  And Easy money around the world.</p><p> Let me ask you, what would you do right now?  Do you want to put money into  this market here knowing that maybe health care reform gets done next week?   I mean, the health care bill rather, the vote.  And then tax reform later  in the year.  And then what about Europe?</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  I think steady as she goes.  I mean, it's evitable for quite  a long time.  I still think that we're at 2,500 now.  Have a few bets,  personal bets to - we might hit 2,700 by the end of the year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  On the S&amp;P 500.</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  In the S&amp;P 500.  Yup.  That's a big -- it's a big move from  here.  But it's still June and there's so much left that we could do and  especially if the Fed does not hike in September, there's not a lot of  resistance above.</p><p> I think right now, when I'm watching, is the unemployment rate next in July  rate.  If we start to see that tick higher then I would get more concerned.   Right now, unemployment is obviously very low.  And also wages are kind of  not so hot.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No.  Stagnant.</p><p> SHAFFER:  I have a quick question on Brexit.  We had one year anniversary  couple days ago.  They're starting to make their negotiations.  How do you  see your stocks worth rolling as a negotiation starts?</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  European stocks have been actually performing better than --  that's my marker right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  With the easy money there, yes.</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  Yes, the easy money.  But I think that May has got problems,  right?  So we see that the more problems May has, the higher the market  goes in Europe, right?  So that meeting that Brexit is not going to be a  hard Brexit. So I think new markets going to discounting that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Oil price is down.  Okay.</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  Who would have thought that oil via 44 and the stocks be at  2,500.  So oil is a technology driven story, not a supply story and not a  recessionary story.  That's a huge positive oil being a 44.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Okay.  A technology story?</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  Fracking and the ability for the U.S. to be one of the  biggest exporters in the world and that's really Trump's</p><p> BARTIROMO:  John, great to see you.  Thank you so much.  John Spallanzani  joining us there.</p><p> Coming up, police reportedly identified the man suspected of plowing his  van into a crowded London.  47-year-old, Darren Osborne is arrested by  authorities on suspicion of terrorist offences.</p><p> And then technology giants headed to Washington.  I'll speak with Commerce  Secretary Wilbur Ross about President Trump's meeting yesterday with  Silicon Valley CEOs.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST:  Welcome  back, good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, June 20th.  Your top stories right now  6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Busy week at the White House.  President Trump set to meet with the  President of Ukraine this afternoon.  This comes after the President hosted  the biggest names in technology at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue yesterday.  Big  names including the CEOs of Apple among others stressing the importance of  improving the government's technology infrastructure.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The U.S. should have the most modern government in the  world, and today, it doesn't.  And it's great to see the effort that Jared  is putting.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The United States needs to in every way at every level  to be working on machine learning and artificial intelligence, and that can  be used in every part of government.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'll break down the meeting with Commerce Secretary Wilbur  Ross, coming up.  He attended that meeting.  We'll talk about the  conversation at the table, straight ahead.</p><p> Jack Ma, meanwhile, making a big push in the United States.  The Alibaba  founder is in Detroit today in an effort to make good on a promise to  create jobs in America.  Details on his plan to impress entrepreneurs and  President Trump.</p><p> Not to be outdone, Jaguar is creating jobs of its own.  The automaker  teaming up with the band Gorillaz to recruit 5,000 new employees.  The  major impact it could have on its autonomous vehicle plans.  </p><p> The browns want you to pay a little more green this holiday season.  The  delivery fee you could end up facing from UPS this Christmas.  Markets  looking higher this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a gain at  the opening of trading on the heels of a record day yesterday.  The Dow and  the S&amp;P 500 coming off of a record close yesterday.  And as you say, it's  going to be an extension of that even if it's just fractionally.  Dow  Industrials set to open about 14 points today.  In Europe, the major  averages are mostly higher.  Take a look.  The FT-100 up a fraction, the  CAC Quarante in Paris is up a third of a percent.  In the DAX Index in  Germany up a quarter of a percent.  In Asia overnight, stocks closed mostly  lower with the Exception of Japan.  The Hang Seng, the Shanghai, and the  KOSPI all down.  The Nikkei averaging Japan up almost one percent.  </p><p> And the GOAT takes on the Great Wall.  NFL legend, Tom Brady says his dream  is to play a game in China.  Our top story this half an hour, though, let's  kick it off here with the top names and technology meeting the President  Trump yesterday.  The White House is teaming up with industry leaders to  modernize the government's technology infrastructure, and strengthen cyber  security.  The President spoke yesterday about why he's turning to the tech  titans to help achieve those goals. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT:  The businesses represented here  today employed hundreds of thousands of American workers.  Your innovation  has shaped the modern world and created millions of jobs.  America should  be the global leader in government technology just as we are in every other  aspect, and we are going to start our big edge again in technology.  It's  such an important industry.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.   Secretary Ross, it's always a pleasure.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE.  Good to see you again,  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, the President is estimating that this initiative could save  the U.S. a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.  How would it work,  take us behind the meeting and what was most important yesterday?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, these factors that the government not just the federal but  also state and local government generally has not spent very much on  upgrading their technology.  A lot of archaic equipment that's been used,  lot of equipment where you can barely get proper support anywhere.   And  there are various estimates that the government may be spending, something  like $90 billion a year on maintaining systems that fundamentally are  obsoleted by modern standards.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are these companies ready and willing to help in this effort?   There were 18 CEOs there yesterday.  What kind of a sense did you get from  companies of what they will actually do to achieve that goal?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, the real specifics of the plan haven't been worked out  (INAUDIBLE) but they all acknowledge the need.  They all acknowledge that  the -- if we thought about capital expenditure rather than maintenance,  we'd be a lot better off.  So, there's a lot of investigation as to the  extent to which we could simply reinvest in equipment, funding that  otherwise would have to go for maintenance.  It's kind of a juggling act.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I could totally see that.  And you think this will - this would  save a trillion dollars over 10 years?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, it certainly can be a very, very big number, as I've said.   There's something like 90 billion a year or more that's spent on  maintenance of the equipment and maintaining an obsolete thing.  Think  about your car.  Once your car gets to be, what, 10 years old, you start  putting in inordinate amount into its maintenance relatively to what would  be the maintenance on a vehicle.  So, one of the peculiarities of  government accounting is that a capital expenditure and in expense more or  less treated the same way from a budgetary point of view whereas the  capital expenditure has enduring value, it has a long-term asset value,  whereas the maintenance, the out of pocket expense that just comes in is  just gone.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see that the Homeland Security Secretary was there.  Wilbur,  let me ask you about security and what came around that topic.  You've got  the leaders of some of these companies that can actually have a real hand  in helping protect our data cybersecurity huge issue.  And then, of course,  there's the extremisms in terms of content online.  What was said about  those topics?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, Homeland Security and cyber security are inextricably in  linked together.  And cybersecurity is a problem everywhere.  You've seen  some of the recent hacking in (INAUDIBLE) a very, very big scale.  Some of  which were for commercial purposes.  Others of which appear perhaps to have  been for national security purposes.  So, I think we're going to find.  The  defenders of security, cybersecurity, keep developing new firewalls, new  ways to keep the bad people out.  And yet, there's a great deal of  ingenuity on the part of the hackers to figure out new ways to intrude and  new ways to be disruptive.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, they sure are.  Let's talk trade, Secretary.  I enjoyed  that piece with you and the Journal the other day in terms of the  conservation on trade.  We're all trying to figure out when we'll see tax  reform?  It's so important for the economy, moving the needle on growth.   And tit's so important, of course, for the markets as well.  Are you  expecting that we will see some kind of attacks at the border?  I mean,  maybe it's not a border adjustment tax because we know that the President  is not in favor of that.  But maybe it's a reciprocal tax or some kind of   other tracks at the border in terms of trade with our friends across the  world?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, the border-adjustable tax was not proposed particularly as a  U.S. agenda item.  The border-adjustable tax was proposed mainly to help  balance the budget.  As you know, the to get to reconciliation when there  are different bills passed by the House from the one passed by the Senate,  you need to have a certain scoring by the Congressional Budget Office,  namely over a 10-year horizon to break even.  That means that you have to  fill some holes.  And the border-adjustable tax idea was a - idea that  Chairman Brady, I believe, come out with in order to just try to fill that  hole.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you have to fill the whole, though?  I mean that's the  point.  I mean, do you - do you need to see some kind of revenue raised, or  can you do way with this whole idea of deficit neutral?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, the rules for reconciliation are fairly clear, and as I  understand them, you need to be neutral or at the tenured time horizon.   And the recon we need the reconciliation is that it's unlikely that the  House and Senate will pass exactly the same bill.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, if we - if we don't see a border adjustment tax in the tax  portion of this, in terms of trade, you're overseeing, you're expecting any  other kind of tax, like a reciprocal tax, something at the border.</p><p> ROSS:  Well, remember, the U.S. budget until well into the 20th century.   Main component had been tariffs.  So, tariffs are nothing new to the  financing of the U.S. government, but we've long past that with the advent  of personal income tax and corporate tax, so now border adjustable or some  such thing is simply one way to fill up a portion of a hole.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll see - we'll see if it ends up there.  I know  that you'll be taking the lead on renegotiating the North America Free  Trade Agreement, NAFTA, later this year.  And then, of course, today,  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is talking about irritants with his  counterparts from Canada and Mexico, including the dairy trade dispute with  sugar exports.  What are your priorities in terms of setting the stage for  NAFTA talks, Secretary? </p><p> ROSS:  Well, we - Ambassador Lighthizer already has made a preliminary  report to the Congress explaining the big bold letter headlines for NAFTA  renegotiation.  They'll be a much more detailed one filed middle of July  because 30 days before the August 15th date when the 90-day clock finally  ticks, where the administration is required to give Congress more detail on  the objectives for NAFTA.  So, that's when there will be a fairly detail  exposition of the objective.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, the sugar issue is one thing that you've spoken about.   Is there's an overriding issue that's problematic with the current form?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, the sugar deal has been resolved.  We reached the agreement  with the Mexican government and with the U.S. sugar industry.  We filed it  some days ago.  It's not out for public commentary but doesn't require  congressional vote and since the key parties to the original trade case now  are finally all on board with the solution, I don't think they'll be that  much controversy about it. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And is there another priority that you want to make sure to  tackle as a result of your be getting this?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, what would be a good thing would be if we could get rid of  some of the other issues with Canada, for example, the softwood lumber and  potentially the dairy management issue that Secretary Perdue was talking  about.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see.  In terms of -- Secretary, the new trade deals actually  moving the needle on growth, what are your expectations?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, the growth plans of the administration have several components  to them.  Trade is certainly one but tax reform, regulatory reform,  unleashing the energy that we have in the ground and infrastructure are all  also essential ingredients to getting the Trump program for three percent  growth.  So, we need all of those pieces to get to the objective.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We are watching that in terms of these pieces  coming together.  Secretary Ross, do you think that when we see all of  these issues whether it be your renegotiating of NAFTA, you know, the tax  reform, the health care bill, do you think these things will get done this  year, or are you expecting - are you looking over the next three years?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, the NAFTA has a fairly natural time horizon in that - think  about next year, the trade promotion authority which is an essential  ingredient to our being able to negotiate trade treaties, that expires July  of 2018.  There's also the Mexican Presidential election in July 2018 and  then in the fall of '18, you have the mid-term congressional elections  here.  So as you move well into next year, the political calendar will  become very complicated in terms of any big transaction like a NAFTA  renegotiation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Sure.  Wilbur Ross, good to see you.  Thank you so  much.</p><p> ROSS:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Secretary Wilbur Ross joining us.  We will be right back</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are looking higher today.  Take a look,  Futures indicating a gain of about 12 points on the Dow Industrials at the  open this morning, 12 on the NASDAQ as well, after the S&amp;P and the - and  the Dow Industrials, rather, both hit record highs yesterday.  A couple of  names on the move this morning, more job cuts coming to general motors.   The automaker is set to layoff nearly 1,000 workers to its sedan plant in  Kansas City, Kansas.  GM notified the workers of plans to eliminate a third  shift at the plant late last week.</p><p> We're watching shares of Apple this morning.  The company is shaking up  subscription options for its Apple music streaming service, TechCrunch is  reporting users now have the option to pay $99 for 12-month subscription,  works out so just over $8 a month.  Monthly individual plans currently cost  $9.99.  </p><p> Authorities have identified and arrested the man suspected of mowing down a  crowd at a London mosque earlier Monday.  Cheryl Casone with the details.   Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, that's right, Maria.   So, the victims were leaving Ramadan prayers at the time of the attack.   The suspect identified as 47-year-old, Darren Osborne of Cardiff Wales.   Osborne was arrested on suspicion of terror offenses.  At least 1 person  was killed, 10 others injured in that assault which authorities are  treating as a terrorist attack.  And investigators in France say that the  man suspected of trying to attack security forces on the Champs-Elysees in  Paris, Monday afternoon has been flagged by investigators earlier for  extremism.  The man ran this car into a police van and afterward,  authorities found a rifle and explosives in that vehicle.  That suspect  died.</p><p> Well, another headlines this morning.  Jaguar Land Rover is hiring and  they're making the application process pretty interesting.  They (AUDIO  GAP) 5,000 software engineers, electronic experts and others, but instead  of using job fairs and ads to attract the applicants, potential employees  are asked to assemble a Jaguar sports car then tackle a series of code- breaking puzzles.  They teamed up with the app, Gorillaz.  We should say in  2011, Marriott asked applicants to manage a virtual hotel so it's not  really a new idea but interesting.  </p><p> And get ready to pay more for shipping this Christmas.  UPS says it's going  to add a holiday surcharge per package as much as 97 cents per package.   UPS wants to recoup some money for increased staffing, extra planes and  vehicles added during the holiday season but this could be tough for  retailers, Maria.  Remember, they're promising free ground shipping, a lot  of them.  So here's the question, do you charge your customers more or do  you eat the surcharge? We'll see what they decide.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But first of all, I'm a little uncomfortable talking about  Christmas right now.  We're having - </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- summertime, but OK.  I will take your bait, Cheryl.  In  terms of this higher cost around holidays, guys, big deal?</p><p> LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Look, I think I  would -- if I were the folks selling the stuff, I would go eat the cost.  I  think it --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Eat it?</p><p> SHAFFER:  Yes.  I mean, Amazon is doing, I think, pretty well with its  Prime, and I look at it, and I don't know how they can afford to send me  stuff in two days sometimes.  I know they have preset stuff, but it's, you  know, I don't know.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND THE WALL STREET JOURNAL  ASSISTANT  EDITOR:  Surge pricing.  You know, people whine about it with Uber, but I  guess it's catching on on other places.  It seems like you have a lot of  highly-motivated buyers at that time of year so I would think they'd  probably be willing to eat the cost if being guaranteed December 24th  delivery.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But it also depends on what we're going to hear in the tax  package, right?  If they're going to be paying a border adjustment tax -</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is really going to hurt the retailers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They may not want to eat anything.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Remember, though, your corporate rate comes down.  It's covering  all goods.  It's just a shifting, right?  I mean, I understand they've  going to do some work on selling the border adjustment tax but you're  talking about a much lower rate.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll talk about this.</p><p> Coming up, will the NFL head to China.  New England Patriots quarterback  says his dream is to play a game in the East Asian nation, back in a  minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, the NBA Finals just ended a week ago but several  teams are already looking to next season.  Jared Max with the story, now.   Jared, good morning.</p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SPORTSCASTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  The  NBA's next crop of talent will be picked Thursday.  NBA Draft at Barkley  Center in Brooklyn, New York, for the second year in a row, the first pick  belongs to the Philadelphia 76ers, who yesterday, finalized to trade with  the Boston Celtics to acquire the first selection and the right to pick 19- year-old point guard Markelle Fultz out of the University of Washington.   Fultz worked out for the 6ers yesterday hours before the team completed its  trade with Boston to get the number one overall pick a second straight  season.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BRYAN COLANGELO, PHILADELPHIA 76ERS PRESIDENT:  There's a history of draft  picks that you can't study with a deep dive and no one understand that the  odds are in your favor at number one more so than in any other position in  the draft that player may - the player chosen may end up being a franchise- level player.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MAX:  To land the number one overall selection, 6ers G.M. and President of  basketball operations, Bryan Colangelo also parted ways with a second first  round pick to Boston that allowed to be next year or 2019.  So, the draft  order, it's Philadelphia first followed by the L.A. Lakers, then the Boston  Celtics, the Phoenix Suns, fourth, as Sacramento Kings get the fifth  selection, Thursday.  In the 12 1/2 years that Dan Gilbert has owned the  Cleveland Cavaliers, no general manager has received a contract extension,  not one.  David Griffin, no different.  Unable to reach agreement on a new  deal, Griffin mutually agreed to part ways with the Cavaliers.  Yesterday,  after three seasons on the job, three trips to the NBA Finals, one  championship.  Griffin said it's not the right fit for him anymore and  Cleveland.  </p><p> LeBron James tweeted support.  He says, \"If no one appreciated you, Griff,  I did.  And hopefully, all the people of Cleveland!  Thanks for what you  did for the team for three years!  We got us one.</p><p> As we told yesterday, the Cavs are set to be pursuing a trade that could  land them point guard Paul George from the Indiana Pacers.  And the Cavs  are also reportedly working on a possible multi-team trade to get Jimmy  Butler from the Chicago Bulls.  But such a trade would likely mean parting  ways with a star like Kevin Love.  </p><p> What a superstar quarterback Tom Brady doing these days?  Oh, just hanging  out in the Great Wall of China.  The Patriot Super Bowl-winning quarterback  spent Father's Day throwing a football to his son at the Great Wall.  The  Brady bunch in China is part of a promotional tour for his Under Armour  TB12 Recovery Sleepwear.  Brady said that it is his dream to play an NFL  game in China.  Victory for the Washington Red Skins and freedom of speech.   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled yesterday that a 71-year-old trademark law  that bars offensive language is an infringement of rights to free speech.   This came from a case involving an Asian-American rock band that fought the  trademark.  Its name, The Slants.  Now, yesterday's case figures to serve  as legal precedent for the Red Skins to be able to keep their name.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I was surprised at that and happy to see that.  Jared,  great stuff.  Thank you so much, Jared Max.  Still to come, a new twist for  check fillet.  The company unveiling its gluten-free bun next hour on  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  What does tell us?

We've got the latest.</p><p> And a massive cell phone outage across the country -- the details on what  caused it coming up.</p><p>Twitter getting some star power in a new ad -- Grammy winner Chance the  Rapper takes role highlighting how users can interact with their favorite  celebrities on the2 social media service.</p><p> Plus how color affects home sales -- the new details on which pain colors  are best and worst when trying to sell your home.</p><p> Futures showing the markets will open higher this morning.  We are  expecting that the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 extend the record-setting  performance yesterday.  Both are coming off a record close yesterday.  And  as you see there are gains to be had.</p><p>Dow Industrials expected to be up about 10 points this morning.  This is  fractional, of course, and anything can change in the next two hours.</p><p> In Europe the major averages are mostly higher this morning.  The indices  look good although well off of highs of the morning.  In fact, the CAC 40  is now up about a quarter of a percent.  They have given up gains.</p><p> And I believe that stocks are giving up some gains this morning because oil  prices are worsening.  Oil prices are down about 2 percent.  Take a look at  oil sliding and as oil has worsened this morning that has certainly taken a  bite out of some of the gains in equities.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it financial analyst Heather Zumarraga is here, \"Wall Street Journal\"  assistant editorial page editor James Freeman is here, and the London  Center for Policy Research vice president, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer  is here as well.  Good morning.</p><p> LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p> HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good morning.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Thank you for having us.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Lots to talk about today.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.  We'll see if the markets continue making all-time highs  this week.  Health care is in focus.  Paul Ryan is set to speak at noon  today to see if we can get that passed as well as tax reform and that's big  for the markets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And people will want to hear what he has to say about tax  reform.  But his plan, James Freeman, is different than what the President  has been talking about.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  That's right.  The President is just talking about that low  corporate rate.  Paul Ryan has the border adjustment plan and they need a  new name for that.  But basically what he's talking about, the economics  are good which is you want to tax consumption instead of working  investment.  That's what Ryan is trying to do.  But he's got a sales job  and if he can't persuade other members of congress this is the way to go he  should just -- </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Republicans in the Senate just don't want to hear it.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  He hasn't found a lot of takers.  So maybe he just needs to  focus on cutting rates.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, I think the bottom line is anything they do right now has  been in my judgment not positive to the President's overall message.  It  seems to me that they always find some other way to go anytime they  actually try to do something.  And this is where it's frustrating to me as  someone who just observes.  They don't seem to be actually sitting down and  talking about how to meet on achieving something, or even talking pass this  thing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The leadership does say that they are having meetings very  often, weekly about tax reform and that they are moving forward on this  despite what you're seeing in the press.  But we will see about that.   We're going to talk about that coming up.</p><p> Joining the conversation coming up now is Fox News military analyst General  Jack Keane is with us.  Harvard Law professor emeritus, defense attorney  and author of \"Electile Dysfunction: A Guide for Unaroused Voters\" Alan  Dershowitz is here -- good name for his book.  Former Reagan campaign  adviser Ed Rollins is here as well.  We've got a big program ahead so don't  miss a moment of it.  </p><p> And we kick it off this hour right now with our top story.  The  administration pushing the President's agenda with only weeks left on the  legislative calendar for the fiscal year.  Counsel to the President,  Kellyanne Conway told me yesterday reform is on the way.  Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT:  The President is forging  ahead.  He's in close contact with Leader McConnell on the health care  reform.  You know, Obamacare has been a log (inaudible) for seven years.   These sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the  House.  Now the Senate will do its work.  Leader McConnell told you that he  would like it to be by July 4th -- that's around the corner.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> CONWAY:  Tax reform later this year.  They are moving towards  infrastructure, towards border security, more of that.  The military has  gotten new funding.  So things are happening.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, calls for lawmakers to work through their month-long  August recess to get both health care and tax reform done are increasing.</p><p> Joining me right now is Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn.  Congresswoman --  good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Good to see you.  Sure.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think about the agenda?  How confident are you that  you and your colleagues can get tax reform and the health care over the  finish line this year?</p><p> BLACKBURN:  I agree that you're going to see the Senate take a vote before  July 4th.  And the people are thrilled with that.  They want to be free and  independent of the Affordable Care Act.  So I think it's very timely.</p><p> I think a final bill, a final version will be on the President's desk  before August 1st.  And that's the goal.  We should be hitting that goal  and then it is getting the push together to get tax reform over the finish  line.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There was a report yesterday that lawmakers said that they are  considering not going on the August recess in order to get the work done if  in fact it doesn't get done by then.  Are you for that?  Was that an actual  conversation piece in Congress?</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Yes.  Maria -- there are plenty of conversations about do we  stay in during August.  Many individuals want to get out there.  I agree.   Get out there, do our meetings and rotary clubs and civic clubs and chamber  coffees, visit with our constituents.  And we appreciate having that time.</p><p> But there is also the argument to be made that we have a heavy lift.  We  have a once in a lifetime opportunity to actually take care of  deregulating, lowering taxes, getting some this environment for jobs growth  to take place in place.</p><p> Your interview with Secretary Ross spoke specifically to that.  How do we  utilize new technologies?  How do we make the environment right for private  sector jobs growth to take place?  And that is less litigation, less  taxation to get that job creation.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Congresswoman -- James Freeman of the \"Wall Street Journal\".</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Yes -- James.</p><p> FREEMAN:  The one -- I have a tax question for you but real quick.  I  noticed the White House announcing last night that Michael (inaudible) is  headed to the Commerce Department.  You seem to be losing one of the big  chip staffers on Capitol Hill.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  And we are pleased with it for him.  And look forward to all  good things -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Ok. </p><p> BLACKBURN:  -- for him.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Now, as far as the tax cut, tell us about the conversation  around how big this cut can be.  Because there is some sentiment on the  Hill that you have to stick CBO rules, a 10-year budget window, all of that  boring Beltway stuff.  But what it means is it limits how much you can cut  taxes.  Some people are saying let's make it a 30-year window.  It means we  can have a big, big tax cut.  Where do you stand on that?</p><p> BLACKBURN:  I think what you're going to see Chairman Brady do is get as  much as he can.  I like the way this administration works things out and  says let's do more with less.  So if you put that into how you work tax  reductions into a reconciliation bill, what you're going to see the Speaker  and the Chairman do is to move forward with how much they can lower those  marginal rates.</p><p> They're looking right now at 35 percent, 25 percent and 10 percent.  Those  are worthy goals.  Then going to the business side, how low can you get  that corporate rate?  Can you deal with repatriation on that?</p><p> I think that the BAT tax is going to be very, very difficult in my district  with the auto manufacturing, with large retailers like Dollar General and  Tractor supply.  Kirkland's headquartered here.  That is not a popular tax.  </p><p> And I don't see -- I know the Speaker's for it -- but I don't see the  support from my constituents or from my colleagues for that tax.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Go ahead.</p><p> FREEMAN:  So maybe just cut the rate down to 15 percent as the President  has suggested.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  I think that that is something that is workable.  And James --  you know, if we do that, we're still going to be the biggest cut tax since  the Reagan '86 tax cut.  And let's take as much as we can get this year and  then let's come back next year and take some more. </p><p> Taxes are too high.  Regulation is too high.  Litigation is too prolific.   So let's get those under control so that jobs growth could take place.  I  talk to small business manufacturers that work in the Just in Time supply  chain for the auto industry every single week and they will tell you, they  will point to you specifically how that BAT tax would adversely impact them  and thereby the price of an auto.</p><p>  BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And the price of an auto I heard would go up $2,000 --  $3,000 even if you have that border adjustment tax, the BAT as you refer to  it.</p><p> So what I hear you saying, Congresswoman -- and I want to move to the  Georgia election in a second -- but you would be willing then to vote on no  new revenue then.  You just cut taxes and then deal, if you need to raise  revenue next year or the next year, you would be willing to vote with just  lowering the corporate rate as low as you can get it without raising  revenue from something at the border -- a tax at the border?  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  Yes.  I think if you lower those rates and see where that gets  you, you don't have to do everything with one stroke of the pen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The President is tweeting this morning on Georgia's special  election as voters head to the polls.  Here is what he said, Congresswoman,  \"Karen Handel for Congress.  She will fight for lower taxes, great  healthcare, strong security and a hard worker who will never give up.  Vote  today.\"  This as a new political ad is stirring up controversy.  Watch  this.  I want to get your reaction -- Congresswoman.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Sure.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Now the unhinged left is endorsing and applauding  shooting Republicans.  When will it stop?  It won't if Jon Ossoff wins on  Tuesday because the same unhinged leftist cheering last week's shooting are  all backing Jon Ossoff.  And if he wins they win.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That ad was paid for by a PAC supporting Republican  candidate Karen Handel.  It's now receiving backlash for showing images of  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise after he was shot last week.</p><p> A spokesperson for Handel condemned the ad saying, \"For any group to use  the shootings this week for political or personal benefit is shameful.   This group should be ashamed.\"</p><p> What's your take?  Nearly $50 million have been raised in this election --  the most expensive House race in U.S. history -- Congresswoman.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  I think the group that put the ad up should be ashamed.  I  think anyone who is inciting violence or encouraging violence or  encouraging hateful rhetoric should stop it.</p><p> People want to see us work together, whether they're a Democrat, a  Republican an Independent.  I have individuals in my office as I did  yesterday who said we just want to see you get some things done. </p><p> Let's get the Affordable Care Act off the books.  Let's get tax reform  done.  Let's secure the border.  Let's get this infrastructure bill going.   That is what they are wanting to see, and ads like that are not helpful to  the process.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we agree.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  Hateful rhetoric isn't helpful to the process.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Congresswoman -- this is Tony Shaffer with the London Center for  Policy Research.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Yes, Tony.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Good morning, ma'am.</p><p> With all due respect, I know what you're saying about cooperating but it  doesn't seem that Nancy Pelosi and colleagues on the left are actually  trying to ratchet this down.  And it's not all of them.  I mean I talked to  Tulsi Gabbard and Tulsi I think recognizes what's going on but how do you  deal with folks who just don't want to engage in that dialogue.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean look what Chuck Schumer just said that you're doing the  health care deal in the dark of night, excuse me, but wasn't that the way  they did Obamacare?  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  You know, what happened with Obamacare was a bill that was  written in the House -- in the White House and then brought over.  Nobody  knew what was in it and Miss Pelosi said so.  What you see now is a team  working together off the House bill which is a public document.</p><p> But Tony, back to your question on this, I think what we have to do is just  continue to push against this and encourage our colleagues to keep the  conversation on the policies and to move away from this politics of  personal attack and destruction.  The fact that you have so many members of  congress who are receiving death threats, personal harm threats coming into  their steps, to their families, this is completely unacceptable.</p><p> And they need to join together in saying we are not going to tolerate this  type of rhetoric.  We are well served by robust political debate.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you make all great points Congresswoman.  It's great to  see you.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  Good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All our love to Steve Scalise. </p><p> We will be right back.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Excessive heat warnings in effect across the southwest today while  thunderstorm watches are in effect for 11 states on the East Coast.</p><p>Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean breaks it all down for us.   What's the latest we can expect across the country today?  Janice -- good  morning.</p><p> JANICE DEAN, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  A lot of stories -- Maria, we are working  on.</p><p> Let's take a look at it across the northeast.  Hundreds of reports of  severe weather including a tornado report just outside the D.C. area.  No  reports of any injuries but we've got a lot of reports of destruction.</p><p> And we have a tropical cyclone potential in the next 12 to 24 hours  expecting it to get a name and make landfall possibly Thursday, Friday  along the Gulf Coast.  We have tropical storm watches and warnings in  place.  </p><p> This is going to be a rainmaker along the Gulf Coast; six to eight even 12  inches of rainfall, so watching this.  The tropics already heating up.</p><p> And then speaking of heat, across the southwest, heat advisories are posted  where we have dangerous conditions.  Temperatures well over 100 degrees and  we are going to be seeing temperatures close to 120 in Phoenix, Arizona.   Look at the temperatures here over the next several days.</p><p> Looking at Phoenix, they've actually canceled flights.  The smaller  aircraft have a hard time taking off in heat and when we look at the all- time hottest, we go back to 1990, 122 degrees; 1990 here as well, 120;  we're going to be flirting with 119, 120 degrees across Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p> So those big stories we are following today in the Fox News Extreme Weather  Center.  Maria -- back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Yes, that is something.  Ok.  Janice -- thank you.   Janice Dean.</p><p> Meanwhile a blood drive is being held today on Capitol Hill for  Representative Steve Scalise. </p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details there -- Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- Maria.</p><p> Patrick McHenry, the House chief deputy majority whip is hosting that blood  drive for Scalise, a close friend, and other victims of last week's  shooting.  That's according to a notice obtained by Politico.</p><p> So Scalise, he was shot during a congressional baseball practice last  Wednesday has been upgraded, we should say, to serious condition from  critical.  The Louisiana congressman has had several surgeries at MedStar  Washington Hospital.  That blood drive which will be held again on Thursday  is also for U.S. Capitol police special agent Crystal Griner and lobbyist  Matt Mika.</p><p> Well, multiple sources report that several major mobile service providers  are experiencing cellphone service outages this morning.  Companies  (inaudible) reportedly include AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon.  So far  we don't have a reason for these outages but according to the site Down  Detector, Sprint and Verizon had the largest outage areas on the East Coast  and in the state of California.</p><p> And then Chick-Fil-A is the latest fast food chain to offer gluten-free  food.  But there's a catch.  So it's $1.15, you can order your gluten-free  bun.  But you have to make your own sandwich.  Chick-Fil-A says its  kitchens are not gluten-free and that's the only way that they can keep it  safe.  So, you know, it's healthier, I guess but make your own food --  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Joining the wave of others who are going gluten- free.  We'll check it out.   Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p> Coming up next, tensions soaring with North Korea now after the death of an  American student held hostage by the Kim Jong-Un regime for 17 months.   President Trump's tough message to North Korea, next.</p><p> And then information on nearly 200 million voters exposed by the Republican  National Committee.  How a contractor accidentally reveals the names,  birthdays, phone numbers online.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just wanted to pass on  word that Otto Warmbier has just passed away.  He spent a year and a half  in North Korea.  A lot of bad things happened.  That's a brutal regime.   And we will be able to handle it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was President Trump speaking at the White House yesterday  following the death of Otto Warmbier.  The American student died just days  after returning home following 17 months of imprisonment in North Korea.</p><p> Joining me right now is Fox News military analyst, General Jack Keane.   General -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> GEN. JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, good to see you -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's such a horrible and just a terrible story.  The U.S. is  demanding the release now of three other Americans currently being held in  North Korea.</p><p> Your reaction to Otto Warmbier passing away now after being tortured  obviously, coming home in a vegetative state.  </p><p> KEANE:  Well, there's no doubt that the North Koreans are responsible for  murdering Otto, that's for sure and that heartfelt message that (inaudible)  provided yesterday was rally quite extraordinary and revealing in a sense  they talked about him being tortured.  Their doctors obviously have some  sense of what's happening and autopsy will confirm what actually happened.</p><p> But something went wrong here for the North Koreans because, you know,  Maria -- they imprison, torture, kill and starve their own people.  What  they do with Americans is they take them hostage and they use them as  bargaining chips until some prominent American comes forward and is willing  to negotiate with them like a Bill Clinton or a Bill Richardson.  </p><p> So what happened here?  How did this take place?  They lost a leverage that  they use hostages for to establish some legitimacy for the regime.  And I  think the other three certainly, the President's doing the right thing in  demanding their release.</p><p> I think what this will do for us here is strengthen our resolve, our  determination our commitment to deal with this North Korean problem once  and for all.</p><p> I believe the President is already there but I think will just add to his  determination to deal with it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Should the U.S. be responding to this?  What should the U.S. do  at this point?  And basically just to be clear.  What you're saying is they  had him imprisoned, they were obviously drugging him when they realized  that he was in a vegetative state, they said ok, we're losing our leverage  we can send him home?</p><p> KEANE:  Yes.  They didn't want him to die there.  That's for sure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> KEANE:  And it's just -- it's out of the pattern of what they normally do.   We don't know the facts yet -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Should the U.S. do anything about this -- General?</p><p> KEANE:  We're not going to -- we're not going to take any immediate action  with North Korea.  What we have done is we have -- we have ladled the  football to China to see if they can use economic pressure on North Korea  to denuclearize.  That will take some time.  </p><p> Most of us looking at that and I'm sure the administration also has a  healthy dose of skepticism about whether China is genuinely sincere about  doing this.  We'll have to see and we'll have to wait to see that happen.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  I think at some point, here's where I think we're going to wind up.   China is not going to do it.  We're going to have to really get tough with  North Korea on sanctions.</p><p> I think we'll probably have to provide some sanctions against China for the  first time.  I think we have to have a get tough policy with China.  And  when it comes to the Asia Pacific and what they're doing in terms of  trampling our interests and also our allies' interests.</p><p> I think we're kind of on a collision course with North Korea and also with  China.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's important.  That's going to be an important day  when in fact the U.S. makes a decision to put sanctions against China as  well.</p><p> Let me switch gears and get your take on this latest surrounding the USS  Fitzgerald's collision with a container ship.  That happened this weekend  off the coast of Japan.  And investigators are looking into several aspects  of this crash including why it took the crew of the civilian vessel almost  an hour to report the incident.  How does this happen -- General?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, I don't know what they were doing on board, what kind of  emergency situation they may have had.  They have very small crews on that  ship but you know, making a radio call isn't a big deal.  And certainly our  war ship had their hands full -- the things that were knocked out were the  berthing areas for the crew.  The radio communication was knocked out and  also interesting, the captain's quarters was sitting on top of all of that.</p><p> So it is understandable our crew was fighting for their lives and trying to  make sure -- you have a warship and it demonstrates, you know, the  instruments of war like a warship is dangerous in peace time as it is in  war.</p><p> Sitting on that ship as we know, not on that commercial ship, sitting on  that warship is incredible amount of missiles and explosive munitions.  And  if a fire broke out on that ship that thing could really have turned into  an incredible tragedy.  So fortunate that that crew was as brave as they  are, battled that situation and took control of it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, any other issues that will come as a result of this?   Because people are scratching their heads saying how does this happen?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, the Navy -- the Navy is not saying it publicly but the Navy  is not going to stand for our ship at sea not being able to evade an  oncoming ship if the oncoming ship made an unexpected U-turn like it did.   The Navy has navigational devices.  It has human beings that are alert and  paying attention.  And something's failed on that ship that we did not take  evasive action.</p><p> The Navy will never excuse any of its vessels being hit by another vessel  regardless of who was at fault.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p> KEANE:  The Navy will hold that crew accountable for being able to evade  that ship.  That's the fact of it.  They'll get to what caused it all but  at the end of the day they're going to hold them accountable for it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right. We'll be watching that.  General -- always a  pleasure.  Thanks so much.</p><p> KEANE:  Good talking to you -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And to you -- General Jack Keane joining us there.</p><p> Coming up, a new weapon in the Russian election meddling probe.

Your top stories right now 7:30 A.M. on the  East Coast.</p><p> A busy week at the White House.  President Trump set to meet with president  of the Ukraine this afternoon.  The meeting coming as the White House is  facing new headwinds in the Russia probe Special Counsel Robert Mueller  expanding his team including one man who is best known for his ability to  flip witnesses.  What it means for the president, coming up.</p><p> Hacking concerns hit the RNC.

Why picking a certain paint color could actually earn you  big bucks when you sell your home.  We'll tell you about it.</p><p> Futures meanwhile showing the markets will be mixed today at the open.  The  Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are coming off of a record close yesterday.  But oil  prices have been selling off and that has cut into some of the gains this  morning.  Now we expect a mixed opening for broader averages.  The Dow  industrials are down one.  The NASDAQ are up 12 points.</p><p> In Europe, the major indices have also lost some momentum this morning.   The FT 100 is now in negative territory down five points.  The CAC quarante  is well off of the highs.  It's up a quarter of a percent and the DAX index  is also higher although well off a big ties as well.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly lower meanwhile with the exception  of Japan.  The Nikkei average finished up almost one percent.</p><p> And take a look at oil prices.  One of the certainly market stories down  two percent right now, on oil, and as oil prices have slide, stocks have  also given up some gains.</p><p> Well, Special Counsel Robert Mueller adding a new weapon to his Russia  probe.  Veteran federal prosecutor and former Department of Justice fraud  division chief Andrew Weissmann has joined the team.  Weissmann is the man  who has been known for his ability to flip witnesses in his work on  organized crime, and in cases like Enron </p><p> Joining us right now defense attorney author and Harvard law professor  Emeritus, Alan Dershowitz.  Alan, good to see you.</p><p> ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS:  Nice to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is this a move that should concern the president bringing  Weissmann on?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Sure.  We're seeing a game of three dimensional chess.   Mueller is sending a very powerful message to the White House.  We have a  flipper.  You have some potential flipees out there, especially Flynn.   Flynn's lawyer are now sending a message to the White House as well.  We  may flip.  We're not going to allow our client to go to jail.  You have a  choice.  If you don't wanted to flip, you have the option of pardoning him.   If you pardon him, he doesn't flip.  If you don't pardon him, he flips.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So he's cooperating with the special prosecutor.  Mike Flynn.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Well, what I think is happening is his lawyer announced  publicly, which is very odd.  We have a story to tell.  Please give us  immunity.  I think it may be bluff.  We're not sure he has great story to  tell but he's certainly, by that public message, trying to get the  attention of the oval office.  Trying to get the president to say, you can  stop all this by pardoning Flynn.  Now pardoning Flynn would be a political  cost.  Very heavy cost for the president.</p><p> So the stakes have gone up all over the place.  This is the way tough  defense attorneys and tough prosecutors go after each other and play the  game.  I have seen this game.  I have participated in it.  And I know how  rough and tumble it can become.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  It sounds, James.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Professor, I want to you ask you about Andrew Weissmann, Clinton  donor also has been sharply criticized by a newspaper that was owned by  Jared Kushner.  He's now apparently investigating Jared Kushner.</p><p> And this is in terms of political donors, this is a patter so far in the  Mueller team.  He's hiring a number of people who've donated, the  democrats.  Is it -- is it that hard to find good lawyers who are not  political activists?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Well, lawyers are like everybody else.  I contribute.  I  contributed to Hillary Clinton's campaign.  I would not let it affect my  judgment.  I defended republicans and democrats alike.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you do that though?  You gave money.  I mean, how do you  not make sure that it doesn't affect your judgment?  That's hard.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Well, look at me now.  I gave money to Clinton and I'm no  making arguments that helped the man I voted against because I believe in  principle.  Now, Weissmann is a very tough prosecutor.  If I were the  president, I'd be more worried about his experience and his record of being  a very tough prosecutor and a few bucks being contributed to the democrats.   Having said that, I think that probably should have look for people who  didn't make political contributions.  Much the way the president  disqualified probably one of the most qualified persons to be the head of  the FBI and that is Senator Lieberman because he had been a politician.   The president wanted to make sure that whoever it was, was outside of  politics.</p><p> So I think the seize is white principle that you're going to engage in a  political prosecution and this is a political prosecution, you better not  give the other side the opportunity to make arguments that it's been  politicized.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think about all of this focused on this Russian  meddling probe?  I understand the Russian meddling probe, but to attach  Trump to it, when we know that there's absolutely no evidence, whatsoever  of collusion and still going on about this, I mean, how much does this cost  taxpayers?  Hundred million or more than that?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  And there's nothing -- I don't know.  But there's nothing  criminal about it.  This ought to be investigated by an independent  commission looking into the relationship between Russia and political  elections on both sides moving forward.  Then there ought to be a  congressional investigation to see maybe we need to change the law to  prevent the president from firing the director of the FBI.</p><p> The one place they should not be is in front of a grand jury.  There is  nothing criminal here.  And the grand jury is secret behind closed doors.   It's causing us a fortune.  We're learning nothing.  Nothing will come of  it.  This idea that you can turn a constitutionally protected act, the  firing the director into a crime because it had a corrupt motive.</p><p> You should read my emails.  I'm accused every day of having a corrupt  motive.  Why am I on Fox talking about Donald Trump?  Is he paying me?  Am  I auditioning to become his lawyer?  Do I want to be a judge?  Am I  expecting a favor?  My motives are being questioned all over the place.   Politicians questioned each other's motives.  The idea of corrupt motive  being the criteria distinguishing a constitutionally protected act from a  felony is so dangerous to civil liberties that every -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, is there going to be any -- is there going to be any  accountability for the dems obstructing the agenda that America voted for  last year?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Well, the republicans did the very same thing to Bill Clinton.   When they impeached him and what they tried to do to Barack Obama.  Look,  packs on both their -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the accountability happened because they got voted  out of office, right?  So will the dems lose seats as a result of this in  '18?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  We'll see today in Georgia.  We'll see in other places.  We  don't know.  This is a referendum, perhaps.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, back onto my pointing for a second.  Because that's the  most real element I've seen so far in any legal jeopardy.  Simply because  Mike is going to talk doesn't mean he's flipping.  This is one of those  things where I think people are reading far too much in a way sinister  motive here.  You and I both know, Alan, that you go in front of congress,  you go in front of these groups, anything you say can eventually be turned  against you in some form.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  He's looking for immunity.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Because you don't want to be say anything.  It gives you later.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  But I would never ever ask for immunity publicly.  I would go  quietly to the prosecutor and say, here's my story.  But his lawyers are  very smart.  Why is he asking for immunity publicly?  Because he's sending  a message to the president of the United States.  You want me not to get  immunity?  Pardon me.  Pardon me.  Pardon my client.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Last thing.  We talked about how there's no evidence yet of  collusion.  It seems interesting as you watch Mueller build his team and  assign people the different tasks.  He seems to be assigning them largely  to things other than looking for evidence of collusion.  Does that mean  he's already decided there's nothing there?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  I don't think there's anything that criminally on collusion.   What he's looking for is to make a case against Flynn, for example, failure  to list some of these things then go to Flynn and say, you want to go to  jail?  You have a family.  There's a way out of this.  Weissmann is an  expert of that.  He has flipped better witnesses and stronger witnesses  then Flynn that's the goal prosecutor's.</p><p> I once debated Rudy Giuliani in my class and he put a bunch of dominos up  on the blackboard and he said, if I ever have to bring somebody to trial, I  have failed.  My goal is to flip the first guy on the guy, on the third  guy, ultimately get them all flipped and finally go after the big guy on  the top and the evidence is so overwhelming he'll plead guilty.  That's the  way prosecutors operate.  And defense attorneys operate by using that to  their advantage and trying to make sure their client is the one who's  giving to get out of jail free ticket and they can turn -- the first rule  in America is that you're going to commit a crime always committed with  somebody more important than you are.  So you can flip on them and make it  flip on you.  That's my advice to all persons of criminals out there.   Don't commit crimes.  But if you're going to do it, do it with someone more  important.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Alan, great insights as always from you.  Thanks so much.   Alan Dershowitz there.</p><p> Coming up, data for nearly 200 million voters have been exposed.  How a  contractor for the republican national committee accidentally posted the  information online.</p><p> And then the right colored walls can earn you more green.  A surprising new  study reveals what specific paint color can help boost a home selling  price.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Republican Party data of nearly 200 million  voters has been exposed online.  Cheryl Casone with all the details now.   Cheryl, over to you.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  A cyber security analyst  working for the RNC discovered that the information was left unsecured on  an online database for 12 days before it was taken down.  The data was  stolen in an Amazon cloud account used by a contractor that work for the  RNC.  The information was nearly on every U.S. voter.  It include names,  date of birth, home addresses.  The RNC says it's working with that  contractor padding that conclusion of an investigation in the security.</p><p> Well, Google can now help you find a job.  The search engine has launched a  new job search feature on its search result pages.  You can now search for  jobs across all major online job words.  It covers LinkedIn, Monster,  Career Builder, Facebook and a lot more.  Google is also going to include  job listings that finds on a company specific homepage.  Basically, it's  going to be one stop shopping for job seekers of all trades.</p><p> And then finally this.  The color that you paint the inside of your home  could affect its value.  Zillow conducted an analysis and more than 32,000  sold homes -- here's example.  A blue bathroom can increase the home's  price by $5,400.  A blue dining room can fetch an extra 2,000.  But some  color hurt you.  Last year, yellow was a hot color, it increased sales  values.  This year, a yellow kitchen, for example, will hurt you by about  $800.</p><p> And then, Maria, some colors just hurt you every year.  Terracotta, a terra  no-no, do not -- it's like orange brown.  No.  Don't do it.  If you have  terracotta walls, you're going to lose more than $2,000, versus other  homes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's amazing that color does that.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Twitter turns to TV to maintain its Trump bump.  We  will take a look of whether the new ad campaign is enough to more and more  users and how will they monetize it.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Twitter announcing a new ad campaign with Chance  the Rapper, and what he should play at his shows.  Tracee Carrasco with the  details now.  Tracee, good morning.</p><p> TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Now, this is the  first-ever TV ad for Twitter, as you said Chance the Rapper, now take a  look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARRASCO:  The ad shows Chance asking fans via Twitter for a song request  for his upcoming concert, his tweet sets off a wide range of responses not  all positive, as people tweet back and debate selections.  Music legend  David Crosby even trolls the rapper by tweeting, how about any song with  real instruments?  Now, the new campaign is the next step in Twitter's  ongoing attempt to better explain to consumers what Twitter is and why it's  valuable to spend time on the site.</p><p> The ad push hope to show people how Twitter is unique compared with other  social media sites.  Now Twitter reported its average monthly user rose six  percent in the first quarter to 328 million.  It was the largest quarterly  increase since 2015.  And according to company, it is partly due to \"new  and resurrected users following more news and political accounts in U.S.\"</p><p> Now, although the company didn't specifically mention President Trump, his  frequent tweeting has gotten worldwide attention.  For Twitter, they want  to show they're not just news, they're entertainment, they're sports,  they're everything.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a good arguments we made that it does trigger conversation  and that you have back-and-forth debate.  I like the fact that Crosby was  in it answering about the instruments.  That's cute.</p><p> CARRASCO:  Yes.  Maybe a collaboration.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  And Chance the Rapper says the gentleman here, it's their  favorite musician.</p><p> SHAFFER:  I was on Yo! MTV Raps left.  One of these few things, I have  friends who literally still can't use Twitter.  They can't figure it out.   And to me, it's kind of like riding a bike.  Once you figure it out, you  figure it out and you can use it.  So, do you think there's a part of it  now people starting to figure out how to use this more?  Because I have  friends saying, I just don't get it.  How do I get my message out?  So, do  you have any sense of where this is going regarding people just probably  getting smart how to use it?</p><p> CARRASCO:  I think so.  I think we're seeing so many -- you know, we can't  go a day without saying President Trump is tweeting this, so and so is  tweeting this, so I think people are now saying well, I want to know what  Twitter is all about.  I'm going to figure out how to use it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the company has to monetize it somehow.</p><p> That's helping them make money.  This ad, what's that going to do for  monetization?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think investors have kind of been wondering before and  especially through this Trump era, why are you not making more money off  this fact that the U.S. president has put you at the center of the  universe, political discussion, debate, really all news, and maybe this is  a way to try and figure it out.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  And this is millennials also.  I think if millennials don't  follow as much D.C. politics as maybe they should than this is another way  to reach out to them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I thought it was really interesting when Jack Dorsey was  asked, the CEO of Twitter.  What do you think about the president tweeting  all the time on your service?  He goes, oh, it's complicated.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Probably don't want to monetize it.</p><p> FREEMAN:  This is obviously a huge gift to them.  But being at Silicon  Valley, given the political sensibility there, I think they have to pretend  that this is kind of a mixed story for them.  But, yes.  It's not really -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a huge break for them.</p><p> CARRASCO:  It's been great for them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sure it has.  Tracee, great.  Thank you so much.  Tracee  Carrasco there.</p><p> Still ahead, UPS giving itself a present this Christmas.  Why the shipping  giant is planning to charge you more for holiday deliveries and they've  decided this now.

Commerce Secretary  Wilbur Ross weighed in on tariffs and taxes early on the program.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY:  Tariffs are nothing new to the  financing of the U.S. government.  But we've long passed that with the  advent of personal income tax then corporate tax.  So now, border  adjustable or some such thing is simply one way to fill up a portion of a  whole.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A closer look at the timeline and the tax plan coming up.</p><p> Meanwhile, the tour company that brought American student Otto Warmbier to  North Korea, it says it is not halting those tour trips.

Take a look at futures right now  indicating a mixed opening for the broader averages, Dow Industrials  squeaking out a gain of just two points right here.  S&amp;P 500 is unchanged  and the NASDAQ is up 15, all of the above, of off the highs of the morning.   And of course, this is after the Dow and S&amp;P reached record highs yesterday  at the close.</p><p> In Europe, the indices have also given up some of the momentum, the FT 100  is now negative by nine points.  The CAC quarante in Paris is up a quarter  of a percent off of the highs as is the DAX Index right now as well of 25  points there.  In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly lower with the  exception of Japan, Nikkei Average was up almost one percent.  But take a  look at oil prices driving better than two percent right now, 2 2/3  percent, that is really behind what's going on for stock prices this  morning.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it, financial analyst Heather Zumarraga is here, Wall Street Journal  Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman is here, and the London  Center for Policy Research Vice President Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaeffer  is here.  Great to see you.</p><p> TONY SCHAEFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH VICE PRESIDENT: Thanks,  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Allan Dersowitch said some interesting things to say I thought.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Yes.   And we're still waiting for that collusion evidence.  He's talking about  the potential that maybe Michael Flynn will be forced to flip but what does  -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- stories that Michael Flynn has about the president.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, yes.  I think - this is one of the things too.  Because he  had a story doesn't mean it's a bad story.  I mean, everybody kind of  infers he's going to flip on the president.  Look, I think Mike Flynn  probably made some mistakes, we've talked about the Russian issue regarding  his conversations with the Russians, he had a deal with Turkey which has  been questioned and some issues with that, the whole issue of what he got  paid going to Moscow to meet with Putin via RT.</p><p> These are all things which I think are relevant in a way by the fact that  maybe he even didn't follow the rules but they don't add anything to the  larger narrative or issue regarding what exactly are we looking for  regarding this \"collusion.\" </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  Absolutely right.  We want to kick this out off of  this.  The Trump administration is pushing forward on the president's  agenda as the Senate GOP is planning on a health care vote next week.  Adam  Shapiro is at the White House right now with the very latest.  Adam, that  certainly keeps them on the timeline for '17.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Right.  It  would keep on the timeline, they have to do the health care stuff first  because of the rules of reconciliation in the 2017 budget resolution but  Mitch McConnell, the leader in the senate's office has said, pay attention  to what the leader had - to what the leader has said in regards to getting  this vote before the July 4th recess.  So the bill is being crafted and the  vote is expected next week but the Democrats are trying to slow down the  process in the Senate and then last night, Chuck Schumer went after Mitch  McConnell in an exchange about why are you doing this behind closed doors,  let's see what you're working on.  Here's what they talked about. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATOR:  Will it be available to us and the public  more than 10 hours before we have to vote for it? </p><p> MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATOR:  I think we'll ample opportunity to read  and amend the bill. </p><p> SCHUMER:  Will it be more than 10 hours -- </p><p> MCCONNELL:  I think we'll have ample opportunity to read and amend the  bill. </p><p> SCHUMER:  I rest my case. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  So the goal again for Republicans is to have this bill next week  debated no more than 20 hours in the Senate and then a vote before the  senators and all of Congress actually leave for the July 4th recess.  The  other issue, of course, is tax reform.  Once they have accomplished or  defeated the health care repeal and replace, they can then move on to a  budget resolution and then tax reform.  And today we're going to get a  major speech from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan on what he thinks is  important, not only in tax reform but why this moment when Republicans  control the White House and the House of Representatives and the Senate is  in the opportunity they can't afford to miss.  So that speech at 12:45 at  the National Association Of Manufacturers, will outline Speaker Ryan's  thoughts on tax reform.</p><p> We're not looking for too much debate on that, for instance, the border  adjustment tax, he hasn't officially said he is against it, there is no one  in the Senate who is for it but in the house, Republicans are still  supporting it and Paul Ryan was a big supporter of it originally.  We're  looking for guidance during this speech today on that. Maria? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Adam Shapiro, thank you very much.  Adam is at the White  House.  And I don't think he's letting it go, James Freeman.  I think Paul  Ryan still wants this border adjustment tax in there even though it gets  massive pushback from his colleagues. </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  And the economics makes sense, we are talking about how  most economists will tell you want a tax consumption instead of working  investment but he's got a lot of work to do on the sales end.  If he can't  persuade his colleagues, he's got to just focus on tax cuts.  You know,  we've in White House for five months, a person who is ready to sign a tax  cut, ready to sign health care reform, investors, voters had been saying,  to the legislature when are you going to do this stuff on his desk? </p><p>  I think, you know, maybe there is more optimism now that they get that  urgency on hill, we see the health care moving forward and I think whatever  deal he's able to work out in terms of Paul Ryan in the House, he's got to  do it too. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think that the markets would react well even if it's not  a broad tax reform plan and it's just tax cuts?</p><p> FREEMAN:  As long as it's - I think the biggest game changer is either -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Corporate tax.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- is really big cut in that corporate rate.  So, I think if you  tell markets and you make it clear that we're going to have a long-term  reform to grow the economy faster, I think people understand that it allows  to generate the growth that can pay more bills for the government.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  If you want to make it riveting and neutral but why are talking  about cutting spending, rolling spending back instead of the border  adjustment tax, the Senate Republicans are just not going to go for that.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where are you going to get - where are you going to cut the  spending though, that's the issue.  I mean, most of the money is in the  entitlements.  They don't want to talk about cutting Social Security.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.  They're not going go after the -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this president is all about helping and boosting the  military.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  So, yes, they have to go -</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SHAFFER:  I mean, look, I just (INAUDIBLE) on a letter recently saying, we  need to look at a black.  The DOD spends a lot of money for global  infrastructure that we don't - we don't use.  So, there's a huge area we  could pick and look at.  Of course, the politics of that is certain people  don't want things cut in their district but that's always an issue.   Secondly, I think we've look at -- big ticket items need to be looked at  that he tweeted on the F-35, for goodness sake, the F-35 has been an issue  for a long time.  Much of the defense budget is tied up on that.  So, I  think you can look at offsets right now that would help reduce some of this  so you don't have to worry about tax increases but nobody seems to be want  to do this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is all the making of the sausage that they are supposedly  having these meetings about behind closed doors right now.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, yes.  The reason - the reason there - it's 52 Republicans  negotiating this is because all the Democrats said, we're not interested in  amending Obamacare.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  They don't want to participate.</p><p> FREEMAN:  That's why they're not part of the negotiation, they've said  they're not going to vote for it.  So, when they come out with that plan,  there will be some entitlement reform because you're basically talking  about fixing Medicaid which expanded under Obamacare.  This is an amazing  program.  As bad as it is for taxpayers, patients are generally better off  with no insurance or they're nowhere soft than with Medicaid.  So, it  doesn't work for anybody and reforming that, I think it's going to be part  of this package.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're also talking about reforming technology of government,  obviously tech titans went to Washington yesterday.  Top industry leaders  met with the president and other administration officials to talk about how  government technology can become more efficient.  Here's what commerce  secretary Wilbur Ross told me about the meeting earlier in the program.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  The government not just  the federal but also state and local government generally has not spent  very much on upgrading their technology.  Might have archaic equipment is  being used, a lot of equipment where you can barely get proper support  anymore.  And there are various estimates the government may be spending  something like $90 billion a year on maintaining systems that fundamentally  are obsoleted by modern standards.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That seems like a lot of low hanging fruit to me, you guys,  what do you think?</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, it's easy, I mean, to me, one of the things we (INAUDIBLE)  the G6 of the division, I was the communications guy and they - I'll be  making decision to roll into vista as an operating system even though  everybody else to include commerce and bypass vista.  But because of their  procurement process and the way they program, they've wasted - my estimate  close to $2 million per sector just on this bad decision.  So the part of  the problem is not necessarily technology, it's people not being able to  make decision to acquire and adapt --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Well, this brings about a decision setting down - you hope it's  not just for show in the media.  Hey, we're all getting together.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Right.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  I think President Trump will be the first there a long time to  take action.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  This should be a way to make government cheaper basically  to get rid of people and use technology instead.  If that's not the goal,  if this is just about allowing government to do more of what it does,  that's going to be a big loss.  But if they're focused on using this as a  cost saver, outside of the military where they actually have tanks and guns  and going blow up stuff.  Most of government just moves information around.   They don't actually produce anything.  There should be an industry that  I.T. can make much more efficient in terms of many, many fewer people.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, the B.A. and DOD is a good example where they have nobody  can actually bridge medical information from the private sector to the  government sector to help manage healthcare.  So this is a great microscopy  --</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  You need them to talk to each other -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SHAFFER:  Yes.  And so - well, you're right.  DOD does have some  experience.  They still won't - and I know of best solutions that have been  purchased by the Department of Defense, they won't implement because of  politics.  So, what he says may be true about them trying to talk but the  problem is culture trying to -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FREEMAN:  I used to work at the SCC and there was - I don't know if this is  still true but there was a form that mutual funds have to submit in DOS, so  they all have to get DOS.</p><p> SHAFFER:  DOS?</p><p> FREEMAN:  A program -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- used on - I mean, sort of 20 years? </p><p> FREEMAN:  Just put it (INAUDIBLE) for god sake.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Yes.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  I don't even know what DOS is. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Let me switch gears.  The travel company that  took Otto Warmbier to North Korea says it will no longer escort Americans  to the hermit kingdom.  The 22 -year-old died after returning to the States  with severe brain damage.  President Trump weighed in on the tragic  incident yesterday.  Here's what he said. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He spent a year and a half  in North Korea.  A lot of bad things happened.  But at least we got him  home to be with his parents where they were so happy to see him even though  he was in very tough condition but he just passed away a little while ago.   That's a brutal regime, and we will be able to handle it. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Colonel Shaffer, your thoughts. </p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, look, him saying, we will be able to handle it, the  president saying that I think it means we're going to do something we  should.  As a father of a 23-year-old, I would just be heartbroken.  I  don't know how the parents are enduring this, but clearly - this whole  trend of opening up to North Korea has been a bad policy.  The idea of  regularizing relationships is like regularizing our relationship with a -  with a cobra.  The cobra is always going to do what a cobra does and I  think the idea that we're trying to work with China, work with them, I  mentioned earlier, the case on free trade zone were essentially - the South  Koreans get free trade - free labor from the North Koreans and they pay  North Korean labor to do things.  It might have just goes with the  government.  So, I think there's been a lot of ill thought ideas of how to  outreach and work with the North Koreans which has not benefited the people  of North Korea or us. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot of people, you know, say what was he doing there?  Why  was he there?  He was in China and went on a tour with a tour company from  China to North Korea, that's what he was doing there with other students. </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  But the tour company should not be pushing to be in areas like  that that are very dangerous.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We will take a break.  Stay with Fox  Business.  House Speaker Paul Ryan is speaking about the GOP tax plan later  today.  We are going to - we are going to take it to you live at 12:45  Eastern.

How long the triple-digit  temperatures are expected to last?  And then, a stamp that ensure to have  collectors over the moon, check it out.  The postal service releasing a  stamp that puts in eclipse at the tip of your fingertips.  We'll show you  how it works.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Dozens of flights out of Arizona Sky Harbor  International Airport are being canceled this morning because it is simply  too hot to fly.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Good  morning, Maria.  This is Phoenix in particular.  American Airlines saying  the small region of planes have a maximum operating temperature of 118  degrees.  So those planes can't fly if it's 120 degrees which is expected  to hit today.  Temperatures like this have not been seen in Phoenix since  1990 when the city endured a record-breaking 122-degree heat wave causing  grounded flights, airport closures, three people actually died that day.   So, American is giving passengers now the option of a refund or a free  booking on another flight if you want to change your plans.</p><p> Well, British officials are charging Barclays and four former top  executives with fraud over fundraising with Qatari investors.  The criminal  charges sent from Barclays investment during the height of the financial  crisis  It's the first time that top executives of the U.K. bankers going  to face criminal charges for their actions during that sort of time.  We  should say Barclays, the stock under pressure slightly almost down about  one percent.  And here as you can see on your screen.</p><p> Well, we are probably not alone.  NASA has spotted 10 new planets outside  of our solar system.  They are likely the right size and temperature to  potentially support life.  The Opinion Space found data from the couple of  telescope during the first four years of its primary mission.  NASA says it  only looked in a tiny part though of the galaxy.  There could be more out  there.</p><p> And let's stay in space just here for a moment.  The postal service out  with a new stamp today that you can have some with, the special edition of  Forever stamp features a solar eclipse to celebrate the Great American  Eclipse that's going to hit on August 21st.  But here's the fun part.  As  you can see with the heat of your finger, the stamp transforms the sun into  the moon.  The solar eclipse will be visible along the 70-mile wide path  that runs from Oregon down to South Carolina, Maria.  And those are your  headlines.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love that.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  Fun, right?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, it looked really cool.  All right.  Thank you,  Cheryl.  Coming up.  The opioid epidemic hits Ohio.  How the state is  working to stem the tide of overdose deaths.  And then the growing  political divide, more Americans believe D.C. has gotten too uncivil since  the election.  We will take a look at what can be done to heal the  division.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  America's opioid crisis is reaching a breaking  point.  Take a look at this.  Authorities in Montgomery County, Ohio say  that they've seen 365 opioid-related deaths this year alone.  The county  tops the nation in overdose deaths and authorities there are calling this a  mass casualty event.  I want to bring in Montgomery County Sheriff Phil  Plummer.  Sheriff, thanks very much for joining us.  And in just five  months the number of opioid-related deaths in your county has already  surpassed the entire last year in terms of numbers.  Why do you think this  is happening? </p><p> PHIL PLUMMER, MONTGOMERY COUNTY SHERIFF:  Good morning, Maria.  Yes.  This  is a tremendous epidemic for us.  We're going to double last year's death  total to set a new record this year.  And it's just happening because  there's a perfect storm of location or economic problems and, you know,  this has been a challenge for all of us.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How are you dealing with this?  Are the authorities fighting  against this opioid epidemic in any specific way?</p><p> PLUMMER:  Yes.  We're very innovative about this, we're working hard, we've  come up some great programs, you know, we're actually - we have Narcan in  cruiser, we're saving lives with Narcan, we're driving addicts to  treatment, we're sending out recovery teams to addict's houses with social  workers, police officers, we're trying to educate the addict's families on  how to get out of this problem.  So, you know, we're working hard on it but  unfortunately, we're not making much progress.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Hey, Sheriff, this is Tony Shaffer.  I'm an alumni of - alumnus  of the Wright State University right there.  So the poll that where I went  to college is actually at the heart of all this.  Do you believe some of  this is because you all are at the - at the intersection of 75 and 70, the  routes for a lot of stuff moving?  Just so happens you guys happen to be  kind of the drop-off point for a lot of this and is there anything the  federal government can do to help you diminish the supply coming into the  region.  </p><p> PLUMMER:  Your location like I said, that's a perfect storm, 70 and 75,  that's the crossroads of America.  So, you know, Dayton has become a source  city where they bring Heroin and the Fentanyl straight from Mexico to  Dayton, Ohio then they can drop on 70 and they go east and west in New York  and Chicago.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's amazing.  So it's just the fact that you're right near  the route of where this -- the drugs are coming in? </p><p> PLUMMER:  Yes, yes.  It's a perfect storm for us saying, you know, they  need more resources from the federal government.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, the President has taken executive action by forming a  commission to combat drug addiction and this opioid crisis.  You want to  see funding from the government?  What else do you want from the government  in terms of addressing this in Montgomery County?  </p><p> PLUMMER:  We need funding, we need more boots on the ground, you know, we  all been - we've had a bad economic downturn, we've lost a lot of officers,  so we need more resources on the ground because we have to work on this  through the supply - the supply how much is coming from Mexico.  We have to  work on the demand, we have to treat our users and have to get into  prevention and education to keep the next generation from falling into this  trap.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Hi, James Freeman here with the Journal.  Speaking about  education, I know a lot of programs around the country or a lot of schools  have these DARE programs, police officers educating kids starting at a very  young age.  Is there something related to that or not doing as you see this  particular epidemic, is there somebody parents ought to be doing that we're  not?  </p><p> PLUMMER:  Yes.  People -- there is a lot of understanding about the opioid  crisis, so what we're starting now is we're having town hall meetings and  all of our churches, we need to get the congregations to our -- in front of  our panelists and educate them on what's going on and what to be aware of,  you know, how to protect your children.  I, mean, we're losing our kids  every day here in this community.</p><p> SHAFFER:  I have a follow-up question, Sheriff, on the issue of how the  stuff is coming into the region and what you guys are doing about it.  Is  there any way to try to go after the money?  I mean, I work kind  counterdrug in the 90s, and obviously the financial motives for this sort  of thing by those who control the flow if you - if you start going right at  the money, that's one issue.  So have you guys been able to look at who's  dealing this?  You mentioned some of the folks transporting this.  I know  you can't necessarily get ahead of the pipeline but there are certain  things you can do to take the financials and (INAUDIBLE) you guys look at  how to get at the financial aspects of this at all.</p><p> PLUMMER:  Yes.  We've done - we've been targeting the cartel members, we  have two cartels, Mexican cartels bringing the product to our community.   So, you know, we've been watching them in various hotels and we've been  trying to capture the moneys.  And the last couple of years, we've taken  $5.5 dollars cash off of the streets from the cartels that would have gone  back to Mexico.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Wow.  Good.</p><p> PLUMMER:  Yes.  So, unfortunately, that's not working either.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Ohio is suing top pharmaceutical companies.  They  say allegedly they downplayed the risk of addiction to drive sales, Purdue  Pharma, Johnson and Johnson, Allergan, among those facing these lawsuits.   Do you agree with that?  Is some of the blame on these pharmaceutical  companies?</p><p> PLUMMER:  Yes.  Yes.  Definitely, they have some accountability here.  And,  you know, and I support the lawsuits but unfortunately, that's a long-term  solution for this problem and we've been fighting this problem for four  years.  So, we need some immediate resources here in this community.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching.  Sheriff, thanks very much for  weighing in and explaining the story to us.  We appreciate it.  Sheriff  Phil Plummer joining us.  Montgomery County there.  Coming up.  D.C. has  Georgia on its mind today.

Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Happy Tuesday.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thank you so much for  joining us.  It is Tuesday, June 20th.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And here are  your top stories, 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  A busy day at 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue today.  President Trump will host the president of the  Ukraine at the White House later this afternoon.  The meeting comes amid  rising tensions in our nation's capital.  A new poll shows a vast majority  of Americans believe political debate is becoming increasingly uncivil and  it is encouraging violence.  The trend is sure to be on voters' minds as  they head to the polls in Georgia today.</p><p> KAREN HANDEL, GEORGIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  I feel great, very, very  encouraged by things the enthusiasm on the ground has been amazing. </p><p> JON OSSOFF, GEORGIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  I think this is an  opportunity for Georgia to elect some fresh leadership that's focused on  delivering results for folks at home, focus on what people that kind  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Over 140,000 ballots have already been cast as Jon Ossoff and  Karen Handel vie for the empty House seat latest on a special election in  Georgia and South Carolina, this morning.

Oil  prices are driving the action for stock prices this morning, crude oil is  down better than two percent right now and that has taken the wind out of  gains for stock prices, there's oil down $1.13, that's 21/2 percent at  $43.07 a barrel on oil sweet crude.</p><p> Futures meanwhile are also their high take a look at stocks here and the  Dow Industrials averages now negative expected to open down about seven  points.  S&amp;P is also negative both the Dow and the S&amp;P hit record highs  yesterday at the close.  The Nasdaq is swill positive although it is well  off of the highs of the morning, in Europe, similar situation, as oil has  reversed course and worsened, European markets have also done so.  The F.T.  100 is down eight points, the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are up but  just fractionally.  And Asia overnight markets closed mostly lower with the  exception of Japan it was up one percent.  </p><p> Americans on both sides of the aisle now say the tone and level of civility  in our political debate is getting much worse according to a new poll by  CBS News, 68 percent of Americans across all parties said so while just  seven percent said the tone was getting better, better?  Three-quarters of  Americans also say they feel the current tone of political debate is  encouraging violence, joining us right now the Trump great America PAC and  Co-Chair and former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins is here, Ed great to  see you. </p><p> ED ROLLINS, REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT AND ADVISOR:  Thank you, thank  you very much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think of this?</p><p> ROLLINS:  Obviously there is the rhetoric is much more severe than it's  ever been, and it's been increasing over last 20 years to a point since the  Trump election, now their people are very unhappy their very polarized, you  either for Trump or totally against Trump, and actually to me I can't go to  restaurant anywhere in this country that I hear someone, not adjacent table  talking about politics, I've never seen that before and one sense that's  good because their paying attention another sense is not particularly  positive conversations. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but it's also, you know, you have Hollywood getting in on  the act Robert De Niro saying I want to punch the President in the face  you've got Madonna saying yes I think about blowing up the White House  then, of course, the sickest of them all with Kathy Griffin and her head  that she was holding that time. </p><p> ROLLINS:  I think Hollywood is proven to be totally irrelevant in the last  election when everybody was pretty much for MRS. Clinton didn't make any  difference.  I think the serious thing here though is we could have had a  massacre last week if those two Capitol guards had not been there guarding,  you know, they could have killed 10 members of Congress or more and I think  that's very severe that, you know, this is a deranged guy this is obviously  someone who that just walked on the field that morning, he had planned this  but it's very, very severe. </p><p> TONY SHAFFER, RETIRED UNITED STATES ARMY:  And I said the other day in  interview that I felt that the essentially there's a pathology here and  that pathology mirrors what ISIS has been doing to radicalize its members,  I mean you're talking about a group where you have certain beliefs which  become completely inculcated in your believers to the point of were even  that they believe fiction they believe the whole Russian there, there was  on the other and then you have on top of that then this desensitization of  the groups by media.  Media saying it's OK, to say you want to punch the  President, it's OK to have the image of President Trump being behead and  then that leads them to people acting out.  So I believe that we're on a  path of seeing more of this world thing based on the fact that the left  refuses completely to acknowledge the fact that they are radicalizing  individuals to act.</p><p> ROLLINS:  But the bottom line is both sides have let a tone a down a little  bit there's some very serious we have to debate in the very near future.   The irony is we just haven't a Congressional race today this most expensive  race in the history of the country, over $50 million has been spent on a  Congressional race just to put that in the proper perspective.  When I ran  Reagan 49 state victory we spent $40 million so the publicly financed  campaign $50 million on a singular Congressional pain.  I ran a  Congressional committee in numbers of years ago and my whole budget was in  $50 million here in and across the country.  So the irony here is this to  be interpreted as a Trump victory or Trump defeat in which Trump really  didn't play very much of a part, the Democrats running as a new Democrat,  Karen Handel was one of very, very effective race on the start of the close  I can't tell who's going to win but it's a dead even race today with more  money spent than ever before.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is so incredible and by the way, Jon Ossoff doesn't even  live in the district, right?</p><p> ROLLINS:  He's two hours outside the district.</p><p> HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP FUNDS:  And although have  Trump had a little to do with this race, what does this mean for the Trump  agenda going forward?</p><p> ROLLINS:  Specials are always over-interpreted and their totally different  dug and it's five or six specials every cycle between the elections.  But  this clearly if Handel wins, the Trump people certainly well justifiably  argue to their benefit if not the Democrats will argue this is a rejection  of Trump even though Trump really was a debater very much and a course.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this is a Republican district all the way back to a red new  days.</p><p> ROLLINS:  This is (INAUDIBLE) this is the district he first won.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> ROLLINS:  The Democrats have changed slightly and I don't think you should  over-interpreted but it's an Atlantic District It's a big media market, but  it's some time want to watch very closely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  James.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSISTANT EDITOR EDITORIAL PAGE:   I've just want to relate, this Ossoff message he's a former staff or for  very liberal Democratic member of Congress, he's raised money from  Democrats all around the country calling himself independent.  When people  ask him if his force Nancy Pelosi, he said he hadn't given them an ounce of  thought.  Is that possibly true? </p><p> ROLLINS:  No.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then talks an independent, no.</p><p> ROLLINS:  And I promise you if he gets elected tomorrow or tonight which I  hope doesn't happen, he'll be played Nancy Pelosi is going to first words  out of his mouth and he thanked you, madam leader, where do I sit?  And how  do I vote, I think that's the key thing. </p><p> SHAFFER:  Do you think it's working?</p><p> ROLLINS:  It's worked there, I mean, it's a -- again, it's not as much a  Republican district as it used to be, Trump carried the district by about  two points in the fall.  And again I don't want to be over-interpreted I  just think it's, it is going to have an impact on recruiting in a certain.   We're going to talk about first few days here but it's not the end game.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow it's a real plead heat and voters are also headed to the  polls in South Carolina and the South Carolina fifth district.  This is to  fill the seat of the one, formerly held on Mick Mulvaney, that hasn't got  nearly as much attention but this is also an important race.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Two important race all over the Democrats have an wait much of a  battle there.  So we should win that race in for some reason they come  close the Democrats without spending much money then that I think of South  Carolina is a more of an indicator of what's occurring here.  I think the  reality here is we're going to move full, that's a very tough battles ahead  and I think the polarization that were talking about in the beginning of  this segment is very severe in the Congress and the problem is there's not  enough, Republicans don't have enough Republicans to do all of things they  want to do, even if they have majority and there's not enough money for  both sides to do all that they want to do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One of the things they want to do is repeal and replace  Obamacare, they say that there is going to be a vote in the Senate next  week Ed, and then they are talking about tax reforms after the summer.  Do  you still think the agenda getting executed as viable this year? </p><p> ROLLINS:  I think it's tough, I think no one holds what's in the Senate  bill and Senator McConnell it's pretty much his bill so the few people  getting their advice, it's still not poputive a House bill was overwhelm  not (INAUDIBLE).  However it comes out as a big selling job that has to  take place there's only one person that can sell it, and that's the  President.  The President has to go out across this country and the only  criticism I have of the President today is you can't do one-day events, you  can't go out and say today is infrastructure day and tomorrow is tech day  and what you have.  If he wants to sell health care he's going to be out  there every day for weeks and weeks and weeks telling American public why  this is going to work and why it's better than Obamacare.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point, Ed.</p><p> SHAFFER:  On the issue of Senate and from what they're doing with the  health care bill, I see a lot of changes coming that's going to have to go  into some sort of a reconciliation between the House again.  Quick question  do you see the House staying though August?  Do you see that the potential  have actually -</p><p> ROLLINS:  I wish they would but that's what (INAUDIBLE) wish thanking for,  odd realistic.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They have talked about it, right?</p><p> ROLLINS:  They have talked about it but the bottom-line is they never gave  that up, they've all got junkyards that are all going back home and they've  got vacation plans like everybody else.  I just wish they wouldn't take so  many vacations, I think this is very serious year, we've got some very big  issues today the speakers speech is going to be very, very important on the  tax - what is his tax plan has the guy knows more about the taxes than  anybody and he's going to basically give anything or that basically don't  know about so far.  I think getting this tax plan through a tax reform is  critical, I think health care is important but I think tax is critical -</p><p> ZUMARAGGA:  It's also critical for the stock market and were reaching all- time highs because of tax reform may happen -</p><p> ROLLINS:  It's the hope and so for some reason, we go to the next two  months and we don't think it's going to happen, I think markets going to  change.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well it's also Republicans political survival next fall is  they're going to get the economy growing faster.</p><p> ROLLINS:  That's the promise the President made the rest of it is totally  relevant.  The international stuff that he's all dealing with it is  critical as part of any Presidents responsibility but what he promised the  American public, so I'm going to fix the economy and I want to create jobs  your lives going to be better and there's a whole lot of stuff has to  happen for that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is what is going to leave voters in 2018, for the next  group of elections, do you think voters will remember the way that the left  has been obstructing and basically pushing back on the agenda that America  voters - </p><p> ROLLINS:  I think the problems is you have both sides are very polarized,  so Democrats aren't being turned off by this activity and Republicans, the  same way, it's so if two very anti entities out there and I think the  bottom line is those that are independents and the worry that I think Trump  has is that some of the independents who voted for him in the fall are  starting to back away and independents carry the day today.</p><p> FREEMAN:  OK.  And just given that we had this attempted assassination last  week, do you think it's time for Democrats to stop calling themselves the  resistance?</p><p> ROLLINS:  Yes. </p><p> FREEMAN:  As if they are French freedom fighters battling the Nazis  - </p><p> ROLLINS:  They're very important that the rhetoric get toned down, I mean  you can go fight on the floor, and make whatever kinds of comments you  want, but you got cut stop this personal attack and you got to quit  basically making enemies out of the opposite side.  Part of the breakdown  I've been around the game 50 years is it used to be there was social you  can still fight still be partisan. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But you go have a cup of coffee.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  Still have a couple coffee or drink or dinner what have you, you  have to know his at his family's and you realize we're all Americans today  they don't sit together they don't talk together staffers don't meet  together and they just are polarized they hate each and  that's other a  terrible place to be.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean listen to Chuck Schumer yesterday, saying that,  you know, they are passing something in the dead of night as if nobody  remembers the way Obamacare was passed, and stuck down everybody's throat. </p><p> ZUMARAGGA:  And that what he said you'll find out what's in the bill when  it is passed. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what Nancy Pelosi said.</p><p> ROLLINS:  And unfortunate all those words are going to coming back this  time if we don't do it differently and that's my concern at this point in  time.  I think we got to get this thing drafted I don't have any problems  Senator McConnell of doing it.  I just think it has to get very open we're  going to have a big debate on it, people have to know what this is all  about if not we'll pay a heavy price. </p><p> ZUMARAGGA:  And we'll give Chuck Schumer more than 10 hours, to see what's  in the bill. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He wants for this than ever that's what he said as well.  Ed  great to see you</p><p> ROLLINS:  My pleasure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much great insights as always from Ed Rollins.   Coming up Amazon's deal to acquire whole foods could send cashiers packing  the potential trouble ahead for grosser is it going robotic?

Alibaba has already  done millions and millions of jobs in China and China e-commerce.  By the  way, the only sales reported are 771 billion clearly out places that are in  the United States.  This year, it is at 446 billion in the hopes of trying  to get U.S. businesses to now work with Alibaba.  That in itself is a big  deal.</p><p> Jack Ma also has power in bringing head of UPS in order to make this deal  happen.  There are concerns because you have these sellers lacking the  clarity of merchandise and can step in trying to woo U.S, besides creating  jobs to Amazon -- we know Amazon made that nearly $14 billion deal with  Whole Foods.  Reports are now going to use strategy of Amazon so that  customers can now walk around the store with no cashiers, just technology  sensors, streamers, and maybe humans just in the back monitoring things at  the place.  You can walk out with items with human interaction but the  problem with initial platform is that when the store is getting too crowded  in a prolonged time, it can no longer monitor what the customer has picked  up.  They say -- we will keep an eye on the business that's at stake.  </p><p> There is also talk of new stores that may not be exactly Whole Foods, you  know, and new brands as well, that may be less price because the stocks are  trying to shed that Whole Foods, whole paycheck image and trying to make it  ready for everybody.  Maria, back to you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Nicole Petallides, thank you so much.  We will  watch that.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, final thoughts  from our all-star panel.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Final thoughts from our all-stars.  Heather. </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  A big week ahead we got rate hikes, Sessions testimony may be  in public or private and big tech names to watch. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Buckle up, that's what you're saying. </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Buckle up. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  James Freeman.</p><p> FREEMAN:  I'm watching the text docs too, I also want to say happy  anniversary mom and dad Steve and Gloria Block. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How many years?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  A lot.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Bad son.  But he did wish you a happy anniversary on air.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  The federal reserve is set to raise quarter basis points again  on Wednesday, I'm more interested to see if they hint that unwinding their  balance sheet and reducing some a little the liquidity that helps prop the  markets up. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That we probably won't find out until the fall I think  Septembers the application for that.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Maybe.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks to Heather and James, see you all.  All right, we will  leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow with another big show.  As  request \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is on deck.  Stu, take it away. </p><p> 830</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Thanks for joining  us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Tuesday, June 20th.  Here are your top  stories 6:00 A.M. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump takes aim at North Korea after Otto Warmbier dies days  after returning to the United States with severe brain damage.  The company  that took into the country now saying it will no longer take Americans  there.  It says a tragedy like this should never be repeated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, a push for reform this morning.  \"The Wall  Street Journal\" reporting a health care vote will take place next week.   The administration holding firm that tax reform will also get done this  year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF TREASURY:  I have no higher priority than  having tax reform done this year.  We're working every day.  We're working  with the house and the senate.  We're committed to get this done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Plus, a contentious moment between Senators Mitch McConnell and  Chuck Schumer coming up.</p><p>It is technically not even summer.  But the southwest is facing a dangerous  heat wave this morning.  Temperatures already near triple digits today.  We  will give you the latest.</p><p>And the heat taking a toll.  American Airlines has cancelled more than a  dozen flights.  More than 1,000 needed medical attention at the Electric  Daisy Concert in Las Vegas.</p><p>Markets look like this this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a  mixed opening for the broader averages.  Fractionally better on the  session.  The Dow and the S&amp;P coming up of a record close yesterday.   Looking to extend that today with fractional moves in the upside.  Dow  Industrial sets to open up about 10 points.  Ditto for the NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe, the indices look like this.  Take a look.  European indices  higher across the board with the CAC quarante in Paris, best performer up  about a third of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower, meanwhile.  Take a look.  As  you see the best performer was the Nikkei in Japan that was up one percent.   The others down fractionally.</p><p>Tom Brady wants to play an NFL game outside of the U.S.  We will reveal  where he says is his dream country to play one day.  All those stories  coming up this morning.</p><p>And joining me to talk about it, financial analyst Heather Zumarraga is  with us.  Wall Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James  Freeman is with us.  And the London Center for Policy Research, Vice  President Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer is here.  Great to see you.</p><p>TONY SHAFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Great seeing you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's on top this morning, James?  What do you think of the  big stories?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, at long last, patients, doctors, taxpayers may finally see  the beginning of the end of ObamaCare.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  They were looking for a vote next week.  So  we'll see that.  We will talk about all of that this morning.</p><p>Coming up joining the conversation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is with  us today.  Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn is with us today.  Fox  News Military analyst, Jack Keane is here.  Harvard law professor emeritus  Alan Dershowitz is here.  And former Raegan campaign advisor, Ed Rollins is  here as well.  You don't want to miss moments of it.  So just stay with us  throughout the show.</p><p>We kick it off this hour right now with Otto Warmbier.  The American  student imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months and sent back to the United  States in a persistent vegetative state last week, died yesterday.  He died  at the tender age of 22 years old.  Doctors treating the University of  Virginia student said late last week that Warmbier had extensive loss of  brain tissue and he was in the state of unresponsive wakefulness.</p><p>Warmbier had been sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea for  allegedly stealing a propaganda poster during an organized tour to the  isolated country.  The Chinese company behind Young Pioneer Tours, the tour  company that sent him there now says it will stop taking U.S. citizens to  North Korea.</p><p>President Trump weighed in on the sad news from the White House.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Otto Warmbier has just  passed away.  He spent a year and a half in North Korea.  A lot of bad  things happened.  But at least we got him home to be with his parents where  they were so happy to see him, even though he was in very tough condition.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Warmbier's parents Fred and Cindy put the blame squarely at  North Korea writing in a statement, \"Unfortunately the awful torturous  mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensure that  no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today.</p><p>Tony, your take on these developments.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, look, there's no doubt in my mind he was tortured.  Let's  be very clear what happened here.  And I've already said another interviews  I think there needs to be some level of retaliation.  I'll just be that  direct about it.  My son is 23.  I cannot imagine the pain these parents  are going through.  This is truly tragic.</p><p>My understanding from talking to the experts, he was tortured not so much  the way where you'd be pulling fingernails out with tools, but by repeated  drugging, sodium pentothal.  The idea was they were trying to figure out if  he was a CIA spy or not.  He wasn't.  And the continued and repeated  exposure over that year to these drugs is what caused the consistent and  persistent damage of the entire brain.  So it was essentially the use of  these drugs over and over again which caused the brain damage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, there were some reports that he went into the vegetative  state just recently, a couple of weeks ago.  So, was that -- </p><p>SHAFER:  I don't buy that.  I think this -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The whole time you think he was just drugged?</p><p>SHAFFER:  I think they started during his confinement and did it over and  over.  And I think of the reasons they released him --I mean no doubt,  President Trump saw this and started dealing with it early on.  But no  doubt they kind of like saw that some things are going to go tragically  wrong.  We better get this guy out of here, anyway.  So let's serve their  purpose to get him out.</p><p>The parents got their boy back, their son back.  But again, Maria, it does  not change the fact that he was tortured.  This is something that we should  not stand for.  And I believe that President Trump recognizes how hideous  this is and something requires a response.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And what kind of response do you expect? Should be  warranted.</p><p>SHAFFER:  We in the Cold War, we had organizations which focused on is what  they called dirty tricks in the old days.  Look, we need to rethink our  foreign policy.  We cannot simply sit back and let dictators, horrible  people like Kim Jong-un do these things and think they can get away with  it.  There's been no push back.  This is a remote analogy.  But we just  shut down a certain aircraft.  We haven't shut down an aircraft since 1999.    So I think it's time we re-insinuate ourselves in foreign policy in a way  that the -- those bad guys like Un understand there's going to be  consequences for bad behavior.  There's been no bad consequences for  decades.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Otto's parents said that.  Look, President Obama told us to  be quite.  President Trump took our son home.  James, how do you see it?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, this is one of the last to the old style dictatorships.   This is what communists, dictatorships so.  I think it was probably  surprising to a lot of people over the last year following this news that  you actually tend to travel to North Korea.  To this point, the state  department has a -- had a strong warning and I think maybe you'd expect  from now it would be something more like a -- like a band -- I mean,  obviously they don't treat visitors any better than they treat their own  people.  And this -- for anyone who didn't realize that, yes, this is a  wake up call.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  But so maybe we should it be there  though.  There are some -- to some extent, we shouldn't be going to these  places.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But this was a tour company from China, Heather.  I mean, if  you've got a tour company, you may be thinking that you're OK and that  you're with a safe group.</p><p>Let's switch gears to the standoff in the senate right now.  Because this  is also a piece of important business today.  Republicans are aiming for a  vote on the health care bill next week.  A full week ahead of the July 4th  recess since the democrats have begun using parliamentary maneuvers to slow  down business in the chamber though to protest any bill including a series  of back to back speeches on the floor yesterday.</p><p>In one exchange, minority leader Chuck Schumer press his counterpart, Mitch  McConnell to commit to an open debate.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER:  When we have time more than 10  hours, since this is a complicated bill to review the bill, will it be  available to us and the public, more than 10 hours before we have to vote  for it.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER:  I think we'll have an ample  opportunity to read and amend the bill.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you see republicans pushing through to get this done before  July 4th, James Freeman?  And also, what's your take on this ostracism?   They're basically telling you in advance.  Look, we're going to do long  speeches.  We're going to do whatever it takes to waste time so this  doesn't get done?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So a lot of theatrics.  I think the republicans will get it  done.  It's interesting there.   You look at Chuck Schumer saying, I want  10 hours to read bill.  Of course, if you took another clip from that  speech he was saying, as he often does that this is a terrible bill and  he's opposed to it.  So he's not -- he's not an over minded voter here  looking to consider the measure.  He doesn't need 10 hours.  He's already  against it without even having seen it because this is the Obama legacy  project, no matter how bad it's failing.  They have tied themselves to it  politically and they're going to do well of the parliamentary moves they  can do to slow it down but they can't and it'll pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there any chance though that they are able to stop any  business whatsoever that the Trump administration trust to put forth?   That's the whole plan.  Let his president be a president that gets nothing  done.  Let this congress be get nothing done congress that we take the  house in '18 and we impeach him in '20?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think that will work.  Because if you basically make it  impossible to do business, what they're going to do is they're going to  kill the legislative filibuster which still exists and allows them to block  things like -- any measure that can't get 60 votes.  Now, health care is  different because they're going through this recompilation process.  But  basically if they put up a big roadblock like they did with Gorsuch, it'  going to hurt their agenda because they're not going to be able to stop  anything else.  It seems a lot of republicans are going to say, enough.   We're going to filibuster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So then you do think a health care vote happens?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me ask you about House Speaker Paul Ryan.  He  sets to deliver his first major speech on tax reform today.  According to  the excerpts of the speech that have been released, he's expected to urge  republicans, \"We need to get his done in 2017.  We cannot let this once in  a generation moment slip.\"</p><p>Now, Heather, if we don't see tax reform, big implications from markets?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, the markets have been up hitting all-time highs.  Yet  again, I think Futures are up today.  We'll see if the Dow can hit new  highs today.  It's tax reform.  It's health care.  That's what it's all  about.  That's what the markets are running on right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James, what do you want to hear from Paul Ryan today?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'd like to hear him say that the number one priority is growing  this economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what he's going to say.  You know that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I'm worried that he's also going to say that this has got  to be revenue natural.  We've got to stick with the conventions of beltway  score keeping no matter how flawed they are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And that means the border adjustment tax or higher  corporate rate or some kind of a revenue, right?</p><p>FREEMAN:  They've got to get the corporate rate into the teams if we want a  real game changer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Tony?</p><p>SHAFFER:  Look, I think what we've seen over and over again is reluctant  facts to actually break out of what we know doesn't work.  The scoring  system, we know doesn't work, doesn't matter.  The democrats always refer  to it.  And what I don't understand why the republicans haven't gone back  and looked at the numbers that CBO did on the original estimates for  ObamaCare and look at how wildly of they were.  So it's kind of like how is  that you don't just look at what bad work they did and say throw it out  because it doesn't work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  It's funny to hear Chuck Schumer say, well, when  you do things in the dark of night.  Excuse me, ObamaCare was done in the  dark of night.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  No.  Find out what's in the bill after we pass the bill.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nancy Pelosi.  We have the Trump tweets to tell you about the  president is tweeting this morning.  And we want to bring you to you right  now President Trump just tweeting about the Georgia special election.   \"Democrat Jon Ossoff who wants to raise your taxes to the highest level and  is weak on crime and security doesn't even live in the district.  Karen  Handel for congress, she will fight for lower taxes, great health care,  strong security.  A hard worker who will never give up.  Vote today.</p><p>We've got more analysis on this.  The special election happening in  Georgia.  Of course it's real important.  It's the most money, right?  In  the congressional election.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Ossoff has raised more than 23 million bucks.  He's got about  five times the money that Karen Handel has.  He's raising his money  basically outside of Georgia.  So it's going to be a question of whether  people want to -- Georgia voters want to allow the rest of the country's  liberals to use them as a vehicle to oppose the president.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does this tell us anything, I mean, if Ossoff wins or Handel  wins, does this tell us anything about the republican party or democratic  party today do you think?  Is this going to be sort of an indicator?</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, Georgia has been one of the states that the democrats have  been trying to turn for a while.  I mean, there was during the last  election cycle, I believe, which was not founded on anything real that they  could turn this state blue and they didn't.  But I think you see over and  over again, every election, we've seen special cycle election, outside  money's been donated heavily and they've lost every time.  And I think it's  going to happen again here because the overwhelming feeling still is that I  think people want to give President Trump time to get his act together.  I  think this is a microcosm of other things.  And Georgia still I think is  more red than blue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We'll take a short break.  We have a lot more  on the congressional race today.</p><p>But first, let's take a break.  A heat wave is striking the southwest.  The  national weather service predicting highs of 120 degrees today with some  states already having canceled flights to the region.  We're on it next.   Stay with us.  Quick break.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A brutal heat wave hitting the southwest United  States.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Maria.  OK.   Temperatures could reach 120 degrees today in parts of Arizona for the  first time in more than 20 years.  This is a record-breaking 122 that  happened back in 1990.  Also, the city of Las Vegas and southern California  bracing for what authorities are calling a public health hazard.  Death  Valley could reach temperatures as high as 124 degrees.</p><p>Airlines also watching the weather, at least -- excuse me, 20 American  Airlines flights out of Arizona have already been cancelled because those  planes can't operate over a temperature of 118.  That's according to a  statement from the airline.  It's the smaller aircraft.  Americans saying  that flight changes are going to be free of charge for passengers.</p><p>Meanwhile, one person is dead and nearly 1,000 needed medical attention on  site at the Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas.  Sixteen other people  taken to a local hospital.  According to -- still can't determine the cause  of death for 34-year-old Michael Morse.  He passed away after attending the  festival on Saturday.  The heat though could have been a factor.  The  temperature in Las Vegas reach 110 degrees.  He experienced convulsions  about 3:23 in the morning.  According to police there, a total of 340  medical calls were handled on Saturday.</p><p>And you were just talking about this, Maria.  Over 140,000 ballots have  already been cast in the Georgia congressional race for democrat John  Ossoff is looking to defeat Karen Handel.  Ossoff raising, a record setting  15 million.  President Trump tweeting on the election just saying this, big  day tomorrow in Georgia and South Carolina.  ObamaCare is dead.  Dems wants  to raise taxes big.  They can only obstruct.  No ideas vote \"R.\"  And this  coming as a new ad pack - ad paid for by PAC supporting Handel is receiving  backlash for showing images of House Majority Whip Scalise after he was  shot in a baseball game last week.  The spokesperson for Handel condemning  that act saying, \"For any group to use the shootings this week for  political or personal benefit is shameful.  This group should be ashamed.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, South Carolina also holding elections.  Democrat Archie Parnell  faces republican Paul Norman to replace Mick Mulvaney.  And of course the  president tapped to be budget director.  That election is going to test if  the republican candidate can gain support from largely African-American  districts, Maria.  So a lot going on politically today.  Those were your  headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl.  Thanks so much.  Coming up next, record  closing for the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 yesterday.  Technology stops once again  rebounding and leading this market high.  We're taking a closer look at  markets and the best performers, next.</p><p>Then play a game, win a job.  Jaguar L, Land Rover's new technique for  recruiting engineers straight ahead.  Stay with us right here \"Mornings  with Maria.\"  After this.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Stocks looking to extend yesterday's record run.   The gains driven by the technology sector yesterday.  Of course, tech has  been down and now it looks like it's stabilizing a bit in recent weeks.</p><p>Joining us right now is GFI Group chief macro strategist, John Spallanzani.   John good to see you.</p><p>JOHN SPALLANZANI, CHIEF MACRO STRATEGIST, GFI GROUP:  Good seeing you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's going on in markets right now?  Is money coming back  into technology after the Amazon announcement of the Whole Foods?</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  I think we saw some rotation out of tech and into some of the  big financial names.  Hopefully that they're expecting some tax relief.   Obviously a steeper occur because the Fed hike rates.  I think that we see  small caps catching a bit again.  Those have been flat for a while, for six  months.  We've been consolidating all those stocks that run up after the  election kind of went sideways and now we're starting to see some rotations  which is healthy in the market.</p><p>The NASDAQ is up 16 percent.  The S&amp;P is almost up 10 percent now.  So we  saw a lot of momentum into, again, the dime and so there was a bit  divergence between tech last week was down like 150 basis points.  But yet,  the diamonds were up 180 basis points.  So those are three percent swing in  one week where guys obviously rotating out of tech and then for someone  bigger names.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then bigger names and you say diamond.  Bigger names -- </p><p>SPALLANZANI:  The Dow stocks and also the S&amp;P stocks.  People are expecting  the effective tax rates and corporations to go down.  So those corporations  with the highest effective tax rates right now are being targeted because  they're going to get the biggest boost if we do get some taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  targeted to buy.  So Wall Street still believes in tax reform  in '17 is what you're saying?</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  I think the media is more interested in '17 and '18.  I think  right now we're just worried about the message.  But the message is good  right now.  And I think that whether it's '17 or '18, there's other good  things.  Earnings are obviously very good.  I don't think -- we didn't see  -- this rally is not based on multiple expansions.  It's really based on  earnings so far.</p><p>So if you look at stock multiples compared to credit and bonds, stocks are  still cheap relative to the other two.  So, where else are you going to put  your money?</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  But they are still expensive relative to their earnings  historically -- that's a hard metric to pin down.  Because -- OK.  Let's  say they're not relative to their earnings.  Here's on the upper level.   Here's where I'm wondering is how much of this is company's doing well, how  much is the optimism surrounding Trump and reform and how much is still  very loose monetary policy around the world?  We're -- in the U.S. kind of  taking baby steps toward going back to normal.  But in central banks, they  printed a lot of money.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Last week, even though we raised, a lot of people are point out  that the central banks around the world, including Europe and Japan are  still easing at a rate of $1 trillion, so global central banks are still  easing although we're increasing rates in the U.S.</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  Yes.  There's still a lot of capital around.  I think the  other reason why our yield curve is so flat because, again, treasuries are  tier one capital that everybody has not the balance sheets.  There's no  alternative to treasuries, really.  So, do you want to invest in goes to 27  basis points?  Which is like last night.  What do you want it by treasury  220?  That's the trade.  So there's not a lot of alternatives to what you  have going on.  So that's another thing that's keeping rates down that's  helping.</p><p>Just last night, just this morning, Carney said, I'm not going to tight in  -- the Bank of England is not going to tie because he fears that we have  still on present talks, want to go slow.  Les Evans.  Last night again that  listen, we're not going to tight in -- we might not tight in September,  maybe December because inflation is still undershooting the Feds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  So the Fed is still a major factor here, is what you're  saying.  And Easy money around the world.</p><p>Let me ask you, what would you do right now?  Do you want to put money into  this market here knowing that maybe health care reform gets done next week?   I mean, the health care bill rather, the vote.  And then tax reform later  in the year.  And then what about Europe?</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  I think steady as she goes.  I mean, it's evitable for quite  a long time.  I still think that we're at 2,500 now.  Have a few bets,  personal bets to - we might hit 2,700 by the end of the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  In the S&amp;P 500.  Yup.  That's a big -- it's a big move from  here.  But it's still June and there's so much left that we could do and  especially if the Fed does not hike in September, there's not a lot of  resistance above.</p><p>I think right now, when I'm watching, is the unemployment rate next in July  rate.  If we start to see that tick higher then I would get more concerned.   Right now, unemployment is obviously very low.  And also wages are kind of  not so hot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  Stagnant.</p><p>SHAFFER:  I have a quick question on Brexit.  We had one year anniversary  couple days ago.  They're starting to make their negotiations.  How do you  see your stocks worth rolling as a negotiation starts?</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  European stocks have been actually performing better than --  that's my marker right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  With the easy money there, yes.</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  Yes, the easy money.  But I think that May has got problems,  right?  So we see that the more problems May has, the higher the market  goes in Europe, right?  So that meeting that Brexit is not going to be a  hard Brexit. So I think new markets going to discounting that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Oil price is down.  Okay.</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  Who would have thought that oil via 44 and the stocks be at  2,500.  So oil is a technology driven story, not a supply story and not a  recessionary story.  That's a huge positive oil being a 44.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.  A technology story?</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  Fracking and the ability for the U.S. to be one of the  biggest exporters in the world and that's really Trump's</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John, great to see you.  Thank you so much.  John Spallanzani  joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, police reportedly identified the man suspected of plowing his  van into a crowded London.  47-year-old, Darren Osborne is arrested by  authorities on suspicion of terrorist offences.</p><p>And then technology giants headed to Washington.

And as you say, it's  going to be an extension of that even if it's just fractionally.  Dow  Industrials set to open about 14 points today.  In Europe, the major  averages are mostly higher.  Take a look.  The FT-100 up a fraction, the  CAC Quarante in Paris is up a third of a percent.  In the DAX Index in  Germany up a quarter of a percent.  In Asia overnight, stocks closed mostly  lower with the Exception of Japan.  The Hang Seng, the Shanghai, and the  KOSPI all down.  The Nikkei averaging Japan up almost one percent.  </p><p>And the GOAT takes on the Great Wall.  NFL legend, Tom Brady says his dream  is to play a game in China.  Our top story this half an hour, though, let's  kick it off here with the top names and technology meeting the President  Trump yesterday.  The White House is teaming up with industry leaders to  modernize the government's technology infrastructure, and strengthen cyber  security.  The President spoke yesterday about why he's turning to the tech  titans to help achieve those goals. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT:  The businesses represented here  today employed hundreds of thousands of American workers.  Your innovation  has shaped the modern world and created millions of jobs.  America should  be the global leader in government technology just as we are in every other  aspect, and we are going to start our big edge again in technology.  It's  such an important industry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.   Secretary Ross, it's always a pleasure.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE.  Good to see you again,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the President is estimating that this initiative could save  the U.S. a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.  How would it work,  take us behind the meeting and what was most important yesterday?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, these factors that the government not just the federal but  also state and local government generally has not spent very much on  upgrading their technology.  A lot of archaic equipment that's been used,  lot of equipment where you can barely get proper support anywhere.   And  there are various estimates that the government may be spending, something  like $90 billion a year on maintaining systems that fundamentally are  obsoleted by modern standards.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are these companies ready and willing to help in this effort?   There were 18 CEOs there yesterday.  What kind of a sense did you get from  companies of what they will actually do to achieve that goal?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, the real specifics of the plan haven't been worked out  (INAUDIBLE) but they all acknowledge the need.  They all acknowledge that  the -- if we thought about capital expenditure rather than maintenance,  we'd be a lot better off.  So, there's a lot of investigation as to the  extent to which we could simply reinvest in equipment, funding that  otherwise would have to go for maintenance.  It's kind of a juggling act.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I could totally see that.  And you think this will - this would  save a trillion dollars over 10 years?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, it certainly can be a very, very big number, as I've said.   There's something like 90 billion a year or more that's spent on  maintenance of the equipment and maintaining an obsolete thing.  Think  about your car.  Once your car gets to be, what, 10 years old, you start  putting in inordinate amount into its maintenance relatively to what would  be the maintenance on a vehicle.  So, one of the peculiarities of  government accounting is that a capital expenditure and in expense more or  less treated the same way from a budgetary point of view whereas the  capital expenditure has enduring value, it has a long-term asset value,  whereas the maintenance, the out of pocket expense that just comes in is  just gone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see that the Homeland Security Secretary was there.  Wilbur,  let me ask you about security and what came around that topic.  You've got  the leaders of some of these companies that can actually have a real hand  in helping protect our data cybersecurity huge issue.  And then, of course,  there's the extremisms in terms of content online.  What was said about  those topics?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, Homeland Security and cyber security are inextricably in  linked together.  And cybersecurity is a problem everywhere.  You've seen  some of the recent hacking in (INAUDIBLE) a very, very big scale.  Some of  which were for commercial purposes.  Others of which appear perhaps to have  been for national security purposes.  So, I think we're going to find.  The  defenders of security, cybersecurity, keep developing new firewalls, new  ways to keep the bad people out.  And yet, there's a great deal of  ingenuity on the part of the hackers to figure out new ways to intrude and  new ways to be disruptive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they sure are.  Let's talk trade, Secretary.  I enjoyed  that piece with you and the Journal the other day in terms of the  conservation on trade.  We're all trying to figure out when we'll see tax  reform?  It's so important for the economy, moving the needle on growth.   And tit's so important, of course, for the markets as well.  Are you  expecting that we will see some kind of attacks at the border?  I mean,  maybe it's not a border adjustment tax because we know that the President  is not in favor of that.  But maybe it's a reciprocal tax or some kind of   other tracks at the border in terms of trade with our friends across the  world?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, the border-adjustable tax was not proposed particularly as a  U.S. agenda item.  The border-adjustable tax was proposed mainly to help  balance the budget.  As you know, the to get to reconciliation when there  are different bills passed by the House from the one passed by the Senate,  you need to have a certain scoring by the Congressional Budget Office,  namely over a 10-year horizon to break even.  That means that you have to  fill some holes.  And the border-adjustable tax idea was a - idea that  Chairman Brady, I believe, come out with in order to just try to fill that  hole.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you have to fill the whole, though?  I mean that's the  point.  I mean, do you - do you need to see some kind of revenue raised, or  can you do way with this whole idea of deficit neutral?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, the rules for reconciliation are fairly clear, and as I  understand them, you need to be neutral or at the tenured time horizon.   And the recon we need the reconciliation is that it's unlikely that the  House and Senate will pass exactly the same bill.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, if we - if we don't see a border adjustment tax in the tax  portion of this, in terms of trade, you're overseeing, you're expecting any  other kind of tax, like a reciprocal tax, something at the border.</p><p>ROSS:  Well, remember, the U.S. budget until well into the 20th century.   Main component had been tariffs.  So, tariffs are nothing new to the  financing of the U.S. government, but we've long past that with the advent  of personal income tax and corporate tax, so now border adjustable or some  such thing is simply one way to fill up a portion of a hole.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll see - we'll see if it ends up there.  I know  that you'll be taking the lead on renegotiating the North America Free  Trade Agreement, NAFTA, later this year.  And then, of course, today,  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is talking about irritants with his  counterparts from Canada and Mexico, including the dairy trade dispute with  sugar exports.  What are your priorities in terms of setting the stage for  NAFTA talks, Secretary? </p><p>ROSS:  Well, we - Ambassador Lighthizer already has made a preliminary  report to the Congress explaining the big bold letter headlines for NAFTA  renegotiation.  They'll be a much more detailed one filed middle of July  because 30 days before the August 15th date when the 90-day clock finally  ticks, where the administration is required to give Congress more detail on  the objectives for NAFTA.  So, that's when there will be a fairly detail  exposition of the objective.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, the sugar issue is one thing that you've spoken about.   Is there's an overriding issue that's problematic with the current form?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, the sugar deal has been resolved.  We reached the agreement  with the Mexican government and with the U.S. sugar industry.  We filed it  some days ago.  It's not out for public commentary but doesn't require  congressional vote and since the key parties to the original trade case now  are finally all on board with the solution, I don't think they'll be that  much controversy about it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And is there another priority that you want to make sure to  tackle as a result of your be getting this?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, what would be a good thing would be if we could get rid of  some of the other issues with Canada, for example, the softwood lumber and  potentially the dairy management issue that Secretary Perdue was talking  about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  In terms of -- Secretary, the new trade deals actually  moving the needle on growth, what are your expectations?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, the growth plans of the administration have several components  to them.  Trade is certainly one but tax reform, regulatory reform,  unleashing the energy that we have in the ground and infrastructure are all  also essential ingredients to getting the Trump program for three percent  growth.  So, we need all of those pieces to get to the objective.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We are watching that in terms of these pieces  coming together.  Secretary Ross, do you think that when we see all of  these issues whether it be your renegotiating of NAFTA, you know, the tax  reform, the health care bill, do you think these things will get done this  year, or are you expecting - are you looking over the next three years?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, the NAFTA has a fairly natural time horizon in that - think  about next year, the trade promotion authority which is an essential  ingredient to our being able to negotiate trade treaties, that expires July  of 2018.  There's also the Mexican Presidential election in July 2018 and  then in the fall of '18, you have the mid-term congressional elections  here.  So as you move well into next year, the political calendar will  become very complicated in terms of any big transaction like a NAFTA  renegotiation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Sure.  Wilbur Ross, good to see you.  Thank you so  much.</p><p>ROSS:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary Wilbur Ross joining us.  We will be right back</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are looking higher today.  Take a look,  Futures indicating a gain of about 12 points on the Dow Industrials at the  open this morning, 12 on the NASDAQ as well, after the S&amp;P and the - and  the Dow Industrials, rather, both hit record highs yesterday.  A couple of  names on the move this morning, more job cuts coming to general motors.   The automaker is set to layoff nearly 1,000 workers to its sedan plant in  Kansas City, Kansas.  GM notified the workers of plans to eliminate a third  shift at the plant late last week.</p><p>We're watching shares of Apple this morning.  The company is shaking up  subscription options for its Apple music streaming service, TechCrunch is  reporting users now have the option to pay $99 for 12-month subscription,  works out so just over $8 a month.  Monthly individual plans currently cost  $9.99.  </p><p>Authorities have identified and arrested the man suspected of mowing down a  crowd at a London mosque earlier Monday.  Cheryl Casone with the details.   Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, that's right, Maria.   So, the victims were leaving Ramadan prayers at the time of the attack.   The suspect identified as 47-year-old, Darren Osborne of Cardiff Wales.   Osborne was arrested on suspicion of terror offenses.  At least 1 person  was killed, 10 others injured in that assault which authorities are  treating as a terrorist attack.  And investigators in France say that the  man suspected of trying to attack security forces on the Champs-Elysees in  Paris, Monday afternoon has been flagged by investigators earlier for  extremism.  The man ran this car into a police van and afterward,  authorities found a rifle and explosives in that vehicle.  That suspect  died.</p><p>Well, another headlines this morning.  JaguarLand Rover is hiring and  they're making the application process pretty interesting.  They (AUDIO  GAP) 5,000 software engineers, electronic experts and others, but instead  of using job fairs and ads to attract the applicants, potential employees  are asked to assemble a Jaguar sports car then tackle a series of code- breaking puzzles.  They teamed up with the app, Gorillaz.  We should say in  2011, Marriott asked applicants to manage a virtual hotel so it's not  really a new idea but interesting.  </p><p>And get ready to pay more for shipping this Christmas.  UPS says it's going  to add a holiday surcharge per package as much as 97 cents per package.   UPS wants to recoup some money for increased staffing, extra planes and  vehicles added during the holiday season but this could be tough for  retailers, Maria.  Remember, they're promising free ground shipping, a lot  of them.  So here's the question, do you charge your customers more or do  you eat the surcharge? We'll see what they decide.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But first of all, I'm a little uncomfortable talking about  Christmas right now.  We're having - </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- summertime, but OK.  I will take your bait, Cheryl.  In  terms of this higher cost around holidays, guys, big deal?</p><p>LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Look, I think I  would -- if I were the folks selling the stuff, I would go eat the cost.  I  think it --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Eat it?</p><p>SHAFFER:  Yes.  I mean, Amazon is doing, I think, pretty well with its  Prime, and I look at it, and I don't know how they can afford to send me  stuff in two days sometimes.  I know they have preset stuff, but it's, you  know, I don't know.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND THE WALL STREET JOURNAL  ASSISTANT  EDITOR:  Surge pricing.  You know, people whine about it with Uber, but I  guess it's catching on on other places.  It seems like you have a lot of  highly-motivated buyers at that time of year so I would think they'd  probably be willing to eat the cost if being guaranteed December 24th  delivery.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it also depends on what we're going to hear in the tax  package, right?  If they're going to be paying a border adjustment tax -</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is really going to hurt the retailers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They may not want to eat anything.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Remember, though, your corporate rate comes down.  It's covering  all goods.  It's just a shifting, right?  I mean, I understand they've  going to do some work on selling the border adjustment tax but you're  talking about a much lower rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll talk about this.</p><p>Coming up, will the NFL head to China.  New England Patriots quarterback  says his dream is to play a game in the East Asian nation, back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, the NBA Finals just ended a week ago but several  teams are already looking to next season.  Jared Max with the story, now.   Jared, good morning.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SPORTSCASTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  The  NBA's next crop of talent will be picked Thursday.  NBA Draft at Barkley  Center in Brooklyn, New York, for the second year in a row, the first pick  belongs to the Philadelphia 76ers, who yesterday, finalized to trade with  the Boston Celtics to acquire the first selection and the right to pick 19- year-old point guard Markelle Fultz out of the University of Washington.   Fultz worked out for the 6ers yesterday hours before the team completed its  trade with Boston to get the number one overall pick a second straight  season.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRYAN COLANGELO, PHILADELPHIA 76ERS PRESIDENT:  There's a history of draft  picks that you can't study with a deep dive and no one understand that the  odds are in your favor at number one more so than in any other position in  the draft that player may - the player chosen may end up being a franchise- level player.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  To land the number one overall selection, 6ers G.M. and President of  basketball operations, Bryan Colangelo also parted ways with a second first  round pick to Boston that allowed to be next year or 2019.  So, the draft  order, it's Philadelphia first followed by the L.A. Lakers, then the Boston  Celtics, the Phoenix Suns, fourth, as Sacramento Kings get the fifth  selection, Thursday.  In the 12 1/2 years that Dan Gilbert has owned the  Cleveland Cavaliers, no general manager has received a contract extension,  not one.  David Griffin, no different.  Unable to reach agreement on a new  deal, Griffin mutually agreed to part ways with the Cavaliers.  Yesterday,  after three seasons on the job, three trips to the NBA Finals, one  championship.  Griffin said it's not the right fit for him anymore and  Cleveland.  </p><p>LeBron James tweeted support.  He says, \"If no one appreciated you, Griff,  I did.  And hopefully, all the people of Cleveland!  Thanks for what you  did for the team for three years!  We got us one.</p><p>As we told yesterday, the Cavs are set to be pursuing a trade that could  land them point guard Paul George from the Indiana Pacers.  And the Cavs  are also reportedly working on a possible multi-team trade to get Jimmy  Butler from the Chicago Bulls.  But such a trade would likely mean parting  ways with a star like Kevin Love.  </p><p>What a superstar quarterback Tom Brady doing these days?  Oh, just hanging  out in the Great Wall of China.  The Patriot Super Bowl-winning quarterback  spent Father's Day throwing a football to his son at the Great Wall.  The  Brady bunch in China is part of a promotional tour for his Under Armour  TB12 Recovery Sleepwear.  Brady said that it is his dream to play an NFL  game in China.  Victory for the Washington Red Skins and freedom of speech.   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled yesterday that a 71-year-old trademark law  that bars offensive language is an infringement of rights to free speech.   This came from a case involving an Asian-American rock band that fought the  trademark.  Its name, The Slants.  Now, yesterday's case figures to serve  as legal precedent for the Red Skins to be able to keep their name.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I was surprised at that and happy to see that.  Jared,  great stuff.  Thank you so much, Jared Max.  Still to come, a new twist for  check fillet.  The company unveiling its gluten-free bun next hour on  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  What does tell us?

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Tuesday, June 20th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>The push to get tax reform and health care done continues.  House Speaker  Paul Ryan set to lay out his tax reform plan later this afternoon.</p><p>The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that the Senate is planning to vote  on repealing and replacing Obamacare next week.  Senate minority leader  Chuck Schumer ramped up his attack on Republicans.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER:  Why are our Republican  colleagues rushing through a bill in the dark of night?  I will tell you  why.   They don't want you Mr. and Mrs. American to know about this bill.   They don't want you to see that it cuts health care for millions.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The battle on Capitol Hill and whether lawmakers will give up  their August recess, still ahead.</p><p>Meanwhile the tour company that brought American student Otto Warmbier to  North Korea says it's halting those tour trips.  It says a tragedy like  this should never be repeated.</p><p>It is technically not even summer yet but the southwest is facing a  dangerous heat wave.  Temperatures are expected to hit triple digits today.   It is forcing American airlines to cancel more than a dozen flights this  morning.  We've got the latest.</p><p>And a massive cell phone outage across the country -- the details on what  caused it coming up.</p><p>Twitter getting some star power in a new ad -- Grammy winner Chance the  Rapper takes role highlighting how users can interact with their favorite  celebrities on the2 social media service.</p><p>Plus how color affects home sales -- the new details on which pain colors  are best and worst when trying to sell your home.</p><p>Futures showing the markets will open higher this morning.  We are  expecting that the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 extend the record-setting  performance yesterday.  Both are coming off a record close yesterday.  And  as you see there are gains to be had.</p><p>Dow Industrials expected to be up about 10 points this morning.  This is  fractional, of course, and anything can change in the next two hours.</p><p>In Europe the major averages are mostly higher this morning.  The indices  look good although well off of highs of the morning.  In fact, the CAC 40  is now up about a quarter of a percent.  They have given up gains.</p><p>And I believe that stocks are giving up some gains this morning because oil  prices are worsening.  Oil prices are down about 2 percent.  Take a look at  oil sliding and as oil has worsened this morning that has certainly taken a  bite out of some of the gains in equities.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it financial analyst Heather Zumarraga is here, \"Wall Street Journal\"  assistant editorial page editor James Freeman is here, and the London  Center for Policy Research vice president, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer  is here as well.  Good morning.</p><p>LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good morning.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lots to talk about today.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.  We'll see if the markets continue making all-time highs  this week.  Health care is in focus.  Paul Ryan is set to speak at noon  today to see if we can get that passed as well as tax reform and that's big  for the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And people will want to hear what he has to say about tax  reform.  But his plan, James Freeman, is different than what the President  has been talking about.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  The President is just talking about that low  corporate rate.  Paul Ryan has the border adjustment plan and they need a  new name for that.  But basically what he's talking about, the economics  are good which is you want to tax consumption instead of working  investment.  That's what Ryan is trying to do.  But he's got a sales job  and if he can't persuade other members of congress this is the way to go he  should just -- </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Republicans in the Senate just don't want to hear it.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  He hasn't found a lot of takers.  So maybe he just needs to  focus on cutting rates.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, I think the bottom line is anything they do right now has  been in my judgment not positive to the President's overall message.  It  seems to me that they always find some other way to go anytime they  actually try to do something.  And this is where it's frustrating to me as  someone who just observes.  They don't seem to be actually sitting down and  talking about how to meet on achieving something, or even talking pass this  thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The leadership does say that they are having meetings very  often, weekly about tax reform and that they are moving forward on this  despite what you're seeing in the press.  But we will see about that.   We're going to talk about that coming up.</p><p>Joining the conversation coming up now is Fox News military analyst General  Jack Keane is with us.  Harvard Law professor emeritus, defense attorney  and author of \"Electile Dysfunction: A Guide for Unaroused Voters\" Alan  Dershowitz is here -- good name for his book.  Former Reagan campaign  adviser Ed Rollins is here as well.  We've got a big program ahead so don't  miss a moment of it.  </p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with our top story.  The  administration pushing the President's agenda with only weeks left on the  legislative calendar for the fiscal year.  Counsel to the President,  Kellyanne Conway told me yesterday reform is on the way.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT:  The President is forging  ahead.  He's in close contact with Leader McConnell on the health care  reform.  You know, Obamacare has been a log (inaudible) for seven years.   These sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the  House.  Now the Senate will do its work.  Leader McConnell told you that he  would like it to be by July 4th -- that's around the corner.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CONWAY:  Tax reform later this year.  They are moving towards  infrastructure, towards border security, more of that.  The military has  gotten new funding.  So things are happening.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, calls for lawmakers to work through their month-long  August recess to get both health care and tax reform done are increasing.</p><p>Joining me right now is Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn.  Congresswoman --  good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Good to see you.  Sure.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about the agenda?  How confident are you that  you and your colleagues can get tax reform and the health care over the  finish line this year?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  I agree that you're going to see the Senate take a vote before  July 4th.  And the people are thrilled with that.  They want to be free and  independent of the Affordable Care Act.  So I think it's very timely.</p><p>I think a final bill, a final version will be on the President's desk  before August 1st.  And that's the goal.  We should be hitting that goal  and then it is getting the push together to get tax reform over the finish  line.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a report yesterday that lawmakers said that they are  considering not going on the August recess in order to get the work done if  in fact it doesn't get done by then.  Are you for that?  Was that an actual  conversation piece in Congress?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.  Maria -- there are plenty of conversations about do we  stay in during August.  Many individuals want to get out there.  I agree.   Get out there, do our meetings and rotary clubs and civic clubs and chamber  coffees, visit with our constituents.  And we appreciate having that time.</p><p>But there is also the argument to be made that we have a heavy lift.  We  have a once in a lifetime opportunity to actually take care of  deregulating, lowering taxes, getting some this environment for jobs growth  to take place in place.</p><p>Your interview with Secretary Ross spoke specifically to that.  How do we  utilize new technologies?  How do we make the environment right for private  sector jobs growth to take place?  And that is less litigation, less  taxation to get that job creation.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Congresswoman -- James Freeman of the \"Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes -- James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The one -- I have a tax question for you but real quick.  I  noticed the White House announcing last night that Michael (inaudible) is  headed to the Commerce Department.  You seem to be losing one of the big  chip staffers on Capitol Hill.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  And we are pleased with it for him.  And look forward to all  good things -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok. </p><p>BLACKBURN:  -- for him.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Now, as far as the tax cut, tell us about the conversation  around how big this cut can be.  Because there is some sentiment on the  Hill that you have to stick CBO rules, a 10-year budget window, all of that  boring Beltway stuff.  But what it means is it limits how much you can cut  taxes.  Some people are saying let's make it a 30-year window.  It means we  can have a big, big tax cut.  Where do you stand on that?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  I think what you're going to see Chairman Brady do is get as  much as he can.  I like the way this administration works things out and  says let's do more with less.  So if you put that into how you work tax  reductions into a reconciliation bill, what you're going to see the Speaker  and the Chairman do is to move forward with how much they can lower those  marginal rates.</p><p>They're looking right now at 35 percent, 25 percent and 10 percent.  Those  are worthy goals.  Then going to the business side, how low can you get  that corporate rate?  Can you deal with repatriation on that?</p><p>I think that the BAT tax is going to be very, very difficult in my district  with the auto manufacturing, with large retailers like Dollar General and  Tractor supply.  Kirkland's headquartered here.  That is not a popular tax.  </p><p>And I don't see -- I know the Speaker's for it -- but I don't see the  support from my constituents or from my colleagues for that tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So maybe just cut the rate down to 15 percent as the President  has suggested.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  I think that that is something that is workable.  And James --  you know, if we do that, we're still going to be the biggest cut tax since  the Reagan '86 tax cut.  And let's take as much as we can get this year and  then let's come back next year and take some more. </p><p>Taxes are too high.  Regulation is too high.  Litigation is too prolific.   So let's get those under control so that jobs growth could take place.  I  talk to small business manufacturers that work in the Just in Time supply  chain for the auto industry every single week and they will tell you, they  will point to you specifically how that BAT tax would adversely impact them  and thereby the price of an auto.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And the price of an auto I heard would go up $2,000 --  $3,000 even if you have that border adjustment tax, the BAT as you refer to  it.</p><p>So what I hear you saying, Congresswoman -- and I want to move to the  Georgia election in a second -- but you would be willing then to vote on no  new revenue then.  You just cut taxes and then deal, if you need to raise  revenue next year or the next year, you would be willing to vote with just  lowering the corporate rate as low as you can get it without raising  revenue from something at the border -- a tax at the border?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.  I think if you lower those rates and see where that gets  you, you don't have to do everything with one stroke of the pen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is tweeting this morning on Georgia's special  election as voters head to the polls.  Here is what he said, Congresswoman,  \"Karen Handel for Congress.  She will fight for lower taxes, great  healthcare, strong security and a hard worker who will never give up.  Vote  today.\"  This as a new political ad is stirring up controversy.  Watch  this.  I want to get your reaction -- Congresswoman.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Sure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Now the unhinged left is endorsing and applauding  shooting Republicans.  When will it stop?  It won't if Jon Ossoff wins on  Tuesday because the same unhinged leftist cheering last week's shooting are  all backing Jon Ossoff.  And if he wins they win.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That ad was paid for by a PAC supporting Republican  candidate Karen Handel.  It's now receiving backlash for showing images of  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise after he was shot last week.</p><p>A spokesperson for Handel condemned the ad saying, \"For any group to use  the shootings this week for political or personal benefit is shameful.   This group should be ashamed.\"</p><p>What's your take?  Nearly $50 million have been raised in this election --  the most expensive House race in U.S. history -- Congresswoman.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  I think the group that put the ad up should be ashamed.  I  think anyone who is inciting violence or encouraging violence or  encouraging hateful rhetoric should stop it.</p><p>People want to see us work together, whether they're a Democrat, a  Republican an Independent.  I have individuals in my office as I did  yesterday who said we just want to see you get some things done. </p><p>Let's get the Affordable Care Act off the books.  Let's get tax reform  done.  Let's secure the border.  Let's get this infrastructure bill going.   That is what they are wanting to see, and ads like that are not helpful to  the process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we agree.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Hateful rhetoric isn't helpful to the process.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Congresswoman -- this is Tony Shaffer with the London Center for  Policy Research.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes, Tony.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Good morning, ma'am.</p><p>With all due respect, I know what you're saying about cooperating but it  doesn't seem that Nancy Pelosi and colleagues on the left are actually  trying to ratchet this down.  And it's not all of them.  I mean I talked to  Tulsi Gabbard and Tulsi I think recognizes what's going on but how do you  deal with folks who just don't want to engage in that dialogue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean look what Chuck Schumer just said that you're doing the  health care deal in the dark of night, excuse me, but wasn't that the way  they did Obamacare?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  You know, what happened with Obamacare was a bill that was  written in the House -- in the White House and then brought over.  Nobody  knew what was in it and Miss Pelosi said so.  What you see now is a team  working together off the House bill which is a public document.</p><p>But Tony, back to your question on this, I think what we have to do is just  continue to push against this and encourage our colleagues to keep the  conversation on the policies and to move away from this politics of  personal attack and destruction.  The fact that you have so many members of  congress who are receiving death threats, personal harm threats coming into  their steps, to their families, this is completely unacceptable.</p><p>And they need to join together in saying we are not going to tolerate this  type of rhetoric.  We are well served by robust political debate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you make all great points Congresswoman.  It's great to  see you.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All our love to Steve Scalise. </p><p>We will be right back.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Excessive heat warnings in effect across the southwest today while  thunderstorm watches are in effect for 11 states on the East Coast.</p><p>Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean breaks it all down for us.   What's the latest we can expect across the country today?  Janice -- good  morning.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  A lot of stories -- Maria, we are working  on.</p><p>Let's take a look at it across the northeast.  Hundreds of reports of  severe weather including a tornado report just outside the D.C. area.  No  reports of any injuries but we've got a lot of reports of destruction.</p><p>And we have a tropical cyclone potential in the next 12 to 24 hours  expecting it to get a name and make landfall possibly Thursday, Friday  along the Gulf Coast.  We have tropical storm watches and warnings in  place.  </p><p>This is going to be a rainmaker along the Gulf Coast; six to eight even 12  inches of rainfall, so watching this.  The tropics already heating up.</p><p>And then speaking of heat, across the southwest, heat advisories are posted  where we have dangerous conditions.  Temperatures well over 100 degrees and  we are going to be seeing temperatures close to 120 in Phoenix, Arizona.   Look at the temperatures here over the next several days.</p><p>Looking at Phoenix, they've actually canceled flights.  The smaller  aircraft have a hard time taking off in heat and when we look at the all- time hottest, we go back to 1990, 122 degrees; 1990 here as well, 120;  we're going to be flirting with 119, 120 degrees across Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p>So those big stories we are following today in the Fox News Extreme Weather  Center.  Maria -- back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Yes, that is something.  Ok.  Janice -- thank you.   Janice Dean.</p><p>Meanwhile a blood drive is being held today on Capitol Hill for  Representative Steve Scalise. </p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details there -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- Maria.</p><p>Patrick McHenry, the House chief deputy majority whip is hosting that blood  drive for Scalise, a close friend, and other victims of last week's  shooting.  That's according to a notice obtained by Politico.</p><p>So Scalise, he was shot during a congressional baseball practice last  Wednesday has been upgraded, we should say, to serious condition from  critical.  The Louisiana congressman has had several surgeries at MedStar  Washington Hospital.  That blood drive which will be held again on Thursday  is also for U.S. Capitol police special agent Crystal Griner and lobbyist  Matt Mika.</p><p>Well, multiple sources report that several major mobile service providers  are experiencing cellphone service outages this morning.  Companies  (inaudible) reportedly include AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon.  So far  we don't have a reason for these outages but according to the site Down  Detector, Sprint and Verizon had the largest outage areas on the East Coast  and in the state of California.</p><p>And then Chick-Fil-A is the latest fast food chain to offer gluten-free  food.  But there's a catch.  So it's $1.15, you can order your gluten-free  bun.  But you have to make your own sandwich.  Chick-Fil-A says its  kitchens are not gluten-free and that's the only way that they can keep it  safe.  So, you know, it's healthier, I guess but make your own food --  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Joining the wave of others who are going gluten- free.  We'll check it out.   Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up next, tensions soaring with North Korea now after the death of an  American student held hostage by the Kim Jong-Un regime for 17 months.   President Trump's tough message to North Korea, next.</p><p>And then information on nearly 200 million voters exposed by the Republican  National Committee.  How a contractor accidentally reveals the names,  birthdays, phone numbers online.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just wanted to pass on  word that Otto Warmbier has just passed away.  He spent a year and a half  in North Korea.  A lot of bad things happened.  That's a brutal regime.   And we will be able to handle it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was President Trump speaking at the White House yesterday  following the death of Otto Warmbier.  The American student died just days  after returning home following 17 months of imprisonment in North Korea.</p><p>Joining me right now is Fox News military analyst, General Jack Keane.   General -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's such a horrible and just a terrible story.  The U.S. is  demanding the release now of three other Americans currently being held in  North Korea.</p><p>Your reaction to Otto Warmbier passing away now after being tortured  obviously, coming home in a vegetative state.  </p><p>KEANE:  Well, there's no doubt that the North Koreans are responsible for  murdering Otto, that's for sure and that heartfelt message that (inaudible)  provided yesterday was rally quite extraordinary and revealing in a sense  they talked about him being tortured.  Their doctors obviously have some  sense of what's happening and autopsy will confirm what actually happened.</p><p>But something went wrong here for the North Koreans because, you know,  Maria -- they imprison, torture, kill and starve their own people.  What  they do with Americans is they take them hostage and they use them as  bargaining chips until some prominent American comes forward and is willing  to negotiate with them like a Bill Clinton or a Bill Richardson.  </p><p>So what happened here?  How did this take place?  They lost a leverage that  they use hostages for to establish some legitimacy for the regime.  And I  think the other three certainly, the President's doing the right thing in  demanding their release.</p><p>I think what this will do for us here is strengthen our resolve, our  determination our commitment to deal with this North Korean problem once  and for all.</p><p>I believe the President is already there but I think will just add to his  determination to deal with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should the U.S. be responding to this?  What should the U.S. do  at this point?  And basically just to be clear.  What you're saying is they  had him imprisoned, they were obviously drugging him when they realized  that he was in a vegetative state, they said ok, we're losing our leverage  we can send him home?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  They didn't want him to die there.  That's for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  And it's just -- it's out of the pattern of what they normally do.   We don't know the facts yet -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should the U.S. do anything about this -- General?</p><p>KEANE:  We're not going to -- we're not going to take any immediate action  with North Korea.  What we have done is we have -- we have ladled the  football to China to see if they can use economic pressure on North Korea  to denuclearize.  That will take some time.  </p><p>Most of us looking at that and I'm sure the administration also has a  healthy dose of skepticism about whether China is genuinely sincere about  doing this.  We'll have to see and we'll have to wait to see that happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  I think at some point, here's where I think we're going to wind up.   China is not going to do it.  We're going to have to really get tough with  North Korea on sanctions.</p><p>I think we'll probably have to provide some sanctions against China for the  first time.  I think we have to have a get tough policy with China.  And  when it comes to the Asia Pacific and what they're doing in terms of  trampling our interests and also our allies' interests.</p><p>I think we're kind of on a collision course with North Korea and also with  China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's important.  That's going to be an important day  when in fact the U.S. makes a decision to put sanctions against China as  well.</p><p>Let me switch gears and get your take on this latest surrounding the USS  Fitzgerald's collision with a container ship.  That happened this weekend  off the coast of Japan.  And investigators are looking into several aspects  of this crash including why it took the crew of the civilian vessel almost  an hour to report the incident.  How does this happen -- General?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I don't know what they were doing on board, what kind of  emergency situation they may have had.  They have very small crews on that  ship but you know, making a radio call isn't a big deal.  And certainly our  war ship had their hands full -- the things that were knocked out were the  berthing areas for the crew.  The radio communication was knocked out and  also interesting, the captain's quarters was sitting on top of all of that.</p><p>So it is understandable our crew was fighting for their lives and trying to  make sure -- you have a warship and it demonstrates, you know, the  instruments of war like a warship is dangerous in peace time as it is in  war.</p><p>Sitting on that ship as we know, not on that commercial ship, sitting on  that warship is incredible amount of missiles and explosive munitions.  And  if a fire broke out on that ship that thing could really have turned into  an incredible tragedy.  So fortunate that that crew was as brave as they  are, battled that situation and took control of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, any other issues that will come as a result of this?   Because people are scratching their heads saying how does this happen?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, the Navy -- the Navy is not saying it publicly but the Navy  is not going to stand for our ship at sea not being able to evade an  oncoming ship if the oncoming ship made an unexpected U-turn like it did.   The Navy has navigational devices.  It has human beings that are alert and  paying attention.  And something's failed on that ship that we did not take  evasive action.</p><p>The Navy will never excuse any of its vessels being hit by another vessel  regardless of who was at fault.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KEANE:  The Navy will hold that crew accountable for being able to evade  that ship.  That's the fact of it.  They'll get to what caused it all but  at the end of the day they're going to hold them accountable for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. We'll be watching that.  General -- always a  pleasure.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KEANE:  Good talking to you -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to you -- General Jack Keane joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, a new weapon in the Russian election meddling probe.  Special  counsel Robert Mueller hires a big name to help move forward with this  investigation. </p><p>And then Google wants to help you find a new job.  How the technology giant  is using AI to connect people with the perfect career.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is a happy  Tuesday, Tuesday, June 20th.  Your top stories right now 7:30 A.M. on the  East Coast.</p><p>A busy week at the White House.  President Trump set to meet with president  of the Ukraine this afternoon.  The meeting coming as the White House is  facing new headwinds in the Russia probe Special Counsel Robert Mueller  expanding his team including one man who is best known for his ability to  flip witnesses.  What it means for the president, coming up.</p><p>Hacking concerns hit the RNC.

All coming up.</p><p>Plus it is Crosby's steals a chance?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How about a new song with real instruments?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How Twitter is hoping its new ad campaign will help keep the  momentum from the Trump bump.  Twitter shares are up today.</p><p>Plus, the perfect color could have you seeing more green when you want to  sell your house.  Why picking a certain paint color could actually earn you  big bucks when you sell your home.  We'll tell you about it.</p><p>Futures meanwhile showing the markets will be mixed today at the open.  The  Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are coming off of a record close yesterday.  But oil  prices have been selling off and that has cut into some of the gains this  morning.  Now we expect a mixed opening for broader averages.  The Dow  industrials are down one.  The NASDAQ are up 12 points.</p><p>In Europe, the major indices have also lost some momentum this morning.   The FT 100 is now in negative territory down five points.  The CAC quarante  is well off of the highs.  It's up a quarter of a percent and the DAX index  is also higher although well off a big ties as well.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly lower meanwhile with the exception  of Japan.  The Nikkei average finished up almost one percent.</p><p>And take a look at oil prices.  One of the certainly market stories down  two percent right now, on oil, and as oil prices have slide, stocks have  also given up some gains.</p><p>Well, Special Counsel Robert Mueller adding a new weapon to his Russia  probe.  Veteran federal prosecutor and former Department of Justice fraud  division chief Andrew Weissmann has joined the team.  Weissmann is the man  who has been known for his ability to flip witnesses in his work on  organized crime, and in cases like Enron</p><p>Joining us right now defense attorney author and Harvard law professor  Emeritus, Alan Dershowitz.  Alan, good to see you.</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS:  Nice to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this a move that should concern the president bringing  Weissmann on?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Sure.  We're seeing a game of three dimensional chess.   Mueller is sending a very powerful message to the White House.  We have a  flipper.  You have some potential flipees out there, especially Flynn.   Flynn's lawyer are now sending a message to the White House as well.  We  may flip.  We're not going to allow our client to go to jail.  You have a  choice.  If you don't wanted to flip, you have the option of pardoning him.   If you pardon him, he doesn't flip.  If you don't pardon him, he flips.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So he's cooperating with the special prosecutor.  Mike Flynn.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, what I think is happening is his lawyer announced  publicly, which is very odd.  We have a story to tell.  Please give us  immunity.  I think it may be bluff.  We're not sure he has great story to  tell but he's certainly, by that public message, trying to get the  attention of the oval office.  Trying to get the president to say, you can  stop all this by pardoning Flynn.  Now pardoning Flynn would be a political  cost.  Very heavy cost for the president.</p><p>So the stakes have gone up all over the place.  This is the way tough  defense attorneys and tough prosecutors go after each other and play the  game.  I have seen this game.  I have participated in it.  And I know how  rough and tumble it can become.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  It sounds, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Professor, I want to you ask you about Andrew Weissmann, Clinton  donor also has been sharply criticized by a newspaper that was owned by  Jared Kushner.  He's now apparently investigating Jared Kushner.</p><p>And this is in terms of political donors, this is a patter so far in the  Mueller team.  He's hiring a number of people who've donated, the  democrats.  Is it -- is it that hard to find good lawyers who are not  political activists?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, lawyers are like everybody else.  I contribute.  I  contributed to Hillary Clinton's campaign.  I would not let it affect my  judgment.  I defended republicans and democrats alike.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you do that though?  You gave money.  I mean, how do you  not make sure that it doesn't affect your judgment?  That's hard.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, look at me now.  I gave money to Clinton and I'm no  making arguments that helped the man I voted against because I believe in  principle.  Now, Weissmann is a very tough prosecutor.  If I were the  president, I'd be more worried about his experience and his record of being  a very tough prosecutor and a few bucks being contributed to the democrats.   Having said that, I think that probably should have look for people who  didn't make political contributions.  Much the way the president  disqualified probably one of the most qualified persons to be the head of  the FBI and that is Senator Lieberman because he had been a politician.   The president wanted to make sure that whoever it was, was outside of  politics.</p><p>So I think the seize is white principle that you're going to engage in a  political prosecution and this is a political prosecution, you better not  give the other side the opportunity to make arguments that it's been  politicized.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about all of this focused on this Russian  meddling probe?  I understand the Russian meddling probe, but to attach  Trump to it, when we know that there's absolutely no evidence, whatsoever  of collusion and still going on about this, I mean, how much does this cost  taxpayers?  Hundred million or more than that?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  And there's nothing -- I don't know.  But there's nothing  criminal about it.  This ought to be investigated by an independent  commission looking into the relationship between Russia and political  elections on both sides moving forward.  Then there ought to be a  congressional investigation to see maybe we need to change the law to  prevent the president from firing the director of the FBI.</p><p>The one place they should not be is in front of a grand jury.  There is  nothing criminal here.  And the grand jury is secret behind closed doors.   It's causing us a fortune.  We're learning nothing.  Nothing will come of  it.  This idea that you can turn a constitutionally protected act, the  firing the director into a crime because it had a corrupt motive.</p><p>You should read my emails.  I'm accused every day of having a corrupt  motive.  Why am I on Fox talking about Donald Trump?  Is he paying me?  Am  I auditioning to become his lawyer?  Do I want to be a judge?  Am I  expecting a favor?  My motives are being questioned all over the place.   Politicians questioned each other's motives.  The idea of corrupt motive  being the criteria distinguishing a constitutionally protected act from a  felony is so dangerous to civil liberties that every -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, is there going to be any -- is there going to be any  accountability for the dems obstructing the agenda that America voted for  last year?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, the republicans did the very same thing to Bill Clinton.   When they impeached him and what they tried to do to Barack Obama.  Look,  packs on both their -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the accountability happened because they got voted  out of office, right?  So will the dems lose seats as a result of this in  '18?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  We'll see today in Georgia.  We'll see in other places.  We  don't know.  This is a referendum, perhaps.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, back onto my pointing for a second.  Because that's the  most real element I've seen so far in any legal jeopardy.  Simply because  Mike is going to talk doesn't mean he's flipping.  This is one of those  things where I think people are reading far too much in a way sinister  motive here.  You and I both know, Alan, that you go in front of congress,  you go in front of these groups, anything you say can eventually be turned  against you in some form.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  He's looking for immunity.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Because you don't want to be say anything.  It gives you later.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  But I would never ever ask for immunity publicly.  I would go  quietly to the prosecutor and say, here's my story.  But his lawyers are  very smart.  Why is he asking for immunity publicly?  Because he's sending  a message to the president of the United States.  You want me not to get  immunity?  Pardon me.  Pardon me.  Pardon my client.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Last thing.  We talked about how there's no evidence yet of  collusion.  It seems interesting as you watch Mueller build his team and  assign people the different tasks.  He seems to be assigning them largely  to things other than looking for evidence of collusion.  Does that mean  he's already decided there's nothing there?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  I don't think there's anything that criminally on collusion.   What he's looking for is to make a case against Flynn, for example, failure  to list some of these things then go to Flynn and say, you want to go to  jail?  You have a family.  There's a way out of this.  Weissmann is an  expert of that.  He has flipped better witnesses and stronger witnesses  then Flynn that's the goal prosecutor's.</p><p>I once debated Rudy Giuliani in my class and he put a bunch of dominos up  on the blackboard and he said, if I ever have to bring somebody to trial, I  have failed.  My goal is to flip the first guy on the guy, on the third  guy, ultimately get them all flipped and finally go after the big guy on  the top and the evidence is so overwhelming he'll plead guilty.  That's the  way prosecutors operate.  And defense attorneys operate by using that to  their advantage and trying to make sure their client is the one who's  giving to get out of jail free ticket and they can turn -- the first rule  in America is that you're going to commit a crime always committed with  somebody more important than you are.  So you can flip on them and make it  flip on you.  That's my advice to all persons of criminals out there.   Don't commit crimes.  But if you're going to do it, do it with someone more  important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Alan, great insights as always from you.  Thanks so much.   Alan Dershowitz there.</p><p>Coming up, data for nearly 200 million voters have been exposed.  How a  contractor for the republican national committee accidentally posted the  information online.</p><p>And then the right colored walls can earn you more green.  A surprising new  study reveals what specific paint color can help boost a home selling  price.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Republican Party data of nearly 200 million  voters has been exposed online.  Cheryl Casone with all the details now.   Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  A cyber security analyst  working for the RNC discovered that the information was left unsecured on  an online database for 12 days before it was taken down.  The data was  stolen in an Amazon cloud account used by a contractor that work for the  RNC.  The information was nearly on every U.S. voter.  It include names,  date of birth, home addresses.  The RNC says it's working with that  contractor padding that conclusion of an investigation in the security.</p><p>Well, Google can now help you find a job.  The search engine has launched a  new job search feature on its search result pages.  You can now search for  jobs across all major online job words.  It covers LinkedIn, Monster,  Career Builder, Facebook and a lot more.  Google is also going to include  job listings that finds on a company specific homepage.  Basically, it's  going to be one stop shopping for job seekers of all trades.</p><p>And then finally this.  The color that you paint the inside of your home  could affect its value.  Zillow conducted an analysis and more than 32,000  sold homes -- here's example.  A blue bathroom can increase the home's  price by $5,400.  A blue dining room can fetch an extra 2,000.  But some  color hurt you.  Last year, yellow was a hot color, it increased sales  values.  This year, a yellow kitchen, for example, will hurt you by about  $800.</p><p>And then, Maria, some colors just hurt you every year.  Terracotta, a terra  no-no, do not -- it's like orange brown.  No.  Don't do it.  If you have  terracotta walls, you're going to lose more than $2,000, versus other  homes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's amazing that color does that.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Twitter turns to TV to maintain its Trump bump.  We  will take a look of whether the new ad campaign is enough to more and more  users and how will they monetize it.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Twitter announcing a new ad campaign with Chance  the Rapper, and what he should play at his shows.  Tracee Carrasco with the  details now.  Tracee, good morning.</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Now, this is the  first-ever TV ad for Twitter, as you said Chance the Rapper, now take a  look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARRASCO:  The ad shows Chance asking fans via Twitter for a song request  for his upcoming concert, his tweet sets off a wide range of responses not  all positive, as people tweet back and debate selections.  Music legend  David Crosby even trolls the rapper by tweeting, how about any song with  real instruments?  Now, the new campaign is the next step in Twitter's  ongoing attempt to better explain to consumers what Twitter is and why it's  valuable to spend time on the site.</p><p>The ad push hope to show people how Twitter is unique compared with other  social media sites.  Now Twitter reported its average monthly user rose six  percent in the first quarter to 328 million.  It was the largest quarterly  increase since 2015.  And according to company, it is partly due to \"new  and resurrected users following more news and political accounts in U.S.\"</p><p>Now, although the company didn't specifically mention President Trump, his  frequent tweeting has gotten worldwide attention.  For Twitter, they want  to show they're not just news, they're entertainment, they're sports,  they're everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a good arguments we made that it does trigger conversation  and that you have back-and-forth debate.  I like the fact that Crosby was  in it answering about the instruments.  That's cute.</p><p>CARRASCO:  Yes.  Maybe a collaboration.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  And Chance the Rapper says the gentleman here, it's their  favorite musician.</p><p>SHAFFER:  I was on Yo! MTV Raps left.  One of these few things, I have  friends who literally still can't use Twitter.  They can't figure it out.   And to me, it's kind of like riding a bike.  Once you figure it out, you  figure it out and you can use it.  So, do you think there's a part of it  now people starting to figure out how to use this more?  Because I have  friends saying, I just don't get it.  How do I get my message out?  So, do  you have any sense of where this is going regarding people just probably  getting smart how to use it?</p><p>CARRASCO:  I think so.  I think we're seeing so many -- you know, we can't  go a day without saying President Trump is tweeting this, so and so is  tweeting this, so I think people are now saying well, I want to know what  Twitter is all about.  I'm going to figure out how to use it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the company has to monetize it somehow.</p><p>That's helping them make money.  This ad, what's that going to do for  monetization?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think investors have kind of been wondering before and  especially through this Trump era, why are you not making more money off  this fact that the U.S. president has put you at the center of the  universe, political discussion, debate, really all news, and maybe this is  a way to try and figure it out.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  And this is millennials also.  I think if millennials don't  follow as much D.C. politics as maybe they should than this is another way  to reach out to them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I thought it was really interesting when Jack Dorsey was  asked, the CEO of Twitter.  What do you think about the president tweeting  all the time on your service?  He goes, oh, it's complicated.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Probably don't want to monetize it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  This is obviously a huge gift to them.  But being at Silicon  Valley, given the political sensibility there, I think they have to pretend  that this is kind of a mixed story for them.  But, yes.  It's not really -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a huge break for them.</p><p>CARRASCO:  It's been great for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure it has.  Tracee, great.  Thank you so much.  Tracee  Carrasco there.</p><p>Still ahead, UPS giving itself a present this Christmas.  Why the shipping  giant is planning to charge you more for holiday deliveries and they've  decided this now.

Take a look at futures right now  indicating a mixed opening for the broader averages, Dow Industrials  squeaking out a gain of just two points right here.  S&amp;P 500 is unchanged  and the NASDAQ is up 15, all of the above, of off the highs of the morning.   And of course, this is after the Dow and S&amp;P reached record highs yesterday  at the close.</p><p>In Europe, the indices have also given up some of the momentum, the FT 100  is now negative by nine points.  The CAC quarante in Paris is up a quarter  of a percent off of the highs as is the DAX Index right now as well of 25  points there.  In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly lower with the  exception of Japan, Nikkei Average was up almost one percent.

Great to see you.</p><p>TONY SCHAEFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH VICE PRESIDENT: Thanks,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Allan Dersowitch said some interesting things to say I thought.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Yes.   And we're still waiting for that collusion evidence.  He's talking about  the potential that maybe Michael Flynn will be forced to flip but what does  -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- stories that Michael Flynn has about the president.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, yes.  I think - this is one of the things too.  Because he  had a story doesn't mean it's a bad story.  I mean, everybody kind of  infers he's going to flip on the president.  Look, I think Mike Flynn  probably made some mistakes, we've talked about the Russian issue regarding  his conversations with the Russians, he had a deal with Turkey which has  been questioned and some issues with that, the whole issue of what he got  paid going to Moscow to meet with Putin via RT.</p><p>These are all things which I think are relevant in a way by the fact that  maybe he even didn't follow the rules but they don't add anything to the  larger narrative or issue regarding what exactly are we looking for  regarding this \"collusion.\" </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  Absolutely right.  We want to kick this out off of  this.  The Trump administration is pushing forward on the president's  agenda as the Senate GOP is planning on a health care vote next week.  Adam  Shapiro is at the White House right now with the very latest.  Adam, that  certainly keeps them on the timeline for '17.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Right.  It  would keep on the timeline, they have to do the health care stuff first  because of the rules of reconciliation in the 2017 budget resolution but  Mitch McConnell, the leader in the senate's office has said, pay attention  to what the leader had - to what the leader has said in regards to getting  this vote before the July 4th recess.  So the bill is being crafted and the  vote is expected next week but the Democrats are trying to slow down the  process in the Senate and then last night, Chuck Schumer went after Mitch  McConnell in an exchange about why are you doing this behind closed doors,  let's see what you're working on.  Here's what they talked about. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATOR:  Will it be available to us and the public  more than 10 hours before we have to vote for it? </p><p>MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATOR:  I think we'll ample opportunity to read  and amend the bill. </p><p>SCHUMER:  Will it be more than 10 hours -- </p><p>MCCONNELL:  I think we'll have ample opportunity to read and amend the  bill. </p><p>SCHUMER:  I rest my case. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  So the goal again for Republicans is to have this bill next week  debated no more than 20 hours in the Senate and then a vote before the  senators and all of Congress actually leave for the July 4th recess.  The  other issue, of course, is tax reform.  Once they have accomplished or  defeated the health care repeal and replace, they can then move on to a  budget resolution and then tax reform.  And today we're going to get a  major speech from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan on what he thinks is  important, not only in tax reform but why this moment when Republicans  control the White House and the House of Representatives and the Senate is  in the opportunity they can't afford to miss.  So that speech at 12:45 at  the National Association Of Manufacturers, will outline Speaker Ryan's  thoughts on tax reform.</p><p>We're not looking for too much debate on that, for instance, the border  adjustment tax, he hasn't officially said he is against it, there is no one  in the Senate who is for it but in the house, Republicans are still  supporting it and Paul Ryan was a big supporter of it originally.  We're  looking for guidance during this speech today on that. Maria? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Adam Shapiro, thank you very much.  Adam is at the White  House.  And I don't think he's letting it go, James Freeman.  I think Paul  Ryan still wants this border adjustment tax in there even though it gets  massive pushback from his colleagues. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And the economics makes sense, we are talking about how  most economists will tell you want a tax consumption instead of working  investment but he's got a lot of work to do on the sales end.  If he can't  persuade his colleagues, he's got to just focus on tax cuts.  You know,  we've in White House for five months, a person who is ready to sign a tax  cut, ready to sign health care reform, investors, voters had been saying,  to the legislature when are you going to do this stuff on his desk? </p><p>I think, you know, maybe there is more optimism now that they get that  urgency on hill, we see the health care moving forward and I think whatever  deal he's able to work out in terms of Paul Ryan in the House, he's got to  do it too. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think that the markets would react well even if it's not  a broad tax reform plan and it's just tax cuts?</p><p>FREEMAN:  As long as it's - I think the biggest game changer is either -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Corporate tax.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- is really big cut in that corporate rate.  So, I think if you  tell markets and you make it clear that we're going to have a long-term  reform to grow the economy faster, I think people understand that it allows  to generate the growth that can pay more bills for the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  If you want to make it riveting and neutral but why are talking  about cutting spending, rolling spending back instead of the border  adjustment tax, the Senate Republicans are just not going to go for that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are you going to get - where are you going to cut the  spending though, that's the issue.  I mean, most of the money is in the  entitlements.  They don't want to talk about cutting Social Security.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.  They're not going go after the -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this president is all about helping and boosting the  military.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  So, yes, they have to go -</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SHAFFER:  I mean, look, I just (INAUDIBLE) on a letter recently saying, we  need to look at a black.  The DOD spends a lot of money for global  infrastructure that we don't - we don't use.  So, there's a huge area we  could pick and look at.  Of course, the politics of that is certain people  don't want things cut in their district but that's always an issue.   Secondly, I think we've look at -- big ticket items need to be looked at  that he tweeted on the F-35, for goodness sake, the F-35 has been an issue  for a long time.  Much of the defense budget is tied up on that.  So, I  think you can look at offsets right now that would help reduce some of this  so you don't have to worry about tax increases but nobody seems to be want  to do this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is all the making of the sausage that they are supposedly  having these meetings about behind closed doors right now.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, yes.  The reason - the reason there - it's 52 Republicans  negotiating this is because all the Democrats said, we're not interested in  amending Obamacare.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  They don't want to participate.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's why they're not part of the negotiation, they've said  they're not going to vote for it.  So, when they come out with that plan,  there will be some entitlement reform because you're basically talking  about fixing Medicaid which expanded under Obamacare.  This is an amazing  program.  As bad as it is for taxpayers, patients are generally better off  with no insurance or they're nowhere soft than with Medicaid.  So, it  doesn't work for anybody and reforming that, I think it's going to be part  of this package.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're also talking about reforming technology of government,  obviously tech titans went to Washington yesterday.  Top industry leaders  met with the president and other administration officials to talk about how  government technology can become more efficient.  Here's what commerce  secretary Wilbur Ross told me about the meeting earlier in the program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  The government not just  the federal but also state and local government generally has not spent  very much on upgrading their technology.  Might have archaic equipment is  being used, a lot of equipment where you can barely get proper support  anymore.  And there are various estimates the government may be spending  something like $90 billion a year on maintaining systems that fundamentally  are obsoleted by modern standards.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That seems like a lot of low hanging fruit to me, you guys,  what do you think?</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, it's easy, I mean, to me, one of the things we (INAUDIBLE)  the G6 of the division, I was the communications guy and they - I'll be  making decision to roll into vista as an operating system even though  everybody else to include commerce and bypass vista.  But because of their  procurement process and the way they program, they've wasted - my estimate  close to $2 million per sector just on this bad decision.  So the part of  the problem is not necessarily technology, it's people not being able to  make decision to acquire and adapt --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Well, this brings about a decision setting down - you hope it's  not just for show in the media.  Hey, we're all getting together.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  I think President Trump will be the first there a long time to  take action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  This should be a way to make government cheaper basically  to get rid of people and use technology instead.  If that's not the goal,  if this is just about allowing government to do more of what it does,  that's going to be a big loss.  But if they're focused on using this as a  cost saver, outside of the military where they actually have tanks and guns  and going blow up stuff.  Most of government just moves information around.   They don't actually produce anything.  There should be an industry that  I.T. can make much more efficient in terms of many, many fewer people.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, the B.A. and DOD is a good example where they have nobody  can actually bridge medical information from the private sector to the  government sector to help manage healthcare.  So this is a great microscopy  --</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  You need them to talk to each other -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SHAFFER:  Yes.  And so - well, you're right.  DOD does have some  experience.  They still won't - and I know of best solutions that have been  purchased by the Department of Defense, they won't implement because of  politics.  So, what he says may be true about them trying to talk but the  problem is culture trying to -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  I used to work at the SCC and there was - I don't know if this is  still true but there was a form that mutual funds have to submit in DOS, so  they all have to get DOS.</p><p>SHAFFER:  DOS?</p><p>FREEMAN:  A program -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- used on - I mean, sort of 20 years? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Just put it (INAUDIBLE) for god sake.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  I don't even know what DOS is. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Let me switch gears.  The travel company that  took Otto Warmbier to North Korea says it will no longer escort Americans  to the hermit kingdom.  The 22 -year-old died after returning to the States  with severe brain damage.  President Trump weighed in on the tragic  incident yesterday.  Here's what he said. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He spent a year and a half  in North Korea.  A lot of bad things happened.  But at least we got him  home to be with his parents where they were so happy to see him even though  he was in very tough condition but he just passed away a little while ago.   That's a brutal regime, and we will be able to handle it. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Colonel Shaffer, your thoughts. </p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, look, him saying, we will be able to handle it, the  president saying that I think it means we're going to do something we  should.  As a father of a 23-year-old, I would just be heartbroken.  I  don't know how the parents are enduring this, but clearly - this whole  trend of opening up to North Korea has been a bad policy.  The idea of  regularizing relationships is like regularizing our relationship with a -  with a cobra.  The cobra is always going to do what a cobra does and I  think the idea that we're trying to work with China, work with them, I  mentioned earlier, the case on free trade zone were essentially - the South  Koreans get free trade - free labor from the North Koreans and they pay  North Korean labor to do things.  It might have just goes with the  government.  So, I think there's been a lot of ill thought ideas of how to  outreach and work with the North Koreans which has not benefited the people  of North Korea or us. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of people, you know, say what was he doing there?  Why  was he there?  He was in China and went on a tour with a tour company from  China to North Korea, that's what he was doing there with other students. </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  But the tour company should not be pushing to be in areas like  that that are very dangerous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We will take a break.  Stay with Fox  Business.  House Speaker Paul Ryan is speaking about the GOP tax plan later  today.  We are going to - we are going to take it to you live at 12:45  Eastern.  Stay right here as we take the House speaker's comments in the  first major tax speech this morning at manufacturing summit.</p><p>Coming up, a scorcher in the southwest, a record-breaking heat wave, so  hot, it's forcing airlines to ground flights. How long the triple-digit  temperatures are expected to last?  And then, a stamp that ensure to have  collectors over the moon, check it out.  The postal service releasing a  stamp that puts in eclipse at the tip of your fingertips.  We'll show you  how it works.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Dozens of flights out of Arizona Sky Harbor  International Airport are being canceled this morning because it is simply  too hot to fly.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Good  morning, Maria.  This is Phoenix in particular.  American Airlines saying  the small region of planes have a maximum operating temperature of 118  degrees.  So those planes can't fly if it's 120 degrees which is expected  to hit today.  Temperatures like this have not been seen in Phoenix since  1990 when the city endured a record-breaking 122-degree heat wave causing  grounded flights, airport closures, three people actually died that day.   So, American is giving passengers now the option of a refund or a free  booking on another flight if you want to change your plans.</p><p>Well, British officials are charging Barclays and four former top  executives with fraud over fundraising with Qatari investors.  The criminal  charges sent from Barclays investment during the height of the financial  crisis  It's the first time that top executives of the U.K. bankers going  to face criminal charges for their actions during that sort of time.  We  should say Barclays, the stock under pressure slightly almost down about  one percent.  And here as you can see on your screen.</p><p>Well, we are probably not alone.  NASA has spotted 10 new planets outside  of our solar system.  They are likely the right size and temperature to  potentially support life.  The Opinion Space found data from the couple of  telescope during the first four years of its primary mission.  NASA says it  only looked in a tiny part though of the galaxy.  There could be more out  there.</p><p>And let's stay in space just here for a moment.  The postal service out  with a new stamp today that you can have some with, the special edition of  Forever stamp features a solar eclipse to celebrate the Great American  Eclipse that's going to hit on August 21st.  But here's the fun part.  As  you can see with the heat of your finger, the stamp transforms the sun into  the moon.  The solar eclipse will be visible along the 70-mile wide path  that runs from Oregon down to South Carolina, Maria.  And those are your  headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Fun, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, it looked really cool.  All right.  Thank you,  Cheryl.  Coming up.  The opioid epidemic hits Ohio.  How the state is  working to stem the tide of overdose deaths.  And then the growing  political divide, more Americans believe D.C. has gotten too uncivil since  the election.  We will take a look at what can be done to heal the  division.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  America's opioid crisis is reaching a breaking  point.  Take a look at this.  Authorities in Montgomery County, Ohio say  that they've seen 365 opioid-related deaths this year alone.  The county  tops the nation in overdose deaths and authorities there are calling this a  mass casualty event.  I want to bring in Montgomery County Sheriff Phil  Plummer.  Sheriff, thanks very much for joining us.  And in just five  months the number of opioid-related deaths in your county has already  surpassed the entire last year in terms of numbers.  Why do you think this  is happening? </p><p>PHIL PLUMMER, MONTGOMERY COUNTY SHERIFF:  Good morning, Maria.  Yes.  This  is a tremendous epidemic for us.  We're going to double last year's death  total to set a new record this year.  And it's just happening because  there's a perfect storm of location or economic problems and, you know,  this has been a challenge for all of us.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How are you dealing with this?  Are the authorities fighting  against this opioid epidemic in any specific way?</p><p>PLUMMER:  Yes.  We're very innovative about this, we're working hard, we've  come up some great programs, you know, we're actually - we have Narcan in  cruiser, we're saving lives with Narcan, we're driving addicts to  treatment, we're sending out recovery teams to addict's houses with social  workers, police officers, we're trying to educate the addict's families on  how to get out of this problem.  So, you know, we're working hard on it but  unfortunately, we're not making much progress.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Hey, Sheriff, this is Tony Shaffer.  I'm an alumni of - alumnus  of the Wright State University right there.  So the poll that where I went  to college is actually at the heart of all this.  Do you believe some of  this is because you all are at the - at the intersection of 75 and 70, the  routes for a lot of stuff moving?  Just so happens you guys happen to be  kind of the drop-off point for a lot of this and is there anything the  federal government can do to help you diminish the supply coming into the  region.  </p><p>PLUMMER:  Your location like I said, that's a perfect storm, 70 and 75,  that's the crossroads of America.  So, you know, Dayton has become a source  city where they bring Heroin and the Fentanyl straight from Mexico to  Dayton, Ohio then they can drop on 70 and they go east and west in New York  and Chicago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's amazing.  So it's just the fact that you're right near  the route of where this -- the drugs are coming in? </p><p>PLUMMER:  Yes, yes.  It's a perfect storm for us saying, you know, they  need more resources from the federal government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the President has taken executive action by forming a  commission to combat drug addiction and this opioid crisis.  You want to  see funding from the government?  What else do you want from the government  in terms of addressing this in Montgomery County?  </p><p>PLUMMER:  We need funding, we need more boots on the ground, you know, we  all been - we've had a bad economic downturn, we've lost a lot of officers,  so we need more resources on the ground because we have to work on this  through the supply - the supply how much is coming from Mexico.  We have to  work on the demand, we have to treat our users and have to get into  prevention and education to keep the next generation from falling into this  trap.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Hi, James Freeman here with the Journal.  Speaking about  education, I know a lot of programs around the country or a lot of schools  have these DARE programs, police officers educating kids starting at a very  young age.  Is there something related to that or not doing as you see this  particular epidemic, is there somebody parents ought to be doing that we're  not?  </p><p>PLUMMER:  Yes.  People -- there is a lot of understanding about the opioid  crisis, so what we're starting now is we're having town hall meetings and  all of our churches, we need to get the congregations to our -- in front of  our panelists and educate them on what's going on and what to be aware of,  you know, how to protect your children.  I, mean, we're losing our kids  every day here in this community.</p><p>SHAFFER:  I have a follow-up question, Sheriff, on the issue of how the  stuff is coming into the region and what you guys are doing about it.  Is  there any way to try to go after the money?  I mean, I work kind  counterdrug in the 90s, and obviously the financial motives for this sort  of thing by those who control the flow if you - if you start going right at  the money, that's one issue.  So have you guys been able to look at who's  dealing this?  You mentioned some of the folks transporting this.  I know  you can't necessarily get ahead of the pipeline but there are certain  things you can do to take the financials and (INAUDIBLE) you guys look at  how to get at the financial aspects of this at all.</p><p>PLUMMER:  Yes.  We've done - we've been targeting the cartel members, we  have two cartels, Mexican cartels bringing the product to our community.   So, you know, we've been watching them in various hotels and we've been  trying to capture the moneys.  And the last couple of years, we've taken  $5.5 dollars cash off of the streets from the cartels that would have gone  back to Mexico.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Wow.  Good.</p><p>PLUMMER:  Yes.  So, unfortunately, that's not working either.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Ohio is suing top pharmaceutical companies.  They  say allegedly they downplayed the risk of addiction to drive sales, Purdue  Pharma, Johnson and Johnson, Allergan, among those facing these lawsuits.   Do you agree with that?  Is some of the blame on these pharmaceutical  companies?</p><p>PLUMMER:  Yes.  Yes.  Definitely, they have some accountability here.  And,  you know, and I support the lawsuits but unfortunately, that's a long-term  solution for this problem and we've been fighting this problem for four  years.  So, we need some immediate resources here in this community.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching.  Sheriff, thanks very much for  weighing in and explaining the story to us.  We appreciate it.  Sheriff  Phil Plummer joining us.  Montgomery County there.  Coming up.  D.C. has  Georgia on its mind today.

And here are  your top stories, 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  A busy day at 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue today.  President Trump will host the president of the  Ukraine at the White House later this afternoon.  The meeting comes amid  rising tensions in our nation's capital.  A new poll shows a vast majority  of Americans believe political debate is becoming increasingly uncivil and  it is encouraging violence.  The trend is sure to be on voters' minds as  they head to the polls in Georgia today.</p><p>KAREN HANDEL, GEORGIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  I feel great, very, very  encouraged by things the enthusiasm on the ground has been amazing. </p><p>JON OSSOFF, GEORGIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  I think this is an  opportunity for Georgia to elect some fresh leadership that's focused on  delivering results for folks at home, focus on what people that kind  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Over 140,000 ballots have already been cast as Jon Ossoff and  Karen Handel vie for the empty House seat latest on a special election in  Georgia and South Carolina, this morning.

Oil  prices are driving the action for stock prices this morning, crude oil is  down better than two percent right now and that has taken the wind out of  gains for stock prices, there's oil down $1.13, that's 21/2 percent at  $43.07 a barrel on oil sweet crude.</p><p>Futures meanwhile are also their high take a look at stocks here and the  Dow Industrials averages now negative expected to open down about seven  points.  S&amp;P is also negative both the Dow and the S&amp;P hit record highs  yesterday at the close.  The Nasdaq is swill positive although it is well  off of the highs of the morning, in Europe, similar situation, as oil has  reversed course and worsened, European markets have also done so.  The F.T.  100 is down eight points, the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are up but  just fractionally.  And Asia overnight markets closed mostly lower with the  exception of Japan it was up one percent.  </p><p>Americans on both sides of the aisle now say the tone and level of civility  in our political debate is getting much worse according to a new poll by  CBS News, 68 percent of Americans across all parties said so while just  seven percent said the tone was getting better, better?  Three-quarters of  Americans also say they feel the current tone of political debate is  encouraging violence, joining us right now the Trump great America PAC and  Co-Chair and former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins is here, Ed great to  see you. </p><p>ED ROLLINS, REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT AND ADVISOR:  Thank you, thank  you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think of this?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Obviously there is the rhetoric is much more severe than it's  ever been, and it's been increasing over last 20 years to a point since the  Trump election, now their people are very unhappy their very polarized, you  either for Trump or totally against Trump, and actually to me I can't go to  restaurant anywhere in this country that I hear someone, not adjacent table  talking about politics, I've never seen that before and one sense that's  good because their paying attention another sense is not particularly  positive conversations. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but it's also, you know, you have Hollywood getting in on  the act Robert De Niro saying I want to punch the President in the face  you've got Madonna saying yes I think about blowing up the White House  then, of course, the sickest of them all with Kathy Griffin and her head  that she was holding that time. </p><p>ROLLINS:  I think Hollywood is proven to be totally irrelevant in the last  election when everybody was pretty much for MRS. Clinton didn't make any  difference.  I think the serious thing here though is we could have had a  massacre last week if those two Capitol guards had not been there guarding,  you know, they could have killed 10 members of Congress or more and I think  that's very severe that, you know, this is a deranged guy this is obviously  someone who that just walked on the field that morning, he had planned this  but it's very, very severe. </p><p>TONY SHAFFER, RETIRED UNITED STATES ARMY:  And I said the other day in  interview that I felt that the essentially there's a pathology here and  that pathology mirrors what ISIS has been doing to radicalize its members,  I mean you're talking about a group where you have certain beliefs which  become completely inculcated in your believers to the point of were even  that they believe fiction they believe the whole Russian there, there was  on the other and then you have on top of that then this desensitization of  the groups by media.  Media saying it's OK, to say you want to punch the  President, it's OK to have the image of President Trump being behead and  then that leads them to people acting out.  So I believe that we're on a  path of seeing more of this world thing based on the fact that the left  refuses completely to acknowledge the fact that they are radicalizing  individuals to act.</p><p>ROLLINS:  But the bottom line is both sides have let a tone a down a little  bit there's some very serious we have to debate in the very near future.   The irony is we just haven't a Congressional race today this most expensive  race in the history of the country, over $50 million has been spent on a  Congressional race just to put that in the proper perspective.  When I ran  Reagan 49 state victory we spent $40 million so the publicly financed  campaign $50 million on a singular Congressional pain.  I ran a  Congressional committee in numbers of years ago and my whole budget was in  $50 million here in and across the country.  So the irony here is this to  be interpreted as a Trump victory or Trump defeat in which Trump really  didn't play very much of a part, the Democrats running as a new Democrat,  Karen Handel was one of very, very effective race on the start of the close  I can't tell who's going to win but it's a dead even race today with more  money spent than ever before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is so incredible and by the way, Jon Ossoff doesn't even  live in the district, right?</p><p>ROLLINS:  He's two hours outside the district.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP FUNDS:  And although have  Trump had a little to do with this race, what does this mean for the Trump  agenda going forward?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Specials are always over-interpreted and their totally different  dug and it's five or six specials every cycle between the elections.  But  this clearly if Handel wins, the Trump people certainly well justifiably  argue to their benefit if not the Democrats will argue this is a rejection  of Trump even though Trump really was a debater very much and a course.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is a Republican district all the way back to a red new  days.</p><p>ROLLINS:  This is (INAUDIBLE) this is the district he first won.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  The Democrats have changed slightly and I don't think you should  over-interpreted but it's an Atlantic District It's a big media market, but  it's some time want to watch very closely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSISTANT EDITOR EDITORIAL PAGE:   I've just want to relate, this Ossoff message he's a former staff or for  very liberal Democratic member of Congress, he's raised money from  Democrats all around the country calling himself independent.  When people  ask him if his force Nancy Pelosi, he said he hadn't given them an ounce of  thought.  Is that possibly true? </p><p>ROLLINS:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then talks an independent, no.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And I promise you if he gets elected tomorrow or tonight which I  hope doesn't happen, he'll be played Nancy Pelosi is going to first words  out of his mouth and he thanked you, madam leader, where do I sit?  And how  do I vote, I think that's the key thing. </p><p>SHAFFER:  Do you think it's working?</p><p>ROLLINS:  It's worked there, I mean, it's a -- again, it's not as much a  Republican district as it used to be, Trump carried the district by about  two points in the fall.  And again I don't want to be over-interpreted I  just think it's, it is going to have an impact on recruiting in a certain.   We're going to talk about first few days here but it's not the end game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow it's a real plead heat and voters are also headed to the  polls in South Carolina and the South Carolina fifth district.  This is to  fill the seat of the one, formerly held on Mick Mulvaney, that hasn't got  nearly as much attention but this is also an important race.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Two important race all over the Democrats have an wait much of a  battle there.  So we should win that race in for some reason they come  close the Democrats without spending much money then that I think of South  Carolina is a more of an indicator of what's occurring here.  I think the  reality here is we're going to move full, that's a very tough battles ahead  and I think the polarization that were talking about in the beginning of  this segment is very severe in the Congress and the problem is there's not  enough, Republicans don't have enough Republicans to do all of things they  want to do, even if they have majority and there's not enough money for  both sides to do all that they want to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the things they want to do is repeal and replace  Obamacare, they say that there is going to be a vote in the Senate next  week Ed, and then they are talking about tax reforms after the summer.  Do  you still think the agenda getting executed as viable this year? </p><p>ROLLINS:  I think it's tough, I think no one holds what's in the Senate  bill and Senator McConnell it's pretty much his bill so the few people  getting their advice, it's still not poputive a House bill was overwhelm  not (INAUDIBLE).  However it comes out as a big selling job that has to  take place there's only one person that can sell it, and that's the  President.  The President has to go out across this country and the only  criticism I have of the President today is you can't do one-day events, you  can't go out and say today is infrastructure day and tomorrow is tech day  and what you have.  If he wants to sell health care he's going to be out  there every day for weeks and weeks and weeks telling American public why  this is going to work and why it's better than Obamacare.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point, Ed.</p><p>SHAFFER:  On the issue of Senate and from what they're doing with the  health care bill, I see a lot of changes coming that's going to have to go  into some sort of a reconciliation between the House again.  Quick question  do you see the House staying though August?  Do you see that the potential  have actually -</p><p>ROLLINS:  I wish they would but that's what (INAUDIBLE) wish thanking for,  odd realistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They have talked about it, right?</p><p>ROLLINS:  They have talked about it but the bottom-line is they never gave  that up, they've all got junkyards that are all going back home and they've  got vacation plans like everybody else.  I just wish they wouldn't take so  many vacations, I think this is very serious year, we've got some very big  issues today the speakers speech is going to be very, very important on the  tax - what is his tax plan has the guy knows more about the taxes than  anybody and he's going to basically give anything or that basically don't  know about so far.  I think getting this tax plan through a tax reform is  critical, I think health care is important but I think tax is critical -</p><p>ZUMARAGGA:  It's also critical for the stock market and were reaching all- time highs because of tax reform may happen -</p><p>ROLLINS:  It's the hope and so for some reason, we go to the next two  months and we don't think it's going to happen, I think markets going to  change.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well it's also Republicans political survival next fall is  they're going to get the economy growing faster.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the promise the President made the rest of it is totally  relevant.  The international stuff that he's all dealing with it is  critical as part of any Presidents responsibility but what he promised the  American public, so I'm going to fix the economy and I want to create jobs  your lives going to be better and there's a whole lot of stuff has to  happen for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is what is going to leave voters in 2018, for the next  group of elections, do you think voters will remember the way that the left  has been obstructing and basically pushing back on the agenda that America  voters - </p><p>ROLLINS:  I think the problems is you have both sides are very polarized,  so Democrats aren't being turned off by this activity and Republicans, the  same way, it's so if two very anti entities out there and I think the  bottom line is those that are independents and the worry that I think Trump  has is that some of the independents who voted for him in the fall are  starting to back away and independents carry the day today.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  And just given that we had this attempted assassination last  week, do you think it's time for Democrats to stop calling themselves the  resistance?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Yes. </p><p>FREEMAN:  As if they are French freedom fighters battling the Nazis  - </p><p>ROLLINS:  They're very important that the rhetoric get toned down, I mean  you can go fight on the floor, and make whatever kinds of comments you  want, but you got cut stop this personal attack and you got to quit  basically making enemies out of the opposite side.  Part of the breakdown  I've been around the game 50 years is it used to be there was social you  can still fight still be partisan. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you go have a cup of coffee.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Still have a couple coffee or drink or dinner what have you, you  have to know his at his family's and you realize we're all Americans today  they don't sit together they don't talk together staffers don't meet  together and they just are polarized they hate each and  that's other a  terrible place to be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean listen to Chuck Schumer yesterday, saying that,  you know, they are passing something in the dead of night as if nobody  remembers the way Obamacare was passed, and stuck down everybody's throat. </p><p>ZUMARAGGA:  And that what he said you'll find out what's in the bill when  it is passed. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what Nancy Pelosi said.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And unfortunate all those words are going to coming back this  time if we don't do it differently and that's my concern at this point in  time.  I think we got to get this thing drafted I don't have any problems  Senator McConnell of doing it.  I just think it has to get very open we're  going to have a big debate on it, people have to know what this is all  about if not we'll pay a heavy price. </p><p>ZUMARAGGA:  And we'll give Chuck Schumer more than 10 hours, to see what's  in the bill. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He wants for this than ever that's what he said as well.  Ed  great to see you</p><p>ROLLINS:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much great insights as always from Ed Rollins.   Coming up Amazon's deal to acquire whole foods could send cashiers packing  the potential trouble ahead for grosser is it going robotic?  And then  Santa sleigh make come with a surcharge where the shipping giant is  planning to charge more for holiday delivery there were at UPS, back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  With O&amp;M, head of Chinese e-commerce giant,  Alibaba is rolling into mortar city.  Here's Nicole Petallides covering the  story from New York, Stock Exchange.  Hi, Nicole. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Thank you, Maria.  That is  right.  Technology and e-customers wave off the future.  The story was  exactly that Jack Ma, Chairman of Alibaba, is coming into moderate gateway  conference and is going to meet with over 3,000 businesses all to go with  the pledge to President Donald Trump in creating jobs.  Alibaba has already  done millions and millions of jobs in China and China e-commerce.  By the  way, the only sales reported are 771 billion clearly out places that are in  the United States.  This year, it is at 446 billion in the hopes of trying  to get U.S. businesses to now work with Alibaba.  That in itself is a big  deal.</p><p>Jack Ma also has power in bringing head of UPS in order to make this deal  happen.  There are concerns because you have these sellers lacking the  clarity of merchandise and can step in trying to woo U.S, besides creating  jobs to Amazon -- we know Amazon made that nearly $14 billion deal with  Whole Foods.  Reports are now going to use strategy of Amazon so that  customers can now walk around the store with no cashiers, just technology  sensors, streamers, and maybe humans just in the back monitoring things at  the place.  You can walk out with items with human interaction but the  problem with initial platform is that when the store is getting too crowded  in a prolonged time, it can no longer monitor what the customer has picked  up.  They say -- we will keep an eye on the business that's at stake.  </p><p>There is also talk of new stores that may not be exactly Whole Foods, you  know, and new brands as well, that may be less price because the stocks are  trying to shed that Whole Foods, whole paycheck image and trying to make it  ready for everybody.  Maria, back to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Nicole Petallides, thank you so much.  We will  watch that.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, final thoughts  from our all-star panel.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Final thoughts from our all-stars.  Heather. </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  A big week ahead we got rate hikes, Sessions testimony may be  in public or private and big tech names to watch. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Buckle up, that's what you're saying. </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Buckle up. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Freeman.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm watching the text docs too, I also want to say happy  anniversary mom and dad Steve and Gloria Block. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How many years?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Bad son.  But he did wish you a happy anniversary on air.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  The federal reserve is set to raise quarter basis points again  on Wednesday, I'm more interested to see if they hint that unwinding their  balance sheet and reducing some a little the liquidity that helps prop the  markets up. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That we probably won't find out until the fall I think  Septembers the application for that.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Maybe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks to Heather and James, see you all.  All right, we will  leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow with another big show.  As  request \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is on deck.  Stu, take it away. </p><p>830</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Here are your top  stories 6:00 A.M. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump takes aim at North Korea after Otto Warmbier dies days  after returning to the United States with severe brain damage.  The company  that took into the country now saying it will no longer take Americans  there.  It says a tragedy like this should never be repeated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, a push for reform this morning.  \"The Wall  Street Journal\" reporting a health care vote will take place next week.   The administration holding firm that tax reform will also get done this  year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF TREASURY:  I have no higher priority than  having tax reform done this year.  We're working every day.  We're working  with the house and the senate.  We're committed to get this done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Plus, a contentious moment between Senators Mitch McConnell and  Chuck Schumer coming up.</p><p>It is technically not even summer.  But the southwest is facing a dangerous  heat wave this morning.  Temperatures already near triple digits today.  We  will give you the latest.</p><p>And the heat taking a toll.  American Airlines has cancelled more than a  dozen flights.  More than 1,000 needed medical attention at the Electric  Daisy Concert in Las Vegas.</p><p>Markets look like this this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a  mixed opening for the broader averages.  Fractionally better on the  session.  The Dow and the S&amp;P coming up of a record close yesterday.   Looking to extend that today with fractional moves in the upside.  Dow  Industrial sets to open up about 10 points.  Ditto for the NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe, the indices look like this.  Take a look.  European indices  higher across the board with the CAC quarante in Paris, best performer up  about a third of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower, meanwhile.  Take a look.  As  you see the best performer was the Nikkei in Japan that was up one percent.   The others down fractionally.</p><p>Tom Brady wants to play an NFL game outside of the U.S.  We will reveal  where he says is his dream country to play one day.  All those stories  coming up this morning.</p><p>And joining me to talk about it, financial analyst Heather Zumarraga is  with us.  Wall Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James  Freeman is with us.  And the London Center for Policy Research, Vice  President Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer is here.  Great to see you.</p><p>TONY SHAFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Great seeing you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's on top this morning, James?  What do you think of the  big stories?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, at long last, patients, doctors, taxpayers may finally see  the beginning of the end of ObamaCare.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  They were looking for a vote next week.  So  we'll see that.  We will talk about all of that this morning.</p><p>Coming up joining the conversation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is with  us today.  Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn is with us today.  Fox  News Military analyst, Jack Keane is here.  Harvard law professor emeritus  Alan Dershowitz is here.  And former Raegan campaign advisor, Ed Rollins is  here as well.  You don't want to miss moments of it.  So just stay with us  throughout the show.</p><p>We kick it off this hour right now with Otto Warmbier.  The American  student imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months and sent back to the United  States in a persistent vegetative state last week, died yesterday.  He died  at the tender age of 22 years old.  Doctors treating the University of  Virginia student said late last week that Warmbier had extensive loss of  brain tissue and he was in the state of unresponsive wakefulness.</p><p>Warmbier had been sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea for  allegedly stealing a propaganda poster during an organized tour to the  isolated country.  The Chinese company behind Young Pioneer Tours, the tour  company that sent him there now says it will stop taking U.S. citizens to  North Korea.</p><p>President Trump weighed in on the sad news from the White House.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Otto Warmbier has just  passed away.  He spent a year and a half in North Korea.  A lot of bad  things happened.  But at least we got him home to be with his parents where  they were so happy to see him, even though he was in very tough condition.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Warmbier's parents Fred and Cindy put the blame squarely at  North Korea writing in a statement, \"Unfortunately the awful torturous  mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensure that  no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today.</p><p>Tony, your take on these developments.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, look, there's no doubt in my mind he was tortured.  Let's  be very clear what happened here.  And I've already said another interviews  I think there needs to be some level of retaliation.  I'll just be that  direct about it.  My son is 23.  I cannot imagine the pain these parents  are going through.  This is truly tragic.</p><p>My understanding from talking to the experts, he was tortured not so much  the way where you'd be pulling fingernails out with tools, but by repeated  drugging, sodium pentothal.  The idea was they were trying to figure out if  he was a CIA spy or not.  He wasn't.  And the continued and repeated  exposure over that year to these drugs is what caused the consistent and  persistent damage of the entire brain.  So it was essentially the use of  these drugs over and over again which caused the brain damage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, there were some reports that he went into the vegetative  state just recently, a couple of weeks ago.  So, was that -- </p><p>SHAFER:  I don't buy that.  I think this -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The whole time you think he was just drugged?</p><p>SHAFFER:  I think they started during his confinement and did it over and  over.  And I think of the reasons they released him --I mean no doubt,  President Trump saw this and started dealing with it early on.  But no  doubt they kind of like saw that some things are going to go tragically  wrong.  We better get this guy out of here, anyway.  So let's serve their  purpose to get him out.</p><p>The parents got their boy back, their son back.  But again, Maria, it does  not change the fact that he was tortured.  This is something that we should  not stand for.  And I believe that President Trump recognizes how hideous  this is and something requires a response.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And what kind of response do you expect? Should be  warranted.</p><p>SHAFFER:  We in the Cold War, we had organizations which focused on is what  they called dirty tricks in the old days.  Look, we need to rethink our  foreign policy.  We cannot simply sit back and let dictators, horrible  people like Kim Jong-un do these things and think they can get away with  it.  There's been no push back.  This is a remote analogy.  But we just  shut down a certain aircraft.  We haven't shut down an aircraft since 1999.    So I think it's time we re-insinuate ourselves in foreign policy in a way  that the -- those bad guys like Un understand there's going to be  consequences for bad behavior.  There's been no bad consequences for  decades.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Otto's parents said that.  Look, President Obama told us to  be quite.  President Trump took our son home.  James, how do you see it?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, this is one of the last to the old style dictatorships.   This is what communists, dictatorships so.  I think it was probably  surprising to a lot of people over the last year following this news that  you actually tend to travel to North Korea.  To this point, the state  department has a -- had a strong warning and I think maybe you'd expect  from now it would be something more like a -- like a band -- I mean,  obviously they don't treat visitors any better than they treat their own  people.  And this -- for anyone who didn't realize that, yes, this is a  wake up call.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  But so maybe we should it be there  though.  There are some -- to some extent, we shouldn't be going to these  places.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But this was a tour company from China, Heather.  I mean, if  you've got a tour company, you may be thinking that you're OK and that  you're with a safe group.</p><p>Let's switch gears to the standoff in the senate right now.  Because this  is also a piece of important business today.  Republicans are aiming for a  vote on the health care bill next week.  A full week ahead of the July 4th  recess since the democrats have begun using parliamentary maneuvers to slow  down business in the chamber though to protest any bill including a series  of back to back speeches on the floor yesterday.</p><p>In one exchange, minority leader Chuck Schumer press his counterpart, Mitch  McConnell to commit to an open debate.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER:  When we have time more than 10  hours, since this is a complicated bill to review the bill, will it be  available to us and the public, more than 10 hours before we have to vote  for it.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER:  I think we'll have an ample  opportunity to read and amend the bill.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you see republicans pushing through to get this done before  July 4th, James Freeman?  And also, what's your take on this ostracism?   They're basically telling you in advance.  Look, we're going to do long  speeches.  We're going to do whatever it takes to waste time so this  doesn't get done?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So a lot of theatrics.  I think the republicans will get it  done.  It's interesting there.   You look at Chuck Schumer saying, I want  10 hours to read bill.  Of course, if you took another clip from that  speech he was saying, as he often does that this is a terrible bill and  he's opposed to it.  So he's not -- he's not an over minded voter here  looking to consider the measure.  He doesn't need 10 hours.  He's already  against it without even having seen it because this is the Obama legacy  project, no matter how bad it's failing.  They have tied themselves to it  politically and they're going to do well of the parliamentary moves they  can do to slow it down but they can't and it'll pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there any chance though that they are able to stop any  business whatsoever that the Trump administration trust to put forth?   That's the whole plan.  Let his president be a president that gets nothing  done.  Let this congress be get nothing done congress that we take the  house in '18 and we impeach him in '20?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think that will work.  Because if you basically make it  impossible to do business, what they're going to do is they're going to  kill the legislative filibuster which still exists and allows them to block  things like -- any measure that can't get 60 votes.  Now, health care is  different because they're going through this recompilation process.  But  basically if they put up a big roadblock like they did with Gorsuch, it'  going to hurt their agenda because they're not going to be able to stop  anything else.  It seems a lot of republicans are going to say, enough.   We're going to filibuster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So then you do think a health care vote happens?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me ask you about House Speaker Paul Ryan.  He  sets to deliver his first major speech on tax reform today.  According to  the excerpts of the speech that have been released, he's expected to urge  republicans, \"We need to get his done in 2017.  We cannot let this once in  a generation moment slip.\"</p><p>Now, Heather, if we don't see tax reform, big implications from markets?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, the markets have been up hitting all-time highs.  Yet  again, I think Futures are up today.  We'll see if the Dow can hit new  highs today.  It's tax reform.  It's health care.  That's what it's all  about.  That's what the markets are running on right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James, what do you want to hear from Paul Ryan today?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'd like to hear him say that the number one priority is growing  this economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what he's going to say.  You know that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I'm worried that he's also going to say that this has got  to be revenue natural.  We've got to stick with the conventions of beltway  score keeping no matter how flawed they are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And that means the border adjustment tax or higher  corporate rate or some kind of a revenue, right?</p><p>FREEMAN:  They've got to get the corporate rate into the teams if we want a  real game changer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Tony?</p><p>SHAFFER:  Look, I think what we've seen over and over again is reluctant  facts to actually break out of what we know doesn't work.  The scoring  system, we know doesn't work, doesn't matter.  The democrats always refer  to it.  And what I don't understand why the republicans haven't gone back  and looked at the numbers that CBO did on the original estimates for  ObamaCare and look at how wildly of they were.  So it's kind of like how is  that you don't just look at what bad work they did and say throw it out  because it doesn't work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  It's funny to hear Chuck Schumer say, well, when  you do things in the dark of night.  Excuse me, ObamaCare was done in the  dark of night.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  No.  Find out what's in the bill after we pass the bill.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nancy Pelosi.  We have the Trump tweets to tell you about the  president is tweeting this morning.  And we want to bring you to you right  now President Trump just tweeting about the Georgia special election.   \"Democrat Jon Ossoff who wants to raise your taxes to the highest level and  is weak on crime and security doesn't even live in the district.  Karen  Handel for congress, she will fight for lower taxes, great health care,  strong security.  A hard worker who will never give up.  Vote today.</p><p>We've got more analysis on this.  The special election happening in  Georgia.  Of course it's real important.  It's the most money, right?  In  the congressional election.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Ossoff has raised more than 23 million bucks.  He's got about  five times the money that Karen Handel has.  He's raising his money  basically outside of Georgia.  So it's going to be a question of whether  people want to -- Georgia voters want to allow the rest of the country's  liberals to use them as a vehicle to oppose the president.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does this tell us anything, I mean, if Ossoff wins or Handel  wins, does this tell us anything about the republican party or democratic  party today do you think?  Is this going to be sort of an indicator?</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, Georgia has been one of the states that the democrats have  been trying to turn for a while.  I mean, there was during the last  election cycle, I believe, which was not founded on anything real that they  could turn this state blue and they didn't.  But I think you see over and  over again, every election, we've seen special cycle election, outside  money's been donated heavily and they've lost every time.  And I think it's  going to happen again here because the overwhelming feeling still is that I  think people want to give President Trump time to get his act together.  I  think this is a microcosm of other things.  And Georgia still I think is  more red than blue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We'll take a short break.  We have a lot more  on the congressional race today.</p><p>But first, let's take a break.  A heat wave is striking the southwest.  The  national weather service predicting highs of 120 degrees today with some  states already having canceled flights to the region.  We're on it next.   Stay with us.  Quick break.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A brutal heat wave hitting the southwest United  States.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Maria.  OK.   Temperatures could reach 120 degrees today in parts of Arizona for the  first time in more than 20 years.  This is a record-breaking 122 that  happened back in 1990.  Also, the city of Las Vegas and southern California  bracing for what authorities are calling a public health hazard.  Death  Valley could reach temperatures as high as 124 degrees.</p><p>Airlines also watching the weather, at least -- excuse me, 20 American  Airlines flights out of Arizona have already been cancelled because those  planes can't operate over a temperature of 118.  That's according to a  statement from the airline.  It's the smaller aircraft.  Americans saying  that flight changes are going to be free of charge for passengers.</p><p>Meanwhile, one person is dead and nearly 1,000 needed medical attention on  site at the Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas.  Sixteen other people  taken to a local hospital.  According to -- still can't determine the cause  of death for 34-year-old Michael Morse.  He passed away after attending the  festival on Saturday.  The heat though could have been a factor.  The  temperature in Las Vegas reach 110 degrees.  He experienced convulsions  about 3:23 in the morning.  According to police there, a total of 340  medical calls were handled on Saturday.</p><p>And you were just talking about this, Maria.  Over 140,000 ballots have  already been cast in the Georgia congressional race for democrat John  Ossoff is looking to defeat Karen Handel.  Ossoff raising, a record setting  15 million.  President Trump tweeting on the election just saying this, big  day tomorrow in Georgia and South Carolina.  ObamaCare is dead.  Dems wants  to raise taxes big.  They can only obstruct.  No ideas vote \"R.\"  And this  coming as a new ad pack - ad paid for by PAC supporting Handel is receiving  backlash for showing images of House Majority Whip Scalise after he was  shot in a baseball game last week.  The spokesperson for Handel condemning  that act saying, \"For any group to use the shootings this week for  political or personal benefit is shameful.  This group should be ashamed.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, South Carolina also holding elections.  Democrat Archie Parnell  faces republican Paul Norman to replace Mick Mulvaney.  And of course the  president tapped to be budget director.  That election is going to test if  the republican candidate can gain support from largely African-American  districts, Maria.  So a lot going on politically today.  Those were your  headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl.  Thanks so much.  Coming up next, record  closing for the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 yesterday.  Technology stops once again  rebounding and leading this market high.  We're taking a closer look at  markets and the best performers, next.</p><p>Then play a game, win a job.  Jaguar L, Land Rover's new technique for  recruiting engineers straight ahead.  Stay with us right here \"Mornings  with Maria.\"  After this.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Stocks looking to extend yesterday's record run.   The gains driven by the technology sector yesterday.  Of course, tech has  been down and now it looks like it's stabilizing a bit in recent weeks.</p><p>Joining us right now is GFI Group chief macro strategist, John Spallanzani.   John good to see you.</p><p>JOHN SPALLANZANI, CHIEF MACRO STRATEGIST, GFI GROUP:  Good seeing you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's going on in markets right now?  Is money coming back  into technology after the Amazon announcement of the Whole Foods?</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  I think we saw some rotation out of tech and into some of the  big financial names.  Hopefully that they're expecting some tax relief.   Obviously a steeper occur because the Fed hike rates.  I think that we see  small caps catching a bit again.  Those have been flat for a while, for six  months.  We've been consolidating all those stocks that run up after the  election kind of went sideways and now we're starting to see some rotations  which is healthy in the market.</p><p>The NASDAQ is up 16 percent.  The S&amp;P is almost up 10 percent now.  So we  saw a lot of momentum into, again, the dime and so there was a bit  divergence between tech last week was down like 150 basis points.  But yet,  the diamonds were up 180 basis points.  So those are three percent swing in  one week where guys obviously rotating out of tech and then for someone  bigger names.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then bigger names and you say diamond.  Bigger names -- </p><p>SPALLANZANI:  The Dow stocks and also the S&amp;P stocks.  People are expecting  the effective tax rates and corporations to go down.  So those corporations  with the highest effective tax rates right now are being targeted because  they're going to get the biggest boost if we do get some taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  targeted to buy.  So Wall Street still believes in tax reform  in '17 is what you're saying?</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  I think the media is more interested in '17 and '18.  I think  right now we're just worried about the message.  But the message is good  right now.  And I think that whether it's '17 or '18, there's other good  things.  Earnings are obviously very good.  I don't think -- we didn't see  -- this rally is not based on multiple expansions.  It's really based on  earnings so far.</p><p>So if you look at stock multiples compared to credit and bonds, stocks are  still cheap relative to the other two.  So, where else are you going to put  your money?</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  But they are still expensive relative to their earnings  historically -- that's a hard metric to pin down.  Because -- OK.  Let's  say they're not relative to their earnings.  Here's on the upper level.   Here's where I'm wondering is how much of this is company's doing well, how  much is the optimism surrounding Trump and reform and how much is still  very loose monetary policy around the world?  We're -- in the U.S. kind of  taking baby steps toward going back to normal.  But in central banks, they  printed a lot of money.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Last week, even though we raised, a lot of people are point out  that the central banks around the world, including Europe and Japan are  still easing at a rate of $1 trillion, so global central banks are still  easing although we're increasing rates in the U.S.</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  Yes.  There's still a lot of capital around.  I think the  other reason why our yield curve is so flat because, again, treasuries are  tier one capital that everybody has not the balance sheets.  There's no  alternative to treasuries, really.  So, do you want to invest in goes to 27  basis points?  Which is like last night.  What do you want it by treasury  220?  That's the trade.  So there's not a lot of alternatives to what you  have going on.  So that's another thing that's keeping rates down that's  helping.</p><p>Just last night, just this morning, Carney said, I'm not going to tight in  -- the Bank of England is not going to tie because he fears that we have  still on present talks, want to go slow.  Les Evans.  Last night again that  listen, we're not going to tight in -- we might not tight in September,  maybe December because inflation is still undershooting the Feds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  So the Fed is still a major factor here, is what you're  saying.  And Easy money around the world.</p><p>Let me ask you, what would you do right now?  Do you want to put money into  this market here knowing that maybe health care reform gets done next week?   I mean, the health care bill rather, the vote.  And then tax reform later  in the year.  And then what about Europe?</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  I think steady as she goes.  I mean, it's evitable for quite  a long time.  I still think that we're at 2,500 now.  Have a few bets,  personal bets to - we might hit 2,700 by the end of the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  In the S&amp;P 500.  Yup.  That's a big -- it's a big move from  here.  But it's still June and there's so much left that we could do and  especially if the Fed does not hike in September, there's not a lot of  resistance above.</p><p>I think right now, when I'm watching, is the unemployment rate next in July  rate.  If we start to see that tick higher then I would get more concerned.   Right now, unemployment is obviously very low.  And also wages are kind of  not so hot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  Stagnant.</p><p>SHAFFER:  I have a quick question on Brexit.  We had one year anniversary  couple days ago.  They're starting to make their negotiations.  How do you  see your stocks worth rolling as a negotiation starts?</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  European stocks have been actually performing better than --  that's my marker right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  With the easy money there, yes.</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  Yes, the easy money.  But I think that May has got problems,  right?  So we see that the more problems May has, the higher the market  goes in Europe, right?  So that meeting that Brexit is not going to be a  hard Brexit. So I think new markets going to discounting that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Oil price is down.  Okay.</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  Who would have thought that oil via 44 and the stocks be at  2,500.  So oil is a technology driven story, not a supply story and not a  recessionary story.  That's a huge positive oil being a 44.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.  A technology story?</p><p>SPALLANZANI:  Fracking and the ability for the U.S. to be one of the  biggest exporters in the world and that's really Trump's</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John, great to see you.  Thank you so much.  John Spallanzani  joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, police reportedly identified the man suspected of plowing his  van into a crowded London.  47-year-old, Darren Osborne is arrested by  authorities on suspicion of terrorist offences.</p><p>And then technology giants headed to Washington.  I'll speak with Commerce  Secretary Wilbur Ross about President Trump's meeting yesterday with  Silicon Valley CEOs.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST:  Welcome  back, good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.

And as you say, it's  going to be an extension of that even if it's just fractionally.  Dow  Industrials set to open about 14 points today.  In Europe, the major  averages are mostly higher.  Take a look.  The FT-100 up a fraction, the  CAC Quarante in Paris is up a third of a percent.  In the DAX Index in  Germany up a quarter of a percent.  In Asia overnight, stocks closed mostly  lower with the Exception of Japan.  The Hang Seng, the Shanghai, and the  KOSPI all down.  The Nikkei averaging Japan up almost one percent.  </p><p>And the GOAT takes on the Great Wall.  NFL legend, Tom Brady says his dream  is to play a game in China.  Our top story this half an hour, though, let's  kick it off here with the top names and technology meeting the President  Trump yesterday.  The White House is teaming up with industry leaders to  modernize the government's technology infrastructure, and strengthen cyber  security.  The President spoke yesterday about why he's turning to the tech  titans to help achieve those goals. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT:  The businesses represented here  today employed hundreds of thousands of American workers.  Your innovation  has shaped the modern world and created millions of jobs.  America should  be the global leader in government technology just as we are in every other  aspect, and we are going to start our big edge again in technology.  It's  such an important industry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.   Secretary Ross, it's always a pleasure.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE.  Good to see you again,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the President is estimating that this initiative could save  the U.S. a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.  How would it work,  take us behind the meeting and what was most important yesterday?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, these factors that the government not just the federal but  also state and local government generally has not spent very much on  upgrading their technology.  A lot of archaic equipment that's been used,  lot of equipment where you can barely get proper support anywhere.   And  there are various estimates that the government may be spending, something  like $90 billion a year on maintaining systems that fundamentally are  obsoleted by modern standards.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are these companies ready and willing to help in this effort?   There were 18 CEOs there yesterday.  What kind of a sense did you get from  companies of what they will actually do to achieve that goal?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, the real specifics of the plan haven't been worked out  (INAUDIBLE) but they all acknowledge the need.  They all acknowledge that  the -- if we thought about capital expenditure rather than maintenance,  we'd be a lot better off.  So, there's a lot of investigation as to the  extent to which we could simply reinvest in equipment, funding that  otherwise would have to go for maintenance.  It's kind of a juggling act.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I could totally see that.  And you think this will - this would  save a trillion dollars over 10 years?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, it certainly can be a very, very big number, as I've said.   There's something like 90 billion a year or more that's spent on  maintenance of the equipment and maintaining an obsolete thing.  Think  about your car.  Once your car gets to be, what, 10 years old, you start  putting in inordinate amount into its maintenance relatively to what would  be the maintenance on a vehicle.  So, one of the peculiarities of  government accounting is that a capital expenditure and in expense more or  less treated the same way from a budgetary point of view whereas the  capital expenditure has enduring value, it has a long-term asset value,  whereas the maintenance, the out of pocket expense that just comes in is  just gone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see that the Homeland Security Secretary was there.  Wilbur,  let me ask you about security and what came around that topic.  You've got  the leaders of some of these companies that can actually have a real hand  in helping protect our data cybersecurity huge issue.  And then, of course,  there's the extremisms in terms of content online.  What was said about  those topics?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, Homeland Security and cyber security are inextricably in  linked together.  And cybersecurity is a problem everywhere.  You've seen  some of the recent hacking in (INAUDIBLE) a very, very big scale.  Some of  which were for commercial purposes.  Others of which appear perhaps to have  been for national security purposes.  So, I think we're going to find.  The  defenders of security, cybersecurity, keep developing new firewalls, new  ways to keep the bad people out.  And yet, there's a great deal of  ingenuity on the part of the hackers to figure out new ways to intrude and  new ways to be disruptive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they sure are.  Let's talk trade, Secretary.  I enjoyed  that piece with you and the Journal the other day in terms of the  conservation on trade.  We're all trying to figure out when we'll see tax  reform?  It's so important for the economy, moving the needle on growth.   And tit's so important, of course, for the markets as well.  Are you  expecting that we will see some kind of attacks at the border?  I mean,  maybe it's not a border adjustment tax because we know that the President  is not in favor of that.  But maybe it's a reciprocal tax or some kind of   other tracks at the border in terms of trade with our friends across the  world?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, the border-adjustable tax was not proposed particularly as a  U.S. agenda item.  The border-adjustable tax was proposed mainly to help  balance the budget.  As you know, the to get to reconciliation when there  are different bills passed by the House from the one passed by the Senate,  you need to have a certain scoring by the Congressional Budget Office,  namely over a 10-year horizon to break even.  That means that you have to  fill some holes.  And the border-adjustable tax idea was a - idea that  Chairman Brady, I believe, come out with in order to just try to fill that  hole.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you have to fill the whole, though?  I mean that's the  point.  I mean, do you - do you need to see some kind of revenue raised, or  can you do way with this whole idea of deficit neutral?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, the rules for reconciliation are fairly clear, and as I  understand them, you need to be neutral or at the tenured time horizon.   And the recon we need the reconciliation is that it's unlikely that the  House and Senate will pass exactly the same bill.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, if we - if we don't see a border adjustment tax in the tax  portion of this, in terms of trade, you're overseeing, you're expecting any  other kind of tax, like a reciprocal tax, something at the border.</p><p>ROSS:  Well, remember, the U.S. budget until well into the 20th century.   Main component had been tariffs.  So, tariffs are nothing new to the  financing of the U.S. government, but we've long past that with the advent  of personal income tax and corporate tax, so now border adjustable or some  such thing is simply one way to fill up a portion of a hole.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll see - we'll see if it ends up there.  I know  that you'll be taking the lead on renegotiating the North America Free  Trade Agreement, NAFTA, later this year.  And then, of course, today,  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is talking about irritants with his  counterparts from Canada and Mexico, including the dairy trade dispute with  sugar exports.  What are your priorities in terms of setting the stage for  NAFTA talks, Secretary? </p><p>ROSS:  Well, we - Ambassador Lighthizer already has made a preliminary  report to the Congress explaining the big bold letter headlines for NAFTA  renegotiation.  They'll be a much more detailed one filed middle of July  because 30 days before the August 15th date when the 90-day clock finally  ticks, where the administration is required to give Congress more detail on  the objectives for NAFTA.  So, that's when there will be a fairly detail  exposition of the objective.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, the sugar issue is one thing that you've spoken about.   Is there's an overriding issue that's problematic with the current form?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, the sugar deal has been resolved.  We reached the agreement  with the Mexican government and with the U.S. sugar industry.  We filed it  some days ago.  It's not out for public commentary but doesn't require  congressional vote and since the key parties to the original trade case now  are finally all on board with the solution, I don't think they'll be that  much controversy about it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And is there another priority that you want to make sure to  tackle as a result of your be getting this?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, what would be a good thing would be if we could get rid of  some of the other issues with Canada, for example, the softwood lumber and  potentially the dairy management issue that Secretary Perdue was talking  about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  In terms of -- Secretary, the new trade deals actually  moving the needle on growth, what are your expectations?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, the growth plans of the administration have several components  to them.  Trade is certainly one but tax reform, regulatory reform,  unleashing the energy that we have in the ground and infrastructure are all  also essential ingredients to getting the Trump program for three percent  growth.  So, we need all of those pieces to get to the objective.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We are watching that in terms of these pieces  coming together.  Secretary Ross, do you think that when we see all of  these issues whether it be your renegotiating of NAFTA, you know, the tax  reform, the health care bill, do you think these things will get done this  year, or are you expecting - are you looking over the next three years?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, the NAFTA has a fairly natural time horizon in that - think  about next year, the trade promotion authority which is an essential  ingredient to our being able to negotiate trade treaties, that expires July  of 2018.  There's also the Mexican Presidential election in July 2018 and  then in the fall of '18, you have the mid-term congressional elections  here.  So as you move well into next year, the political calendar will  become very complicated in terms of any big transaction like a NAFTA  renegotiation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Sure.  Wilbur Ross, good to see you.  Thank you so  much.</p><p>ROSS:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary Wilbur Ross joining us.  We will be right back</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are looking higher today.  Take a look,  Futures indicating a gain of about 12 points on the Dow Industrials at the  open this morning, 12 on the NASDAQ as well, after the S&amp;P and the - and  the Dow Industrials, rather, both hit record highs yesterday.  A couple of  names on the move this morning, more job cuts coming to general motors.   The automaker is set to layoff nearly 1,000 workers to its sedan plant in  Kansas City, Kansas.  GM notified the workers of plans to eliminate a third  shift at the plant late last week.</p><p>We're watching shares of Apple this morning.  The company is shaking up  subscription options for its Apple music streaming service, TechCrunch is  reporting users now have the option to pay $99 for 12-month subscription,  works out so just over $8 a month.  Monthly individual plans currently cost  $9.99.  </p><p>Authorities have identified and arrested the man suspected of mowing down a  crowd at a London mosque earlier Monday.  Cheryl Casone with the details.   Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, that's right, Maria.   So, the victims were leaving Ramadan prayers at the time of the attack.   The suspect identified as 47-year-old, Darren Osborne of Cardiff Wales.   Osborne was arrested on suspicion of terror offenses.  At least 1 person  was killed, 10 others injured in that assault which authorities are  treating as a terrorist attack.  And investigators in France say that the  man suspected of trying to attack security forces on the Champs-Elysees in  Paris, Monday afternoon has been flagged by investigators earlier for  extremism.  The man ran this car into a police van and afterward,  authorities found a rifle and explosives in that vehicle.  That suspect  died.</p><p>Well, another headlines this morning.  JaguarLand Rover is hiring and  they're making the application process pretty interesting.  They (AUDIO  GAP) 5,000 software engineers, electronic experts and others, but instead  of using job fairs and ads to attract the applicants, potential employees  are asked to assemble a Jaguar sports car then tackle a series of code- breaking puzzles.  They teamed up with the app, Gorillaz.  We should say in  2011, Marriott asked applicants to manage a virtual hotel so it's not  really a new idea but interesting.  </p><p>And get ready to pay more for shipping this Christmas.  UPS says it's going  to add a holiday surcharge per package as much as 97 cents per package.   UPS wants to recoup some money for increased staffing, extra planes and  vehicles added during the holiday season but this could be tough for  retailers, Maria.  Remember, they're promising free ground shipping, a lot  of them.  So here's the question, do you charge your customers more or do  you eat the surcharge? We'll see what they decide.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But first of all, I'm a little uncomfortable talking about  Christmas right now.  We're having - </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- summertime, but OK.  I will take your bait, Cheryl.  In  terms of this higher cost around holidays, guys, big deal?</p><p>LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Look, I think I  would -- if I were the folks selling the stuff, I would go eat the cost.  I  think it --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Eat it?</p><p>SHAFFER:  Yes.  I mean, Amazon is doing, I think, pretty well with its  Prime, and I look at it, and I don't know how they can afford to send me  stuff in two days sometimes.  I know they have preset stuff, but it's, you  know, I don't know.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND THE WALL STREET JOURNAL  ASSISTANT  EDITOR:  Surge pricing.  You know, people whine about it with Uber, but I  guess it's catching on on other places.  It seems like you have a lot of  highly-motivated buyers at that time of year so I would think they'd  probably be willing to eat the cost if being guaranteed December 24th  delivery.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it also depends on what we're going to hear in the tax  package, right?  If they're going to be paying a border adjustment tax -</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is really going to hurt the retailers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They may not want to eat anything.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Remember, though, your corporate rate comes down.  It's covering  all goods.  It's just a shifting, right?  I mean, I understand they've  going to do some work on selling the border adjustment tax but you're  talking about a much lower rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll talk about this.</p><p>Coming up, will the NFL head to China.  New England Patriots quarterback  says his dream is to play a game in the East Asian nation, back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, the NBA Finals just ended a week ago but several  teams are already looking to next season.  Jared Max with the story, now.   Jared, good morning.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SPORTSCASTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  The  NBA's next crop of talent will be picked Thursday.  NBA Draft at Barkley  Center in Brooklyn, New York, for the second year in a row, the first pick  belongs to the Philadelphia 76ers, who yesterday, finalized to trade with  the Boston Celtics to acquire the first selection and the right to pick 19- year-old point guard Markelle Fultz out of the University of Washington.   Fultz worked out for the 6ers yesterday hours before the team completed its  trade with Boston to get the number one overall pick a second straight  season.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRYAN COLANGELO, PHILADELPHIA 76ERS PRESIDENT:  There's a history of draft  picks that you can't study with a deep dive and no one understand that the  odds are in your favor at number one more so than in any other position in  the draft that player may - the player chosen may end up being a franchise- level player.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  To land the number one overall selection, 6ers G.M. and President of  basketball operations, Bryan Colangelo also parted ways with a second first  round pick to Boston that allowed to be next year or 2019.  So, the draft  order, it's Philadelphia first followed by the L.A. Lakers, then the Boston  Celtics, the Phoenix Suns, fourth, as Sacramento Kings get the fifth  selection, Thursday.  In the 12 1/2 years that Dan Gilbert has owned the  Cleveland Cavaliers, no general manager has received a contract extension,  not one.  David Griffin, no different.  Unable to reach agreement on a new  deal, Griffin mutually agreed to part ways with the Cavaliers.  Yesterday,  after three seasons on the job, three trips to the NBA Finals, one  championship.  Griffin said it's not the right fit for him anymore and  Cleveland.  </p><p>LeBron James tweeted support.  He says, \"If no one appreciated you, Griff,  I did.  And hopefully, all the people of Cleveland!  Thanks for what you  did for the team for three years!  We got us one.</p><p>As we told yesterday, the Cavs are set to be pursuing a trade that could  land them point guard Paul George from the Indiana Pacers.  And the Cavs  are also reportedly working on a possible multi-team trade to get Jimmy  Butler from the Chicago Bulls.  But such a trade would likely mean parting  ways with a star like Kevin Love.  </p><p>What a superstar quarterback Tom Brady doing these days?  Oh, just hanging  out in the Great Wall of China.  The Patriot Super Bowl-winning quarterback  spent Father's Day throwing a football to his son at the Great Wall.  The  Brady bunch in China is part of a promotional tour for his Under Armour  TB12 Recovery Sleepwear.  Brady said that it is his dream to play an NFL  game in China.  Victory for the Washington Red Skins and freedom of speech.   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled yesterday that a 71-year-old trademark law  that bars offensive language is an infringement of rights to free speech.   This came from a case involving an Asian-American rock band that fought the  trademark.  Its name, The Slants.  Now, yesterday's case figures to serve  as legal precedent for the Red Skins to be able to keep their name.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I was surprised at that and happy to see that.  Jared,  great stuff.  Thank you so much, Jared Max.  Still to come, a new twist for  check fillet.  The company unveiling its gluten-free bun next hour on  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  What does tell us?

This is  fractional, of course, and anything can change in the next two hours.</p><p>In Europe the major averages are mostly higher this morning.  The indices  look good although well off of highs of the morning.  In fact, the CAC 40  is now up about a quarter of a percent.  They have given up gains.</p><p>And I believe that stocks are giving up some gains this morning because oil  prices are worsening.  Oil prices are down about 2 percent.  Take a look at  oil sliding and as oil has worsened this morning that has certainly taken a  bite out of some of the gains in equities.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it financial analyst Heather Zumarraga is here, \"Wall Street Journal\"  assistant editorial page editor James Freeman is here, and the London  Center for Policy Research vice president, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer  is here as well.  Good morning.</p><p>LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good morning.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lots to talk about today.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.  We'll see if the markets continue making all-time highs  this week.  Health care is in focus.  Paul Ryan is set to speak at noon  today to see if we can get that passed as well as tax reform and that's big  for the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And people will want to hear what he has to say about tax  reform.  But his plan, James Freeman, is different than what the President  has been talking about.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  The President is just talking about that low  corporate rate.  Paul Ryan has the border adjustment plan and they need a  new name for that.  But basically what he's talking about, the economics  are good which is you want to tax consumption instead of working  investment.  That's what Ryan is trying to do.  But he's got a sales job  and if he can't persuade other members of congress this is the way to go he  should just -- </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Republicans in the Senate just don't want to hear it.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  He hasn't found a lot of takers.  So maybe he just needs to  focus on cutting rates.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, I think the bottom line is anything they do right now has  been in my judgment not positive to the President's overall message.  It  seems to me that they always find some other way to go anytime they  actually try to do something.  And this is where it's frustrating to me as  someone who just observes.  They don't seem to be actually sitting down and  talking about how to meet on achieving something, or even talking pass this  thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The leadership does say that they are having meetings very  often, weekly about tax reform and that they are moving forward on this  despite what you're seeing in the press.  But we will see about that.   We're going to talk about that coming up.</p><p>Joining the conversation coming up now is Fox News military analyst General  Jack Keane is with us.  Harvard Law professor emeritus, defense attorney  and author of \"Electile Dysfunction: A Guide for Unaroused Voters\" Alan  Dershowitz is here -- good name for his book.  Former Reagan campaign  adviser Ed Rollins is here as well.  We've got a big program ahead so don't  miss a moment of it.  </p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with our top story.  The  administration pushing the President's agenda with only weeks left on the  legislative calendar for the fiscal year.  Counsel to the President,  Kellyanne Conway told me yesterday reform is on the way.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT:  The President is forging  ahead.  He's in close contact with Leader McConnell on the health care  reform.  You know, Obamacare has been a log (inaudible) for seven years.   These sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the  House.  Now the Senate will do its work.  Leader McConnell told you that he  would like it to be by July 4th -- that's around the corner.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CONWAY:  Tax reform later this year.  They are moving towards  infrastructure, towards border security, more of that.  The military has  gotten new funding.  So things are happening.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, calls for lawmakers to work through their month-long  August recess to get both health care and tax reform done are increasing.</p><p>Joining me right now is Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn.  Congresswoman --  good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Good to see you.  Sure.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about the agenda?  How confident are you that  you and your colleagues can get tax reform and the health care over the  finish line this year?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  I agree that you're going to see the Senate take a vote before  July 4th.  And the people are thrilled with that.  They want to be free and  independent of the Affordable Care Act.  So I think it's very timely.</p><p>I think a final bill, a final version will be on the President's desk  before August 1st.  And that's the goal.  We should be hitting that goal  and then it is getting the push together to get tax reform over the finish  line.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a report yesterday that lawmakers said that they are  considering not going on the August recess in order to get the work done if  in fact it doesn't get done by then.  Are you for that?  Was that an actual  conversation piece in Congress?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.  Maria -- there are plenty of conversations about do we  stay in during August.  Many individuals want to get out there.  I agree.   Get out there, do our meetings and rotary clubs and civic clubs and chamber  coffees, visit with our constituents.  And we appreciate having that time.</p><p>But there is also the argument to be made that we have a heavy lift.  We  have a once in a lifetime opportunity to actually take care of  deregulating, lowering taxes, getting some this environment for jobs growth  to take place in place.</p><p>Your interview with Secretary Ross spoke specifically to that.  How do we  utilize new technologies?  How do we make the environment right for private  sector jobs growth to take place?  And that is less litigation, less  taxation to get that job creation.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Congresswoman -- James Freeman of the \"Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes -- James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The one -- I have a tax question for you but real quick.  I  noticed the White House announcing last night that Michael (inaudible) is  headed to the Commerce Department.  You seem to be losing one of the big  chip staffers on Capitol Hill.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  And we are pleased with it for him.  And look forward to all  good things -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok. </p><p>BLACKBURN:  -- for him.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Now, as far as the tax cut, tell us about the conversation  around how big this cut can be.  Because there is some sentiment on the  Hill that you have to stick CBO rules, a 10-year budget window, all of that  boring Beltway stuff.  But what it means is it limits how much you can cut  taxes.  Some people are saying let's make it a 30-year window.  It means we  can have a big, big tax cut.  Where do you stand on that?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  I think what you're going to see Chairman Brady do is get as  much as he can.  I like the way this administration works things out and  says let's do more with less.  So if you put that into how you work tax  reductions into a reconciliation bill, what you're going to see the Speaker  and the Chairman do is to move forward with how much they can lower those  marginal rates.</p><p>They're looking right now at 35 percent, 25 percent and 10 percent.  Those  are worthy goals.  Then going to the business side, how low can you get  that corporate rate?  Can you deal with repatriation on that?</p><p>I think that the BAT tax is going to be very, very difficult in my district  with the auto manufacturing, with large retailers like Dollar General and  Tractor supply.  Kirkland's headquartered here.  That is not a popular tax.  </p><p>And I don't see -- I know the Speaker's for it -- but I don't see the  support from my constituents or from my colleagues for that tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So maybe just cut the rate down to 15 percent as the President  has suggested.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  I think that that is something that is workable.  And James --  you know, if we do that, we're still going to be the biggest cut tax since  the Reagan '86 tax cut.  And let's take as much as we can get this year and  then let's come back next year and take some more. </p><p>Taxes are too high.  Regulation is too high.  Litigation is too prolific.   So let's get those under control so that jobs growth could take place.  I  talk to small business manufacturers that work in the Just in Time supply  chain for the auto industry every single week and they will tell you, they  will point to you specifically how that BAT tax would adversely impact them  and thereby the price of an auto.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And the price of an auto I heard would go up $2,000 --  $3,000 even if you have that border adjustment tax, the BAT as you refer to  it.</p><p>So what I hear you saying, Congresswoman -- and I want to move to the  Georgia election in a second -- but you would be willing then to vote on no  new revenue then.  You just cut taxes and then deal, if you need to raise  revenue next year or the next year, you would be willing to vote with just  lowering the corporate rate as low as you can get it without raising  revenue from something at the border -- a tax at the border?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.  I think if you lower those rates and see where that gets  you, you don't have to do everything with one stroke of the pen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President is tweeting this morning on Georgia's special  election as voters head to the polls.  Here is what he said, Congresswoman,  \"Karen Handel for Congress.  She will fight for lower taxes, great  healthcare, strong security and a hard worker who will never give up.  Vote  today.\"  This as a new political ad is stirring up controversy.  Watch  this.  I want to get your reaction -- Congresswoman.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Sure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Now the unhinged left is endorsing and applauding  shooting Republicans.  When will it stop?  It won't if Jon Ossoff wins on  Tuesday because the same unhinged leftist cheering last week's shooting are  all backing Jon Ossoff.  And if he wins they win.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That ad was paid for by a PAC supporting Republican  candidate Karen Handel.  It's now receiving backlash for showing images of  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise after he was shot last week.</p><p>A spokesperson for Handel condemned the ad saying, \"For any group to use  the shootings this week for political or personal benefit is shameful.   This group should be ashamed.\"</p><p>What's your take?  Nearly $50 million have been raised in this election --  the most expensive House race in U.S. history -- Congresswoman.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  I think the group that put the ad up should be ashamed.  I  think anyone who is inciting violence or encouraging violence or  encouraging hateful rhetoric should stop it.</p><p>People want to see us work together, whether they're a Democrat, a  Republican an Independent.  I have individuals in my office as I did  yesterday who said we just want to see you get some things done. </p><p>Let's get the Affordable Care Act off the books.  Let's get tax reform  done.  Let's secure the border.  Let's get this infrastructure bill going.   That is what they are wanting to see, and ads like that are not helpful to  the process.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we agree.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Hateful rhetoric isn't helpful to the process.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Congresswoman -- this is Tony Shaffer with the London Center for  Policy Research.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes, Tony.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Good morning, ma'am.</p><p>With all due respect, I know what you're saying about cooperating but it  doesn't seem that Nancy Pelosi and colleagues on the left are actually  trying to ratchet this down.  And it's not all of them.  I mean I talked to  Tulsi Gabbard and Tulsi I think recognizes what's going on but how do you  deal with folks who just don't want to engage in that dialogue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean look what Chuck Schumer just said that you're doing the  health care deal in the dark of night, excuse me, but wasn't that the way  they did Obamacare?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  You know, what happened with Obamacare was a bill that was  written in the House -- in the White House and then brought over.  Nobody  knew what was in it and Miss Pelosi said so.  What you see now is a team  working together off the House bill which is a public document.</p><p>But Tony, back to your question on this, I think what we have to do is just  continue to push against this and encourage our colleagues to keep the  conversation on the policies and to move away from this politics of  personal attack and destruction.  The fact that you have so many members of  congress who are receiving death threats, personal harm threats coming into  their steps, to their families, this is completely unacceptable.</p><p>And they need to join together in saying we are not going to tolerate this  type of rhetoric.  We are well served by robust political debate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you make all great points Congresswoman.  It's great to  see you.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All our love to Steve Scalise. </p><p>We will be right back.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Excessive heat warnings in effect across the southwest today while  thunderstorm watches are in effect for 11 states on the East Coast.</p><p>Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean breaks it all down for us.   What's the latest we can expect across the country today?  Janice -- good  morning.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  A lot of stories -- Maria, we are working  on.</p><p>Let's take a look at it across the northeast.  Hundreds of reports of  severe weather including a tornado report just outside the D.C. area.  No  reports of any injuries but we've got a lot of reports of destruction.</p><p>And we have a tropical cyclone potential in the next 12 to 24 hours  expecting it to get a name and make landfall possibly Thursday, Friday  along the Gulf Coast.  We have tropical storm watches and warnings in  place.  </p><p>This is going to be a rainmaker along the Gulf Coast; six to eight even 12  inches of rainfall, so watching this.  The tropics already heating up.</p><p>And then speaking of heat, across the southwest, heat advisories are posted  where we have dangerous conditions.  Temperatures well over 100 degrees and  we are going to be seeing temperatures close to 120 in Phoenix, Arizona.   Look at the temperatures here over the next several days.</p><p>Looking at Phoenix, they've actually canceled flights.  The smaller  aircraft have a hard time taking off in heat and when we look at the all- time hottest, we go back to 1990, 122 degrees; 1990 here as well, 120;  we're going to be flirting with 119, 120 degrees across Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p>So those big stories we are following today in the Fox News Extreme Weather  Center.  Maria -- back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Yes, that is something.  Ok.  Janice -- thank you.

That's according to a notice obtained by Politico.</p><p>So Scalise, he was shot during a congressional baseball practice last  Wednesday has been upgraded, we should say, to serious condition from  critical.  The Louisiana congressman has had several surgeries at MedStar  Washington Hospital.  That blood drive which will be held again on Thursday  is also for U.S. Capitol police special agent Crystal Griner and lobbyist  Matt Mika.</p><p>Well, multiple sources report that several major mobile service providers  are experiencing cellphone service outages this morning.  Companies  (inaudible) reportedly include AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon.  So far  we don't have a reason for these outages but according to the site Down  Detector, Sprint and Verizon had the largest outage areas on the East Coast  and in the state of California.</p><p>And then Chick-Fil-A is the latest fast food chain to offer gluten-free  food.

How a contractor accidentally reveals the names,  birthdays, phone numbers online.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just wanted to pass on  word that Otto Warmbier has just passed away.  He spent a year and a half  in North Korea.  A lot of bad things happened.  That's a brutal regime.   And we will be able to handle it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was President Trump speaking at the White House yesterday  following the death of Otto Warmbier.  The American student died just days  after returning home following 17 months of imprisonment in North Korea.</p><p>Joining me right now is Fox News military analyst, General Jack Keane.   General -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's such a horrible and just a terrible story.  The U.S. is  demanding the release now of three other Americans currently being held in  North Korea.</p><p>Your reaction to Otto Warmbier passing away now after being tortured  obviously, coming home in a vegetative state.  </p><p>KEANE:  Well, there's no doubt that the North Koreans are responsible for  murdering Otto, that's for sure and that heartfelt message that (inaudible)  provided yesterday was rally quite extraordinary and revealing in a sense  they talked about him being tortured.  Their doctors obviously have some  sense of what's happening and autopsy will confirm what actually happened.</p><p>But something went wrong here for the North Koreans because, you know,  Maria -- they imprison, torture, kill and starve their own people.  What  they do with Americans is they take them hostage and they use them as  bargaining chips until some prominent American comes forward and is willing  to negotiate with them like a Bill Clinton or a Bill Richardson.  </p><p>So what happened here?  How did this take place?  They lost a leverage that  they use hostages for to establish some legitimacy for the regime.  And I  think the other three certainly, the President's doing the right thing in  demanding their release.</p><p>I think what this will do for us here is strengthen our resolve, our  determination our commitment to deal with this North Korean problem once  and for all.</p><p>I believe the President is already there but I think will just add to his  determination to deal with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should the U.S. be responding to this?  What should the U.S. do  at this point?  And basically just to be clear.  What you're saying is they  had him imprisoned, they were obviously drugging him when they realized  that he was in a vegetative state, they said ok, we're losing our leverage  we can send him home?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  They didn't want him to die there.  That's for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  And it's just -- it's out of the pattern of what they normally do.   We don't know the facts yet -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should the U.S. do anything about this -- General?</p><p>KEANE:  We're not going to -- we're not going to take any immediate action  with North Korea.  What we have done is we have -- we have ladled the  football to China to see if they can use economic pressure on North Korea  to denuclearize.  That will take some time.  </p><p>Most of us looking at that and I'm sure the administration also has a  healthy dose of skepticism about whether China is genuinely sincere about  doing this.  We'll have to see and we'll have to wait to see that happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  I think at some point, here's where I think we're going to wind up.   China is not going to do it.  We're going to have to really get tough with  North Korea on sanctions.</p><p>I think we'll probably have to provide some sanctions against China for the  first time.  I think we have to have a get tough policy with China.  And  when it comes to the Asia Pacific and what they're doing in terms of  trampling our interests and also our allies' interests.</p><p>I think we're kind of on a collision course with North Korea and also with  China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's important.  That's going to be an important day  when in fact the U.S. makes a decision to put sanctions against China as  well.</p><p>Let me switch gears and get your take on this latest surrounding the USS  Fitzgerald's collision with a container ship.  That happened this weekend  off the coast of Japan.  And investigators are looking into several aspects  of this crash including why it took the crew of the civilian vessel almost  an hour to report the incident.  How does this happen -- General?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I don't know what they were doing on board, what kind of  emergency situation they may have had.  They have very small crews on that  ship but you know, making a radio call isn't a big deal.  And certainly our  war ship had their hands full -- the things that were knocked out were the  berthing areas for the crew.  The radio communication was knocked out and  also interesting, the captain's quarters was sitting on top of all of that.</p><p>So it is understandable our crew was fighting for their lives and trying to  make sure -- you have a warship and it demonstrates, you know, the  instruments of war like a warship is dangerous in peace time as it is in  war.</p><p>Sitting on that ship as we know, not on that commercial ship, sitting on  that warship is incredible amount of missiles and explosive munitions.  And  if a fire broke out on that ship that thing could really have turned into  an incredible tragedy.  So fortunate that that crew was as brave as they  are, battled that situation and took control of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, any other issues that will come as a result of this?   Because people are scratching their heads saying how does this happen?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, the Navy -- the Navy is not saying it publicly but the Navy  is not going to stand for our ship at sea not being able to evade an  oncoming ship if the oncoming ship made an unexpected U-turn like it did.   The Navy has navigational devices.  It has human beings that are alert and  paying attention.  And something's failed on that ship that we did not take  evasive action.</p><p>The Navy will never excuse any of its vessels being hit by another vessel  regardless of who was at fault.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KEANE:  The Navy will hold that crew accountable for being able to evade  that ship.  That's the fact of it.  They'll get to what caused it all but  at the end of the day they're going to hold them accountable for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. We'll be watching that.  General -- always a  pleasure.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KEANE:  Good talking to you -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to you -- General Jack Keane joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, a new weapon in the Russian election meddling probe.

The  Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are coming off of a record close yesterday.  But oil  prices have been selling off and that has cut into some of the gains this  morning.  Now we expect a mixed opening for broader averages.  The Dow  industrials are down one.  The NASDAQ are up 12 points.</p><p>In Europe, the major indices have also lost some momentum this morning.   The FT 100 is now in negative territory down five points.  The CAC quarante  is well off of the highs.  It's up a quarter of a percent and the DAX index  is also higher although well off a big ties as well.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly lower meanwhile with the exception  of Japan.  The Nikkei average finished up almost one percent.</p><p>And take a look at oil prices.  One of the certainly market stories down  two percent right now, on oil, and as oil prices have slide, stocks have  also given up some gains.</p><p>Well, Special Counsel Robert Mueller adding a new weapon to his Russia  probe.  Veteran federal prosecutor and former Department of Justice fraud  division chief Andrew Weissmann has joined the team.  Weissmann is the man  who has been known for his ability to flip witnesses in his work on  organized crime, and in cases like Enron</p><p>Joining us right now defense attorney author and Harvard law professor  Emeritus, Alan Dershowitz.  Alan, good to see you.</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS:  Nice to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this a move that should concern the president bringing  Weissmann on?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Sure.  We're seeing a game of three dimensional chess.   Mueller is sending a very powerful message to the White House.  We have a  flipper.  You have some potential flipees out there, especially Flynn.   Flynn's lawyer are now sending a message to the White House as well.  We  may flip.  We're not going to allow our client to go to jail.  You have a  choice.  If you don't wanted to flip, you have the option of pardoning him.   If you pardon him, he doesn't flip.  If you don't pardon him, he flips.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So he's cooperating with the special prosecutor.  Mike Flynn.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, what I think is happening is his lawyer announced  publicly, which is very odd.  We have a story to tell.  Please give us  immunity.  I think it may be bluff.  We're not sure he has great story to  tell but he's certainly, by that public message, trying to get the  attention of the oval office.  Trying to get the president to say, you can  stop all this by pardoning Flynn.  Now pardoning Flynn would be a political  cost.  Very heavy cost for the president.</p><p>So the stakes have gone up all over the place.  This is the way tough  defense attorneys and tough prosecutors go after each other and play the  game.  I have seen this game.  I have participated in it.  And I know how  rough and tumble it can become.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  It sounds, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Professor, I want to you ask you about Andrew Weissmann, Clinton  donor also has been sharply criticized by a newspaper that was owned by  Jared Kushner.  He's now apparently investigating Jared Kushner.</p><p>And this is in terms of political donors, this is a patter so far in the  Mueller team.  He's hiring a number of people who've donated, the  democrats.  Is it -- is it that hard to find good lawyers who are not  political activists?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, lawyers are like everybody else.  I contribute.  I  contributed to Hillary Clinton's campaign.  I would not let it affect my  judgment.  I defended republicans and democrats alike.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you do that though?  You gave money.  I mean, how do you  not make sure that it doesn't affect your judgment?  That's hard.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, look at me now.  I gave money to Clinton and I'm no  making arguments that helped the man I voted against because I believe in  principle.  Now, Weissmann is a very tough prosecutor.  If I were the  president, I'd be more worried about his experience and his record of being  a very tough prosecutor and a few bucks being contributed to the democrats.   Having said that, I think that probably should have look for people who  didn't make political contributions.  Much the way the president  disqualified probably one of the most qualified persons to be the head of  the FBI and that is Senator Lieberman because he had been a politician.   The president wanted to make sure that whoever it was, was outside of  politics.</p><p>So I think the seize is white principle that you're going to engage in a  political prosecution and this is a political prosecution, you better not  give the other side the opportunity to make arguments that it's been  politicized.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about all of this focused on this Russian  meddling probe?  I understand the Russian meddling probe, but to attach  Trump to it, when we know that there's absolutely no evidence, whatsoever  of collusion and still going on about this, I mean, how much does this cost  taxpayers?  Hundred million or more than that?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  And there's nothing -- I don't know.  But there's nothing  criminal about it.  This ought to be investigated by an independent  commission looking into the relationship between Russia and political  elections on both sides moving forward.  Then there ought to be a  congressional investigation to see maybe we need to change the law to  prevent the president from firing the director of the FBI.</p><p>The one place they should not be is in front of a grand jury.  There is  nothing criminal here.  And the grand jury is secret behind closed doors.   It's causing us a fortune.  We're learning nothing.  Nothing will come of  it.  This idea that you can turn a constitutionally protected act, the  firing the director into a crime because it had a corrupt motive.</p><p>You should read my emails.  I'm accused every day of having a corrupt  motive.  Why am I on Fox talking about Donald Trump?  Is he paying me?  Am  I auditioning to become his lawyer?  Do I want to be a judge?  Am I  expecting a favor?  My motives are being questioned all over the place.   Politicians questioned each other's motives.  The idea of corrupt motive  being the criteria distinguishing a constitutionally protected act from a  felony is so dangerous to civil liberties that every -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, is there going to be any -- is there going to be any  accountability for the dems obstructing the agenda that America voted for  last year?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, the republicans did the very same thing to Bill Clinton.   When they impeached him and what they tried to do to Barack Obama.  Look,  packs on both their -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the accountability happened because they got voted  out of office, right?  So will the dems lose seats as a result of this in  '18?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  We'll see today in Georgia.  We'll see in other places.  We  don't know.  This is a referendum, perhaps.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, back onto my pointing for a second.  Because that's the  most real element I've seen so far in any legal jeopardy.  Simply because  Mike is going to talk doesn't mean he's flipping.  This is one of those  things where I think people are reading far too much in a way sinister  motive here.  You and I both know, Alan, that you go in front of congress,  you go in front of these groups, anything you say can eventually be turned  against you in some form.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  He's looking for immunity.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Because you don't want to be say anything.  It gives you later.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  But I would never ever ask for immunity publicly.  I would go  quietly to the prosecutor and say, here's my story.  But his lawyers are  very smart.  Why is he asking for immunity publicly?  Because he's sending  a message to the president of the United States.  You want me not to get  immunity?  Pardon me.  Pardon me.  Pardon my client.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Last thing.  We talked about how there's no evidence yet of  collusion.  It seems interesting as you watch Mueller build his team and  assign people the different tasks.  He seems to be assigning them largely  to things other than looking for evidence of collusion.  Does that mean  he's already decided there's nothing there?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  I don't think there's anything that criminally on collusion.   What he's looking for is to make a case against Flynn, for example, failure  to list some of these things then go to Flynn and say, you want to go to  jail?  You have a family.  There's a way out of this.  Weissmann is an  expert of that.  He has flipped better witnesses and stronger witnesses  then Flynn that's the goal prosecutor's.</p><p>I once debated Rudy Giuliani in my class and he put a bunch of dominos up  on the blackboard and he said, if I ever have to bring somebody to trial, I  have failed.  My goal is to flip the first guy on the guy, on the third  guy, ultimately get them all flipped and finally go after the big guy on  the top and the evidence is so overwhelming he'll plead guilty.  That's the  way prosecutors operate.  And defense attorneys operate by using that to  their advantage and trying to make sure their client is the one who's  giving to get out of jail free ticket and they can turn -- the first rule  in America is that you're going to commit a crime always committed with  somebody more important than you are.  So you can flip on them and make it  flip on you.  That's my advice to all persons of criminals out there.   Don't commit crimes.  But if you're going to do it, do it with someone more  important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Alan, great insights as always from you.  Thanks so much.

A surprising new  study reveals what specific paint color can help boost a home selling  price.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Republican Party data of nearly 200 million  voters has been exposed online.  Cheryl Casone with all the details now.   Cheryl, over to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  A cyber security analyst  working for the RNC discovered that the information was left unsecured on  an online database for 12 days before it was taken down.  The data was  stolen in an Amazon cloud account used by a contractor that work for the  RNC.  The information was nearly on every U.S. voter.  It include names,  date of birth, home addresses.  The RNC says it's working with that  contractor padding that conclusion of an investigation in the security.</p><p>Well, Google can now help you find a job.  The search engine has launched a  new job search feature on its search result pages.  You can now search for  jobs across all major online job words.  It covers LinkedIn, Monster,  Career Builder, Facebook and a lot more.  Google is also going to include  job listings that finds on a company specific homepage.  Basically, it's  going to be one stop shopping for job seekers of all trades.</p><p>And then finally this.  The color that you paint the inside of your home  could affect its value.  Zillow conducted an analysis and more than 32,000  sold homes -- here's example.  A blue bathroom can increase the home's  price by $5,400.  A blue dining room can fetch an extra 2,000.  But some  color hurt you.  Last year, yellow was a hot color, it increased sales  values.  This year, a yellow kitchen, for example, will hurt you by about  $800.</p><p>And then, Maria, some colors just hurt you every year.  Terracotta, a terra  no-no, do not -- it's like orange brown.  No.  Don't do it.  If you have  terracotta walls, you're going to lose more than $2,000, versus other  homes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's amazing that color does that.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Twitter turns to TV to maintain its Trump bump.  We  will take a look of whether the new ad campaign is enough to more and more  users and how will they monetize it.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Twitter announcing a new ad campaign with Chance  the Rapper, and what he should play at his shows.  Tracee Carrasco with the  details now.  Tracee, good morning.</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Now, this is the  first-ever TV ad for Twitter, as you said Chance the Rapper, now take a  look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARRASCO:  The ad shows Chance asking fans via Twitter for a song request  for his upcoming concert, his tweet sets off a wide range of responses not  all positive, as people tweet back and debate selections.  Music legend  David Crosby even trolls the rapper by tweeting, how about any song with  real instruments?  Now, the new campaign is the next step in Twitter's  ongoing attempt to better explain to consumers what Twitter is and why it's  valuable to spend time on the site.</p><p>The ad push hope to show people how Twitter is unique compared with other  social media sites.  Now Twitter reported its average monthly user rose six  percent in the first quarter to 328 million.  It was the largest quarterly  increase since 2015.  And according to company, it is partly due to \"new  and resurrected users following more news and political accounts in U.S.\"</p><p>Now, although the company didn't specifically mention President Trump, his  frequent tweeting has gotten worldwide attention.  For Twitter, they want  to show they're not just news, they're entertainment, they're sports,  they're everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a good arguments we made that it does trigger conversation  and that you have back-and-forth debate.  I like the fact that Crosby was  in it answering about the instruments.  That's cute.</p><p>CARRASCO:  Yes.  Maybe a collaboration.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  And Chance the Rapper says the gentleman here, it's their  favorite musician.</p><p>SHAFFER:  I was on Yo! MTV Raps left.  One of these few things, I have  friends who literally still can't use Twitter.  They can't figure it out.   And to me, it's kind of like riding a bike.  Once you figure it out, you  figure it out and you can use it.  So, do you think there's a part of it  now people starting to figure out how to use this more?  Because I have  friends saying, I just don't get it.  How do I get my message out?  So, do  you have any sense of where this is going regarding people just probably  getting smart how to use it?</p><p>CARRASCO:  I think so.  I think we're seeing so many -- you know, we can't  go a day without saying President Trump is tweeting this, so and so is  tweeting this, so I think people are now saying well, I want to know what  Twitter is all about.  I'm going to figure out how to use it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the company has to monetize it somehow.</p><p>That's helping them make money.  This ad, what's that going to do for  monetization?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think investors have kind of been wondering before and  especially through this Trump era, why are you not making more money off  this fact that the U.S. president has put you at the center of the  universe, political discussion, debate, really all news, and maybe this is  a way to try and figure it out.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  And this is millennials also.  I think if millennials don't  follow as much D.C. politics as maybe they should than this is another way  to reach out to them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I thought it was really interesting when Jack Dorsey was  asked, the CEO of Twitter.  What do you think about the president tweeting  all the time on your service?  He goes, oh, it's complicated.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Probably don't want to monetize it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  This is obviously a huge gift to them.  But being at Silicon  Valley, given the political sensibility there, I think they have to pretend  that this is kind of a mixed story for them.  But, yes.  It's not really -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a huge break for them.</p><p>CARRASCO:  It's been great for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure it has.  Tracee, great.  Thank you so much.  Tracee  Carrasco there.</p><p>Still ahead, UPS giving itself a present this Christmas.  Why the shipping  giant is planning to charge you more for holiday deliveries and they've  decided this now.

Take a look at futures right now  indicating a mixed opening for the broader averages, Dow Industrials  squeaking out a gain of just two points right here.  S&amp;P 500 is unchanged  and the NASDAQ is up 15, all of the above, of off the highs of the morning.   And of course, this is after the Dow and S&amp;P reached record highs yesterday  at the close.</p><p>In Europe, the indices have also given up some of the momentum, the FT 100  is now negative by nine points.  The CAC quarante in Paris is up a quarter  of a percent off of the highs as is the DAX Index right now as well of 25  points there.  In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly lower with the  exception of Japan, Nikkei Average was up almost one percent.  But take a  look at oil prices driving better than two percent right now, 2 2/3  percent, that is really behind what's going on for stock prices this  morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it, financial analyst Heather Zumarraga is here, Wall Street Journal  Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman is here, and the London  Center for Policy Research Vice President Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaeffer  is here.  Great to see you.</p><p>TONY SCHAEFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH VICE PRESIDENT: Thanks,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Allan Dersowitch said some interesting things to say I thought.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Yes.   And we're still waiting for that collusion evidence.  He's talking about  the potential that maybe Michael Flynn will be forced to flip but what does  -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- stories that Michael Flynn has about the president.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, yes.  I think - this is one of the things too.  Because he  had a story doesn't mean it's a bad story.  I mean, everybody kind of  infers he's going to flip on the president.  Look, I think Mike Flynn  probably made some mistakes, we've talked about the Russian issue regarding  his conversations with the Russians, he had a deal with Turkey which has  been questioned and some issues with that, the whole issue of what he got  paid going to Moscow to meet with Putin via RT.</p><p>These are all things which I think are relevant in a way by the fact that  maybe he even didn't follow the rules but they don't add anything to the  larger narrative or issue regarding what exactly are we looking for  regarding this \"collusion.\" </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  Absolutely right.  We want to kick this out off of  this.  The Trump administration is pushing forward on the president's  agenda as the Senate GOP is planning on a health care vote next week.  Adam  Shapiro is at the White House right now with the very latest.  Adam, that  certainly keeps them on the timeline for '17.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Right.  It  would keep on the timeline, they have to do the health care stuff first  because of the rules of reconciliation in the 2017 budget resolution but  Mitch McConnell, the leader in the senate's office has said, pay attention  to what the leader had - to what the leader has said in regards to getting  this vote before the July 4th recess.  So the bill is being crafted and the  vote is expected next week but the Democrats are trying to slow down the  process in the Senate and then last night, Chuck Schumer went after Mitch  McConnell in an exchange about why are you doing this behind closed doors,  let's see what you're working on.  Here's what they talked about. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATOR:  Will it be available to us and the public  more than 10 hours before we have to vote for it? </p><p>MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATOR:  I think we'll ample opportunity to read  and amend the bill. </p><p>SCHUMER:  Will it be more than 10 hours -- </p><p>MCCONNELL:  I think we'll have ample opportunity to read and amend the  bill. </p><p>SCHUMER:  I rest my case. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  So the goal again for Republicans is to have this bill next week  debated no more than 20 hours in the Senate and then a vote before the  senators and all of Congress actually leave for the July 4th recess.  The  other issue, of course, is tax reform.  Once they have accomplished or  defeated the health care repeal and replace, they can then move on to a  budget resolution and then tax reform.  And today we're going to get a  major speech from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan on what he thinks is  important, not only in tax reform but why this moment when Republicans  control the White House and the House of Representatives and the Senate is  in the opportunity they can't afford to miss.  So that speech at 12:45 at  the National Association Of Manufacturers, will outline Speaker Ryan's  thoughts on tax reform.</p><p>We're not looking for too much debate on that, for instance, the border  adjustment tax, he hasn't officially said he is against it, there is no one  in the Senate who is for it but in the house, Republicans are still  supporting it and Paul Ryan was a big supporter of it originally.  We're  looking for guidance during this speech today on that. Maria? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Adam Shapiro, thank you very much.  Adam is at the White  House.  And I don't think he's letting it go, James Freeman.  I think Paul  Ryan still wants this border adjustment tax in there even though it gets  massive pushback from his colleagues. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And the economics makes sense, we are talking about how  most economists will tell you want a tax consumption instead of working  investment but he's got a lot of work to do on the sales end.  If he can't  persuade his colleagues, he's got to just focus on tax cuts.  You know,  we've in White House for five months, a person who is ready to sign a tax  cut, ready to sign health care reform, investors, voters had been saying,  to the legislature when are you going to do this stuff on his desk? </p><p>I think, you know, maybe there is more optimism now that they get that  urgency on hill, we see the health care moving forward and I think whatever  deal he's able to work out in terms of Paul Ryan in the House, he's got to  do it too. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think that the markets would react well even if it's not  a broad tax reform plan and it's just tax cuts?</p><p>FREEMAN:  As long as it's - I think the biggest game changer is either -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Corporate tax.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- is really big cut in that corporate rate.  So, I think if you  tell markets and you make it clear that we're going to have a long-term  reform to grow the economy faster, I think people understand that it allows  to generate the growth that can pay more bills for the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  If you want to make it riveting and neutral but why are talking  about cutting spending, rolling spending back instead of the border  adjustment tax, the Senate Republicans are just not going to go for that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are you going to get - where are you going to cut the  spending though, that's the issue.  I mean, most of the money is in the  entitlements.  They don't want to talk about cutting Social Security.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.  They're not going go after the -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this president is all about helping and boosting the  military.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  So, yes, they have to go -</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SHAFFER:  I mean, look, I just (INAUDIBLE) on a letter recently saying, we  need to look at a black.  The DOD spends a lot of money for global  infrastructure that we don't - we don't use.  So, there's a huge area we  could pick and look at.  Of course, the politics of that is certain people  don't want things cut in their district but that's always an issue.   Secondly, I think we've look at -- big ticket items need to be looked at  that he tweeted on the F-35, for goodness sake, the F-35 has been an issue  for a long time.  Much of the defense budget is tied up on that.  So, I  think you can look at offsets right now that would help reduce some of this  so you don't have to worry about tax increases but nobody seems to be want  to do this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is all the making of the sausage that they are supposedly  having these meetings about behind closed doors right now.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, yes.  The reason - the reason there - it's 52 Republicans  negotiating this is because all the Democrats said, we're not interested in  amending Obamacare.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  They don't want to participate.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's why they're not part of the negotiation, they've said  they're not going to vote for it.  So, when they come out with that plan,  there will be some entitlement reform because you're basically talking  about fixing Medicaid which expanded under Obamacare.  This is an amazing  program.  As bad as it is for taxpayers, patients are generally better off  with no insurance or they're nowhere soft than with Medicaid.  So, it  doesn't work for anybody and reforming that, I think it's going to be part  of this package.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're also talking about reforming technology of government,  obviously tech titans went to Washington yesterday.  Top industry leaders  met with the president and other administration officials to talk about how  government technology can become more efficient.  Here's what commerce  secretary Wilbur Ross told me about the meeting earlier in the program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  The government not just  the federal but also state and local government generally has not spent  very much on upgrading their technology.  Might have archaic equipment is  being used, a lot of equipment where you can barely get proper support  anymore.  And there are various estimates the government may be spending  something like $90 billion a year on maintaining systems that fundamentally  are obsoleted by modern standards.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That seems like a lot of low hanging fruit to me, you guys,  what do you think?</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, it's easy, I mean, to me, one of the things we (INAUDIBLE)  the G6 of the division, I was the communications guy and they - I'll be  making decision to roll into vista as an operating system even though  everybody else to include commerce and bypass vista.  But because of their  procurement process and the way they program, they've wasted - my estimate  close to $2 million per sector just on this bad decision.  So the part of  the problem is not necessarily technology, it's people not being able to  make decision to acquire and adapt --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Well, this brings about a decision setting down - you hope it's  not just for show in the media.  Hey, we're all getting together.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Right.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  I think President Trump will be the first there a long time to  take action.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  This should be a way to make government cheaper basically  to get rid of people and use technology instead.  If that's not the goal,  if this is just about allowing government to do more of what it does,  that's going to be a big loss.  But if they're focused on using this as a  cost saver, outside of the military where they actually have tanks and guns  and going blow up stuff.  Most of government just moves information around.   They don't actually produce anything.  There should be an industry that  I.T. can make much more efficient in terms of many, many fewer people.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, the B.A. and DOD is a good example where they have nobody  can actually bridge medical information from the private sector to the  government sector to help manage healthcare.  So this is a great microscopy  --</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  You need them to talk to each other -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SHAFFER:  Yes.  And so - well, you're right.  DOD does have some  experience.  They still won't - and I know of best solutions that have been  purchased by the Department of Defense, they won't implement because of  politics.  So, what he says may be true about them trying to talk but the  problem is culture trying to -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  I used to work at the SCC and there was - I don't know if this is  still true but there was a form that mutual funds have to submit in DOS, so  they all have to get DOS.</p><p>SHAFFER:  DOS?</p><p>FREEMAN:  A program -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- used on - I mean, sort of 20 years? </p><p>FREEMAN:  Just put it (INAUDIBLE) for god sake.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  I don't even know what DOS is. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Let me switch gears.  The travel company that  took Otto Warmbier to North Korea says it will no longer escort Americans  to the hermit kingdom.  The 22 -year-old died after returning to the States  with severe brain damage.  President Trump weighed in on the tragic  incident yesterday.  Here's what he said. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He spent a year and a half  in North Korea.  A lot of bad things happened.  But at least we got him  home to be with his parents where they were so happy to see him even though  he was in very tough condition but he just passed away a little while ago.   That's a brutal regime, and we will be able to handle it. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Colonel Shaffer, your thoughts. </p><p>SHAFFER:  Well, look, him saying, we will be able to handle it, the  president saying that I think it means we're going to do something we  should.  As a father of a 23-year-old, I would just be heartbroken.  I  don't know how the parents are enduring this, but clearly - this whole  trend of opening up to North Korea has been a bad policy.  The idea of  regularizing relationships is like regularizing our relationship with a -  with a cobra.  The cobra is always going to do what a cobra does and I  think the idea that we're trying to work with China, work with them, I  mentioned earlier, the case on free trade zone were essentially - the South  Koreans get free trade - free labor from the North Koreans and they pay  North Korean labor to do things.  It might have just goes with the  government.  So, I think there's been a lot of ill thought ideas of how to  outreach and work with the North Koreans which has not benefited the people  of North Korea or us. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of people, you know, say what was he doing there?  Why  was he there?  He was in China and went on a tour with a tour company from  China to North Korea, that's what he was doing there with other students. </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  But the tour company should not be pushing to be in areas like  that that are very dangerous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We will take a break.  Stay with Fox  Business.  House Speaker Paul Ryan is speaking about the GOP tax plan later  today.  We are going to - we are going to take it to you live at 12:45  Eastern.  Stay right here as we take the House speaker's comments in the  first major tax speech this morning at manufacturing summit.</p><p>Coming up, a scorcher in the southwest, a record-breaking heat wave, so  hot, it's forcing airlines to ground flights. How long the triple-digit  temperatures are expected to last?  And then, a stamp that ensure to have  collectors over the moon, check it out.  The postal service releasing a  stamp that puts in eclipse at the tip of your fingertips.  We'll show you  how it works.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Dozens of flights out of Arizona Sky Harbor  International Airport are being canceled this morning because it is simply  too hot to fly.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Good  morning, Maria.  This is Phoenix in particular.  American Airlines saying  the small region of planes have a maximum operating temperature of 118  degrees.  So those planes can't fly if it's 120 degrees which is expected  to hit today.  Temperatures like this have not been seen in Phoenix since  1990 when the city endured a record-breaking 122-degree heat wave causing  grounded flights, airport closures, three people actually died that day.   So, American is giving passengers now the option of a refund or a free  booking on another flight if you want to change your plans.</p><p>Well, British officials are charging Barclays and four former top  executives with fraud over fundraising with Qatari investors.  The criminal  charges sent from Barclays investment during the height of the financial  crisis  It's the first time that top executives of the U.K. bankers going  to face criminal charges for their actions during that sort of time.  We  should say Barclays, the stock under pressure slightly almost down about  one percent.  And here as you can see on your screen.</p><p>Well, we are probably not alone.  NASA has spotted 10 new planets outside  of our solar system.  They are likely the right size and temperature to  potentially support life.  The Opinion Space found data from the couple of  telescope during the first four years of its primary mission.  NASA says it  only looked in a tiny part though of the galaxy.  There could be more out  there.</p><p>And let's stay in space just here for a moment.  The postal service out  with a new stamp today that you can have some with, the special edition of  Forever stamp features a solar eclipse to celebrate the Great American  Eclipse that's going to hit on August 21st.  But here's the fun part.  As  you can see with the heat of your finger, the stamp transforms the sun into  the moon.  The solar eclipse will be visible along the 70-mile wide path  that runs from Oregon down to South Carolina, Maria.  And those are your  headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Fun, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, it looked really cool.  All right.  Thank you,  Cheryl.  Coming up.  The opioid epidemic hits Ohio.  How the state is  working to stem the tide of overdose deaths.  And then the growing  political divide, more Americans believe D.C. has gotten too uncivil since  the election.  We will take a look at what can be done to heal the  division.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  America's opioid crisis is reaching a breaking  point.  Take a look at this.  Authorities in Montgomery County, Ohio say  that they've seen 365 opioid-related deaths this year alone.  The county  tops the nation in overdose deaths and authorities there are calling this a  mass casualty event.  I want to bring in Montgomery County Sheriff Phil  Plummer.  Sheriff, thanks very much for joining us.  And in just five  months the number of opioid-related deaths in your county has already  surpassed the entire last year in terms of numbers.  Why do you think this  is happening? </p><p>PHIL PLUMMER, MONTGOMERY COUNTY SHERIFF:  Good morning, Maria.  Yes.  This  is a tremendous epidemic for us.  We're going to double last year's death  total to set a new record this year.  And it's just happening because  there's a perfect storm of location or economic problems and, you know,  this has been a challenge for all of us.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How are you dealing with this?  Are the authorities fighting  against this opioid epidemic in any specific way?</p><p>PLUMMER:  Yes.  We're very innovative about this, we're working hard, we've  come up some great programs, you know, we're actually - we have Narcan in  cruiser, we're saving lives with Narcan, we're driving addicts to  treatment, we're sending out recovery teams to addict's houses with social  workers, police officers, we're trying to educate the addict's families on  how to get out of this problem.  So, you know, we're working hard on it but  unfortunately, we're not making much progress.  </p><p>SHAFFER:  Hey, Sheriff, this is Tony Shaffer.  I'm an alumni of - alumnus  of the Wright State University right there.  So the poll that where I went  to college is actually at the heart of all this.  Do you believe some of  this is because you all are at the - at the intersection of 75 and 70, the  routes for a lot of stuff moving?  Just so happens you guys happen to be  kind of the drop-off point for a lot of this and is there anything the  federal government can do to help you diminish the supply coming into the  region.  </p><p>PLUMMER:  Your location like I said, that's a perfect storm, 70 and 75,  that's the crossroads of America.  So, you know, Dayton has become a source  city where they bring Heroin and the Fentanyl straight from Mexico to  Dayton, Ohio then they can drop on 70 and they go east and west in New York  and Chicago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's amazing.  So it's just the fact that you're right near  the route of where this -- the drugs are coming in? </p><p>PLUMMER:  Yes, yes.  It's a perfect storm for us saying, you know, they  need more resources from the federal government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the President has taken executive action by forming a  commission to combat drug addiction and this opioid crisis.  You want to  see funding from the government?  What else do you want from the government  in terms of addressing this in Montgomery County?  </p><p>PLUMMER:  We need funding, we need more boots on the ground, you know, we  all been - we've had a bad economic downturn, we've lost a lot of officers,  so we need more resources on the ground because we have to work on this  through the supply - the supply how much is coming from Mexico.  We have to  work on the demand, we have to treat our users and have to get into  prevention and education to keep the next generation from falling into this  trap.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Hi, James Freeman here with the Journal.  Speaking about  education, I know a lot of programs around the country or a lot of schools  have these DARE programs, police officers educating kids starting at a very  young age.  Is there something related to that or not doing as you see this  particular epidemic, is there somebody parents ought to be doing that we're  not?  </p><p>PLUMMER:  Yes.  People -- there is a lot of understanding about the opioid  crisis, so what we're starting now is we're having town hall meetings and  all of our churches, we need to get the congregations to our -- in front of  our panelists and educate them on what's going on and what to be aware of,  you know, how to protect your children.  I, mean, we're losing our kids  every day here in this community.</p><p>SHAFFER:  I have a follow-up question, Sheriff, on the issue of how the  stuff is coming into the region and what you guys are doing about it.  Is  there any way to try to go after the money?  I mean, I work kind  counterdrug in the 90s, and obviously the financial motives for this sort  of thing by those who control the flow if you - if you start going right at  the money, that's one issue.  So have you guys been able to look at who's  dealing this?  You mentioned some of the folks transporting this.  I know  you can't necessarily get ahead of the pipeline but there are certain  things you can do to take the financials and (INAUDIBLE) you guys look at  how to get at the financial aspects of this at all.</p><p>PLUMMER:  Yes.  We've done - we've been targeting the cartel members, we  have two cartels, Mexican cartels bringing the product to our community.   So, you know, we've been watching them in various hotels and we've been  trying to capture the moneys.  And the last couple of years, we've taken  $5.5 dollars cash off of the streets from the cartels that would have gone  back to Mexico.</p><p>SHAFFER:  Wow.  Good.</p><p>PLUMMER:  Yes.  So, unfortunately, that's not working either.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Ohio is suing top pharmaceutical companies.  They  say allegedly they downplayed the risk of addiction to drive sales, Purdue  Pharma, Johnson and Johnson, Allergan, among those facing these lawsuits.   Do you agree with that?  Is some of the blame on these pharmaceutical  companies?</p><p>PLUMMER:  Yes.  Yes.  Definitely, they have some accountability here.  And,  you know, and I support the lawsuits but unfortunately, that's a long-term  solution for this problem and we've been fighting this problem for four  years.  So, we need some immediate resources here in this community.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching.  Sheriff, thanks very much for  weighing in and explaining the story to us.  We appreciate it.  Sheriff  Phil Plummer joining us.  Montgomery County there.  Coming up.  D.C. has  Georgia on its mind today.

Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Tuesday.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thank you so much for  joining us.  It is Tuesday, June 20th.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And here are  your top stories, 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  A busy day at 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue today.  President Trump will host the president of the  Ukraine at the White House later this afternoon.  The meeting comes amid  rising tensions in our nation's capital.  A new poll shows a vast majority  of Americans believe political debate is becoming increasingly uncivil and  it is encouraging violence.  The trend is sure to be on voters' minds as  they head to the polls in Georgia today.</p><p>KAREN HANDEL, GEORGIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  I feel great, very, very  encouraged by things the enthusiasm on the ground has been amazing. </p><p>JON OSSOFF, GEORGIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  I think this is an  opportunity for Georgia to elect some fresh leadership that's focused on  delivering results for folks at home, focus on what people that kind  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Over 140,000 ballots have already been cast as Jon Ossoff and  Karen Handel vie for the empty House seat latest on a special election in  Georgia and South Carolina, this morning.  Jack Ma making a big push in the  U.S. the Alibaba founder in is Detroit today, and in efforts to make good  on his promise to create jobs in America.  Details on his plan to impress  entrepreneurs and President Trump.  And Amazon's massive deal for whole  foods could bring major changes to the checkout counter what the  acquisition means for the future of the cashier in your shopping.</p><p>And then Brown wants you to pay a little more green this holiday season,  the new deliveries fee you could be facing, from UPS this Christmas.  Oil  prices are driving the action for stock prices this morning, crude oil is  down better than two percent right now and that has taken the wind out of  gains for stock prices, there's oil down $1.13, that's 21/2 percent at  $43.07 a barrel on oil sweet crude.</p><p>Futures meanwhile are also their high take a look at stocks here and the  Dow Industrials averages now negative expected to open down about seven  points.  S&amp;P is also negative both the Dow and the S&amp;P hit record highs  yesterday at the close.  The Nasdaq is swill positive although it is well  off of the highs of the morning, in Europe, similar situation, as oil has  reversed course and worsened, European markets have also done so.  The F.T.  100 is down eight points, the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are up but  just fractionally.  And Asia overnight markets closed mostly lower with the  exception of Japan it was up one percent.  </p><p>Americans on both sides of the aisle now say the tone and level of civility  in our political debate is getting much worse according to a new poll by  CBS News, 68 percent of Americans across all parties said so while just  seven percent said the tone was getting better, better?  Three-quarters of  Americans also say they feel the current tone of political debate is  encouraging violence, joining us right now the Trump great America PAC and  Co-Chair and former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins is here, Ed great to  see you. </p><p>ED ROLLINS, REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT AND ADVISOR:  Thank you, thank  you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think of this?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Obviously there is the rhetoric is much more severe than it's  ever been, and it's been increasing over last 20 years to a point since the  Trump election, now their people are very unhappy their very polarized, you  either for Trump or totally against Trump, and actually to me I can't go to  restaurant anywhere in this country that I hear someone, not adjacent table  talking about politics, I've never seen that before and one sense that's  good because their paying attention another sense is not particularly  positive conversations. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but it's also, you know, you have Hollywood getting in on  the act Robert De Niro saying I want to punch the President in the face  you've got Madonna saying yes I think about blowing up the White House  then, of course, the sickest of them all with Kathy Griffin and her head  that she was holding that time. </p><p>ROLLINS:  I think Hollywood is proven to be totally irrelevant in the last  election when everybody was pretty much for MRS. Clinton didn't make any  difference.  I think the serious thing here though is we could have had a  massacre last week if those two Capitol guards had not been there guarding,  you know, they could have killed 10 members of Congress or more and I think  that's very severe that, you know, this is a deranged guy this is obviously  someone who that just walked on the field that morning, he had planned this  but it's very, very severe. </p><p>TONY SHAFFER, RETIRED UNITED STATES ARMY:  And I said the other day in  interview that I felt that the essentially there's a pathology here and  that pathology mirrors what ISIS has been doing to radicalize its members,  I mean you're talking about a group where you have certain beliefs which  become completely inculcated in your believers to the point of were even  that they believe fiction they believe the whole Russian there, there was  on the other and then you have on top of that then this desensitization of  the groups by media.  Media saying it's OK, to say you want to punch the  President, it's OK to have the image of President Trump being behead and  then that leads them to people acting out.  So I believe that we're on a  path of seeing more of this world thing based on the fact that the left  refuses completely to acknowledge the fact that they are radicalizing  individuals to act.</p><p>ROLLINS:  But the bottom line is both sides have let a tone a down a little  bit there's some very serious we have to debate in the very near future.   The irony is we just haven't a Congressional race today this most expensive  race in the history of the country, over $50 million has been spent on a  Congressional race just to put that in the proper perspective.  When I ran  Reagan 49 state victory we spent $40 million so the publicly financed  campaign $50 million on a singular Congressional pain.  I ran a  Congressional committee in numbers of years ago and my whole budget was in  $50 million here in and across the country.  So the irony here is this to  be interpreted as a Trump victory or Trump defeat in which Trump really  didn't play very much of a part, the Democrats running as a new Democrat,  Karen Handel was one of very, very effective race on the start of the close  I can't tell who's going to win but it's a dead even race today with more  money spent than ever before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is so incredible and by the way, Jon Ossoff doesn't even  live in the district, right?</p><p>ROLLINS:  He's two hours outside the district.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP FUNDS:  And although have  Trump had a little to do with this race, what does this mean for the Trump  agenda going forward?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Specials are always over-interpreted and their totally different  dug and it's five or six specials every cycle between the elections.  But  this clearly if Handel wins, the Trump people certainly well justifiably  argue to their benefit if not the Democrats will argue this is a rejection  of Trump even though Trump really was a debater very much and a course.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is a Republican district all the way back to a red new  days.</p><p>ROLLINS:  This is (INAUDIBLE) this is the district he first won.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  The Democrats have changed slightly and I don't think you should  over-interpreted but it's an Atlantic District It's a big media market, but  it's some time want to watch very closely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSISTANT EDITOR EDITORIAL PAGE:   I've just want to relate, this Ossoff message he's a former staff or for  very liberal Democratic member of Congress, he's raised money from  Democrats all around the country calling himself independent.  When people  ask him if his force Nancy Pelosi, he said he hadn't given them an ounce of  thought.  Is that possibly true? </p><p>ROLLINS:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then talks an independent, no.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And I promise you if he gets elected tomorrow or tonight which I  hope doesn't happen, he'll be played Nancy Pelosi is going to first words  out of his mouth and he thanked you, madam leader, where do I sit?  And how  do I vote, I think that's the key thing. </p><p>SHAFFER:  Do you think it's working?</p><p>ROLLINS:  It's worked there, I mean, it's a -- again, it's not as much a  Republican district as it used to be, Trump carried the district by about  two points in the fall.  And again I don't want to be over-interpreted I  just think it's, it is going to have an impact on recruiting in a certain.   We're going to talk about first few days here but it's not the end game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow it's a real plead heat and voters are also headed to the  polls in South Carolina and the South Carolina fifth district.  This is to  fill the seat of the one, formerly held on Mick Mulvaney, that hasn't got  nearly as much attention but this is also an important race.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Two important race all over the Democrats have an wait much of a  battle there.  So we should win that race in for some reason they come  close the Democrats without spending much money then that I think of South  Carolina is a more of an indicator of what's occurring here.  I think the  reality here is we're going to move full, that's a very tough battles ahead  and I think the polarization that were talking about in the beginning of  this segment is very severe in the Congress and the problem is there's not  enough, Republicans don't have enough Republicans to do all of things they  want to do, even if they have majority and there's not enough money for  both sides to do all that they want to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the things they want to do is repeal and replace  Obamacare, they say that there is going to be a vote in the Senate next  week Ed, and then they are talking about tax reforms after the summer.  Do  you still think the agenda getting executed as viable this year? </p><p>ROLLINS:  I think it's tough, I think no one holds what's in the Senate  bill and Senator McConnell it's pretty much his bill so the few people  getting their advice, it's still not poputive a House bill was overwhelm  not (INAUDIBLE).  However it comes out as a big selling job that has to  take place there's only one person that can sell it, and that's the  President.  The President has to go out across this country and the only  criticism I have of the President today is you can't do one-day events, you  can't go out and say today is infrastructure day and tomorrow is tech day  and what you have.  If he wants to sell health care he's going to be out  there every day for weeks and weeks and weeks telling American public why  this is going to work and why it's better than Obamacare.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point, Ed.</p><p>SHAFFER:  On the issue of Senate and from what they're doing with the  health care bill, I see a lot of changes coming that's going to have to go  into some sort of a reconciliation between the House again.  Quick question  do you see the House staying though August?  Do you see that the potential  have actually -</p><p>ROLLINS:  I wish they would but that's what (INAUDIBLE) wish thanking for,  odd realistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They have talked about it, right?</p><p>ROLLINS:  They have talked about it but the bottom-line is they never gave  that up, they've all got junkyards that are all going back home and they've  got vacation plans like everybody else.  I just wish they wouldn't take so  many vacations, I think this is very serious year, we've got some very big  issues today the speakers speech is going to be very, very important on the  tax - what is his tax plan has the guy knows more about the taxes than  anybody and he's going to basically give anything or that basically don't  know about so far.  I think getting this tax plan through a tax reform is  critical, I think health care is important but I think tax is critical -</p><p>ZUMARAGGA:  It's also critical for the stock market and were reaching all- time highs because of tax reform may happen -</p><p>ROLLINS:  It's the hope and so for some reason, we go to the next two  months and we don't think it's going to happen, I think markets going to  change.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well it's also Republicans political survival next fall is  they're going to get the economy growing faster.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the promise the President made the rest of it is totally  relevant.  The international stuff that he's all dealing with it is  critical as part of any Presidents responsibility but what he promised the  American public, so I'm going to fix the economy and I want to create jobs  your lives going to be better and there's a whole lot of stuff has to  happen for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is what is going to leave voters in 2018, for the next  group of elections, do you think voters will remember the way that the left  has been obstructing and basically pushing back on the agenda that America  voters - </p><p>ROLLINS:  I think the problems is you have both sides are very polarized,  so Democrats aren't being turned off by this activity and Republicans, the  same way, it's so if two very anti entities out there and I think the  bottom line is those that are independents and the worry that I think Trump  has is that some of the independents who voted for him in the fall are  starting to back away and independents carry the day today.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  And just given that we had this attempted assassination last  week, do you think it's time for Democrats to stop calling themselves the  resistance?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Yes. </p><p>FREEMAN:  As if they are French freedom fighters battling the Nazis  - </p><p>ROLLINS:  They're very important that the rhetoric get toned down, I mean  you can go fight on the floor, and make whatever kinds of comments you  want, but you got cut stop this personal attack and you got to quit  basically making enemies out of the opposite side.  Part of the breakdown  I've been around the game 50 years is it used to be there was social you  can still fight still be partisan. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you go have a cup of coffee.  </p><p>ROLLINS:  Still have a couple coffee or drink or dinner what have you, you  have to know his at his family's and you realize we're all Americans today  they don't sit together they don't talk together staffers don't meet  together and they just are polarized they hate each and  that's other a  terrible place to be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean listen to Chuck Schumer yesterday, saying that,  you know, they are passing something in the dead of night as if nobody  remembers the way Obamacare was passed, and stuck down everybody's throat. </p><p>ZUMARAGGA:  And that what he said you'll find out what's in the bill when  it is passed. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what Nancy Pelosi said.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And unfortunate all those words are going to coming back this  time if we don't do it differently and that's my concern at this point in  time.  I think we got to get this thing drafted I don't have any problems  Senator McConnell of doing it.  I just think it has to get very open we're  going to have a big debate on it, people have to know what this is all  about if not we'll pay a heavy price. </p><p>ZUMARAGGA:  And we'll give Chuck Schumer more than 10 hours, to see what's  in the bill. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He wants for this than ever that's what he said as well.  Ed  great to see you</p><p>ROLLINS:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much great insights as always from Ed Rollins.   Coming up Amazon's deal to acquire whole foods could send cashiers packing  the potential trouble ahead for grosser is it going robotic?  And then  Santa sleigh make come with a surcharge where the shipping giant is  planning to charge more for holiday delivery there were at UPS, back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  With O&amp;M, head of Chinese e-commerce giant,  Alibaba is rolling into mortar city.  Here's Nicole Petallides covering the  story from New York, Stock Exchange.  Hi, Nicole. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Thank you, Maria.  That is  right.  Technology and e-customers wave off the future.  The story was  exactly that Jack Ma, Chairman of Alibaba, is coming into moderate gateway  conference and is going to meet with over 3,000 businesses all to go with  the pledge to President Donald Trump in creating jobs.  Alibaba has already  done millions and millions of jobs in China and China e-commerce.  By the  way, the only sales reported are 771 billion clearly out places that are in  the United States.  This year, it is at 446 billion in the hopes of trying  to get U.S. businesses to now work with Alibaba.  That in itself is a big  deal.</p><p>Jack Ma also has power in bringing head of UPS in order to make this deal  happen.  There are concerns because you have these sellers lacking the  clarity of merchandise and can step in trying to woo U.S, besides creating  jobs to Amazon -- we know Amazon made that nearly $14 billion deal with  Whole Foods.  Reports are now going to use strategy of Amazon so that  customers can now walk around the store with no cashiers, just technology  sensors, streamers, and maybe humans just in the back monitoring things at  the place.  You can walk out with items with human interaction but the  problem with initial platform is that when the store is getting too crowded  in a prolonged time, it can no longer monitor what the customer has picked  up.  They say -- we will keep an eye on the business that's at stake.  </p><p>There is also talk of new stores that may not be exactly Whole Foods, you  know, and new brands as well, that may be less price because the stocks are  trying to shed that Whole Foods, whole paycheck image and trying to make it  ready for everybody.  Maria, back to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Nicole Petallides, thank you so much.  We will  watch that.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, final thoughts  from our all-star panel.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Final thoughts from our all-stars.  Heather. </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  A big week ahead we got rate hikes, Sessions testimony may be  in public or private and big tech names to watch. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Buckle up, that's what you're saying. </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Buckle up. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Freeman.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm watching the text docs too, I also want to say happy  anniversary mom and dad Steve and Gloria Block. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How many years?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Bad son.  But he did wish you a happy anniversary on air.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  The federal reserve is set to raise quarter basis points again  on Wednesday, I'm more interested to see if they hint that unwinding their  balance sheet and reducing some a little the liquidity that helps prop the  markets up. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That we probably won't find out until the fall I think  Septembers the application for that.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Maybe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks to Heather and James, see you all.  All right, we will  leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow with another big show.  As  request \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is on deck.  Stu, take it away. </p><p>830</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Thanks for joining  us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Tuesday, June 20th.  Here are your top  stories 6:00 A.M. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> President Trump takes aim at North Korea after Otto Warmbier dies days  after returning to the United States with severe brain damage.  The company  that took into the country now saying it will no longer take Americans  there.  It says a tragedy like this should never be repeated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, a push for reform this morning.  \"The Wall  Street Journal\" reporting a health care vote will take place next week.   The administration holding firm that tax reform will also get done this  year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF TREASURY:  I have no higher priority than  having tax reform done this year.  We're working every day.  We're working  with the house and the senate.  We're committed to get this done.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Plus, a contentious moment between Senators Mitch McConnell and  Chuck Schumer coming up.</p><p> It is technically not even summer.  But the southwest is facing a dangerous  heat wave this morning.  Temperatures already near triple digits today.  We  will give you the latest.</p><p> And the heat taking a toll.  American Airlines has cancelled more than a  dozen flights.  More than 1,000 needed medical attention at the Electric  Daisy Concert in Las Vegas.</p><p> Markets look like this this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a  mixed opening for the broader averages.  Fractionally better on the  session.  The Dow and the S&amp;P coming up of a record close yesterday.   Looking to extend that today with fractional moves in the upside.  Dow  Industrial sets to open up about 10 points.  Ditto for the NASDAQ.</p><p> In Europe, the indices look like this.  Take a look.  European indices  higher across the board with the CAC quarante in Paris, best performer up  about a third of a percent.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower, meanwhile.  Take a look.  As  you see the best performer was the Nikkei in Japan that was up one percent.   The others down fractionally.</p><p> Tom Brady wants to play an NFL game outside of the U.S.  We will reveal  where he says is his dream country to play one day.  All those stories  coming up this morning.</p><p> And joining me to talk about it, financial analyst Heather Zumarraga is  with us.  Wall Street Journal assistant editorial page editor, James  Freeman is with us.  And the London Center for Policy Research, Vice  President Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer is here.  Great to see you.</p><p> TONY SHAFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Great seeing you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  Good morning.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's on top this morning, James?  What do you think of the  big stories?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, at long last, patients, doctors, taxpayers may finally see  the beginning of the end of ObamaCare.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  They were looking for a vote next week.  So  we'll see that.  We will talk about all of that this morning.</p><p> Coming up joining the conversation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is with  us today.  Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn is with us today.  Fox  News Military analyst, Jack Keane is here.  Harvard law professor emeritus  Alan Dershowitz is here.  And former Raegan campaign advisor, Ed Rollins is  here as well.  You don't want to miss moments of it.  So just stay with us  throughout the show.</p><p> We kick it off this hour right now with Otto Warmbier.  The American  student imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months and sent back to the United  States in a persistent vegetative state last week, died yesterday.  He died  at the tender age of 22 years old.  Doctors treating the University of  Virginia student said late last week that Warmbier had extensive loss of  brain tissue and he was in the state of unresponsive wakefulness.</p><p> Warmbier had been sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea for  allegedly stealing a propaganda poster during an organized tour to the  isolated country.  The Chinese company behind Young Pioneer Tours, the tour  company that sent him there now says it will stop taking U.S. citizens to  North Korea.</p><p> President Trump weighed in on the sad news from the White House.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Otto Warmbier has just  passed away.  He spent a year and a half in North Korea.  A lot of bad  things happened.  But at least we got him home to be with his parents where  they were so happy to see him, even though he was in very tough condition.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Warmbier's parents Fred and Cindy put the blame squarely at  North Korea writing in a statement, \"Unfortunately the awful torturous  mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensure that  no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today.</p><p> Tony, your take on these developments.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, look, there's no doubt in my mind he was tortured.  Let's  be very clear what happened here.  And I've already said another interviews  I think there needs to be some level of retaliation.  I'll just be that  direct about it.  My son is 23.  I cannot imagine the pain these parents  are going through.  This is truly tragic.</p><p> My understanding from talking to the experts, he was tortured not so much  the way where you'd be pulling fingernails out with tools, but by repeated  drugging, sodium pentothal.  The idea was they were trying to figure out if  he was a CIA spy or not.  He wasn't.  And the continued and repeated  exposure over that year to these drugs is what caused the consistent and  persistent damage of the entire brain.  So it was essentially the use of  these drugs over and over again which caused the brain damage.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, there were some reports that he went into the vegetative  state just recently, a couple of weeks ago.  So, was that -- </p><p> SHAFER:  I don't buy that.  I think this -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The whole time you think he was just drugged?</p><p> SHAFFER:  I think they started during his confinement and did it over and  over.  And I think of the reasons they released him --I mean no doubt,  President Trump saw this and started dealing with it early on.  But no  doubt they kind of like saw that some things are going to go tragically  wrong.  We better get this guy out of here, anyway.  So let's serve their  purpose to get him out.</p><p> The parents got their boy back, their son back.  But again, Maria, it does  not change the fact that he was tortured.  This is something that we should  not stand for.  And I believe that President Trump recognizes how hideous  this is and something requires a response.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And what kind of response do you expect? Should be  warranted.</p><p> SHAFFER:  We in the Cold War, we had organizations which focused on is what  they called dirty tricks in the old days.  Look, we need to rethink our  foreign policy.  We cannot simply sit back and let dictators, horrible  people like Kim Jong-un do these things and think they can get away with  it.  There's been no push back.  This is a remote analogy.  But we just  shut down a certain aircraft.  We haven't shut down an aircraft since 1999.    So I think it's time we re-insinuate ourselves in foreign policy in a way  that the -- those bad guys like Un understand there's going to be  consequences for bad behavior.  There's been no bad consequences for  decades.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Otto's parents said that.  Look, President Obama told us to  be quite.  President Trump took our son home.  James, how do you see it?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, this is one of the last to the old style dictatorships.   This is what communists, dictatorships so.  I think it was probably  surprising to a lot of people over the last year following this news that  you actually tend to travel to North Korea.  To this point, the state  department has a -- had a strong warning and I think maybe you'd expect  from now it would be something more like a -- like a band -- I mean,  obviously they don't treat visitors any better than they treat their own  people.  And this -- for anyone who didn't realize that, yes, this is a  wake up call.</p><p> HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  But so maybe we should it be there  though.  There are some -- to some extent, we shouldn't be going to these  places.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But this was a tour company from China, Heather.  I mean, if  you've got a tour company, you may be thinking that you're OK and that  you're with a safe group.</p><p> Let's switch gears to the standoff in the senate right now.  Because this  is also a piece of important business today.  Republicans are aiming for a  vote on the health care bill next week.  A full week ahead of the July 4th  recess since the democrats have begun using parliamentary maneuvers to slow  down business in the chamber though to protest any bill including a series  of back to back speeches on the floor yesterday.</p><p> In one exchange, minority leader Chuck Schumer press his counterpart, Mitch  McConnell to commit to an open debate.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER:  When we have time more than 10  hours, since this is a complicated bill to review the bill, will it be  available to us and the public, more than 10 hours before we have to vote  for it.</p><p> SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER:  I think we'll have an ample  opportunity to read and amend the bill.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you see republicans pushing through to get this done before  July 4th, James Freeman?  And also, what's your take on this ostracism?   They're basically telling you in advance.  Look, we're going to do long  speeches.  We're going to do whatever it takes to waste time so this  doesn't get done?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  So a lot of theatrics.  I think the republicans will get it  done.  It's interesting there.   You look at Chuck Schumer saying, I want  10 hours to read bill.  Of course, if you took another clip from that  speech he was saying, as he often does that this is a terrible bill and  he's opposed to it.  So he's not -- he's not an over minded voter here  looking to consider the measure.  He doesn't need 10 hours.  He's already  against it without even having seen it because this is the Obama legacy  project, no matter how bad it's failing.  They have tied themselves to it  politically and they're going to do well of the parliamentary moves they  can do to slow it down but they can't and it'll pass.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is there any chance though that they are able to stop any  business whatsoever that the Trump administration trust to put forth?   That's the whole plan.  Let his president be a president that gets nothing  done.  Let this congress be get nothing done congress that we take the  house in '18 and we impeach him in '20?</p><p> FREEMAN:  I don't think that will work.  Because if you basically make it  impossible to do business, what they're going to do is they're going to  kill the legislative filibuster which still exists and allows them to block  things like -- any measure that can't get 60 votes.  Now, health care is  different because they're going through this recompilation process.  But  basically if they put up a big roadblock like they did with Gorsuch, it'  going to hurt their agenda because they're not going to be able to stop  anything else.  It seems a lot of republicans are going to say, enough.   We're going to filibuster.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  So then you do think a health care vote happens?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me ask you about House Speaker Paul Ryan.  He  sets to deliver his first major speech on tax reform today.  According to  the excerpts of the speech that have been released, he's expected to urge  republicans, \"We need to get his done in 2017.  We cannot let this once in  a generation moment slip.\"</p><p> Now, Heather, if we don't see tax reform, big implications from markets?</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, the markets have been up hitting all-time highs.  Yet  again, I think Futures are up today.  We'll see if the Dow can hit new  highs today.  It's tax reform.  It's health care.  That's what it's all  about.  That's what the markets are running on right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  James, what do you want to hear from Paul Ryan today?</p><p> FREEMAN:  I'd like to hear him say that the number one priority is growing  this economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what he's going to say.  You know that.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, I'm worried that he's also going to say that this has got  to be revenue natural.  We've got to stick with the conventions of beltway  score keeping no matter how flawed they are.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And that means the border adjustment tax or higher  corporate rate or some kind of a revenue, right?</p><p> FREEMAN:  They've got to get the corporate rate into the teams if we want a  real game changer.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Tony?</p><p> SHAFFER:  Look, I think what we've seen over and over again is reluctant  facts to actually break out of what we know doesn't work.  The scoring  system, we know doesn't work, doesn't matter.  The democrats always refer  to it.  And what I don't understand why the republicans haven't gone back  and looked at the numbers that CBO did on the original estimates for  ObamaCare and look at how wildly of they were.  So it's kind of like how is  that you don't just look at what bad work they did and say throw it out  because it doesn't work.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  It's funny to hear Chuck Schumer say, well, when  you do things in the dark of night.  Excuse me, ObamaCare was done in the  dark of night.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  No.  Find out what's in the bill after we pass the bill.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Nancy Pelosi.  We have the Trump tweets to tell you about the  president is tweeting this morning.  And we want to bring you to you right  now President Trump just tweeting about the Georgia special election.   \"Democrat Jon Ossoff who wants to raise your taxes to the highest level and  is weak on crime and security doesn't even live in the district.  Karen  Handel for congress, she will fight for lower taxes, great health care,  strong security.  A hard worker who will never give up.  Vote today.</p><p> We've got more analysis on this.  The special election happening in  Georgia.  Of course it's real important.  It's the most money, right?  In  the congressional election.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Ossoff has raised more than 23 million bucks.  He's got about  five times the money that Karen Handel has.  He's raising his money  basically outside of Georgia.  So it's going to be a question of whether  people want to -- Georgia voters want to allow the rest of the country's  liberals to use them as a vehicle to oppose the president.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Does this tell us anything, I mean, if Ossoff wins or Handel  wins, does this tell us anything about the republican party or democratic  party today do you think?  Is this going to be sort of an indicator?</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, Georgia has been one of the states that the democrats have  been trying to turn for a while.  I mean, there was during the last  election cycle, I believe, which was not founded on anything real that they  could turn this state blue and they didn't.  But I think you see over and  over again, every election, we've seen special cycle election, outside  money's been donated heavily and they've lost every time.  And I think it's  going to happen again here because the overwhelming feeling still is that I  think people want to give President Trump time to get his act together.  I  think this is a microcosm of other things.  And Georgia still I think is  more red than blue.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We'll take a short break.  We have a lot more  on the congressional race today.</p><p> But first, let's take a break.  A heat wave is striking the southwest.  The  national weather service predicting highs of 120 degrees today with some  states already having canceled flights to the region.  We're on it next.   Stay with us.  Quick break.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A brutal heat wave hitting the southwest United  States.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Maria.  OK.   Temperatures could reach 120 degrees today in parts of Arizona for the  first time in more than 20 years.  This is a record-breaking 122 that  happened back in 1990.  Also, the city of Las Vegas and southern California  bracing for what authorities are calling a public health hazard.  Death  Valley could reach temperatures as high as 124 degrees.</p><p> Airlines also watching the weather, at least -- excuse me, 20 American  Airlines flights out of Arizona have already been cancelled because those  planes can't operate over a temperature of 118.  That's according to a  statement from the airline.  It's the smaller aircraft.  Americans saying  that flight changes are going to be free of charge for passengers.</p><p> Meanwhile, one person is dead and nearly 1,000 needed medical attention on  site at the Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas.  Sixteen other people  taken to a local hospital.  According to -- still can't determine the cause  of death for 34-year-old Michael Morse.  He passed away after attending the  festival on Saturday.  The heat though could have been a factor.  The  temperature in Las Vegas reach 110 degrees.  He experienced convulsions  about 3:23 in the morning.  According to police there, a total of 340  medical calls were handled on Saturday.</p><p> And you were just talking about this, Maria.  Over 140,000 ballots have  already been cast in the Georgia congressional race for democrat John  Ossoff is looking to defeat Karen Handel.  Ossoff raising, a record setting  15 million.  President Trump tweeting on the election just saying this, big  day tomorrow in Georgia and South Carolina.  ObamaCare is dead.  Dems wants  to raise taxes big.  They can only obstruct.  No ideas vote \"R.\"  And this  coming as a new ad pack - ad paid for by PAC supporting Handel is receiving  backlash for showing images of House Majority Whip Scalise after he was  shot in a baseball game last week.  The spokesperson for Handel condemning  that act saying, \"For any group to use the shootings this week for  political or personal benefit is shameful.  This group should be ashamed.\"</p><p> Meanwhile, South Carolina also holding elections.  Democrat Archie Parnell  faces republican Paul Norman to replace Mick Mulvaney.  And of course the  president tapped to be budget director.  That election is going to test if  the republican candidate can gain support from largely African-American  districts, Maria.  So a lot going on politically today.  Those were your  headlines.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl.  Thanks so much.  Coming up next, record  closing for the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 yesterday.  Technology stops once again  rebounding and leading this market high.  We're taking a closer look at  markets and the best performers, next.</p><p> Then play a game, win a job.  Jaguar L, Land Rover's new technique for  recruiting engineers straight ahead.  Stay with us right here \"Mornings  with Maria.\"  After this.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Stocks looking to extend yesterday's record run.   The gains driven by the technology sector yesterday.  Of course, tech has  been down and now it looks like it's stabilizing a bit in recent weeks.</p><p> Joining us right now is GFI Group chief macro strategist, John Spallanzani.   John good to see you.</p><p> JOHN SPALLANZANI, CHIEF MACRO STRATEGIST, GFI GROUP:  Good seeing you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's going on in markets right now?  Is money coming back  into technology after the Amazon announcement of the Whole Foods?</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  I think we saw some rotation out of tech and into some of the  big financial names.  Hopefully that they're expecting some tax relief.   Obviously a steeper occur because the Fed hike rates.  I think that we see  small caps catching a bit again.  Those have been flat for a while, for six  months.  We've been consolidating all those stocks that run up after the  election kind of went sideways and now we're starting to see some rotations  which is healthy in the market.</p><p> The NASDAQ is up 16 percent.  The S&amp;P is almost up 10 percent now.  So we  saw a lot of momentum into, again, the dime and so there was a bit  divergence between tech last week was down like 150 basis points.  But yet,  the diamonds were up 180 basis points.  So those are three percent swing in  one week where guys obviously rotating out of tech and then for someone  bigger names.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then bigger names and you say diamond.  Bigger names -- </p><p> SPALLANZANI:  The Dow stocks and also the S&amp;P stocks.  People are expecting  the effective tax rates and corporations to go down.  So those corporations  with the highest effective tax rates right now are being targeted because  they're going to get the biggest boost if we do get some taxes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  targeted to buy.  So Wall Street still believes in tax reform  in '17 is what you're saying?</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  I think the media is more interested in '17 and '18.  I think  right now we're just worried about the message.  But the message is good  right now.  And I think that whether it's '17 or '18, there's other good  things.  Earnings are obviously very good.  I don't think -- we didn't see  -- this rally is not based on multiple expansions.  It's really based on  earnings so far.</p><p> So if you look at stock multiples compared to credit and bonds, stocks are  still cheap relative to the other two.  So, where else are you going to put  your money?</p><p> FREEMAN:  OK.  But they are still expensive relative to their earnings  historically -- that's a hard metric to pin down.  Because -- OK.  Let's  say they're not relative to their earnings.  Here's on the upper level.   Here's where I'm wondering is how much of this is company's doing well, how  much is the optimism surrounding Trump and reform and how much is still  very loose monetary policy around the world?  We're -- in the U.S. kind of  taking baby steps toward going back to normal.  But in central banks, they  printed a lot of money.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Last week, even though we raised, a lot of people are point out  that the central banks around the world, including Europe and Japan are  still easing at a rate of $1 trillion, so global central banks are still  easing although we're increasing rates in the U.S.</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  Yes.  There's still a lot of capital around.  I think the  other reason why our yield curve is so flat because, again, treasuries are  tier one capital that everybody has not the balance sheets.  There's no  alternative to treasuries, really.  So, do you want to invest in goes to 27  basis points?  Which is like last night.  What do you want it by treasury  220?  That's the trade.  So there's not a lot of alternatives to what you  have going on.  So that's another thing that's keeping rates down that's  helping.</p><p> Just last night, just this morning, Carney said, I'm not going to tight in  -- the Bank of England is not going to tie because he fears that we have  still on present talks, want to go slow.  Les Evans.  Last night again that  listen, we're not going to tight in -- we might not tight in September,  maybe December because inflation is still undershooting the Feds.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  So the Fed is still a major factor here, is what you're  saying.  And Easy money around the world.</p><p> Let me ask you, what would you do right now?  Do you want to put money into  this market here knowing that maybe health care reform gets done next week?   I mean, the health care bill rather, the vote.  And then tax reform later  in the year.  And then what about Europe?</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  I think steady as she goes.  I mean, it's evitable for quite  a long time.  I still think that we're at 2,500 now.  Have a few bets,  personal bets to - we might hit 2,700 by the end of the year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  On the S&amp;P 500.</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  In the S&amp;P 500.  Yup.  That's a big -- it's a big move from  here.  But it's still June and there's so much left that we could do and  especially if the Fed does not hike in September, there's not a lot of  resistance above.</p><p> I think right now, when I'm watching, is the unemployment rate next in July  rate.  If we start to see that tick higher then I would get more concerned.   Right now, unemployment is obviously very low.  And also wages are kind of  not so hot.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No.  Stagnant.</p><p> SHAFFER:  I have a quick question on Brexit.  We had one year anniversary  couple days ago.  They're starting to make their negotiations.  How do you  see your stocks worth rolling as a negotiation starts?</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  European stocks have been actually performing better than --  that's my marker right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  With the easy money there, yes.</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  Yes, the easy money.  But I think that May has got problems,  right?  So we see that the more problems May has, the higher the market  goes in Europe, right?  So that meeting that Brexit is not going to be a  hard Brexit. So I think new markets going to discounting that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Oil price is down.  Okay.</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  Who would have thought that oil via 44 and the stocks be at  2,500.  So oil is a technology driven story, not a supply story and not a  recessionary story.  That's a huge positive oil being a 44.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Okay.  A technology story?</p><p> SPALLANZANI:  Fracking and the ability for the U.S. to be one of the  biggest exporters in the world and that's really Trump's</p><p> BARTIROMO:  John, great to see you.  Thank you so much.  John Spallanzani  joining us there.</p><p> Coming up, police reportedly identified the man suspected of plowing his  van into a crowded London.  47-year-old, Darren Osborne is arrested by  authorities on suspicion of terrorist offences.</p><p> And then technology giants headed to Washington.  I'll speak with Commerce  Secretary Wilbur Ross about President Trump's meeting yesterday with  Silicon Valley CEOs.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST:  Welcome  back, good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, June 20th.  Your top stories right now  6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Busy week at the White House.  President Trump set to meet with the  President of Ukraine this afternoon.  This comes after the President hosted  the biggest names in technology at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue yesterday.  Big  names including the CEOs of Apple among others stressing the importance of  improving the government's technology infrastructure.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The U.S. should have the most modern government in the  world, and today, it doesn't.  And it's great to see the effort that Jared  is putting.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The United States needs to in every way at every level  to be working on machine learning and artificial intelligence, and that can  be used in every part of government.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'll break down the meeting with Commerce Secretary Wilbur  Ross, coming up.  He attended that meeting.  We'll talk about the  conversation at the table, straight ahead.</p><p> Jack Ma, meanwhile, making a big push in the United States.  The Alibaba  founder is in Detroit today in an effort to make good on a promise to  create jobs in America.  Details on his plan to impress entrepreneurs and  President Trump.</p><p> Not to be outdone, Jaguar is creating jobs of its own.  The automaker  teaming up with the band Gorillaz to recruit 5,000 new employees.  The  major impact it could have on its autonomous vehicle plans.  </p><p> The browns want you to pay a little more green this holiday season.  The  delivery fee you could end up facing from UPS this Christmas.  Markets  looking higher this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a gain at  the opening of trading on the heels of a record day yesterday.  The Dow and  the S&amp;P 500 coming off of a record close yesterday.  And as you say, it's  going to be an extension of that even if it's just fractionally.  Dow  Industrials set to open about 14 points today.  In Europe, the major  averages are mostly higher.  Take a look.  The FT-100 up a fraction, the  CAC Quarante in Paris is up a third of a percent.  In the DAX Index in  Germany up a quarter of a percent.  In Asia overnight, stocks closed mostly  lower with the Exception of Japan.  The Hang Seng, the Shanghai, and the  KOSPI all down.  The Nikkei averaging Japan up almost one percent.  </p><p> And the GOAT takes on the Great Wall.  NFL legend, Tom Brady says his dream  is to play a game in China.  Our top story this half an hour, though, let's  kick it off here with the top names and technology meeting the President  Trump yesterday.  The White House is teaming up with industry leaders to  modernize the government's technology infrastructure, and strengthen cyber  security.  The President spoke yesterday about why he's turning to the tech  titans to help achieve those goals. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT:  The businesses represented here  today employed hundreds of thousands of American workers.  Your innovation  has shaped the modern world and created millions of jobs.  America should  be the global leader in government technology just as we are in every other  aspect, and we are going to start our big edge again in technology.  It's  such an important industry.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.   Secretary Ross, it's always a pleasure.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE.  Good to see you again,  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, the President is estimating that this initiative could save  the U.S. a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.  How would it work,  take us behind the meeting and what was most important yesterday?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, these factors that the government not just the federal but  also state and local government generally has not spent very much on  upgrading their technology.  A lot of archaic equipment that's been used,  lot of equipment where you can barely get proper support anywhere.   And  there are various estimates that the government may be spending, something  like $90 billion a year on maintaining systems that fundamentally are  obsoleted by modern standards.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are these companies ready and willing to help in this effort?   There were 18 CEOs there yesterday.  What kind of a sense did you get from  companies of what they will actually do to achieve that goal?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, the real specifics of the plan haven't been worked out  (INAUDIBLE) but they all acknowledge the need.  They all acknowledge that  the -- if we thought about capital expenditure rather than maintenance,  we'd be a lot better off.  So, there's a lot of investigation as to the  extent to which we could simply reinvest in equipment, funding that  otherwise would have to go for maintenance.  It's kind of a juggling act.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I could totally see that.  And you think this will - this would  save a trillion dollars over 10 years?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, it certainly can be a very, very big number, as I've said.   There's something like 90 billion a year or more that's spent on  maintenance of the equipment and maintaining an obsolete thing.  Think  about your car.  Once your car gets to be, what, 10 years old, you start  putting in inordinate amount into its maintenance relatively to what would  be the maintenance on a vehicle.  So, one of the peculiarities of  government accounting is that a capital expenditure and in expense more or  less treated the same way from a budgetary point of view whereas the  capital expenditure has enduring value, it has a long-term asset value,  whereas the maintenance, the out of pocket expense that just comes in is  just gone.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see that the Homeland Security Secretary was there.  Wilbur,  let me ask you about security and what came around that topic.  You've got  the leaders of some of these companies that can actually have a real hand  in helping protect our data cybersecurity huge issue.  And then, of course,  there's the extremisms in terms of content online.  What was said about  those topics?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, Homeland Security and cyber security are inextricably in  linked together.  And cybersecurity is a problem everywhere.  You've seen  some of the recent hacking in (INAUDIBLE) a very, very big scale.  Some of  which were for commercial purposes.  Others of which appear perhaps to have  been for national security purposes.  So, I think we're going to find.  The  defenders of security, cybersecurity, keep developing new firewalls, new  ways to keep the bad people out.  And yet, there's a great deal of  ingenuity on the part of the hackers to figure out new ways to intrude and  new ways to be disruptive.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, they sure are.  Let's talk trade, Secretary.  I enjoyed  that piece with you and the Journal the other day in terms of the  conservation on trade.  We're all trying to figure out when we'll see tax  reform?  It's so important for the economy, moving the needle on growth.   And tit's so important, of course, for the markets as well.  Are you  expecting that we will see some kind of attacks at the border?  I mean,  maybe it's not a border adjustment tax because we know that the President  is not in favor of that.  But maybe it's a reciprocal tax or some kind of   other tracks at the border in terms of trade with our friends across the  world?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, the border-adjustable tax was not proposed particularly as a  U.S. agenda item.  The border-adjustable tax was proposed mainly to help  balance the budget.  As you know, the to get to reconciliation when there  are different bills passed by the House from the one passed by the Senate,  you need to have a certain scoring by the Congressional Budget Office,  namely over a 10-year horizon to break even.  That means that you have to  fill some holes.  And the border-adjustable tax idea was a - idea that  Chairman Brady, I believe, come out with in order to just try to fill that  hole.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you have to fill the whole, though?  I mean that's the  point.  I mean, do you - do you need to see some kind of revenue raised, or  can you do way with this whole idea of deficit neutral?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, the rules for reconciliation are fairly clear, and as I  understand them, you need to be neutral or at the tenured time horizon.   And the recon we need the reconciliation is that it's unlikely that the  House and Senate will pass exactly the same bill.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, if we - if we don't see a border adjustment tax in the tax  portion of this, in terms of trade, you're overseeing, you're expecting any  other kind of tax, like a reciprocal tax, something at the border.</p><p> ROSS:  Well, remember, the U.S. budget until well into the 20th century.   Main component had been tariffs.  So, tariffs are nothing new to the  financing of the U.S. government, but we've long past that with the advent  of personal income tax and corporate tax, so now border adjustable or some  such thing is simply one way to fill up a portion of a hole.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll see - we'll see if it ends up there.  I know  that you'll be taking the lead on renegotiating the North America Free  Trade Agreement, NAFTA, later this year.  And then, of course, today,  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is talking about irritants with his  counterparts from Canada and Mexico, including the dairy trade dispute with  sugar exports.  What are your priorities in terms of setting the stage for  NAFTA talks, Secretary? </p><p> ROSS:  Well, we - Ambassador Lighthizer already has made a preliminary  report to the Congress explaining the big bold letter headlines for NAFTA  renegotiation.  They'll be a much more detailed one filed middle of July  because 30 days before the August 15th date when the 90-day clock finally  ticks, where the administration is required to give Congress more detail on  the objectives for NAFTA.  So, that's when there will be a fairly detail  exposition of the objective.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, the sugar issue is one thing that you've spoken about.   Is there's an overriding issue that's problematic with the current form?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, the sugar deal has been resolved.  We reached the agreement  with the Mexican government and with the U.S. sugar industry.  We filed it  some days ago.  It's not out for public commentary but doesn't require  congressional vote and since the key parties to the original trade case now  are finally all on board with the solution, I don't think they'll be that  much controversy about it. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And is there another priority that you want to make sure to  tackle as a result of your be getting this?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, what would be a good thing would be if we could get rid of  some of the other issues with Canada, for example, the softwood lumber and  potentially the dairy management issue that Secretary Perdue was talking  about.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see.  In terms of -- Secretary, the new trade deals actually  moving the needle on growth, what are your expectations?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, the growth plans of the administration have several components  to them.  Trade is certainly one but tax reform, regulatory reform,  unleashing the energy that we have in the ground and infrastructure are all  also essential ingredients to getting the Trump program for three percent  growth.  So, we need all of those pieces to get to the objective.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We are watching that in terms of these pieces  coming together.  Secretary Ross, do you think that when we see all of  these issues whether it be your renegotiating of NAFTA, you know, the tax  reform, the health care bill, do you think these things will get done this  year, or are you expecting - are you looking over the next three years?</p><p> ROSS:  Well, the NAFTA has a fairly natural time horizon in that - think  about next year, the trade promotion authority which is an essential  ingredient to our being able to negotiate trade treaties, that expires July  of 2018.  There's also the Mexican Presidential election in July 2018 and  then in the fall of '18, you have the mid-term congressional elections  here.  So as you move well into next year, the political calendar will  become very complicated in terms of any big transaction like a NAFTA  renegotiation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Sure.  Wilbur Ross, good to see you.  Thank you so  much.</p><p> ROSS:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Secretary Wilbur Ross joining us.  We will be right back</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are looking higher today.  Take a look,  Futures indicating a gain of about 12 points on the Dow Industrials at the  open this morning, 12 on the NASDAQ as well, after the S&amp;P and the - and  the Dow Industrials, rather, both hit record highs yesterday.  A couple of  names on the move this morning, more job cuts coming to general motors.   The automaker is set to layoff nearly 1,000 workers to its sedan plant in  Kansas City, Kansas.  GM notified the workers of plans to eliminate a third  shift at the plant late last week.</p><p> We're watching shares of Apple this morning.  The company is shaking up  subscription options for its Apple music streaming service, TechCrunch is  reporting users now have the option to pay $99 for 12-month subscription,  works out so just over $8 a month.  Monthly individual plans currently cost  $9.99.  </p><p> Authorities have identified and arrested the man suspected of mowing down a  crowd at a London mosque earlier Monday.  Cheryl Casone with the details.   Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, that's right, Maria.   So, the victims were leaving Ramadan prayers at the time of the attack.   The suspect identified as 47-year-old, Darren Osborne of Cardiff Wales.   Osborne was arrested on suspicion of terror offenses.  At least 1 person  was killed, 10 others injured in that assault which authorities are  treating as a terrorist attack.  And investigators in France say that the  man suspected of trying to attack security forces on the Champs-Elysees in  Paris, Monday afternoon has been flagged by investigators earlier for  extremism.  The man ran this car into a police van and afterward,  authorities found a rifle and explosives in that vehicle.  That suspect  died.</p><p> Well, another headlines this morning.  Jaguar Land Rover is hiring and  they're making the application process pretty interesting.  They (AUDIO  GAP) 5,000 software engineers, electronic experts and others, but instead  of using job fairs and ads to attract the applicants, potential employees  are asked to assemble a Jaguar sports car then tackle a series of code- breaking puzzles.  They teamed up with the app, Gorillaz.  We should say in  2011, Marriott asked applicants to manage a virtual hotel so it's not  really a new idea but interesting.  </p><p> And get ready to pay more for shipping this Christmas.  UPS says it's going  to add a holiday surcharge per package as much as 97 cents per package.   UPS wants to recoup some money for increased staffing, extra planes and  vehicles added during the holiday season but this could be tough for  retailers, Maria.  Remember, they're promising free ground shipping, a lot  of them.  So here's the question, do you charge your customers more or do  you eat the surcharge? We'll see what they decide.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But first of all, I'm a little uncomfortable talking about  Christmas right now.  We're having - </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- summertime, but OK.  I will take your bait, Cheryl.  In  terms of this higher cost around holidays, guys, big deal?</p><p> LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Look, I think I  would -- if I were the folks selling the stuff, I would go eat the cost.  I  think it --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Eat it?</p><p> SHAFFER:  Yes.  I mean, Amazon is doing, I think, pretty well with its  Prime, and I look at it, and I don't know how they can afford to send me  stuff in two days sometimes.  I know they have preset stuff, but it's, you  know, I don't know.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND THE WALL STREET JOURNAL  ASSISTANT  EDITOR:  Surge pricing.  You know, people whine about it with Uber, but I  guess it's catching on on other places.  It seems like you have a lot of  highly-motivated buyers at that time of year so I would think they'd  probably be willing to eat the cost if being guaranteed December 24th  delivery.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But it also depends on what we're going to hear in the tax  package, right?  If they're going to be paying a border adjustment tax -</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It is really going to hurt the retailers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They may not want to eat anything.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Remember, though, your corporate rate comes down.  It's covering  all goods.  It's just a shifting, right?  I mean, I understand they've  going to do some work on selling the border adjustment tax but you're  talking about a much lower rate.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll talk about this.</p><p> Coming up, will the NFL head to China.  New England Patriots quarterback  says his dream is to play a game in the East Asian nation, back in a  minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, the NBA Finals just ended a week ago but several  teams are already looking to next season.  Jared Max with the story, now.   Jared, good morning.</p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SPORTSCASTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  The  NBA's next crop of talent will be picked Thursday.  NBA Draft at Barkley  Center in Brooklyn, New York, for the second year in a row, the first pick  belongs to the Philadelphia 76ers, who yesterday, finalized to trade with  the Boston Celtics to acquire the first selection and the right to pick 19- year-old point guard Markelle Fultz out of the University of Washington.   Fultz worked out for the 6ers yesterday hours before the team completed its  trade with Boston to get the number one overall pick a second straight  season.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BRYAN COLANGELO, PHILADELPHIA 76ERS PRESIDENT:  There's a history of draft  picks that you can't study with a deep dive and no one understand that the  odds are in your favor at number one more so than in any other position in  the draft that player may - the player chosen may end up being a franchise- level player.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MAX:  To land the number one overall selection, 6ers G.M. and President of  basketball operations, Bryan Colangelo also parted ways with a second first  round pick to Boston that allowed to be next year or 2019.  So, the draft  order, it's Philadelphia first followed by the L.A. Lakers, then the Boston  Celtics, the Phoenix Suns, fourth, as Sacramento Kings get the fifth  selection, Thursday.  In the 12 1/2 years that Dan Gilbert has owned the  Cleveland Cavaliers, no general manager has received a contract extension,  not one.  David Griffin, no different.  Unable to reach agreement on a new  deal, Griffin mutually agreed to part ways with the Cavaliers.  Yesterday,  after three seasons on the job, three trips to the NBA Finals, one  championship.  Griffin said it's not the right fit for him anymore and  Cleveland.  </p><p> LeBron James tweeted support.  He says, \"If no one appreciated you, Griff,  I did.  And hopefully, all the people of Cleveland!  Thanks for what you  did for the team for three years!  We got us one.</p><p> As we told yesterday, the Cavs are set to be pursuing a trade that could  land them point guard Paul George from the Indiana Pacers.  And the Cavs  are also reportedly working on a possible multi-team trade to get Jimmy  Butler from the Chicago Bulls.  But such a trade would likely mean parting  ways with a star like Kevin Love.  </p><p> What a superstar quarterback Tom Brady doing these days?  Oh, just hanging  out in the Great Wall of China.  The Patriot Super Bowl-winning quarterback  spent Father's Day throwing a football to his son at the Great Wall.  The  Brady bunch in China is part of a promotional tour for his Under Armour  TB12 Recovery Sleepwear.  Brady said that it is his dream to play an NFL  game in China.  Victory for the Washington Red Skins and freedom of speech.   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled yesterday that a 71-year-old trademark law  that bars offensive language is an infringement of rights to free speech.   This came from a case involving an Asian-American rock band that fought the  trademark.  Its name, The Slants.  Now, yesterday's case figures to serve  as legal precedent for the Red Skins to be able to keep their name.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I was surprised at that and happy to see that.  Jared,  great stuff.  Thank you so much, Jared Max.  Still to come, a new twist for  check fillet.  The company unveiling its gluten-free bun next hour on  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  What does tell us?

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Tuesday, June 20th.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> The push to get tax reform and health care done continues.  House Speaker  Paul Ryan set to lay out his tax reform plan later this afternoon.</p><p> The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that the Senate is planning to vote  on repealing and replacing Obamacare next week.  Senate minority leader  Chuck Schumer ramped up his attack on Republicans.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER:  Why are our Republican  colleagues rushing through a bill in the dark of night?  I will tell you  why.   They don't want you Mr. and Mrs. American to know about this bill.   They don't want you to see that it cuts health care for millions.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The battle on Capitol Hill and whether lawmakers will give up  their August recess, still ahead.</p><p> Meanwhile the tour company that brought American student Otto Warmbier to  North Korea says it's halting those tour trips.  It says a tragedy like  this should never be repeated.</p><p> It is technically not even summer yet but the southwest is facing a  dangerous heat wave.  Temperatures are expected to hit triple digits today.   It is forcing American airlines to cancel more than a dozen flights this  morning.  We've got the latest.</p><p> And a massive cell phone outage across the country -- the details on what  caused it coming up.</p><p>Twitter getting some star power in a new ad -- Grammy winner Chance the  Rapper takes role highlighting how users can interact with their favorite  celebrities on the2 social media service.</p><p> Plus how color affects home sales -- the new details on which pain colors  are best and worst when trying to sell your home.</p><p> Futures showing the markets will open higher this morning.  We are  expecting that the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 extend the record-setting  performance yesterday.  Both are coming off a record close yesterday.  And  as you see there are gains to be had.</p><p>Dow Industrials expected to be up about 10 points this morning.  This is  fractional, of course, and anything can change in the next two hours.</p><p> In Europe the major averages are mostly higher this morning.  The indices  look good although well off of highs of the morning.  In fact, the CAC 40  is now up about a quarter of a percent.  They have given up gains.</p><p> And I believe that stocks are giving up some gains this morning because oil  prices are worsening.  Oil prices are down about 2 percent.  Take a look at  oil sliding and as oil has worsened this morning that has certainly taken a  bite out of some of the gains in equities.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it financial analyst Heather Zumarraga is here, \"Wall Street Journal\"  assistant editorial page editor James Freeman is here, and the London  Center for Policy Research vice president, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer  is here as well.  Good morning.</p><p> LT. COL. TONY SHAFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p> HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good morning.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Thank you for having us.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Lots to talk about today.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.  We'll see if the markets continue making all-time highs  this week.  Health care is in focus.  Paul Ryan is set to speak at noon  today to see if we can get that passed as well as tax reform and that's big  for the markets.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And people will want to hear what he has to say about tax  reform.  But his plan, James Freeman, is different than what the President  has been talking about.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  That's right.  The President is just talking about that low  corporate rate.  Paul Ryan has the border adjustment plan and they need a  new name for that.  But basically what he's talking about, the economics  are good which is you want to tax consumption instead of working  investment.  That's what Ryan is trying to do.  But he's got a sales job  and if he can't persuade other members of congress this is the way to go he  should just -- </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Republicans in the Senate just don't want to hear it.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  He hasn't found a lot of takers.  So maybe he just needs to  focus on cutting rates.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, I think the bottom line is anything they do right now has  been in my judgment not positive to the President's overall message.  It  seems to me that they always find some other way to go anytime they  actually try to do something.  And this is where it's frustrating to me as  someone who just observes.  They don't seem to be actually sitting down and  talking about how to meet on achieving something, or even talking pass this  thing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The leadership does say that they are having meetings very  often, weekly about tax reform and that they are moving forward on this  despite what you're seeing in the press.  But we will see about that.   We're going to talk about that coming up.</p><p> Joining the conversation coming up now is Fox News military analyst General  Jack Keane is with us.  Harvard Law professor emeritus, defense attorney  and author of \"Electile Dysfunction: A Guide for Unaroused Voters\" Alan  Dershowitz is here -- good name for his book.  Former Reagan campaign  adviser Ed Rollins is here as well.  We've got a big program ahead so don't  miss a moment of it.  </p><p> And we kick it off this hour right now with our top story.  The  administration pushing the President's agenda with only weeks left on the  legislative calendar for the fiscal year.  Counsel to the President,  Kellyanne Conway told me yesterday reform is on the way.  Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT:  The President is forging  ahead.  He's in close contact with Leader McConnell on the health care  reform.  You know, Obamacare has been a log (inaudible) for seven years.   These sinking battleships turn slowly and they've got part one through the  House.  Now the Senate will do its work.  Leader McConnell told you that he  would like it to be by July 4th -- that's around the corner.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> CONWAY:  Tax reform later this year.  They are moving towards  infrastructure, towards border security, more of that.  The military has  gotten new funding.  So things are happening.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, calls for lawmakers to work through their month-long  August recess to get both health care and tax reform done are increasing.</p><p> Joining me right now is Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn.  Congresswoman --  good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Good to see you.  Sure.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think about the agenda?  How confident are you that  you and your colleagues can get tax reform and the health care over the  finish line this year?</p><p> BLACKBURN:  I agree that you're going to see the Senate take a vote before  July 4th.  And the people are thrilled with that.  They want to be free and  independent of the Affordable Care Act.  So I think it's very timely.</p><p> I think a final bill, a final version will be on the President's desk  before August 1st.  And that's the goal.  We should be hitting that goal  and then it is getting the push together to get tax reform over the finish  line.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There was a report yesterday that lawmakers said that they are  considering not going on the August recess in order to get the work done if  in fact it doesn't get done by then.  Are you for that?  Was that an actual  conversation piece in Congress?</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Yes.  Maria -- there are plenty of conversations about do we  stay in during August.  Many individuals want to get out there.  I agree.   Get out there, do our meetings and rotary clubs and civic clubs and chamber  coffees, visit with our constituents.  And we appreciate having that time.</p><p> But there is also the argument to be made that we have a heavy lift.  We  have a once in a lifetime opportunity to actually take care of  deregulating, lowering taxes, getting some this environment for jobs growth  to take place in place.</p><p> Your interview with Secretary Ross spoke specifically to that.  How do we  utilize new technologies?  How do we make the environment right for private  sector jobs growth to take place?  And that is less litigation, less  taxation to get that job creation.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Congresswoman -- James Freeman of the \"Wall Street Journal\".</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Yes -- James.</p><p> FREEMAN:  The one -- I have a tax question for you but real quick.  I  noticed the White House announcing last night that Michael (inaudible) is  headed to the Commerce Department.  You seem to be losing one of the big  chip staffers on Capitol Hill.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  And we are pleased with it for him.  And look forward to all  good things -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Ok. </p><p> BLACKBURN:  -- for him.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  Now, as far as the tax cut, tell us about the conversation  around how big this cut can be.  Because there is some sentiment on the  Hill that you have to stick CBO rules, a 10-year budget window, all of that  boring Beltway stuff.  But what it means is it limits how much you can cut  taxes.  Some people are saying let's make it a 30-year window.  It means we  can have a big, big tax cut.  Where do you stand on that?</p><p> BLACKBURN:  I think what you're going to see Chairman Brady do is get as  much as he can.  I like the way this administration works things out and  says let's do more with less.  So if you put that into how you work tax  reductions into a reconciliation bill, what you're going to see the Speaker  and the Chairman do is to move forward with how much they can lower those  marginal rates.</p><p> They're looking right now at 35 percent, 25 percent and 10 percent.  Those  are worthy goals.  Then going to the business side, how low can you get  that corporate rate?  Can you deal with repatriation on that?</p><p> I think that the BAT tax is going to be very, very difficult in my district  with the auto manufacturing, with large retailers like Dollar General and  Tractor supply.  Kirkland's headquartered here.  That is not a popular tax.  </p><p> And I don't see -- I know the Speaker's for it -- but I don't see the  support from my constituents or from my colleagues for that tax.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Go ahead.</p><p> FREEMAN:  So maybe just cut the rate down to 15 percent as the President  has suggested.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  I think that that is something that is workable.  And James --  you know, if we do that, we're still going to be the biggest cut tax since  the Reagan '86 tax cut.  And let's take as much as we can get this year and  then let's come back next year and take some more. </p><p> Taxes are too high.  Regulation is too high.  Litigation is too prolific.   So let's get those under control so that jobs growth could take place.  I  talk to small business manufacturers that work in the Just in Time supply  chain for the auto industry every single week and they will tell you, they  will point to you specifically how that BAT tax would adversely impact them  and thereby the price of an auto.</p><p>  BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And the price of an auto I heard would go up $2,000 --  $3,000 even if you have that border adjustment tax, the BAT as you refer to  it.</p><p> So what I hear you saying, Congresswoman -- and I want to move to the  Georgia election in a second -- but you would be willing then to vote on no  new revenue then.  You just cut taxes and then deal, if you need to raise  revenue next year or the next year, you would be willing to vote with just  lowering the corporate rate as low as you can get it without raising  revenue from something at the border -- a tax at the border?  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  Yes.  I think if you lower those rates and see where that gets  you, you don't have to do everything with one stroke of the pen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The President is tweeting this morning on Georgia's special  election as voters head to the polls.  Here is what he said, Congresswoman,  \"Karen Handel for Congress.  She will fight for lower taxes, great  healthcare, strong security and a hard worker who will never give up.  Vote  today.\"  This as a new political ad is stirring up controversy.  Watch  this.  I want to get your reaction -- Congresswoman.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Sure.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Now the unhinged left is endorsing and applauding  shooting Republicans.  When will it stop?  It won't if Jon Ossoff wins on  Tuesday because the same unhinged leftist cheering last week's shooting are  all backing Jon Ossoff.  And if he wins they win.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That ad was paid for by a PAC supporting Republican  candidate Karen Handel.  It's now receiving backlash for showing images of  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise after he was shot last week.</p><p> A spokesperson for Handel condemned the ad saying, \"For any group to use  the shootings this week for political or personal benefit is shameful.   This group should be ashamed.\"</p><p> What's your take?  Nearly $50 million have been raised in this election --  the most expensive House race in U.S. history -- Congresswoman.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  I think the group that put the ad up should be ashamed.  I  think anyone who is inciting violence or encouraging violence or  encouraging hateful rhetoric should stop it.</p><p> People want to see us work together, whether they're a Democrat, a  Republican an Independent.  I have individuals in my office as I did  yesterday who said we just want to see you get some things done. </p><p> Let's get the Affordable Care Act off the books.  Let's get tax reform  done.  Let's secure the border.  Let's get this infrastructure bill going.   That is what they are wanting to see, and ads like that are not helpful to  the process.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we agree.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  Hateful rhetoric isn't helpful to the process.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Congresswoman -- this is Tony Shaffer with the London Center for  Policy Research.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Yes, Tony.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Good morning, ma'am.</p><p> With all due respect, I know what you're saying about cooperating but it  doesn't seem that Nancy Pelosi and colleagues on the left are actually  trying to ratchet this down.  And it's not all of them.  I mean I talked to  Tulsi Gabbard and Tulsi I think recognizes what's going on but how do you  deal with folks who just don't want to engage in that dialogue.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean look what Chuck Schumer just said that you're doing the  health care deal in the dark of night, excuse me, but wasn't that the way  they did Obamacare?  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  You know, what happened with Obamacare was a bill that was  written in the House -- in the White House and then brought over.  Nobody  knew what was in it and Miss Pelosi said so.  What you see now is a team  working together off the House bill which is a public document.</p><p> But Tony, back to your question on this, I think what we have to do is just  continue to push against this and encourage our colleagues to keep the  conversation on the policies and to move away from this politics of  personal attack and destruction.  The fact that you have so many members of  congress who are receiving death threats, personal harm threats coming into  their steps, to their families, this is completely unacceptable.</p><p> And they need to join together in saying we are not going to tolerate this  type of rhetoric.  We are well served by robust political debate.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you make all great points Congresswoman.  It's great to  see you.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  Good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All our love to Steve Scalise. </p><p> We will be right back.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Excessive heat warnings in effect across the southwest today while  thunderstorm watches are in effect for 11 states on the East Coast.</p><p>Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean breaks it all down for us.   What's the latest we can expect across the country today?  Janice -- good  morning.</p><p> JANICE DEAN, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  A lot of stories -- Maria, we are working  on.</p><p> Let's take a look at it across the northeast.  Hundreds of reports of  severe weather including a tornado report just outside the D.C. area.  No  reports of any injuries but we've got a lot of reports of destruction.</p><p> And we have a tropical cyclone potential in the next 12 to 24 hours  expecting it to get a name and make landfall possibly Thursday, Friday  along the Gulf Coast.  We have tropical storm watches and warnings in  place.  </p><p> This is going to be a rainmaker along the Gulf Coast; six to eight even 12  inches of rainfall, so watching this.  The tropics already heating up.</p><p> And then speaking of heat, across the southwest, heat advisories are posted  where we have dangerous conditions.  Temperatures well over 100 degrees and  we are going to be seeing temperatures close to 120 in Phoenix, Arizona.   Look at the temperatures here over the next several days.</p><p> Looking at Phoenix, they've actually canceled flights.  The smaller  aircraft have a hard time taking off in heat and when we look at the all- time hottest, we go back to 1990, 122 degrees; 1990 here as well, 120;  we're going to be flirting with 119, 120 degrees across Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p> So those big stories we are following today in the Fox News Extreme Weather  Center.  Maria -- back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Yes, that is something.  Ok.  Janice -- thank you.   Janice Dean.</p><p> Meanwhile a blood drive is being held today on Capitol Hill for  Representative Steve Scalise. </p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details there -- Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- Maria.</p><p> Patrick McHenry, the House chief deputy majority whip is hosting that blood  drive for Scalise, a close friend, and other victims of last week's  shooting.  That's according to a notice obtained by Politico.</p><p> So Scalise, he was shot during a congressional baseball practice last  Wednesday has been upgraded, we should say, to serious condition from  critical.  The Louisiana congressman has had several surgeries at MedStar  Washington Hospital.  That blood drive which will be held again on Thursday  is also for U.S. Capitol police special agent Crystal Griner and lobbyist  Matt Mika.</p><p> Well, multiple sources report that several major mobile service providers  are experiencing cellphone service outages this morning.  Companies  (inaudible) reportedly include AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon.  So far  we don't have a reason for these outages but according to the site Down  Detector, Sprint and Verizon had the largest outage areas on the East Coast  and in the state of California.</p><p> And then Chick-Fil-A is the latest fast food chain to offer gluten-free  food.  But there's a catch.  So it's $1.15, you can order your gluten-free  bun.  But you have to make your own sandwich.  Chick-Fil-A says its  kitchens are not gluten-free and that's the only way that they can keep it  safe.  So, you know, it's healthier, I guess but make your own food --  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Joining the wave of others who are going gluten- free.  We'll check it out.   Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p> Coming up next, tensions soaring with North Korea now after the death of an  American student held hostage by the Kim Jong-Un regime for 17 months.   President Trump's tough message to North Korea, next.</p><p> And then information on nearly 200 million voters exposed by the Republican  National Committee.  How a contractor accidentally reveals the names,  birthdays, phone numbers online.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just wanted to pass on  word that Otto Warmbier has just passed away.  He spent a year and a half  in North Korea.  A lot of bad things happened.  That's a brutal regime.   And we will be able to handle it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was President Trump speaking at the White House yesterday  following the death of Otto Warmbier.  The American student died just days  after returning home following 17 months of imprisonment in North Korea.</p><p> Joining me right now is Fox News military analyst, General Jack Keane.   General -- it's good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> GEN. JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, good to see you -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's such a horrible and just a terrible story.  The U.S. is  demanding the release now of three other Americans currently being held in  North Korea.</p><p> Your reaction to Otto Warmbier passing away now after being tortured  obviously, coming home in a vegetative state.  </p><p> KEANE:  Well, there's no doubt that the North Koreans are responsible for  murdering Otto, that's for sure and that heartfelt message that (inaudible)  provided yesterday was rally quite extraordinary and revealing in a sense  they talked about him being tortured.  Their doctors obviously have some  sense of what's happening and autopsy will confirm what actually happened.</p><p> But something went wrong here for the North Koreans because, you know,  Maria -- they imprison, torture, kill and starve their own people.  What  they do with Americans is they take them hostage and they use them as  bargaining chips until some prominent American comes forward and is willing  to negotiate with them like a Bill Clinton or a Bill Richardson.  </p><p> So what happened here?  How did this take place?  They lost a leverage that  they use hostages for to establish some legitimacy for the regime.  And I  think the other three certainly, the President's doing the right thing in  demanding their release.</p><p> I think what this will do for us here is strengthen our resolve, our  determination our commitment to deal with this North Korean problem once  and for all.</p><p> I believe the President is already there but I think will just add to his  determination to deal with it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Should the U.S. be responding to this?  What should the U.S. do  at this point?  And basically just to be clear.  What you're saying is they  had him imprisoned, they were obviously drugging him when they realized  that he was in a vegetative state, they said ok, we're losing our leverage  we can send him home?</p><p> KEANE:  Yes.  They didn't want him to die there.  That's for sure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> KEANE:  And it's just -- it's out of the pattern of what they normally do.   We don't know the facts yet -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Should the U.S. do anything about this -- General?</p><p> KEANE:  We're not going to -- we're not going to take any immediate action  with North Korea.  What we have done is we have -- we have ladled the  football to China to see if they can use economic pressure on North Korea  to denuclearize.  That will take some time.  </p><p> Most of us looking at that and I'm sure the administration also has a  healthy dose of skepticism about whether China is genuinely sincere about  doing this.  We'll have to see and we'll have to wait to see that happen.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  I think at some point, here's where I think we're going to wind up.   China is not going to do it.  We're going to have to really get tough with  North Korea on sanctions.</p><p> I think we'll probably have to provide some sanctions against China for the  first time.  I think we have to have a get tough policy with China.  And  when it comes to the Asia Pacific and what they're doing in terms of  trampling our interests and also our allies' interests.</p><p> I think we're kind of on a collision course with North Korea and also with  China.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's important.  That's going to be an important day  when in fact the U.S. makes a decision to put sanctions against China as  well.</p><p> Let me switch gears and get your take on this latest surrounding the USS  Fitzgerald's collision with a container ship.  That happened this weekend  off the coast of Japan.  And investigators are looking into several aspects  of this crash including why it took the crew of the civilian vessel almost  an hour to report the incident.  How does this happen -- General?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, I don't know what they were doing on board, what kind of  emergency situation they may have had.  They have very small crews on that  ship but you know, making a radio call isn't a big deal.  And certainly our  war ship had their hands full -- the things that were knocked out were the  berthing areas for the crew.  The radio communication was knocked out and  also interesting, the captain's quarters was sitting on top of all of that.</p><p> So it is understandable our crew was fighting for their lives and trying to  make sure -- you have a warship and it demonstrates, you know, the  instruments of war like a warship is dangerous in peace time as it is in  war.</p><p> Sitting on that ship as we know, not on that commercial ship, sitting on  that warship is incredible amount of missiles and explosive munitions.  And  if a fire broke out on that ship that thing could really have turned into  an incredible tragedy.  So fortunate that that crew was as brave as they  are, battled that situation and took control of it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, any other issues that will come as a result of this?   Because people are scratching their heads saying how does this happen?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, the Navy -- the Navy is not saying it publicly but the Navy  is not going to stand for our ship at sea not being able to evade an  oncoming ship if the oncoming ship made an unexpected U-turn like it did.   The Navy has navigational devices.  It has human beings that are alert and  paying attention.  And something's failed on that ship that we did not take  evasive action.</p><p> The Navy will never excuse any of its vessels being hit by another vessel  regardless of who was at fault.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p> KEANE:  The Navy will hold that crew accountable for being able to evade  that ship.  That's the fact of it.  They'll get to what caused it all but  at the end of the day they're going to hold them accountable for it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right. We'll be watching that.  General -- always a  pleasure.  Thanks so much.</p><p> KEANE:  Good talking to you -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And to you -- General Jack Keane joining us there.</p><p> Coming up, a new weapon in the Russian election meddling probe.  Special  counsel Robert Mueller hires a big name to help move forward with this  investigation. </p><p> And then Google wants to help you find a new job.  How the technology giant  is using AI to connect people with the perfect career.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is a happy  Tuesday, Tuesday, June 20th.  Your top stories right now 7:30 A.M. on the  East Coast.</p><p> A busy week at the White House.  President Trump set to meet with president  of the Ukraine this afternoon.  The meeting coming as the White House is  facing new headwinds in the Russia probe Special Counsel Robert Mueller  expanding his team including one man who is best known for his ability to  flip witnesses.  What it means for the president, coming up.</p><p> Hacking concerns hit the RNC.  The information of nearly 200 million voters  in the Republican National Committee database, exposed by a GOP data  analytics firm.  The massive hack you need to know about.</p><p> And LinkedIn facing new competition from Google.  The technology giant's  plan to help you find your next job.  All coming up.</p><p> Plus it is Crosby's steals a chance?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How about a new song with real instruments?</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How Twitter is hoping its new ad campaign will help keep the  momentum from the Trump bump.  Twitter shares are up today.</p><p> Plus, the perfect color could have you seeing more green when you want to  sell your house.  Why picking a certain paint color could actually earn you  big bucks when you sell your home.  We'll tell you about it.</p><p> Futures meanwhile showing the markets will be mixed today at the open.  The  Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are coming off of a record close yesterday.  But oil  prices have been selling off and that has cut into some of the gains this  morning.  Now we expect a mixed opening for broader averages.  The Dow  industrials are down one.  The NASDAQ are up 12 points.</p><p> In Europe, the major indices have also lost some momentum this morning.   The FT 100 is now in negative territory down five points.  The CAC quarante  is well off of the highs.  It's up a quarter of a percent and the DAX index  is also higher although well off a big ties as well.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly lower meanwhile with the exception  of Japan.  The Nikkei average finished up almost one percent.</p><p> And take a look at oil prices.  One of the certainly market stories down  two percent right now, on oil, and as oil prices have slide, stocks have  also given up some gains.</p><p> Well, Special Counsel Robert Mueller adding a new weapon to his Russia  probe.  Veteran federal prosecutor and former Department of Justice fraud  division chief Andrew Weissmann has joined the team.  Weissmann is the man  who has been known for his ability to flip witnesses in his work on  organized crime, and in cases like Enron </p><p> Joining us right now defense attorney author and Harvard law professor  Emeritus, Alan Dershowitz.  Alan, good to see you.</p><p> ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS:  Nice to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is this a move that should concern the president bringing  Weissmann on?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Sure.  We're seeing a game of three dimensional chess.   Mueller is sending a very powerful message to the White House.  We have a  flipper.  You have some potential flipees out there, especially Flynn.   Flynn's lawyer are now sending a message to the White House as well.  We  may flip.  We're not going to allow our client to go to jail.  You have a  choice.  If you don't wanted to flip, you have the option of pardoning him.   If you pardon him, he doesn't flip.  If you don't pardon him, he flips.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So he's cooperating with the special prosecutor.  Mike Flynn.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Well, what I think is happening is his lawyer announced  publicly, which is very odd.  We have a story to tell.  Please give us  immunity.  I think it may be bluff.  We're not sure he has great story to  tell but he's certainly, by that public message, trying to get the  attention of the oval office.  Trying to get the president to say, you can  stop all this by pardoning Flynn.  Now pardoning Flynn would be a political  cost.  Very heavy cost for the president.</p><p> So the stakes have gone up all over the place.  This is the way tough  defense attorneys and tough prosecutors go after each other and play the  game.  I have seen this game.  I have participated in it.  And I know how  rough and tumble it can become.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  It sounds, James.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Professor, I want to you ask you about Andrew Weissmann, Clinton  donor also has been sharply criticized by a newspaper that was owned by  Jared Kushner.  He's now apparently investigating Jared Kushner.</p><p> And this is in terms of political donors, this is a patter so far in the  Mueller team.  He's hiring a number of people who've donated, the  democrats.  Is it -- is it that hard to find good lawyers who are not  political activists?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Well, lawyers are like everybody else.  I contribute.  I  contributed to Hillary Clinton's campaign.  I would not let it affect my  judgment.  I defended republicans and democrats alike.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you do that though?  You gave money.  I mean, how do you  not make sure that it doesn't affect your judgment?  That's hard.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Well, look at me now.  I gave money to Clinton and I'm no  making arguments that helped the man I voted against because I believe in  principle.  Now, Weissmann is a very tough prosecutor.  If I were the  president, I'd be more worried about his experience and his record of being  a very tough prosecutor and a few bucks being contributed to the democrats.   Having said that, I think that probably should have look for people who  didn't make political contributions.  Much the way the president  disqualified probably one of the most qualified persons to be the head of  the FBI and that is Senator Lieberman because he had been a politician.   The president wanted to make sure that whoever it was, was outside of  politics.</p><p> So I think the seize is white principle that you're going to engage in a  political prosecution and this is a political prosecution, you better not  give the other side the opportunity to make arguments that it's been  politicized.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think about all of this focused on this Russian  meddling probe?  I understand the Russian meddling probe, but to attach  Trump to it, when we know that there's absolutely no evidence, whatsoever  of collusion and still going on about this, I mean, how much does this cost  taxpayers?  Hundred million or more than that?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  And there's nothing -- I don't know.  But there's nothing  criminal about it.  This ought to be investigated by an independent  commission looking into the relationship between Russia and political  elections on both sides moving forward.  Then there ought to be a  congressional investigation to see maybe we need to change the law to  prevent the president from firing the director of the FBI.</p><p> The one place they should not be is in front of a grand jury.  There is  nothing criminal here.  And the grand jury is secret behind closed doors.   It's causing us a fortune.  We're learning nothing.  Nothing will come of  it.  This idea that you can turn a constitutionally protected act, the  firing the director into a crime because it had a corrupt motive.</p><p> You should read my emails.  I'm accused every day of having a corrupt  motive.  Why am I on Fox talking about Donald Trump?  Is he paying me?  Am  I auditioning to become his lawyer?  Do I want to be a judge?  Am I  expecting a favor?  My motives are being questioned all over the place.   Politicians questioned each other's motives.  The idea of corrupt motive  being the criteria distinguishing a constitutionally protected act from a  felony is so dangerous to civil liberties that every -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, is there going to be any -- is there going to be any  accountability for the dems obstructing the agenda that America voted for  last year?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Well, the republicans did the very same thing to Bill Clinton.   When they impeached him and what they tried to do to Barack Obama.  Look,  packs on both their -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the accountability happened because they got voted  out of office, right?  So will the dems lose seats as a result of this in  '18?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  We'll see today in Georgia.  We'll see in other places.  We  don't know.  This is a referendum, perhaps.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, back onto my pointing for a second.  Because that's the  most real element I've seen so far in any legal jeopardy.  Simply because  Mike is going to talk doesn't mean he's flipping.  This is one of those  things where I think people are reading far too much in a way sinister  motive here.  You and I both know, Alan, that you go in front of congress,  you go in front of these groups, anything you say can eventually be turned  against you in some form.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  He's looking for immunity.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Because you don't want to be say anything.  It gives you later.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  But I would never ever ask for immunity publicly.  I would go  quietly to the prosecutor and say, here's my story.  But his lawyers are  very smart.  Why is he asking for immunity publicly?  Because he's sending  a message to the president of the United States.  You want me not to get  immunity?  Pardon me.  Pardon me.  Pardon my client.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Last thing.  We talked about how there's no evidence yet of  collusion.  It seems interesting as you watch Mueller build his team and  assign people the different tasks.  He seems to be assigning them largely  to things other than looking for evidence of collusion.  Does that mean  he's already decided there's nothing there?</p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  I don't think there's anything that criminally on collusion.   What he's looking for is to make a case against Flynn, for example, failure  to list some of these things then go to Flynn and say, you want to go to  jail?  You have a family.  There's a way out of this.  Weissmann is an  expert of that.  He has flipped better witnesses and stronger witnesses  then Flynn that's the goal prosecutor's.</p><p> I once debated Rudy Giuliani in my class and he put a bunch of dominos up  on the blackboard and he said, if I ever have to bring somebody to trial, I  have failed.  My goal is to flip the first guy on the guy, on the third  guy, ultimately get them all flipped and finally go after the big guy on  the top and the evidence is so overwhelming he'll plead guilty.  That's the  way prosecutors operate.  And defense attorneys operate by using that to  their advantage and trying to make sure their client is the one who's  giving to get out of jail free ticket and they can turn -- the first rule  in America is that you're going to commit a crime always committed with  somebody more important than you are.  So you can flip on them and make it  flip on you.  That's my advice to all persons of criminals out there.   Don't commit crimes.  But if you're going to do it, do it with someone more  important.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Alan, great insights as always from you.  Thanks so much.   Alan Dershowitz there.</p><p> Coming up, data for nearly 200 million voters have been exposed.  How a  contractor for the republican national committee accidentally posted the  information online.</p><p> And then the right colored walls can earn you more green.  A surprising new  study reveals what specific paint color can help boost a home selling  price.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Republican Party data of nearly 200 million  voters has been exposed online.  Cheryl Casone with all the details now.   Cheryl, over to you.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  A cyber security analyst  working for the RNC discovered that the information was left unsecured on  an online database for 12 days before it was taken down.  The data was  stolen in an Amazon cloud account used by a contractor that work for the  RNC.  The information was nearly on every U.S. voter.  It include names,  date of birth, home addresses.  The RNC says it's working with that  contractor padding that conclusion of an investigation in the security.</p><p> Well, Google can now help you find a job.  The search engine has launched a  new job search feature on its search result pages.  You can now search for  jobs across all major online job words.  It covers LinkedIn, Monster,  Career Builder, Facebook and a lot more.  Google is also going to include  job listings that finds on a company specific homepage.  Basically, it's  going to be one stop shopping for job seekers of all trades.</p><p> And then finally this.  The color that you paint the inside of your home  could affect its value.  Zillow conducted an analysis and more than 32,000  sold homes -- here's example.  A blue bathroom can increase the home's  price by $5,400.  A blue dining room can fetch an extra 2,000.  But some  color hurt you.  Last year, yellow was a hot color, it increased sales  values.  This year, a yellow kitchen, for example, will hurt you by about  $800.</p><p> And then, Maria, some colors just hurt you every year.  Terracotta, a terra  no-no, do not -- it's like orange brown.  No.  Don't do it.  If you have  terracotta walls, you're going to lose more than $2,000, versus other  homes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's amazing that color does that.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, Twitter turns to TV to maintain its Trump bump.  We  will take a look of whether the new ad campaign is enough to more and more  users and how will they monetize it.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Twitter announcing a new ad campaign with Chance  the Rapper, and what he should play at his shows.  Tracee Carrasco with the  details now.  Tracee, good morning.</p><p> TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Now, this is the  first-ever TV ad for Twitter, as you said Chance the Rapper, now take a  look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARRASCO:  The ad shows Chance asking fans via Twitter for a song request  for his upcoming concert, his tweet sets off a wide range of responses not  all positive, as people tweet back and debate selections.  Music legend  David Crosby even trolls the rapper by tweeting, how about any song with  real instruments?  Now, the new campaign is the next step in Twitter's  ongoing attempt to better explain to consumers what Twitter is and why it's  valuable to spend time on the site.</p><p> The ad push hope to show people how Twitter is unique compared with other  social media sites.  Now Twitter reported its average monthly user rose six  percent in the first quarter to 328 million.  It was the largest quarterly  increase since 2015.  And according to company, it is partly due to \"new  and resurrected users following more news and political accounts in U.S.\"</p><p> Now, although the company didn't specifically mention President Trump, his  frequent tweeting has gotten worldwide attention.  For Twitter, they want  to show they're not just news, they're entertainment, they're sports,  they're everything.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a good arguments we made that it does trigger conversation  and that you have back-and-forth debate.  I like the fact that Crosby was  in it answering about the instruments.  That's cute.</p><p> CARRASCO:  Yes.  Maybe a collaboration.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  And Chance the Rapper says the gentleman here, it's their  favorite musician.</p><p> SHAFFER:  I was on Yo! MTV Raps left.  One of these few things, I have  friends who literally still can't use Twitter.  They can't figure it out.   And to me, it's kind of like riding a bike.  Once you figure it out, you  figure it out and you can use it.  So, do you think there's a part of it  now people starting to figure out how to use this more?  Because I have  friends saying, I just don't get it.  How do I get my message out?  So, do  you have any sense of where this is going regarding people just probably  getting smart how to use it?</p><p> CARRASCO:  I think so.  I think we're seeing so many -- you know, we can't  go a day without saying President Trump is tweeting this, so and so is  tweeting this, so I think people are now saying well, I want to know what  Twitter is all about.  I'm going to figure out how to use it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the company has to monetize it somehow.</p><p> That's helping them make money.  This ad, what's that going to do for  monetization?</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think investors have kind of been wondering before and  especially through this Trump era, why are you not making more money off  this fact that the U.S. president has put you at the center of the  universe, political discussion, debate, really all news, and maybe this is  a way to try and figure it out.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  And this is millennials also.  I think if millennials don't  follow as much D.C. politics as maybe they should than this is another way  to reach out to them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I thought it was really interesting when Jack Dorsey was  asked, the CEO of Twitter.  What do you think about the president tweeting  all the time on your service?  He goes, oh, it's complicated.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Probably don't want to monetize it.</p><p> FREEMAN:  This is obviously a huge gift to them.  But being at Silicon  Valley, given the political sensibility there, I think they have to pretend  that this is kind of a mixed story for them.  But, yes.  It's not really -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a huge break for them.</p><p> CARRASCO:  It's been great for them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sure it has.  Tracee, great.  Thank you so much.  Tracee  Carrasco there.</p><p> Still ahead, UPS giving itself a present this Christmas.  Why the shipping  giant is planning to charge you more for holiday deliveries and they've  decided this now.  Six months in advance, next hour with \"Mornings with  Maria.\"  Back in a minute.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us.  It is Tuesday, June 20th.  Here are  your top stories 8:00 A.M. on the East Coast.</p><p> Pushing forward on reforms.  Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell  reportedly hearing up for a health care vote next week.  House Speaker Paul  Ryan is laying out his tax reform plan this afternoon.  Commerce Secretary  Wilbur Ross weighed in on tariffs and taxes early on the program.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY:  Tariffs are nothing new to the  financing of the U.S. government.  But we've long passed that with the  advent of personal income tax then corporate tax.  So now, border  adjustable or some such thing is simply one way to fill up a portion of a  whole.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A closer look at the timeline and the tax plan coming up.</p><p> Meanwhile, the tour company that brought American student Otto Warmbier to  North Korea, it says it is not halting those tour trips.  It says the  tragedy like this should never be repeated.</p><p> A dangerous heat wave is hitting the southwest this morning.  Temperatures  expected to hit triple digits today.  It is forcing American Airlines to  cancel more than a dozen flights.  Airlines in chaos.</p><p> Plus, your holiday gifts could cost you more this year.  UPS is charging  extra fees during the busiest season for shipping.</p><p> And a solar eclipse headed to a post office near you.  The new stamp is out  today.  Take a look at that.</p><p> And oil driving market today.  Take a look at oil down about two percent,  two and two-thirds percent now.  This is the lowest of the morning.  Crude  is now just holding above $43 a barrel as oil has sold off this morning.   Stocks have given much of their earlier high.</p><p> Take a look Futures right now, indicating a mixed opening for the broader  averages.

Take a look at futures right now  indicating a mixed opening for the broader averages, Dow Industrials  squeaking out a gain of just two points right here.  S&amp;P 500 is unchanged  and the NASDAQ is up 15, all of the above, of off the highs of the morning.   And of course, this is after the Dow and S&amp;P reached record highs yesterday  at the close.</p><p> In Europe, the indices have also given up some of the momentum, the FT 100  is now negative by nine points.  The CAC quarante in Paris is up a quarter  of a percent off of the highs as is the DAX Index right now as well of 25  points there.  In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly lower with the  exception of Japan, Nikkei Average was up almost one percent.  But take a  look at oil prices driving better than two percent right now, 2 2/3  percent, that is really behind what's going on for stock prices this  morning.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it, financial analyst Heather Zumarraga is here, Wall Street Journal  Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman is here, and the London  Center for Policy Research Vice President Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaeffer  is here.  Great to see you.</p><p> TONY SCHAEFFER, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH VICE PRESIDENT: Thanks,  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Allan Dersowitch said some interesting things to say I thought.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Yes.   And we're still waiting for that collusion evidence.  He's talking about  the potential that maybe Michael Flynn will be forced to flip but what does  -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- stories that Michael Flynn has about the president.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, yes.  I think - this is one of the things too.  Because he  had a story doesn't mean it's a bad story.  I mean, everybody kind of  infers he's going to flip on the president.  Look, I think Mike Flynn  probably made some mistakes, we've talked about the Russian issue regarding  his conversations with the Russians, he had a deal with Turkey which has  been questioned and some issues with that, the whole issue of what he got  paid going to Moscow to meet with Putin via RT.</p><p> These are all things which I think are relevant in a way by the fact that  maybe he even didn't follow the rules but they don't add anything to the  larger narrative or issue regarding what exactly are we looking for  regarding this \"collusion.\" </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  Absolutely right.  We want to kick this out off of  this.  The Trump administration is pushing forward on the president's  agenda as the Senate GOP is planning on a health care vote next week.  Adam  Shapiro is at the White House right now with the very latest.  Adam, that  certainly keeps them on the timeline for '17.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Right.  It  would keep on the timeline, they have to do the health care stuff first  because of the rules of reconciliation in the 2017 budget resolution but  Mitch McConnell, the leader in the senate's office has said, pay attention  to what the leader had - to what the leader has said in regards to getting  this vote before the July 4th recess.  So the bill is being crafted and the  vote is expected next week but the Democrats are trying to slow down the  process in the Senate and then last night, Chuck Schumer went after Mitch  McConnell in an exchange about why are you doing this behind closed doors,  let's see what you're working on.  Here's what they talked about. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATOR:  Will it be available to us and the public  more than 10 hours before we have to vote for it? </p><p> MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATOR:  I think we'll ample opportunity to read  and amend the bill. </p><p> SCHUMER:  Will it be more than 10 hours -- </p><p> MCCONNELL:  I think we'll have ample opportunity to read and amend the  bill. </p><p> SCHUMER:  I rest my case. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  So the goal again for Republicans is to have this bill next week  debated no more than 20 hours in the Senate and then a vote before the  senators and all of Congress actually leave for the July 4th recess.  The  other issue, of course, is tax reform.  Once they have accomplished or  defeated the health care repeal and replace, they can then move on to a  budget resolution and then tax reform.  And today we're going to get a  major speech from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan on what he thinks is  important, not only in tax reform but why this moment when Republicans  control the White House and the House of Representatives and the Senate is  in the opportunity they can't afford to miss.  So that speech at 12:45 at  the National Association Of Manufacturers, will outline Speaker Ryan's  thoughts on tax reform.</p><p> We're not looking for too much debate on that, for instance, the border  adjustment tax, he hasn't officially said he is against it, there is no one  in the Senate who is for it but in the house, Republicans are still  supporting it and Paul Ryan was a big supporter of it originally.  We're  looking for guidance during this speech today on that. Maria? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Adam Shapiro, thank you very much.  Adam is at the White  House.  And I don't think he's letting it go, James Freeman.  I think Paul  Ryan still wants this border adjustment tax in there even though it gets  massive pushback from his colleagues. </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  And the economics makes sense, we are talking about how  most economists will tell you want a tax consumption instead of working  investment but he's got a lot of work to do on the sales end.  If he can't  persuade his colleagues, he's got to just focus on tax cuts.  You know,  we've in White House for five months, a person who is ready to sign a tax  cut, ready to sign health care reform, investors, voters had been saying,  to the legislature when are you going to do this stuff on his desk? </p><p>  I think, you know, maybe there is more optimism now that they get that  urgency on hill, we see the health care moving forward and I think whatever  deal he's able to work out in terms of Paul Ryan in the House, he's got to  do it too. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think that the markets would react well even if it's not  a broad tax reform plan and it's just tax cuts?</p><p> FREEMAN:  As long as it's - I think the biggest game changer is either -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Corporate tax.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- is really big cut in that corporate rate.  So, I think if you  tell markets and you make it clear that we're going to have a long-term  reform to grow the economy faster, I think people understand that it allows  to generate the growth that can pay more bills for the government.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  If you want to make it riveting and neutral but why are talking  about cutting spending, rolling spending back instead of the border  adjustment tax, the Senate Republicans are just not going to go for that.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Where are you going to get - where are you going to cut the  spending though, that's the issue.  I mean, most of the money is in the  entitlements.  They don't want to talk about cutting Social Security.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.  They're not going go after the -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this president is all about helping and boosting the  military.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  So, yes, they have to go -</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SHAFFER:  I mean, look, I just (INAUDIBLE) on a letter recently saying, we  need to look at a black.  The DOD spends a lot of money for global  infrastructure that we don't - we don't use.  So, there's a huge area we  could pick and look at.  Of course, the politics of that is certain people  don't want things cut in their district but that's always an issue.   Secondly, I think we've look at -- big ticket items need to be looked at  that he tweeted on the F-35, for goodness sake, the F-35 has been an issue  for a long time.  Much of the defense budget is tied up on that.  So, I  think you can look at offsets right now that would help reduce some of this  so you don't have to worry about tax increases but nobody seems to be want  to do this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is all the making of the sausage that they are supposedly  having these meetings about behind closed doors right now.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, yes.  The reason - the reason there - it's 52 Republicans  negotiating this is because all the Democrats said, we're not interested in  amending Obamacare.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  They don't want to participate.</p><p> FREEMAN:  That's why they're not part of the negotiation, they've said  they're not going to vote for it.  So, when they come out with that plan,  there will be some entitlement reform because you're basically talking  about fixing Medicaid which expanded under Obamacare.  This is an amazing  program.  As bad as it is for taxpayers, patients are generally better off  with no insurance or they're nowhere soft than with Medicaid.  So, it  doesn't work for anybody and reforming that, I think it's going to be part  of this package.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're also talking about reforming technology of government,  obviously tech titans went to Washington yesterday.  Top industry leaders  met with the president and other administration officials to talk about how  government technology can become more efficient.  Here's what commerce  secretary Wilbur Ross told me about the meeting earlier in the program.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  The government not just  the federal but also state and local government generally has not spent  very much on upgrading their technology.  Might have archaic equipment is  being used, a lot of equipment where you can barely get proper support  anymore.  And there are various estimates the government may be spending  something like $90 billion a year on maintaining systems that fundamentally  are obsoleted by modern standards.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That seems like a lot of low hanging fruit to me, you guys,  what do you think?</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, it's easy, I mean, to me, one of the things we (INAUDIBLE)  the G6 of the division, I was the communications guy and they - I'll be  making decision to roll into vista as an operating system even though  everybody else to include commerce and bypass vista.  But because of their  procurement process and the way they program, they've wasted - my estimate  close to $2 million per sector just on this bad decision.  So the part of  the problem is not necessarily technology, it's people not being able to  make decision to acquire and adapt --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Well, this brings about a decision setting down - you hope it's  not just for show in the media.  Hey, we're all getting together.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Right.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  I think President Trump will be the first there a long time to  take action.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  This should be a way to make government cheaper basically  to get rid of people and use technology instead.  If that's not the goal,  if this is just about allowing government to do more of what it does,  that's going to be a big loss.  But if they're focused on using this as a  cost saver, outside of the military where they actually have tanks and guns  and going blow up stuff.  Most of government just moves information around.   They don't actually produce anything.  There should be an industry that  I.T. can make much more efficient in terms of many, many fewer people.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, the B.A. and DOD is a good example where they have nobody  can actually bridge medical information from the private sector to the  government sector to help manage healthcare.  So this is a great microscopy  --</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  You need them to talk to each other -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SHAFFER:  Yes.  And so - well, you're right.  DOD does have some  experience.  They still won't - and I know of best solutions that have been  purchased by the Department of Defense, they won't implement because of  politics.  So, what he says may be true about them trying to talk but the  problem is culture trying to -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FREEMAN:  I used to work at the SCC and there was - I don't know if this is  still true but there was a form that mutual funds have to submit in DOS, so  they all have to get DOS.</p><p> SHAFFER:  DOS?</p><p> FREEMAN:  A program -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- used on - I mean, sort of 20 years? </p><p> FREEMAN:  Just put it (INAUDIBLE) for god sake.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Yes.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  I don't even know what DOS is. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Let me switch gears.  The travel company that  took Otto Warmbier to North Korea says it will no longer escort Americans  to the hermit kingdom.  The 22 -year-old died after returning to the States  with severe brain damage.  President Trump weighed in on the tragic  incident yesterday.  Here's what he said. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  He spent a year and a half  in North Korea.  A lot of bad things happened.  But at least we got him  home to be with his parents where they were so happy to see him even though  he was in very tough condition but he just passed away a little while ago.   That's a brutal regime, and we will be able to handle it. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Colonel Shaffer, your thoughts. </p><p> SHAFFER:  Well, look, him saying, we will be able to handle it, the  president saying that I think it means we're going to do something we  should.  As a father of a 23-year-old, I would just be heartbroken.  I  don't know how the parents are enduring this, but clearly - this whole  trend of opening up to North Korea has been a bad policy.  The idea of  regularizing relationships is like regularizing our relationship with a -  with a cobra.  The cobra is always going to do what a cobra does and I  think the idea that we're trying to work with China, work with them, I  mentioned earlier, the case on free trade zone were essentially - the South  Koreans get free trade - free labor from the North Koreans and they pay  North Korean labor to do things.  It might have just goes with the  government.  So, I think there's been a lot of ill thought ideas of how to  outreach and work with the North Koreans which has not benefited the people  of North Korea or us. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot of people, you know, say what was he doing there?  Why  was he there?  He was in China and went on a tour with a tour company from  China to North Korea, that's what he was doing there with other students. </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  But the tour company should not be pushing to be in areas like  that that are very dangerous.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We will take a break.  Stay with Fox  Business.  House Speaker Paul Ryan is speaking about the GOP tax plan later  today.  We are going to - we are going to take it to you live at 12:45  Eastern.  Stay right here as we take the House speaker's comments in the  first major tax speech this morning at manufacturing summit.</p><p> Coming up, a scorcher in the southwest, a record-breaking heat wave, so  hot, it's forcing airlines to ground flights. How long the triple-digit  temperatures are expected to last?  And then, a stamp that ensure to have  collectors over the moon, check it out.  The postal service releasing a  stamp that puts in eclipse at the tip of your fingertips.  We'll show you  how it works.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Dozens of flights out of Arizona Sky Harbor  International Airport are being canceled this morning because it is simply  too hot to fly.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  Good  morning, Maria.  This is Phoenix in particular.  American Airlines saying  the small region of planes have a maximum operating temperature of 118  degrees.  So those planes can't fly if it's 120 degrees which is expected  to hit today.  Temperatures like this have not been seen in Phoenix since  1990 when the city endured a record-breaking 122-degree heat wave causing  grounded flights, airport closures, three people actually died that day.   So, American is giving passengers now the option of a refund or a free  booking on another flight if you want to change your plans.</p><p> Well, British officials are charging Barclays and four former top  executives with fraud over fundraising with Qatari investors.  The criminal  charges sent from Barclays investment during the height of the financial  crisis  It's the first time that top executives of the U.K. bankers going  to face criminal charges for their actions during that sort of time.  We  should say Barclays, the stock under pressure slightly almost down about  one percent.  And here as you can see on your screen.</p><p> Well, we are probably not alone.  NASA has spotted 10 new planets outside  of our solar system.  They are likely the right size and temperature to  potentially support life.  The Opinion Space found data from the couple of  telescope during the first four years of its primary mission.  NASA says it  only looked in a tiny part though of the galaxy.  There could be more out  there.</p><p> And let's stay in space just here for a moment.  The postal service out  with a new stamp today that you can have some with, the special edition of  Forever stamp features a solar eclipse to celebrate the Great American  Eclipse that's going to hit on August 21st.  But here's the fun part.  As  you can see with the heat of your finger, the stamp transforms the sun into  the moon.  The solar eclipse will be visible along the 70-mile wide path  that runs from Oregon down to South Carolina, Maria.  And those are your  headlines.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love that.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  Fun, right?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, it looked really cool.  All right.  Thank you,  Cheryl.  Coming up.  The opioid epidemic hits Ohio.  How the state is  working to stem the tide of overdose deaths.  And then the growing  political divide, more Americans believe D.C. has gotten too uncivil since  the election.  We will take a look at what can be done to heal the  division.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  America's opioid crisis is reaching a breaking  point.  Take a look at this.  Authorities in Montgomery County, Ohio say  that they've seen 365 opioid-related deaths this year alone.  The county  tops the nation in overdose deaths and authorities there are calling this a  mass casualty event.  I want to bring in Montgomery County Sheriff Phil  Plummer.  Sheriff, thanks very much for joining us.  And in just five  months the number of opioid-related deaths in your county has already  surpassed the entire last year in terms of numbers.  Why do you think this  is happening? </p><p> PHIL PLUMMER, MONTGOMERY COUNTY SHERIFF:  Good morning, Maria.  Yes.  This  is a tremendous epidemic for us.  We're going to double last year's death  total to set a new record this year.  And it's just happening because  there's a perfect storm of location or economic problems and, you know,  this has been a challenge for all of us.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How are you dealing with this?  Are the authorities fighting  against this opioid epidemic in any specific way?</p><p> PLUMMER:  Yes.  We're very innovative about this, we're working hard, we've  come up some great programs, you know, we're actually - we have Narcan in  cruiser, we're saving lives with Narcan, we're driving addicts to  treatment, we're sending out recovery teams to addict's houses with social  workers, police officers, we're trying to educate the addict's families on  how to get out of this problem.  So, you know, we're working hard on it but  unfortunately, we're not making much progress.  </p><p> SHAFFER:  Hey, Sheriff, this is Tony Shaffer.  I'm an alumni of - alumnus  of the Wright State University right there.  So the poll that where I went  to college is actually at the heart of all this.  Do you believe some of  this is because you all are at the - at the intersection of 75 and 70, the  routes for a lot of stuff moving?  Just so happens you guys happen to be  kind of the drop-off point for a lot of this and is there anything the  federal government can do to help you diminish the supply coming into the  region.  </p><p> PLUMMER:  Your location like I said, that's a perfect storm, 70 and 75,  that's the crossroads of America.  So, you know, Dayton has become a source  city where they bring Heroin and the Fentanyl straight from Mexico to  Dayton, Ohio then they can drop on 70 and they go east and west in New York  and Chicago.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's amazing.  So it's just the fact that you're right near  the route of where this -- the drugs are coming in? </p><p> PLUMMER:  Yes, yes.  It's a perfect storm for us saying, you know, they  need more resources from the federal government.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, the President has taken executive action by forming a  commission to combat drug addiction and this opioid crisis.  You want to  see funding from the government?  What else do you want from the government  in terms of addressing this in Montgomery County?  </p><p> PLUMMER:  We need funding, we need more boots on the ground, you know, we  all been - we've had a bad economic downturn, we've lost a lot of officers,  so we need more resources on the ground because we have to work on this  through the supply - the supply how much is coming from Mexico.  We have to  work on the demand, we have to treat our users and have to get into  prevention and education to keep the next generation from falling into this  trap.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Hi, James Freeman here with the Journal.  Speaking about  education, I know a lot of programs around the country or a lot of schools  have these DARE programs, police officers educating kids starting at a very  young age.  Is there something related to that or not doing as you see this  particular epidemic, is there somebody parents ought to be doing that we're  not?  </p><p> PLUMMER:  Yes.  People -- there is a lot of understanding about the opioid  crisis, so what we're starting now is we're having town hall meetings and  all of our churches, we need to get the congregations to our -- in front of  our panelists and educate them on what's going on and what to be aware of,  you know, how to protect your children.  I, mean, we're losing our kids  every day here in this community.</p><p> SHAFFER:  I have a follow-up question, Sheriff, on the issue of how the  stuff is coming into the region and what you guys are doing about it.  Is  there any way to try to go after the money?  I mean, I work kind  counterdrug in the 90s, and obviously the financial motives for this sort  of thing by those who control the flow if you - if you start going right at  the money, that's one issue.  So have you guys been able to look at who's  dealing this?  You mentioned some of the folks transporting this.  I know  you can't necessarily get ahead of the pipeline but there are certain  things you can do to take the financials and (INAUDIBLE) you guys look at  how to get at the financial aspects of this at all.</p><p> PLUMMER:  Yes.  We've done - we've been targeting the cartel members, we  have two cartels, Mexican cartels bringing the product to our community.   So, you know, we've been watching them in various hotels and we've been  trying to capture the moneys.  And the last couple of years, we've taken  $5.5 dollars cash off of the streets from the cartels that would have gone  back to Mexico.</p><p> SHAFFER:  Wow.  Good.</p><p> PLUMMER:  Yes.  So, unfortunately, that's not working either.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Ohio is suing top pharmaceutical companies.  They  say allegedly they downplayed the risk of addiction to drive sales, Purdue  Pharma, Johnson and Johnson, Allergan, among those facing these lawsuits.   Do you agree with that?  Is some of the blame on these pharmaceutical  companies?</p><p> PLUMMER:  Yes.  Yes.  Definitely, they have some accountability here.  And,  you know, and I support the lawsuits but unfortunately, that's a long-term  solution for this problem and we've been fighting this problem for four  years.  So, we need some immediate resources here in this community.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching.  Sheriff, thanks very much for  weighing in and explaining the story to us.  We appreciate it.  Sheriff  Phil Plummer joining us.  Montgomery County there.  Coming up.  D.C. has  Georgia on its mind today.

Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Happy Tuesday.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thank you so much for  joining us.  It is Tuesday, June 20th.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And here are  your top stories, 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  A busy day at 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue today.  President Trump will host the president of the  Ukraine at the White House later this afternoon.  The meeting comes amid  rising tensions in our nation's capital.  A new poll shows a vast majority  of Americans believe political debate is becoming increasingly uncivil and  it is encouraging violence.  The trend is sure to be on voters' minds as  they head to the polls in Georgia today.</p><p> KAREN HANDEL, GEORGIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  I feel great, very, very  encouraged by things the enthusiasm on the ground has been amazing. </p><p> JON OSSOFF, GEORGIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  I think this is an  opportunity for Georgia to elect some fresh leadership that's focused on  delivering results for folks at home, focus on what people that kind  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Over 140,000 ballots have already been cast as Jon Ossoff and  Karen Handel vie for the empty House seat latest on a special election in  Georgia and South Carolina, this morning.

Oil  prices are driving the action for stock prices this morning, crude oil is  down better than two percent right now and that has taken the wind out of  gains for stock prices, there's oil down $1.13, that's 21/2 percent at  $43.07 a barrel on oil sweet crude.</p><p> Futures meanwhile are also their high take a look at stocks here and the  Dow Industrials averages now negative expected to open down about seven  points.  S&amp;P is also negative both the Dow and the S&amp;P hit record highs  yesterday at the close.  The Nasdaq is swill positive although it is well  off of the highs of the morning, in Europe, similar situation, as oil has  reversed course and worsened, European markets have also done so.  The F.T.  100 is down eight points, the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are up but  just fractionally.  And Asia overnight markets closed mostly lower with the  exception of Japan it was up one percent.  </p><p> Americans on both sides of the aisle now say the tone and level of civility  in our political debate is getting much worse according to a new poll by  CBS News, 68 percent of Americans across all parties said so while just  seven percent said the tone was getting better, better?  Three-quarters of  Americans also say they feel the current tone of political debate is  encouraging violence, joining us right now the Trump great America PAC and  Co-Chair and former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins is here, Ed great to  see you. </p><p> ED ROLLINS, REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT AND ADVISOR:  Thank you, thank  you very much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think of this?</p><p> ROLLINS:  Obviously there is the rhetoric is much more severe than it's  ever been, and it's been increasing over last 20 years to a point since the  Trump election, now their people are very unhappy their very polarized, you  either for Trump or totally against Trump, and actually to me I can't go to  restaurant anywhere in this country that I hear someone, not adjacent table  talking about politics, I've never seen that before and one sense that's  good because their paying attention another sense is not particularly  positive conversations. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but it's also, you know, you have Hollywood getting in on  the act Robert De Niro saying I want to punch the President in the face  you've got Madonna saying yes I think about blowing up the White House  then, of course, the sickest of them all with Kathy Griffin and her head  that she was holding that time. </p><p> ROLLINS:  I think Hollywood is proven to be totally irrelevant in the last  election when everybody was pretty much for MRS. Clinton didn't make any  difference.  I think the serious thing here though is we could have had a  massacre last week if those two Capitol guards had not been there guarding,  you know, they could have killed 10 members of Congress or more and I think  that's very severe that, you know, this is a deranged guy this is obviously  someone who that just walked on the field that morning, he had planned this  but it's very, very severe. </p><p> TONY SHAFFER, RETIRED UNITED STATES ARMY:  And I said the other day in  interview that I felt that the essentially there's a pathology here and  that pathology mirrors what ISIS has been doing to radicalize its members,  I mean you're talking about a group where you have certain beliefs which  become completely inculcated in your believers to the point of were even  that they believe fiction they believe the whole Russian there, there was  on the other and then you have on top of that then this desensitization of  the groups by media.  Media saying it's OK, to say you want to punch the  President, it's OK to have the image of President Trump being behead and  then that leads them to people acting out.  So I believe that we're on a  path of seeing more of this world thing based on the fact that the left  refuses completely to acknowledge the fact that they are radicalizing  individuals to act.</p><p> ROLLINS:  But the bottom line is both sides have let a tone a down a little  bit there's some very serious we have to debate in the very near future.   The irony is we just haven't a Congressional race today this most expensive  race in the history of the country, over $50 million has been spent on a  Congressional race just to put that in the proper perspective.  When I ran  Reagan 49 state victory we spent $40 million so the publicly financed  campaign $50 million on a singular Congressional pain.  I ran a  Congressional committee in numbers of years ago and my whole budget was in  $50 million here in and across the country.  So the irony here is this to  be interpreted as a Trump victory or Trump defeat in which Trump really  didn't play very much of a part, the Democrats running as a new Democrat,  Karen Handel was one of very, very effective race on the start of the close  I can't tell who's going to win but it's a dead even race today with more  money spent than ever before.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is so incredible and by the way, Jon Ossoff doesn't even  live in the district, right?</p><p> ROLLINS:  He's two hours outside the district.</p><p> HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP FUNDS:  And although have  Trump had a little to do with this race, what does this mean for the Trump  agenda going forward?</p><p> ROLLINS:  Specials are always over-interpreted and their totally different  dug and it's five or six specials every cycle between the elections.  But  this clearly if Handel wins, the Trump people certainly well justifiably  argue to their benefit if not the Democrats will argue this is a rejection  of Trump even though Trump really was a debater very much and a course.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this is a Republican district all the way back to a red new  days.</p><p> ROLLINS:  This is (INAUDIBLE) this is the district he first won.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> ROLLINS:  The Democrats have changed slightly and I don't think you should  over-interpreted but it's an Atlantic District It's a big media market, but  it's some time want to watch very closely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  James.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSISTANT EDITOR EDITORIAL PAGE:   I've just want to relate, this Ossoff message he's a former staff or for  very liberal Democratic member of Congress, he's raised money from  Democrats all around the country calling himself independent.  When people  ask him if his force Nancy Pelosi, he said he hadn't given them an ounce of  thought.  Is that possibly true? </p><p> ROLLINS:  No.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then talks an independent, no.</p><p> ROLLINS:  And I promise you if he gets elected tomorrow or tonight which I  hope doesn't happen, he'll be played Nancy Pelosi is going to first words  out of his mouth and he thanked you, madam leader, where do I sit?  And how  do I vote, I think that's the key thing. </p><p> SHAFFER:  Do you think it's working?</p><p> ROLLINS:  It's worked there, I mean, it's a -- again, it's not as much a  Republican district as it used to be, Trump carried the district by about  two points in the fall.  And again I don't want to be over-interpreted I  just think it's, it is going to have an impact on recruiting in a certain.   We're going to talk about first few days here but it's not the end game.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow it's a real plead heat and voters are also headed to the  polls in South Carolina and the South Carolina fifth district.  This is to  fill the seat of the one, formerly held on Mick Mulvaney, that hasn't got  nearly as much attention but this is also an important race.</p><p> ROLLINS:  Two important race all over the Democrats have an wait much of a  battle there.  So we should win that race in for some reason they come  close the Democrats without spending much money then that I think of South  Carolina is a more of an indicator of what's occurring here.  I think the  reality here is we're going to move full, that's a very tough battles ahead  and I think the polarization that were talking about in the beginning of  this segment is very severe in the Congress and the problem is there's not  enough, Republicans don't have enough Republicans to do all of things they  want to do, even if they have majority and there's not enough money for  both sides to do all that they want to do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One of the things they want to do is repeal and replace  Obamacare, they say that there is going to be a vote in the Senate next  week Ed, and then they are talking about tax reforms after the summer.  Do  you still think the agenda getting executed as viable this year? </p><p> ROLLINS:  I think it's tough, I think no one holds what's in the Senate  bill and Senator McConnell it's pretty much his bill so the few people  getting their advice, it's still not poputive a House bill was overwhelm  not (INAUDIBLE).  However it comes out as a big selling job that has to  take place there's only one person that can sell it, and that's the  President.  The President has to go out across this country and the only  criticism I have of the President today is you can't do one-day events, you  can't go out and say today is infrastructure day and tomorrow is tech day  and what you have.  If he wants to sell health care he's going to be out  there every day for weeks and weeks and weeks telling American public why  this is going to work and why it's better than Obamacare.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point, Ed.</p><p> SHAFFER:  On the issue of Senate and from what they're doing with the  health care bill, I see a lot of changes coming that's going to have to go  into some sort of a reconciliation between the House again.  Quick question  do you see the House staying though August?  Do you see that the potential  have actually -</p><p> ROLLINS:  I wish they would but that's what (INAUDIBLE) wish thanking for,  odd realistic.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They have talked about it, right?</p><p> ROLLINS:  They have talked about it but the bottom-line is they never gave  that up, they've all got junkyards that are all going back home and they've  got vacation plans like everybody else.  I just wish they wouldn't take so  many vacations, I think this is very serious year, we've got some very big  issues today the speakers speech is going to be very, very important on the  tax - what is his tax plan has the guy knows more about the taxes than  anybody and he's going to basically give anything or that basically don't  know about so far.  I think getting this tax plan through a tax reform is  critical, I think health care is important but I think tax is critical -</p><p> ZUMARAGGA:  It's also critical for the stock market and were reaching all- time highs because of tax reform may happen -</p><p> ROLLINS:  It's the hope and so for some reason, we go to the next two  months and we don't think it's going to happen, I think markets going to  change.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Well it's also Republicans political survival next fall is  they're going to get the economy growing faster.</p><p> ROLLINS:  That's the promise the President made the rest of it is totally  relevant.  The international stuff that he's all dealing with it is  critical as part of any Presidents responsibility but what he promised the  American public, so I'm going to fix the economy and I want to create jobs  your lives going to be better and there's a whole lot of stuff has to  happen for that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is what is going to leave voters in 2018, for the next  group of elections, do you think voters will remember the way that the left  has been obstructing and basically pushing back on the agenda that America  voters - </p><p> ROLLINS:  I think the problems is you have both sides are very polarized,  so Democrats aren't being turned off by this activity and Republicans, the  same way, it's so if two very anti entities out there and I think the  bottom line is those that are independents and the worry that I think Trump  has is that some of the independents who voted for him in the fall are  starting to back away and independents carry the day today.</p><p> FREEMAN:  OK.  And just given that we had this attempted assassination last  week, do you think it's time for Democrats to stop calling themselves the  resistance?</p><p> ROLLINS:  Yes. </p><p> FREEMAN:  As if they are French freedom fighters battling the Nazis  - </p><p> ROLLINS:  They're very important that the rhetoric get toned down, I mean  you can go fight on the floor, and make whatever kinds of comments you  want, but you got cut stop this personal attack and you got to quit  basically making enemies out of the opposite side.  Part of the breakdown  I've been around the game 50 years is it used to be there was social you  can still fight still be partisan. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But you go have a cup of coffee.  </p><p> ROLLINS:  Still have a couple coffee or drink or dinner what have you, you  have to know his at his family's and you realize we're all Americans today  they don't sit together they don't talk together staffers don't meet  together and they just are polarized they hate each and  that's other a  terrible place to be.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean listen to Chuck Schumer yesterday, saying that,  you know, they are passing something in the dead of night as if nobody  remembers the way Obamacare was passed, and stuck down everybody's throat. </p><p> ZUMARAGGA:  And that what he said you'll find out what's in the bill when  it is passed. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what Nancy Pelosi said.</p><p> ROLLINS:  And unfortunate all those words are going to coming back this  time if we don't do it differently and that's my concern at this point in  time.  I think we got to get this thing drafted I don't have any problems  Senator McConnell of doing it.  I just think it has to get very open we're  going to have a big debate on it, people have to know what this is all  about if not we'll pay a heavy price. </p><p> ZUMARAGGA:  And we'll give Chuck Schumer more than 10 hours, to see what's  in the bill. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He wants for this than ever that's what he said as well.  Ed  great to see you</p><p> ROLLINS:  My pleasure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much great insights as always from Ed Rollins.   Coming up Amazon's deal to acquire whole foods could send cashiers packing  the potential trouble ahead for grosser is it going robotic?  And then  Santa sleigh make come with a surcharge where the shipping giant is  planning to charge more for holiday delivery there were at UPS, back in a  minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  With O&amp;M, head of Chinese e-commerce giant,  Alibaba is rolling into mortar city.  Here's Nicole Petallides covering the  story from New York, Stock Exchange.  Hi, Nicole. </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Thank you, Maria.  That is  right.  Technology and e-customers wave off the future.  The story was  exactly that Jack Ma, Chairman of Alibaba, is coming into moderate gateway  conference and is going to meet with over 3,000 businesses all to go with  the pledge to President Donald Trump in creating jobs.  Alibaba has already  done millions and millions of jobs in China and China e-commerce.  By the  way, the only sales reported are 771 billion clearly out places that are in  the United States.  This year, it is at 446 billion in the hopes of trying  to get U.S. businesses to now work with Alibaba.  That in itself is a big  deal.</p><p> Jack Ma also has power in bringing head of UPS in order to make this deal  happen.  There are concerns because you have these sellers lacking the  clarity of merchandise and can step in trying to woo U.S, besides creating  jobs to Amazon -- we know Amazon made that nearly $14 billion deal with  Whole Foods.  Reports are now going to use strategy of Amazon so that  customers can now walk around the store with no cashiers, just technology  sensors, streamers, and maybe humans just in the back monitoring things at  the place.  You can walk out with items with human interaction but the  problem with initial platform is that when the store is getting too crowded  in a prolonged time, it can no longer monitor what the customer has picked  up.  They say -- we will keep an eye on the business that's at stake.  </p><p> There is also talk of new stores that may not be exactly Whole Foods, you  know, and new brands as well, that may be less price because the stocks are  trying to shed that Whole Foods, whole paycheck image and trying to make it  ready for everybody.  Maria, back to you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Nicole Petallides, thank you so much.  We will  watch that.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, final thoughts  from our all-star panel.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Final thoughts from our all-stars.  Heather. </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  A big week ahead we got rate hikes, Sessions testimony may be  in public or private and big tech names to watch. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Buckle up, that's what you're saying. </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Buckle up. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  James Freeman.</p><p> FREEMAN:  I'm watching the text docs too, I also want to say happy  anniversary mom and dad Steve and Gloria Block. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How many years?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  A lot.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Bad son.  But he did wish you a happy anniversary on air.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  The federal reserve is set to raise quarter basis points again  on Wednesday, I'm more interested to see if they hint that unwinding their  balance sheet and reducing some a little the liquidity that helps prop the  markets up. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That we probably won't find out until the fall I think  Septembers the application for that.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Maybe.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks to Heather and James, see you all.  All right, we will  leave it there and we'll see you tomorrow with another big show.  As  request \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is on deck.  Stu, take it away. </p><p> 830</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Even bad news is free media visibility after all for a rapacious corporate firm that has upturned corporate ethics and Silicon Valley virtuousness.    Last week, Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, already famous in India following his passionate embrace of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was at it again.    A Wall Street Journal report made the sensational disclosure that its leadership team in India deliberately smothered corporate policy on proscriptions on hate speeches because it would have damaged Facebook\u2019s intimate relationship with the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government and therefore its business interests.    The individual who had made vituperative, violent posts was a member of the BJP, T Raja Singh, an MLA from the southern state of Telangana.    India is currently Facebook\u2019s most attractive market (it has 300 million users) and in the foreseeable future could be its crucial lynchpin as it expands its social media footprint to capture global mindshare.    The fact is that T Raja Singh\u2019s provocative Facebook posts were meant to make India\u2019s minority Muslims (around 200 million) feel insecure. As per reports, his hate was unequivocal: he called Muslims traitors, exhorted people to raze mosques down and called for Rohingya Muslims to be shot dead.    It was a repugnant, reprehensible abuse of fellow citizens of India. In Telangana, the Muslim population is about 12% and it is the erstwhile princely state of the Nizam of Hyderabad. What is particularly disturbing is that the hate speech was internally discussed within Facebook in the month of March 2020 itself, with several employees expressing their concerns in an open letter.    Facebook must explain as to why it needed WSJ to investigate the brazen contravention of its own house rules or is Zuckerberg being a smart Alec by merely framing red flags for legal, media and public consumption while his team has been given the go-ahead to do as they please.    Ankhi Das, who heads public policy (euphemism for government lobbying) and has become the poster-person of Facebook\u2019s shenanigans was perhaps doing what many in Facebook do: protecting the bottom-line. But at what cost? This is not just about an individual but the larger corporate imperfection within Facebook.    In a perfect world, the BJP should have itself punished T Raja Singh for inciting violence with his venomous tweets. But the fact is that Singh was steadfastly adhering to the BJP playbook of being vitriolic with a capital V. It suits the BJP to have these vicious motormouths. Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and the ilk were far from reprimanded for making inflammatory speeches during the Delhi elections earlier this year.    Just as they have their \u2018political compulsions\u2019 ( the most cheesy pretext that gives one a carte blanche license to abuse) so does Facebook have its shareholder value to protect (the company\u2019s revenues exceed those of all US newspaper companies aggregated together). It is a simple equation.    Zuckerberg\u2019s personal net worth now exceeds $100 billion, and he joined two other Big Tech big fish in Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos in the new \u2018centibillionaire club\u2019. Facebook is unlikely to make compromises with its cash flows; ethics can wait in the lounge.    Das okayed the objectionable content because she knew that the Modi government would, in its vindictiveness, railroad Facebook\u2019s business prospects in India. In effect, Das has dealt a double whammy, a body blow to Facebook\u2019s negotiable elastic morality and also exposed the BJP\u2019s authoritarian anti-democratic propensities that have already been well documented.    Facebook has effectively demonstrated that it can overlook dangerously instigating comments to protect its income and profits, principles be damned. It has also painted Mr Modi\u2019s government as a despotic vengeful regime that can stymie a company\u2019s plans if its interests are violated.   But this is beyond the usual BJP vs Congress slugfest (Facebook has been asked to explain itself before an Information Technology parliamentary committee headed by Dr Shashi Tharoor on September 2, 2020), because at risk is Indian democracy itself.    Facebook had indeed deliberately concealed the Cambridge Analytica connection (the latter was hired by the Republican candidate Donald Trump) from the regulatory authorities until it was forced to make a public disclosure.   Russian interlocutors successfully interfered in the US Presidential elections by spreading misinformation, fake news (Hillary Clinton running a child prostitution racket was big news in the rust belt of US mid-west) and populating lies on a targeted audience, mostly the vulnerable sections in the swing states.    Social media like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp are the new electoral weapons because they can be customized to influence select sub-groups and do microscopic targeting. Political parties are loving the focus groups on their apps.    India needs to worry. Because the recent riots in Bengaluru and Delhi (and don\u2019t forget Muzaffarnagar) saw the diabolical role of social media, particularly Facebook and WhatsApp. If political parties strike deals with an avaricious global shark intent on shoring up its corporate fortunes that cares a fig for social harmony, we will have ourselves to blame. Not an algorithm.     **********   Disclaimer: The author is the former National Spokesperson of the Indian National Congress.

Ordinary people supposedly want substance instead. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet Elizabeth Warren, on the campaign trail, is doing her best to talk about process. And she may be taking her cues from Bernie Sanders, who did the same thing in 2016 with great success.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren's homepage doesn\u2019t lead with policies like healthcare, goals like economic equality, or even principles. It leads with talk of democracy: \u201cWe\u2019re building a grassroots movement to fight corruption head on and put power in the hands of the people.\u201d</p><p>She constantly brags about how democratic her campaign has been. She\u2019s held up her tens of thousands of \u201cselfies\u201d as a \u201cnew measure of democracy.\u201d Her rally Sunday morning in Indianola, like most of her late-Iowa rallies, began with a riff on all her townhalls, remarking on how tough questions and voters \u201cpushing\u201d her has refined and influenced her views. \u201cYou have made me a better candidate, and you will make me a better president,\u201d Warren said.</p><p>The message: Through Warren, ordinary voters are empowered. </p><p>This was the true heart of Sanders\u2019 campaign in 2016. More than socialism, more than Medicare for All, more than student loan debt, Sanders\u2019 campaign was about process.</p><p>\u201cIf this campaign is about anything,\u201d Sanders said at a rally in a 2016 rally in New Hampshire, \u201cit is about revitalizing American democracy \u2014 making sure that every American knows how powerful he or she is to determine the future of this great country.\u201d</p><p>It worked for Sanders. Young people flocked to him because they were desperately seeking a sense of political agency. </p><p>And like Sanders, Warren tries to make democratic process sexy by making it about corruption, and undue influence. Sanders spent most of 2016 raging against Citizens United. Warren, too, talks a lot about how money corrupts politics. </p><p>\u201cMoney is choking off our Democracy,\u201d Warren said Sunday morning. She argued that rich people \u201cmay own more shoes, they may own more cars, they may own more houses, but they're not supposed to own a bigger piece of our democracy.\u201d</p><p>And Warren addresses the issue in Bernie-like terms of revolution. \u201cIf we want to change\" the role of money in politics, she says, \u201cwe're not going to be able to do it with just a little nibble around the edge. One little statue over here, a couple of regulations over there. No, we want to beat back the influence of money. We want to save our democracy. We want to save our country. It's going to take big structural change.\u201d</p><p>When asked about climate change, Warren spent much of her answer on the meta-question of special-interest politics. \u201cEverybody wants to talk to you about climate change, they got a lot of good plans. Yay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut unless you're willing to attack the corruption head on, and unless you\u2019re willing to take on the oil industry, unless you're willing to take on the big polluters unless, you're willing to fight corruption and the influence of money and lobby,\u201d nothing significant will happen, Warren argues. </p><p>When asked for a female role model, Warren named Frances Perkins, who became FDR\u2019s secretary of Labor. Warren\u2019s talk about Perkins, was heavy on how she took on powerful big businesses. When asked about big tech, Warren said the problem was the concentrated power of companies like Amazon.</p><p>Often she sets aside the substance, and focuses on the process. How could this be appealing? Because a big part of what people want isn\u2019t specific policy outcomes, but the knowledge that their voices matter. Warren hopes this message will inspire enough people in Iowa and New Hampshire to nominate her.</p><p>Photo Caption:Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With expectations of a U.S. government lawsuit against Alphabet\u2019s Google within weeks, two progressive Democrats tweeted support for legal action against tech giants who break the law, in a rare instance of agreement with the Republican administration amid a polarized political environment.   The tweets come as the Justice Department, which has been conducting an antitrust investigation of Google and others, plans to bring a lawsuit against the search and advertising giant as soon as this month, according to sources who said that the probe focused on search and advertising.   Senator Elizabeth Warren, long a critic of Big Tech, tweeted late Thursday that Google \u201cuses its size to bully competitors.\u201d   In her tweets, she reiterated concerns from more than a year ago when she called for antitrust enforcers to force Big Tech firms like Amazon and Facebook to unwind some mergers. Google, she said then, should be forced to sell mapping subsidiary Waze, connected home products company Nest and ad management tool DoubleClick.   \u201cFor the good of our country, we must demand our regulators do their jobs &amp; take swift, aggressive action \u2013 not kick the can down the road,\u201d she said on Thursday.   The Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Rohit Chopra, a Democratic commissioner, tweeted support on Friday for the investigations into \u201ctech titans,\u201d but did not name Google.   \u201cNo company, no matter how big, can be above our laws. It\u2019s time for regulators to take action against any companies that broke them,\u201d he tweeted on Friday.   Google had no immediate comment on the tweets.

Their mission?</p><p> To convince the FTC to break up the company. They also want users on competing social networks to be able to communicate with one another, as well as the implementation of stronger privacy rules. \"Facebook is in a competitive environment where people use our apps at the same time they use free services offered by many others,\" a Facebook spokesperson told Engadget. \"The average person uses eight different apps to communicate and stay connected. People use Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger because they find them valuable, and we've been able to better fight spam and abuse and build new features much faster by working under one roof. We support smart privacy regulation and efforts that make it easier for people to take their data to competing services. But rather than wait, we've simplified our privacy controls and introduced new ways for people to access and delete their data, or to take their data with them.\" These ads will run online, and the groups (which include the Open Market Institute and MoveOn Civic Action) are putting six figures of spending power behind them. They will run on both Twitter and Facebook, as well as as more traditional display units on websites.The groups believe that the new FTC chairman, Joe Simons, might be amenable to taking on a big tech company. While some commissioners might be sympathetic, Axios notes that no commissioners have come out in support of breaking up any American tech giants.Facebook has certainly been in some hot water recently[2] over fake news and privacy issues, and it's become popular to cry for more regulation of the social networking service from both the left and the right (who claim that Facebook shows liberal bias). But this feels like a stretch. There are multiple options when it comes to social networking and messaging apps. Facebook doesn't operate all, or even a majority, of them. While stricter privacy controls would be welcome news, breaking up the company doesn't seem like the answer to that problem.

My name is Will Marshall, I'm president of the Progressive Policy Institute and I want to welcome you today to this Capitol Hill Forum on Blockchain 101: Harnessing the Distributed Power Blockchain Technology. Thanks we--we've had great interest in this and a lot of people signed up and we really appreciate your coming out today to learn more about this fascinating subject. </p><p>Progressive Policy Institute, if you all know us, know that we have made a study of digital innovation and its impact on economic investment and job creation in America a centerpiece of the work that--that we do. We think it is the absolute driver of our economy and the key to our ability to win the race for economic privacy with--with China. </p><p>And blockchain is on the, you know, sort of an exciting new frontier of digital innovation but its revolutionary potential is not well understood here in Washington, I think. I--I will confess to be, you know, as a late adopter of technology someone who needs to learn more but I think that's--a lot of people up here do. </p><p>We all know it has something to do with bitcoin but after that it gets pretty--pretty murky. But, you know, blockchain technology is emerging as a kind of general purpose technology for all sorts of data sharing applications and transactions and we are very fortunate today to have a wonderful crew of blockchain entrepreneurs here who are pio--pioneering fascinating new applications for this technology and we're going to hear from them about what they're doing and, I hope to learn a little more about how the--the technology actually works and Rob Shapiro is going to--is going to lead that conversation in just a minute. But before--before we get there, I just want to say this, there's kind of a lucky accident of timing that we're here talking about blockchain when Congress is hauling in the big tech--tech companies, you know, for inquest this week and basically raising questions about the market power of these tech giants and--and there's a lot of concern about that and--and I wonder, and I'll just put this as a question, but you know, to--to some extent, is blockchain technology an answer to this techlash, this concern about centralization of power and of the--the monopolistic role of--of big platforms by enabling decentralized networks and lowering the number of intermediaries and reducing transaction costs and creating higher levels of data security. </p><p>Blockchain can, perhaps, organize innovation ecosystems and commerce in ways that--that doesn't seed enormous market power to platform operators and avoids some of the pitfalls that we're going to hear about this week in the other hearings and it raises, obviously, a whole lot of important public policy implications that we're going to explore today too, if we have time. </p><p>So without further ado, we--Representative Darren Sutten--Soto, of--of Florida was supposed to be here. Unfortunately, he went to the doctor this morning and was diagnosed with some kind of flu or contagion and mercifully decided not to come and be with us. That's too bad, but we are fortunate to have pinch-hitting Bill Rockwood, who is Congressman Soto's Financial and Tec--Tech Policy Advisor. And, of course, Congressman Soto is the Co-Chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. So, it would be good to get your perspective on what's happening with the caucus and--and--and Congress on--on this subject. So, Bill, over to you. </p><p>ROCKWOOD: Well, first, thank you for the great introduction. You did a fantastic job queuing up a lot of the issues that are to come. Again, my name is Bill Rockwood. I apologize, my boss, Darren Soto, couldn't be here today; it's probably in our own best interest he isn't, but happy for this opportunity and this gathering. </p><p>I've actually been trying to put together an event myself entitled: Blockchain for Dems and I will make the disclaimer, let's try to leave bitcoin and--and Facebook at the door today because I think that's what get--gets a lot of attention. Frankly, it's why Republicans might be a little further along on this issue. But I think this is a great panel and there is a really strong opportunity for--for Dems and the Progressive Caucus to take a lead, because if you project five, ten years down the road, a lot of the blockchain technologies and the way it works, plays very well into the Democratic platform. So I'm happy to engage further with any of you all behind the scenes but just mention some things like reducing healthcare costs, cyber security in elections, food tracing, tracking humanitarian aid dollars. Like all of these things become more efficient and open and transparent because of the way the technology works. </p><p>So, yes, bitcoin and--and the Facebook Libra thing are major things these days, but I see all of this as a way to get to the more interesting discussion, which is blockchain itself and just to--those are some areas and--and just, we won't go into the 101. Hopefully our panelists will go into that, but just to throw some provocative things out there, it's a way to reduce energy consumption, increase cyber security and your us--user privacy than traditional networks. </p><p>Again, Mr. Soto is a Co-Chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus and in that role, the caucus really sees itself as an educational outlet. Yes, we are trying to coordinate groups like this and have done a lot of different subjects, but this is a new issue so there are a lot of questions and, you know, whether it's getting beyond bitcoin to blockchain, and a lot of times it's just coming in, and my biggest role this year I've realized is flipping the discussion. It's--my job isn't to explain blockchain to you, like there's always going to be an inherent difficulty and bandwidth issue with some of those, but if you come to me with issues your boss cares about, I can find an application and ways that we can work together. </p><p>So use this as a good introductory 101 on like how the technology works at a high level, but really thinking through the implications as a way to make a name for yourself like I did as a staffer. No one's touching this on the Dems side. So, I issue that challenge to you, you know, I don't want to be out here by myself all the time on this stuff-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But really, as a young staffer, it's the quickest way to make an impact and a different--difference for your boss. The caucus emphasizes a light touch regulatory approach and I guarantee, we can find a project for everyone in here to work on it, if--if you're motivated. So I'll leave my--my cards on the outside and feel free to get in touch. </p><p>Just some specifics in terms of what Mr. Soto probably would have talked about, we have introduced some legislation to help with the jurisdiction of--to clarify what different digital assets, again, that goes down the bitcoin/Facebook route but happy to chat about that. And, with the appropriations and things like the NDAA, there are such profound implications. Like we got eight pieces of legislative report language in, the most recent appropriations process related to crypto and blockchain. So, again, I--I pose this out to the--the next generation of staffers, you know, how this is going to be a--a $30, I think, billion dollar industry in 2030. It's coming. I think it has the potential to be the next Silicon Valley, so, again, we want to make sure this occurs domestically but it's also a great way to get yourselves involved in an issue that is going to effect the future. You know, that's why, in theory, we--we do this job to make a difference, get involved and by--by getting in front of policy issues you can really make a big im--impact for both your boss and the future that's to come. </p><p>So thank you for this opportunity and I look forward to the panel discussion. </p><p>MARSHALL: Thank you. Thanks very much, Bill, I'm sorry to hear that blockchain people are so lonely here on Capitol Hill--Maytag repairman. I'm not going to give Rob Shapiro the--the lavish introduction he--he deserves. But, Rob, is really the moving spirit of this--of this event today and I want to thank him for focusing us at PPI on blockchain technology. Rob is the founder and chairman of Sonecon, he's really one of the foremost economic thinkers and analyst in America. He was the Undersecretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs under Bill Clinton and he oversaw the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Census Bureau. Aren't you glad you don't have that job now, Rob? </p><p>But, he's been an advisor to every Democratic president since and just one of the sharpest economists, economic thinkers, that we have here and we're fortunate to count him as a friend and as a former PPI colleague; somebody present at the creation of PPI many years ago. So without further ado, Rob, over to you and--and to hear from our entrepreneurs is really--what--what we're going to really learn today. Thanks. </p><p>SHAPIRO: Thanks for coming. I--I just want to say this is, in PPI's tradition of always being on the cutting edge of policy. And so I really want to thank Will. I'm going to talk for less than a minute and then we'll hear from the people who are building companies and new operations around blockchain. </p><p>Many of you know, it's the technology behind bitcoin. The way to think about it is that bitcoin is to blockchain what email was to the internet. It's the first killer app. Think of where the internet was in 1990 or 1992; that's where blockchain is today. I personally think it will be a $30 billion industry by 2022, not by 2030, and growing very, very fast after that. So the question is, why are Bill Gates, Wall Street and Silicon Valley so interested in blockchain today? It's a peer-to-peer network or a person-to-person network, as Jonathan Johnson puts it, for nearly any transaction. </p><p>Today most of us use some trusted middleman like a bank or a credit card company to make a transaction and we pay fees to do it. Blockchain allows everyone to carry out many transactions directly removing the cost and inefficiency of a third-party. This is a radically efficient technology which is why, as it--as its capacity grows, it--it will, economically, has to become pervasive. I--I'm not going to describe how, exactly how, it works, I'm going to leave that to the--the panel but the fact is that blockchain works with any type of transaction involving value; whether it's money or goods or property. Governments can use it to collect taxes, for example. </p><p>Moreover, its potential uses go beyond that because the assets and money being transferred through a blockchain are just digital information made very secure between one party or another. So blockchain can do the same with any type of digital information. For example, voting, or land titles. </p><p>We have with us today people who can talk on all of these topics. We have--I'm going to introduce them very briefly right now and then we'll go to the questioning. Jonathon Johnson, the chairman of Medici Ventures which is the leading blockchain incubator and venturer (PH) investor in America. Hillary Braseth is the director of Product for Voatz which is the leading actor in blockchain-based voting for elections. Trent Larson, is the Principal Software Developer for Medici Land Governance which is the leading blockchain-based land titling venture in the world and Al--Al--Alan Konevsky is the Chief Legal Officer for tZERO which is the--the leading player in America in developing blockchain-based capital markets. So, we're touching a lot of areas. </p><p>I'm going to start with Jonathan Johnson. Jonathan, tell us why you think blockchain is so promising and so important? </p><p>JOHNSON: Well, Rob, thank you and, Will, thank you for hosting this, this is just fantastic. I want to go back to the analogy that Rob used to talk about the internet. When the internet first came on the scene, we used to refer to it as the information superhighway and that's because it made the transfer of information nearly free and nearly frictionless and that's transformed the--the world that we live in. </p><p>When we use the internet to transfer something, we give a copy. So if you send an email or a picture or a Website, you're serving up a copy of something to somebody. And no one cares that you get a copy of my picture or my email, but if I'm giving you an asset, you don't want a copy of my asset; mostly because you don't want me spending it twice, three times, end (PH) times. </p><p>Blockchain is really the digital assets superhighway. It lets you and I transfer goods electronically just like we transfer information electronically and--and--and Rob said that email is to the internet what bitcoin is to blockchain. It's the first killer app. It's the first asset that used blockchain technology but, assets include things like your vote, once you give it, you don't (PH) want to be able to cast it again and again and again in the same election. They include things like land, hard assets that we can digitize. They include things like stock certificates that today, when we transfer these things, we have a bunch of people in between; real estate brokers, title insurance people, brokers, prime brokers, clearing agents, county clerks; all these people in between us to make sure that when we transfer something we can trust each other. </p><p>Blockchain is the digital trust agent. It's almost like, when I was a kid I liked to trade baseball cards. My neighbor down the street, (INAUDIBLE) was a Cincinnati Red's fan, I was a Dodgers fan. When we would get each other's cards that we wanted, we each hold one half of the card that we were trading and on the count of one, two, three, we'd let go--thank you--we'd let go and pull. Well, that was kind of a handshake of sorts. Blockchain technology is the digital handshake that lets us each hold part of an asset; my money, Alan's stock, and one, two, three, without someone in the middle, let go and pull. That's why I think it's so revolutionary. </p><p>SHAPIRO: And what is it that keeps it secure? </p><p>JOHNSON: Well, when you think about why we use trust agents, it's because they--we are relying on them to keep it secure. We're relying on Equifax to keep our information secure. We're relying on banks to keep our information secure. Blockchain technology is two things; principally they keep it secure; one is the cryptography that has the information that's in it cryptographically secure and then the fact that there's no one single ledger that if a hacker hacks into, like Equifax, or your bank, they can figure out everything they need to know about you and have everything that you have. This is a distributed ledger so that all five of us up here have a ledger and if you hack into mine, you can't deplete what I own because all the other four of us haven't been hacked into and they represent the truth and the one hacked ledger gets fixed that way. </p><p>That's--that's my non-technical explanation. Transit technologist; I'm not. </p><p>SHAPIRO: Right. Think of a block on the blockchain as a network of computers and for any exchange to occur, they all have to approve it. They all have a record of the asset that's being transferred and so it all has to concur. So, as Jonathan said, you hack into one and you cannot get a hold of that asset; it's the whole network. </p><p>Since we're on Capitol Hill, let's turn to blockchain technologies application to elections. Hillary, you're from Voatz, the leading company in blockchain-based voting right now, how--how does Voatz use blockchain to make voting secure and efficient? </p><p>BRASETH: Sure, thank you so much. And thank you, Jonathan, that was a really wonderful way to, I think, bring down to earth this core concept of what is blockchain? Can you all hear me? Okay. So I work with Voatz and Voatz is a mobile voting system backed by blockchain technology. So, the way that we use blockchain is the final step of the voting process. So, if you are a voter and you decide to use Voatz in an election or your jurisdiction allows you to vote with Voatz, your experience of this would be using the device that all of you carry around in your hand or your pocket and what you would do is you would download the Voatz app, sign up for an account and you would go through an identity verification process where you would take a picture of your photo ID, take a live selfie of your face, so you blink up and down, look sideways to make sure you're not taking a picture of another picture, or a picture of a video and that identity verification process simultaneously checks against the states Voter Registration database to ensure that you are, indeed, a voter. </p><p>So, yes, we do require a government issued photo ID which is a tradeoff if you want to use the convenience of voting. This wouldn't replace you being able to still show up at the poll without an ID and--and vote that way. </p><p>Once that process is complete, you're instantly pinged with your mobile ballot, mobile pic (PH). So you make your selections and in the background what's happening, every single oval that you're filling in on your ballot equals essentially what we call a vote transaction on the blockchain. So, when you make all of your selections, and at the moment that you press submit, which uses your biometrics which are already tied to your identity, that ballot passes through the blockchain and this is where it becomes very compelling because rather than being validated by one single server and stored on one single server, it goes through a validation process that passes through all of the different validators participating in the network to ensure that what you voted for, is indeed what's logged as an aggregate count of the vote. And that's how we use blockchain is to secure that aggregate count so that in the event that somebody tried to be nefarious in our--in our elections, we would have a sustained record of who won the election. Whereas, right now, our trust is all placed in, well, I guess it's the media these days that announces who wins-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--an election, or the, you know, governing body that's hosting the election. </p><p>SHAPIRO: You know, there have been a lot of elections where the final result is held up because they're waiting for the overseas vote and the military vote. How does--how does Voatz simplify that process? </p><p>BRASETH: Yeah, thank you. So, essentially we've been around for about three years and we've run all types of elections from university voting to local towns, non-profits. We've had a lot of headway this past year with that very population; overseas voters, which are classified as what we call UOCAVA voters. There's about three million overseas U.S. citizens and right now their only options to vote include postal mail, fax and email. Now, I lived in West Africa for three years and I didn't vote once because there's no postal system in Guinea. So, this population, their average voter turnout is 7 percent which is, by and large, one of the most disenfranchised voting blocks that we have in our country. </p><p>So, this past fall we piloted with the State of West Virginia and allowed overseas citizens, for the first time in history, to vote in the midterms with their smartphones. And all votes that were cast had a voter verified digital receipt. So, as soon as you cast your vote you got a ballot receipt that showed you exactly how you voted so you could verify that your vote was cast, was counted as cast. </p><p>So, there was also an audit trail so that the jurisdiction could con--conduct a very rigorous post-election audit. So those pieces are also very important but this is a huge game changer for re-enfranchising this demographic that lives overseas and struggles with receiving mail and--and quite frankly, emailing your ballot to your county clerk is not a very secure, as Jonathan said, process. There's a copy that's made and your name is attached so you really relinquish your right to anonymity and what's actually happening on the ground is that jurisdiction is receiving your emailed ballot and hand copying all of your selections onto a paper ballot that can be tabulated. I don't know if many people know that but that's truly what's happening. </p><p>So for coun--for states that have a large portion of these overseas citizens, the amount of human labor doing that process and the potential for human error is quite large. </p><p>SHAPIRO: And last--last question, what misconceptions do you hear about blockchain-based voting and how do you respond to them? </p><p>BRASETH: Yeah, one thing I want to mention is I want to make sure to differentiate that we are not just blockchain voting. Blockchain is one piece of the puzzle but the other pieces of the puzzle are equally as important to factor into the equation. So, we only operate with the latest classes of smartphones, which smartphone hardware technology has mostly become ubiquitous and the security measures are--are very, very good. So we leverage the biometric capabilities of the smartphone along with cryptography and then blockchain is the piece that, in our view, provides three really main values; the first is data storage. As was mentioned earlier, rather than being housed on one single server, this is distributed across multiple servers. </p><p>The second piece is, auditability. So, for the first time--so we had Denver also pilot this in May with their municipal elections, so overseas citizens voted for the mayor on--with Voatz. And we held, for the first time, a citizens public audit where the jurisdiction was able to compare the voter verify of all digital receipts with the actual ballots that were tabulated with the data on the blockchain. So we built a tool to visualize the blockchain where every single vote transaction could be audited; and that's a key piece is--is, again, to reinforce that trust. And the last piece is transparency. So, you go to vote right now, do you know that it's counted and do you know that it's counted correctly? A lot of us just assume that it is but we don't really know and so we're building towards a scenario where for the first time, as a voter, you and only you, can audit your own vote and say, that's my vote on the blockchain, that's exactly how I voted and also do that without revealing your anonymity. </p><p>And the last piece I'll mention very quickly is, it's important for me to mention that we use a very specific type of blockchain called a public permissioned network which is different than what you hear about in bitcoin where anybody can participate and run a--a node, is what they're called. So in our case, it's a public permissioned network where anybody running a node has to go through a very rigorous process to do that. But what it enables is that we can make sure that all the nodes are, for example, operating in the United States and that it can most closely mirror the way elections are currently run and have both political parties running a node, non-profits, auditors, universities to be able to distribute and mirror how elections are run today. </p><p>SHAPIRO: Thank you Hillary. </p><p>JOHNSON: Rob, if I could just interrupt? </p><p>SHAPIRO: Of course. </p><p>JOHNSON: I--I've seen some of the feedback that Voatz, which is spelled V-O-A-T-Z, has gotten from overseas military personnel, o--overseas foreign exchange students, universally they praise how easy it is to use. What if we could do that for people here? You know, you show up at work, you see someone has got an I Voted sticker on, no one in this room doesn't know when the elections are, that's why you're here in Washington, D.C., but most of America is like, ah, oh, today's voting, we've got to go stand in line at the junior high school or at the library to wait and wait. They can sit in their office or they could be on a plane and vote and be done, done. I think we could increase participation in election by a lot with this technology. </p><p>SHAPIRO: Thank you, Jonathan. Next I'm going to turn to Trent Larson. Trent, your enterprise uses blockchain technology to help people get secure title to land holdings in developing countries and in hard to survey rural areas of developed nations. Tell us both why this is important and how do you do it? </p><p>LARSON: Okay, I'm--I'll just start with the why. Yeah, that's--it--it--it is important and I'm sure you've seen in the news problems with refugees where they get displaced and then how you go back and reclaim what you had before. There's mass problems all across Africa with trust in some of the systems where--that are supposed to secure your land rights and your land tenure and so that's our focus. We mostly focus in third world countries. And our hope is to build trust in these systems and these registries that the people independently, individually can interact with. So that's a little bit of background. </p><p>Let me start with some of the technology because I think it's important to emphasize that you all use cryptography every time you get online and you make a purchase because of the lock that is on the top of your browser shows that you have an encrypted connection. That encryption is one of the basics of watching and bitcoin technology. So what we are doing is getting those encryption tools in the hands of the people, the individuals. And so there's three primary ways that we are helping specifically in some African projects. The first is with systematic lands titling. So this is where Zambia has recognized that people are moving into, and--and residing in, areas where they haven't previously recorded (PH) anything and so it's just been many, many years of people living in their own settlements. The government is finally realizing, you know, whether it would be wrong of somebody to kick them out. Let's record and help them secure that. So, we go out and we incent people on the ground to actually take surveys of--and look at documents and take pictures of documents and people and their houses. They send that in and the registrar will stamp with that cryptographic signature. </p><p>So from then on, they can go and point to some place on an open permissions ledger and say, yeah, they stamped this particular plane of land. That's the first way. Second way is a combination of the individual and the registrar where I, as a seller, have recorded what my properties are on the public registry so I'm going to initiate a transaction and so I signed it with my own cryptographic signature that nobody else has but I've registered it. </p><p>So, pass the transaction to the buyer. The buyer, if they agree to the terms, and maybe he's agreed that he's received the keys, then we'll sign. Maybe there's a little back and forth while the funds are settled. The signatures then get passed to the registrar and the registrar looks at the workflow, hey, does this pass all of my requirements and do these people really own that property? Okay, I will put my stamp on it and so it's a third stamp. So they each are participating in this transaction. And it's this trust lever that Jonathan had that's making it so that they can each trust one another. </p><p>The third way, this is directly in between people and, you know, the first story I told where we'd go into these informal settlements where they haven't been recorded before, they--when we do that, we want to make sure that their neighbors agree with them. So, we have to do this arduous process and go back into the area, put huge maps up on the wall, let them go through paperwork and say, okay, this was me, okay, and do you have a problem with any of these neighbors boundaries that are on your place? No. Okay, go ahead and sign. Again, what if we can, as they're taking the surveys, show that hey, these are what your neighbors claimed as the boundaries, do you agree or disagree? Okay, I agree, then let's put your signature on there, cryptographic signature, and now you've got this social support for that, all those claims. And that's something they can show a year or five years down the road and show, hey, you know, I lived here and--and it builds that history which is--is the documentation. </p><p>So, this is--these are a little bit different than what you typically hear about bitcoin. It's--we have this transaction of tokens of value which is a great use case but what we're building these mostly built on, hey, we have signatures and we're reporting the history of (INAUDIBLE). These are often recorded on an open permission-less ledger because, in my case, we want that information to be open to the world. </p><p>We don't publish all of the individual's information on there that would have privacy concerns with that. But, when they have the keys, they can go back later and show, oh yeah, this was me if they want to prove it to the bank or prove it to government officials or judges who have a dispute in that area. </p><p>SHAPIRO: Thank you. I--I should mention, the World Bank actively supports Medici Land Governance's activities and five African countries. As an economist, there are hundreds of millions of poor people in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, who are sitting on plots of land that they and their ancestors have been sitting on for two, three, four, ten generations. They can never leave because they have no title to that land. And if they leave, it's gone. They can never sell it. This is--this is a--land titling is one of the most fundamental aspects of development and so the work they're doing, in my view, is God's work. </p><p>JOHNSON: And--and Rob, I just want to comment on that. It--it's hard for us to fathom that you can't prove you own your land but that's the way in most of the developing world. If you can't prove you own it, you can't sell it, you can't demise it to your kids and, importantly, you can't borrow against it. Every entrepreneur I know, starts their business with a loan on a--on a second mortgage. This is way to provide great aid to the developing world because we take dead capital, land that's not titled, and we make it alive. </p><p>SHAPIRO: Right. </p><p>JOHNSON: That's how they jump to the 21st Century. </p><p>SHAPIRO: Right. </p><p>LARSON: And--and I just want to add a story to that. When you are unable, not just to get loans or anything, but when you see your neighbors have had their land taken away arbitrarily, then you're not very secure in what you've got and how much motivation do you have to improve that, to make a long-term investment in your community. It's hard. So once we get that security in the whole area, that's where you really see things take off. </p><p>SHAPIRO: I think we're beginning to see the ways in which blockchain is changing the world. Next we're going to go to Alan--Alan Konevsky who is one of the leaders of tZERO, a leading blockchain-based capital markets company. You apply blockchain technologies to creating and trading financial assets. So you're building a blockchain-based capital market. We already had the world's most advanced and developed capital markets. What can a blockchain-based version contribute? </p><p>KONEVSKY: Absolutely. Thanks for the question, I'm delighted to be here. I--I think really, and--and one of the challenges with thinking about blockchain is often because, you know, there isn't a first principle and frame of reference. And I think the one that Jon started with, trust, helps here as well. And we've talked about it, including context (PH) and land registration, I think, trust as the first principle really helps them to span the application blockchain of good application and bad application across a number of use cases. </p><p>And so, for capital markets, you have an ecosystem and, incidentally, while it's also just a good yardstick of which to evaluate new technologies generally, if it is something that's going through a fundamental problem that people have been experiencing for as long as they've been keeping within the society and it's aiming to do it better; it's probably a good idea. </p><p>And so in this case, looping back to trust, and capital markets, you know, since the development of the current regulatory and operational framework of Wall Street starting in the 30's and then going through the 70's, you--you've come up with a system that enables investors to trust each other largely through a combination of intermediation and--and you have multiple layers of regulated intermediaries that have to satisfy certain requirements, hold certain capital, comply with certain rules, influence certain types of people, subject their books and records to examination supervision by governmental agencies of self-regulatory organizations and it's through those layers of intermediation, and you hear, you know, Jonathan used the terms broker dealers, clearing firms, transfer agents, center clearing counterparties, stock exchanges and others. The idea is that by forcing the transactions to flow through that funnel of intermediation, you are helping people trust that at the end of the day, I'm going to get what I'm paying for and I'm going to get--I'm going to get the proceeds of what I'm selling. Or I'm going to get what I invested in, and I'm going to have reasonable likelihood that my capital subjective, you know, the long end of the sharp stick caveat is going to get, you know, is going to--is going to see a referral. </p><p>Intermediation, however, as a solution to trust brings with it friction, brings with it cost, brings with it delays, brings with it, asymmetries of access and information and therefore potential for manipulation and mischief. And that's really what--what we're trying to address when you look at the Wall Street ecosystem and I think it applies globally as well outside of the United States as well. Honestly, this is the frame of reference globally for capital markets whether--when it comes to raising capital or trading capital as you are--you are bringing a substitute mechanism much how in the voting context or land registration for building that trust. So instead of intermediation, you have a permissioned or permission-less ledger that allows securities to be issued and then trade in the way that produces instant settlement, produces visibility into the capital structure of the company, produces a--an instrument that can be far more flexible than traditional stocks or bonds or other kind of--more or less cookie-cutter tools that you have if you are a company looking to raise capital or if you're an investor looking to deploy the assets that are sitting around to productive uses. </p><p>You can--you can create instruments that are--that are--that are very smart and that--and that can adjust the particular behaviors that you are looking to incentives and disincentivize. They can have compliance mechanisms built into it so from a regulatory perspective, if something is not meant to go into a retirees account, it can never go into a retirees account, no matter how smooth talking the salesman is. And I think--so those are sort of the front-end benefits and then it's helpful to think about it as a front-end benefits of creating instruments that are more malleable, more flexible, smarter, have regulation built into their DNA that give access to assets that, before, were largely reserved to institutions of very wealthy investors. So there's democratization of capital that's involved here as well where now you can take something, whether it's a big real estate project or--or something else that's largely held back from the--the public markets and most of the value creation is--is--is--is--is reserved for private investors and cut it up into smaller pieces and obviously ensuring regulatory compliance give investors an opportunity to participate in that value creation. </p><p>And then there are the backend benefits that come with enabling near instantaneous trading and settlement and--and--and clearing ability to trade these instruments seamlessly, globally, across marketplaces that--that really don't exist now so-- </p><p>SHAPIRO: So a blockchain-based capital market would mean that lots of people could participate in early funding of companies rather than a select group of investment bankers and very large investors. And it's kind of like the next stage of Kickstarter in that respect. And, you know, I--I--my research has shown a long time ago that some time ago that worldwide banks charge about $2 trillion a year in fees for various kinds of transfers from checks to other kinds of transfers. </p><p>And security houses charge a comparable amount; about half. My estimate is about half of those costs could be eliminated through blockchain. That's trillions of dollars. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>That's a large incentive for a very fast-growing market. </p><p>JOHNSON: Well, that's just common every time this--this goes to the bitcoin, or the cryptocurrencies. Every time you swipe a credit card there is a 2 percent to 3 percent to 5 percent fee that the credit card processor is taking. With bitcoin, that doesn't exist. And what does that mean? It means lowering your prices is what it means and so, again, I think this is a way every--when--when Alan talks about friction the middlemen caused, friction, number one, is money. They always take their piece. We can take that out with blockchain. Friction number two is time. It takes time to get your money if you sold something or if your good if you bought it. Friction number three is mistake or mischief. </p><p>People figuring out how to game the system to commit fraud, or, inadvertently making mistakes they've caused you and me, compliance people, regulators, tons and tons of time. </p><p>SHAPIRO: Before I'm going to open it to questions, I want to ask Jonathan one other question and that is, you know, you run a portfolio--we--portfolio of around 20 companies, blockchain companies, we've heard about voting and land governance and capital markets. If you could just briefly tell us other areas that--where blockchain is beginning to make a mark? </p><p>JOHNSON: Banking the unbanked and the U.S., 8 percent of the population doesn't have a bank account. 26 percent are under-banked. They're using check cashing companies all the time. In the Caribbean that's 40 percent of the south--South America, it's 70 percent in--in Africa it's 90 percent that don't have banks. Digital wallets, using blockchain technology. I think will enter the 21st Century to have digital currency so they could buy things online; so they don't have to store their money in their sock drawer and worry that it's going to get stolen. </p><p>Identity; being able to prove who you are in a cryptographically secure way without giving a bunch of trivial arcana (PH) that proves that you are you. Frankly, if I know your mother's maiden name, your second grade school and your first pets name, I can probably prove that I am you. That's wrong. We can do that with--we can do that in a self-sovereign identity way. </p><p>Supply chain; making sure farmers get paid quickly, making sure we know the providence of goods so when you buy a Coach bag online, you know you're getting a Coach bag and you're not getting some knockoff. Monitoring--monitoring agriculture so when there's a recall on lettuce, we're not recalling all of the lettuce, we're knowing where the contaminated farm was that got Representative Soto sick. He ate some bad lettuce and (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>We could be pinpointing these. There are great, great use cases for blockchain. </p><p>SHAPIRO: Thank you. And now some questions. The young lady first because you--your hand was up first. </p><p>QUESTION: Okay. Well, thank you for being here. This has been really enlightening. So, I'm just thinking with the revolution of blockchain, and--and it seems like the prevalence of it in order to be effective, what are the unin--unintended consequences that you foresee happening? For example, when the internet boomed and it became a very close part of our lives, there have been a lot of consequences that we've seen starting from data, our privacy, mental health, all of that, what are some unintended consequences of blockchain technology that you are seeing? </p><p>JOHNSON: I'm ready to answer, unless someone else wants to? I mean, I--I think one--I think it solves some of the unintended consequences of the internet. I think our data gets more private and secure and that's good. I think there's going to be disintermediation of certain industries. You know, when the car came along, buggy manufacturers went away. There are a lot of trust intermediaries; whether they're brokers or title agents who are, you know, they're going to move out of place. But as it's been with every new technology, it tends to create more jobs (INAUDIBLE). So I think that's one. </p><p>I think there's a risk of over-regulation. Bill mentioned earlier, the Supply Chain Caucus and Representative Soto, like a light touch regulatory piece. One of the great things that Bill Clinton did with the internet story was he said, we want this technology to develop free and unfettered regulation. It doesn't mean it didn't--there aren't--there aren't actions that don't get regulated that use blockchain technology, frankly, capital markets are always going to be regulated at some point. Transfer of title is going to be regulated. Voting; who gets to vote? That's always regulated, but don't regulate the technology, I think that's a big concern. Did that address your question? </p><p>QUESTION: I think just--I mean, you've been bringing it--bringing it back to votes, I think that's a really creative way to do it, but I already see so many communities being blocked out from accessing this voting app, right? It's who doesn't have government stated IDs, who doesn't have access to the latest technology or to the latest edition of phones. Like I see the pros, but I also see the cons. </p><p>BRASETH: Absolutely! I think as I had mentioned earlier, it will be a very long time before this becomes the only option to vote. This isn't replacing the traditional methods of you being able to go to a polling place and cast your vote that way. And I think--I think we are seeing a continued trend where more than 85 percent of U.S. American's have a smartphone, not just old phone but a smartphone and so I think we'll continue to see that increase given projections. But to name what your concern is, in terms of voter ID laws, in order to have the convenience of voting no matter your circumstance or wherever you are, we have to find a day to be able to ensure that you are who you say you are and so we have to have that be a tradeoff in this instance. And I think what we're seeing is that a lot of people are saying yes, this is so much more convenient and much more available to the way that I--we all live, in many ways, so many of us live mobile lives. So, yeah. </p><p>JOHNSON: I think it has to be additive initially, it can't be replacing. </p><p>BRASETH: Yeah. </p><p>JOHNSON: It needs to be additive. </p><p>KONEVSKY: Yeah, I think that's--I think that's right. I mean, that certainly has been the experience in the capital market space where this is a journey and it's a journey that's incremental and iterative where you look at the existing checks and balances ecosystem, we've talked about intermediation, we've talked about regulation that supports that intermediation and as you look to--while continuing to address the same critical priorities around investor protection and other topics to have technology do the job of the intermediaries, with the benefits that come with it, whether it's faster, cheaper and--and more accessible, safer, it is a journey that is incremental in narrative and where things are going to be riding side-by-side for a period of time. </p><p>So from a test and learn perspective, you are going to be able to identify the pain points when you're talking about it as you look to, you know, at the end of the day emerged into the 2.0 ecosystem. But there is going to--you know, there's going to be a transitional phase and I think it probably applies across our use cases as well as other use cases in general voting. </p><p>SHAPIRO: There is no doubt that like the internet, this is a disruptive technology. Yes? </p><p>QUESTION: With respect to votes, what is the interface with the list of registered voters? How does that work? </p><p>BRASETH: So the question was, what is the interface with the list of registered voters? So we work very, very closely with the jurisdiction that's piloting the technology. So, thus far, each jurisdiction has decided to do it a little bit differently but the process for you as a voter remains the same where you have to apply to request an absentee ballot and at that moment, if your jurisdiction allows you to use votes you would indicate that rather than receiving it via mail or email, you want to receive a mobile ballot and they keep the list and then are able to send that to us for the invitation for the voter to be able to download and then their identity verification process is back-checked against that list to make sure that they requested and they requested it via mobile, indeed. </p><p>SHAPIRO: Yes? </p><p>QUESTION: I just have a question in regards to the capital markets, again, it's similar to the first question that was asked but in terms of like removing that intermediary, how do you--how would you prevent something an increase like insider trading once you start to remove that kind of that kind of--those safety procedures and how would regulation change to account for that? </p><p>KONEVSKY: Well, I think that as you look to replace intermediation from institutions and individuals with technology while, again, looking to address the same priorities that you have currently from a policy perspective, whether it is lack of asymmetries and access to information influencing trading behavior, for example, whether it is investor suitability, you--you're going to be looking at a couple of things, one is you're going to be looking at the design of the instruments themselves and the instruments are going to be designed in a fairly immutable DNA level that will prevent certain behaviors from happening. So, for example, if you are a corporate insider and you have access to information, you will not be able to initiate a transaction even--no matter how hard you try unless you are within a period where you deem, from a legal policy perspective, to be permitted to trade because, for example, a company just brought out its annual quarterly report. </p><p>And so you are going to be looking--yeah, I think technology design and security is going to be critical. You know, I think part of it is--and I think it comes up in any technology conversation, you know, we--we tend to have a fairly rosy view of what institutions and people do and that's what's happening now; you have a set of rules that's largely policed from a regulatory agency, self-regulatory agencies and regulated private entities and their employees. And, you know, as Jonathan was saying, there are mistakes, there's mischief and so the yardstick isn't necessarily perfection at this point and I think the view is that technology will eliminate a lot of the human contributors to that mischief, to those mistakes. So--and I think that's--you know, that's the answer. </p><p>SHAPIRO: Well, we have time for one more question. Go ahead. </p><p>QUESTION: Hi, thanks for coming. I have a question kind of more on the money side. So, do you think that we'll ever see a world where the governments are issuing cryptocurrencies as their state currency and then if you do see that, what type of network would they run, would that state-run cryptocurrency use and then what implications do you think that that would have on monetary policy for those countries? </p><p>SHAPIRO: By cryptocurrency you mean just a digital currency? </p><p>QUESTION: Yeah, digital currencies, state-run digital currency. </p><p>JOHNSON: So one of the companies that's in our holdings is a company called Bitt, B-I-T-T. It's currently working with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank to help it issue a central bank digital currency. So the answer to your first question, do I think we'll ever see a world where central banks are issuing digital currency is, yes, I think we will. And I think one of the--what's the consequences of that? Frankly, I think it makes things cheaper, 10 percent printing cost, 8 percent printing costs are--are created (PH) and bills goes away. I think it makes transfer a lot easier, if you're populous (PH) has digital wallets that government funds can be sent to, you do it without a lot of bank transfer fees. If a central bank is is--issuing the currency, it still has the ability to do what it does today, decide when to print faster, decide when to print slower unless they decided to print, that seems to be all the time, but it's faster or slower when they--they decide to print. </p><p>So, I still think central bankers will have a role, a big role, maybe I'll have another--a cheaper way to issue currency. Does that address the question? </p><p>SHAPIRO: Let me just say, you know, with any general purpose innovation, whether it was the internet or computers or blockchain, what we first see are the ways in which the technology changes existing activities and existing operations. The next stage is entrepreneurs figure out entirely new things to do with this technology. That's why it's so exciting to be at the beginning of this new general purpose technology. </p><p>I just want to give everyone on the panel a chance to make a closing remark or two and we'll start with you Hillary. We'll go right down the-- </p><p>BRASETH: Thank you again so much and it's also been wonderful to learn more about all that you are working on. I guess to close, I would be very curious to hear if any of you work in offices or spaces that are interested in exploring what a pilot might look like and also I think in terms of their relationship with government, you know, all of you work in this large marble building and at times things move slowly or more slowly than others. And so I think we're really interested in what would it look like for folks to really pioneer what an innovative spirit within our government would look like, and so I'd love to talk with anybody that's interested in learning more about that and also how might we foster deeper relationships between startups and government from just relationally-based to what might funding sources look like as well? </p><p>LARSON: Yeah, we're interested too in government partnerships, mostly with the countries, but if you've got connections, that's great. </p><p>JOHNSON: You're doing something in Wyoming right now. </p><p>LARSON: That is true, Wyoming has a pilot program, we've gone live with that just this summer, so it's (INAUDIBLE). So, I will also put out there that we're on cryptocurrency, (INAUDIBLE), we've got companies already flew in from New York and they're fleeing the U.S. because of their--there's things like the horrendous IRS ruling where every token swapped has--has to be taxed. I don't want entrepreneurial 8-year old Jonathan Johnson to be swapping tokens with his friends and then have to go through that kind of rigmarole, you know, let innovation start and--and at least get that beginning. </p><p>KONEVSKY: Yeah, absolutely, very grateful to be here and share our flaws. I think the point about regulatory evolution, as much as we talk about technological and strategic evolution behind this technology and its applications is also political and regulatory--it is going to be evolution as a (INAUDIBLE) evolution and it is going to be iterative and incremental and that's a good thing and it's a good thing with respect to (INAUDIBLE) question I was asked before about how do we test and learn messengers (PH) of consequences but also in terms of really overhauling, to your point, something that has been around for a long time, has worked well and will work infinitely better. </p><p>I think one of the--you know, of the questions Will asked about it kind of--this in the financial crisis. And if you had, you know, if you had this when the 2008, 2009 events happened, would things have been different? And look, you can second guess this to the cows come home, and the financial crisis was such as multifactorial--and it's hard to reduce it to a singularity but if you think about it as a crisis of trust including a crisis of trust in institutions, the intermediaries that we talked about, including financial institutions that, you know, (INAUDIBLE) explanations, you know, (INAUDIBLE) liquidity and other things that--that have a lot of (INAUDIBLE) fundamentally crisis of trust. </p><p>Then having an ecosystem that had more transparent, or transparency, for regulators, for other market participants in the--for example, portfolios held by Lehman and others financial institutions, had ability to do real-time valuation of assets. Gave--had instruments that were--that--that were designed in a way to automatically adjust to events of great (PH) value themselves that minimize the ability to commit loan fraud so that the mortgage-backed portfolios of that, to some extent, have that mortgages that could, you know, have a lesser likelihood of a company because loan fraud was prevented whether through digital identity with centralized credit check or--of credit checking from the (INAUDIBLE) blockchain-based databases, right. And--and, you know, there--there are a lot of factors here that probably could answer that things could have been different. </p><p>JOHNSON: First, thanks again PPI, this has been fantastic. I never come to a meeting with a member of Congress where there are staff without an ask. Here's my ask. This is the time you get out your pens. Use us as a resource. As your offices think about regulation and legislation that touches blockchain, we have 19 companies with product in production, votes actually being cast in U.S. elections using blockchain technology, land titles being recorded and transferred using blockchain technology, securities being transferred using blockchain technology. If you want to know how it will affect boots on the ground workers in real industries; we're here to answer that question; Medici Ventures, named after the Italian renaissance family, the Medici's which supposedly brought double-entry bookkeeping accounting to the West-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--became great philanthropists afterwards. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>JOHNSON: --going to shoot me down right there. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>We're a multiple-entry distributed ledgers. That's how you can remember us. We'd love to help, we'd love to be your resource, back in Washington frequently. Please reach out to us so we can help you. </p><p>SHAPIRO: Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>MARSHALL: Thank you, Rob, well done. Lovely. Great conversation. Thank you all very much, that was--(INAUDIBLE). </p><p>BRASETH: Rob, thank you so much. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKV-7161-JDPT-T1YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Turning those states blue again should be a top strategic priority for those working to unseat Trump in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recognition of their pivotal status, the Progressive Policy Institute commissioned Democratic pollster and strategist Pete Brodnitz to take a deep dive into voter attitudes in these three battleground states. His Expedition Strategies poll also focuses on swing voters, including those who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016.</p><p>The report sheds light on key issues likely to be on the minds of Michigan voters in next Tuesday's presidential primaries. It finds that progressives have some arguments that resonate in Michigan and the other two states -- particularly their critique of how wealth is accumulating at the top and the need for wealthy individuals and companies to pay more in taxes.</p><p>On the other hand, battleground voters approve of Trump's handling of the economy, with swing voters being especially positive. And the progressive push for Medicare for All is generally unpopular in these states, and has the potential to turn what should be the single best Democratic strength into a liability. To illustrate the danger here - one in four Democrats (24%) \"fear\" a Democratic push for a government-run health care system more than they fear Republican efforts to \"kill Obamacare.\"</p><p>\"It's health care, stupid,\" said PPI President Will Marshall of the issue voters in these states identify as their top concern. \"The key for Democrats is to shift voter attention from the Medicare for All sideshow to the Trump Republicans' continuing assault on Obamacare and Medicaid,\" he added.</p><p>By better than 2-1 (69-31%), battleground voters favor changes that build on the current, public-private health insurance system to a single, government-run health plan. That's true of Democrats too, who favor the former by a solid, 18-point margin.</p><p>Among voters generally, Democrats have an eight-point advantage on handling health care. Among swing voters, however, they have an eight-point deficit. And by 52-48, all voters say they are more worried about Democratic calls for a government-run health care system than Republican efforts to kill Obamacare.</p><p>Here are other relevant findings as the presidential contest moves to Michigan and then Wisconsin and Pennsylvania:</p><p>* By a whopping 72 points, (86-14%), all battleground voters say the U.S. is better off when we encourage trade, and by more than 2-1, they say the same about trade agreements.</p><p>* In Michigan, voters by a 24-point margin agree that trade agreements make the United States better off.</p><p>* Only eight percent of voters in the three battleground states consider climate change the most important issue.</p><p>* Only 30 percent of voters favor an immediate ban on fracking for natural gas, while 70 percent do not favor such a ban.</p><p>* Asked to name the biggest economic risk if Trump wins re-election, most voters choose \"the wealthy will get richer and the rest left out.\"</p><p>* Battleground state Voters here strongly favor a national industrial strategy to create more manufacturing jobs in the United States</p><p>* By a huge margin, (70-30%), voters see tech companies \"as examples of America's great strengths in innovation and entrepreneurship\" rather than as companies that have \"grown too big and powerful and need to be broken up.\"</p><p>* Voters strongly prefer tougher regulation to dismantling big tech companies.</p><p>* By a wide margin (69-31%), battleground voters would prefer to spend more to help Americans without college degrees get higher skills and better jobs rather than making all colleges tuition-free</p><p>* Voters favor an innovative PPI idea -- a change in Social Security that would award benefits based on how many years a person worked rather than how much they earned throughout their career (69-31%)</p><p>This poll surveyed 1,500 registered voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and was conducted February 6-18, 2020.</p><p>Read the full analysis from PPI President Will Marshall here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PPI_SwingVoters_PollNarrative.pdf\">https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PPI_SwingVoters_PollNarrative.pdf</url>).</p><p>[Category: Political]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7044925 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7044925</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC5-9HV1-JC11-11NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><timeReceived>7:06 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 6, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But some on the left have been leveling that accusation behind closed doors.</p><p>Representatives from groups including March for Our Lives, MoveOn, Fight for 15, Social Security Works, Daily Kos and other left-wing heavyweights first began meeting with top Facebook officials just after the midterm elections in 2018.</p><p>Progressives who spoke to The Hill said they asked for the meetings after Facebook removed or restricted many of their pages amid the company's October 2018 purge of spammy political content.</p><p>\"The biggest thing was, 'Clarify the rules for us,' \" Chris Reeves, a longtime organizer who currently serves as a Kansas Democratic committeeman and participated in a meeting over the phone, told The Hill. \"Because nobody seems to understand, and they won't tell us what the actual hard-and-fast rules of their platform are.\"</p><p>Reeves said many of the left-wing activists felt frustrated as they saw their engagement numbers go down while conservatives seemed to dominate Facebook.</p><p>The meetings with progressives, which have not been previously reported, spanned months and involved high-level Facebook officials, including the company's top lobbyist, Kevin Martin; head of global policy Monika Bickert; head of cybersecurity policy Nathaniel Gleicher; director of external affairs Lindsay Elin; and others, according to sources involved in the talks.</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the company held multiple meetings with the groups.</p><p>\"We appreciate the feedback we've received in meetings with these organizations, along with the chance to describe our efforts to be fully transparent in how we operate,\" the spokesperson told The Hill in a statement.</p><p>\"Our policies are outlined in great detail \u00af publicly \u00af as are our enforcement practices and the process people can use to appeal our decisions,\" the spokesperson added.</p><p>By the end of January of this year, many of the groups were left feeling dejected and personally aggrieved, alleging that Facebook officials had taken no substantive action about their concerns.</p><p>\"It felt like they were approaching it like, 'OK, this is one of those days we have to stick it out and get yelled at by these people,' but they don't actually do anything,\" Charlie Mirsky, a co-founder of the powerful gun violence prevention group March for Our Lives, told The Hill.</p><p>Carolyn Fiddler, the communications director for left-leaning news organization Daily Kos, told The Hill her organization has been frustrated with Facebook's lack of transparency over algorithmic changes. She said they are currently negotiating over whether Facebook will include Daily Kos as a Facebook News partner, a source of tension as Facebook has already named right-leaning Breitbart News as a participant.</p><p>Many organizers across the political spectrum know Facebook is a vital tool to organize, amplify their messages and ask for donations. But increasingly over the past year, popular left-wing political pages have been taken down suddenly or had their reach limited by Facebook, the sources said, as the platform tries to act more aggressively against bots and spam following the 2016 presidential election. Right-wing pages have also been taken down and affected by the changes.</p><p>Political activists for years coordinated campaigns on Facebook by having multiple pages and groups post the same message at the same time. But after 2016, when Russian operatives were able to successfully push disinformation campaigns across the platform, some groups said they felt they were punished for using that strategy.</p><p>At a meeting in January, Gleicher told the groups they'd been caught up in a \"net\" as Facebook's systems worked to take down \"coordinated inauthentic behavior,\" the platform's term for online activity that seems spammy or driven by bots, multiple sources confirmed.</p><p>The groups asked Facebook to whitelist their organizations in order to ensure they did not get caught up in future efforts to take down fake campaigns, two sources said. But officials have not followed up on that request.</p><p>On Jan. 29, the groups delivered a set of demands to Facebook mainly focused on \"transparency,\" according to a copy of the demands obtained by The Hill. They asked Facebook to publish \"clear, precise rules\" that would apply to \"pages and publishers of all sizes and ideological orientations\" and asked for the platform to offer more specific explanations when pages were taken down.</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson pointed out that the company updated its Community Standards in April 2018 to delineate more granular details about where Facebook draws the line and why it removes certain content.</p><p>Facebook also notifies individual users, page administrators and group administrators when they violate the company's rules.</p><p>The spokesperson also rejected the allegations that Facebook \"discourages\" sharing posts between pages, but said Facebook has rules against clickbait and spam because people do not want to see it.</p><p>After the talks purportedly broke down, representatives with several of the progressive organizations have joined together to form the Campaign to Regulate and Break Up Big Tech, an effort to make the case to lawmakers and regulators that Facebook can only be reined in through regulation or a total breakup of the company.</p><p>The progressives participate in a weekly call to discuss and strategize around antitrust issues, multiple sources confirmed. And the group has brought the anti-Facebook crusade to key lawmakers and at least one state attorney general.</p><p>Members have met with Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who is leading efforts to write an online privacy bill in the House, and House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee staff, who are probing the country's largest tech companies, including Facebook, multiple sources said.

Cross-border electronic commerce (EC) is certainly included, as well as crossborder movement of electronic information such as data. While the environment which surrounds international trade has seen drastic changes with advancement in digital technology, rule-making for digital trade has lacked uniformity, and its current status is that it has not been able to respond to the rapid changes. This article will provide an overview of the progress in digital trade, and discuss what the current situation looks like for rule-making on digital trade. Cross-Border EC Let us first look at cross-border EC.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The OECD defines EC as follows: 'An e-commerce transaction is the sale or purchase of goods or services, conducted over computer networks by methods specifically designed for the purpose of receiving or placing of orders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The goods or services are ordered by those methods, but the payment and the ultimate delivery of the goods or services do not have to be conducted online.</p><p>An e-commerce transaction can be between enterprises, households, individuals, governments, and other public or private organisations. To be included are orders made over the web, extranet or electronic data interchange.</p><p>The type is defined by the method of placing the order. To be excluded are orders made by telephone calls, facsimile or manually typed e-mail.' According to the 'E-Commerce Market Survey' published by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the market size of global cross-border EC was $236 billion in 2014, and it is estimated to be four times that at $994 billion in 2020.</p><p>The number of users is also expected to increase from around 300 million to exceed 900 million for the same time period.</p><p>The increase is especially significant in the Asia-Pacific region and it is expected to increase nearly seven times from $71 billion in 2014 to $476 billion in 2020. In addition, the percentage share of the Asia-Pacific region in the global crossborder EC market is estimated to be around 50%.</p><p>As shown in the Chart, according to the 2018 estimation results, Japanese purchases in cross-border business to consumer (B2C) EC totaled $250.4 billion and $26.1 billion from the United States and China respectively, and Japanese cross-border B2C-EC sales to the US and China were $823.8 billion and $1.5345 trillion respectively. Purchase amounts by Japan, the US and China increased by more than 7%, 15%, and 18% respectively.</p><p>According to the OECD's definition of EC, while ordering of goods and services is conducted over computer networks, payments and deliveries do not have to be conducted over computer networks to be considered EC. However, services that are provided electronically such as streaming services of music and videos, electronic books and online games can not only be ordered online on computer networks, but the content itself can also be offered electronically across borders, and these are sometimes narrowly defined as crossborder EC.</p><p>These contents are also termed digital products. Digital products that are transmitted electronically do not go through customs, and thus it is extremely difficult to impose custom duties compared to trade in goods. From the perspective of promoting cross-border EC, the World Trade Organization (WTO) came to a provisional agreement at the second WTO Ministerial Conference in 1998 not to impose tariffs on electronic transmissions. Since then, tariff exemption measures continue to be in place. Regarding cross-border EC rules, it was recognized as a new challenge at the WTO Ministerial Conference in 2015, and discussions around rule-making commenced. Later in December 2017, Japan, Australia and Singapore launched the WTO Meeting for the Exploratory Work on Electronic Commerce with the aim of holding discussions on rule-making around the trade dimensions of EC.</p><p>The meeting has been convening since March 2018, and at the Informal Ministerial Meeting, which convened on Jan. 25, 2019 in Doha, a joint statement was released acknowledging the aim for high-level rule-making amongst as many WTO members as possible, and the intention of beginning negotiations at the WTO, which 78 member nations signed (as of March 2020, 83 member nations are taking part in this meeting). Cross-Border Movement of Data Next, let us look at cross-border movement of data. Rapid development of ICT enabled subdividing production process (so-called 'fragmentation') and its global location (so-called 'offshoring'), and the world economy is fast globalizing. In other words, with the global diffusion of ICT, the formation of global value chains (GVC) has progressed. Most recently, progress in data analysis technology and development of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics have enabled further progress in global competition over data accumulation and digitalization of the production process, as well as further globalization of production and development hubs, and the environment surrounding the global economy is greatly changing. In such an environment, cross-border movement of data is soaring.</p><p>According to the White Paper on Information and Communications in Japan published by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in 2017, around 40% of Japanese firms provide data to overseas.</p><p>Also, according to Jacques Bughin and Susan Lund (<url normalizedValue=\"https://voxeu.org/article/ascendancy-international-dataflows\">https://voxeu.org/article/ascendancy-international-dataflows</url>), the movement of global data increased by around 45 times in the 10 years between 2005 and 2014. Moreover, the amount of movement is estimated to be around nine times that of 2014 by 2021. Cross-border movement of goods is also increasing, but its speed falls far below that of data movement. Underlying this situation is thought to be not only a reduction in data transmission costs, but also because Big Data that have been digitalized and collected have become more important as an input of production activities. In other words, there has been a movement to improve productivity by digitalizing the production process which utilizes Big Data such as the Internet of Things (IoT), AI, and robotics. This implies that digitalization of economic activities such as movement and utilization of massive amounts of data is having a greater impact on the shape of international division of labor. It is now not too much to say that the global movement of data and its utilization is the key to not only the progress of globalization of the world economy, but also to the growth of the world economy. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe proposed 'Data Free Flow with Trust' at the January 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p>The Japanese government has stated that 'liberalization of cross-border transactions' and 'restriction on data localization' are important rules for data free flow, while 'banning disclosure requests on blueprints for software such as source codes' and 'banning of disclosure of encryptions' are important for its credibility. On rule-making for cross-border data, there is a need to be mindful of the differences in thinking by country or region. For example, European countries are highly concerned about privacy and personal information, and place importance on protection of personal data.</p><p> With the aim of preventing illegal collection, illegal use and outflow of personal data via the Internet and other means, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was enacted by European Union member nations and also Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein in May 2018. Under the GDPR, firms are required to obtain individual consents to obtain personal information. Japanese businesses will also be subject to the GDPR if subsidiaries or branches are located within the EU, if products and services are offered within the EU, or if they are commissioned to process personal data from the EU.</p><p> Transfer of personal data outside the bloc is only permitted when the country concerned has in place a data protection rule equivalent to that of the EU, but data transfer to Japan is not restricted. China is attempting to enclose data, which is the source of competitiveness in the digital economy, with the government playing a central role in collecting and managing it. For this purpose, China enacted its Cyber Security Law in June 2017 with the aim of achieving leadership and security in cyberspace. In particular, personal information and data collected and generated within China is required to be stored in China, and data transfer to outside of China is generally prohibited. Platform Businesses The so-called mega platform businesses such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (GAFA) or Big Tech (GAFA+Microsoft) have a huge presence in digital trade. Platform firms are businesses that offer systems and various services using IT. Google offers various web services such as email and video distribution with its search engines as the core of its business.</p><p>Apple also provides a cloud service in addition to online sales of applications and contents. Facebook operates a vast social networking website and obtains advertising revenue.</p><p>The core business of Amazon is operating an EC website. Microsoft develops and sells software such as Windows.</p><p>These firms have massive numbers of users and clients throughout the world, and through their operations they acquire and accumulate huge amounts of information, such as transaction information and personal data. China's Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT) are also mega platform businesses. Baidu operates or provides search engines, Alibaba EC, and Tencent social networking services. However, there is a major difference between BAT and GAFA. BAT grew rapidly with strong protection from the Chinese government.</p><p>The majority of BAT businesses are domestic, but because the Chinese market is huge, they grew to become mega platform firms. It is worth noting that the percentage China occupies in the world market of B2C-EC exceeds 50%. But at the moment, the role BAT plays in cross-border digital trade is small compared to GAFA since its main business is transactions for the domestic market. However, overseas businesses have begun, including in Japan, and as the Belt and Road Initiative progresses, the international presence of BAT is expected to increase. Platform businesses have brought great benefits to their users. For example, by using an EC platform, buyers can instantly search for products that are offered around the world, increasing exponentially the variety from which they can choose. In addition, the rating system of transactions is useful in resolving information asymmetry on the quality of products or the reliability of the transaction partners. In particular, information on prices has spread widely, allowing flexibility around price changes, and this has promoted competition among vendors. For sellers, although competition will become more heated as the usage of EC platforms progresses, it has the merit of an expanding market. When the market expands, producers are able to enjoy benefits of scale economies. </p><p>When firms export, fixed costs for cultivating overseas markets (for example, information-gathering expenses and costs of cultivating sales channels) are incurred in addition to transportation costs and tariffs, but by using EC platforms, reductions in these fixed costs are expected. Professor Marc J. Melitz of Harvard University has demonstrated through firmlevel data that the percentage of firms engaging in exports is small, and due to the existence of trade costs, firms that are exporting are large-scale firms with high productivity.</p><p> However, digitalization of the economy can increase the productivity of small and medium-sized firms, and EC platforms are thought to promote their exports. In essence, platform businesses can bring down costs to allow a better match between sellers and buyers, thereby benefiting both sides. On the other hand, there are concerns about platform businesses further increasing in size where their competitive advantage has become fixed and oligopolistic. In particular, the market share of Big Tech in the digital industry is extremely high.</p><p>According to StatCounter, Google, for example, has around 92% of the global market share for search engines, while Facebook has more than 60% of the global market share in social media. For operating systems, Google, Microsoft and Apple make up almost 100% of the world market share. In short, there is a possibility that competition is not promoted and that users are at a disadvantage when market power is exercised. For example, it has been pointed out that platform businesses allow customers to use only payment methods they offer and manipulate information by enforcing their contracts that prohibit letting others know of the content of the contract (non-disclosure agreement), so that customers are corralled. It will become vital to operate competition policies properly to ensure fairness and transparency. Moreover, digital economies facilitate transactions and transfers of intangible assets such as patents, software, and trademarks. </p><p>By conducting cross-border transfer of intangible assets to tax havens, multinational corporations, including big platform firms, are attempting to ease tax burdens. In other words, they are shifting profits to tax havens by manipulating intra-firm transaction prices (so-called transfer pricing) when conducting cross-border intra-firm transactions such as for intangible assets. In order to curb excessive tax-burden easing by manipulating transfer prices, the OECD introduced the 'arm's length' principle. This principle asks for intrafirm transaction prices with overseas affiliates to be at the same level of pricing as with an independent third-party transaction.</p><p>The G20 and OECD are also leading work to put together a new rule for international taxation corresponding to the digitalization of the economy by the end of 2020. Digital Trade Rule-Making At the G20 Osaka Summit in June 2019, a 'Leaders' Special Event on Digital Economy' was convened. Leaders from 27 nations including US President Donald Trump, European Commission President (at that time) Jean-Claude Juncker, and President Xi Jinping of China, with 78 member nations taking part in the WTO Exploratory Work on Electronic Commerce, announced the 'Osaka Declaration on Digital Economy' to launch the 'Osaka Track' which aims to work on international rule-making around the digital economy, especially around data flows and EC. With regard to the WTO negotiations, an agreement was also reached to achieve substantial progress by the Twelfth Ministerial Meeting to be held in June 2020. However, India, Indonesia and South Africa which are G20 members are reluctant about international rule-making for digital trade and have not joined the 'Osaka Declaration on Digital Economy'.</p><p>There are concerns among the newly developed countries and developing countries that most of the gains from digital trade will be scooped off by the multinational corporations, including the Big Tech, with rules for digital trade being decided by developed countries. Thus, it is thought that agreeing on multilateral digital trade rules at the WTO, which has adopted the consensus method in its decision making, will be extremely difficult. In order to overcome that, just as an enabling clause was introduced for developing countries to the WTO rule on regional trade agreements, there may be a need to set some sort of exception clause for developing countries in digital trade. While digital trade rule-making at the WTO has been slow, rulemaking is progressing in regional trade agreements. In addition to its promotion of IT industries, the US is home to mega platform firms such as GAFA, and the US is thus aggressively promoting liberalization of digital trade. In order to gain global leadership in digital trade rule-making, the US is actively trying to include clauses on digital trade in Free Trade Agreements. Included in the agreement text for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which was signed in November 2018, was the digital trade chapter (Chapter 19). Rules in this chapter were developed from the electronic commerce chapter (Chapter 14) in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement.</p><p>The Japan-US Digital Trade Agreement which became effective in January 2020 can be described as being based on the rules of USMCA.</p><p>An overview of the Japan-US Digital Trade Agreement is as shown in the Table. In one sentence, the rules promote liberalization of digital trade once smooth digital trade and its reliability is secured. In the Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) which came into effect in February 2019, rules such as 'banning tariffs on electronic transmissions' and 'banning disclosure request on source codes and algorithms' (Chapter 8) are also included. But whether rules on free transactions of data should be included in the agreement will be re-evaluated within three years of its enforcement. In January 2020, Singapore, New Zealand and Chile came to a substantial agreement on the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), the negotiations on which began in May 2019. DEPA includes rules on use of electronic books in cross-border businesses, protection of personal information, digital IDs, financial technology, AI, transfer of cross-border Big Data, and opportunities on trade and investments for small and medium-sized firms. Singapore also came to an agreement on the scope of negotiations for the Digital Economy Agreement with Australia in October 2019. Similar rules to which Singapore agreed with New Zealand and Chile are thought to be the target of negotiations with Australia. In addition to developed countries, rule-making on digital trade is also under way in developing countries such as the ASEAN members.</p><p>The Framework on Digital Data Governance was adopted in December 2018, and then in March 2019, the ASEAN Agreement on Electronic Commerce which consists of 19 articles on EC was signed. Conclusion This article has given an overview of the sharp increase in digital trade with the rapid development of ICT, and the situation on the formulation of digital trade rules.</p><p>There are considerable differences in perspectives on digital trade, in particular on cross-border movement of data, and even on free transactions and movement perspectives vary widely by country and region. In such a situation, if rules on digital trade become excessive, varying by country and region, it could obstruct digital trade. On the other hand, multilateral rule-making on digital trade led by the WTO, although it has begun, has been slow and we are likely to continue seeing twists and turns. It is likely true that newly developed countries and developing countries are cautious about the rule-making process being led by developed countries. However, the world has fixed its attention on a small country and newly developed nation, Estonia, which has transformed itself into an electronic nation and offers electronic services such as 'e-residency' not only domestically but also to overseas. Singapore is also aggressively digitalizing and is trying to aggressively promote liberalization of not only trade in goods, but also digital trade. Digitalization of the economy and promotion of digital trade can be described as being an effective means for a newly developed country or a small country to leap forward in the global economy. Regardless of the situation, there is an urgent need for basic minimum multilateral rule-making for digital trade so that all nations can benefit from the digital economy with equal opportunities. Eying multilateral rule-making, the Japanese government is expected to continue demonstrating its leadership, as it did with the WTO Exploratory Work on Electronic Commerce or starting the Osaka Track.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JAPNEC-JEF300620200008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JAPNEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6084-NNH1-JCH9-G3YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3342\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Japan Economic Foundation (JEF) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Japan Economic Foundation</publicationName><volume>Vol. 39</volume><issueNumber>No. 03</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 30, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Cross-border electronic commerce (EC) is certainly included, as well as cross border movement of electronic information such as data. While the environment which surrounds international trade has seen drastic changes with advancement in digital technology, rule-making for digital trade has lacked uniformity, and its current status is that it has not been able to respond to the rapid changes. This article will provide an overview of the progress in digital trade, and discuss what the current situation looks like for rule-making on digital trade. Cross-Border EC Let us first look at cross-border EC.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The OECD defines EC as follows: 'An e-commerce transaction is the sale or purchase of goods or services, conducted over computer networks by methods specifically designed for the purpose of receiving or placing of orders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The goods or services are ordered by those methods, but the payment and the ultimate delivery of the goods or services do not have to be conducted online.</p><p>An e-commerce transaction can be between enterprises, households, individuals, governments, and other public or private organisations. To be included are orders made over the web, extranet or electronic data interchange.</p><p>The type is defined by the method of placing the order. To be excluded are orders made by telephone calls, facsimile or manually typed e-mail.' According to the 'E-Commerce Market Survey' published by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the market size of global cross-border EC was $236 billion in 2014, and it is estimated to be four times that at $994 billion in 2020.</p><p>The number of users is also expected to increase from around 300 million to exceed 900 million for the same time period.</p><p>The increase is especially significant in the Asia-Pacific region and it is expected to increase nearly seven times from $71 billion in 2014 to $476 billion in 2020. In addition, the percentage share of the Asia-Pacific region in the global cross border EC market is estimated to be around 50%.</p><p>As shown in the Chart, according to the 2018 estimation results, Japanese purchases in cross-border business to consumer (B2C) EC totalled $250.4 billion and $26.1 billion from the United States and China respectively, and Japanese cross-border B2C-EC sales to the US and China were $823.8 billion and $1.5345 trillion respectively. Purchase amounts by Japan, the US and China increased by more than 7%, 15%, and 18% respectively.</p><p>According to the OECD's definition of EC, while ordering of goods and services is conducted over computer networks, payments and deliveries do not have to be conducted over computer networks to be considered EC. However, services that are provided electronically such as streaming services of music and videos, electronic books and online games can not only be ordered online on computer networks, but the content itself can also be offered electronically across borders, and these are sometimes narrowly defined as cross border EC.</p><p>These contents are also termed digital products. Digital products that are transmitted electronically do not go through customs, and thus it is extremely difficult to impose custom duties compared to trade in goods. From the perspective of promoting cross-border EC, the World Trade Organization (WTO) came to a provisional agreement at the second WTO Ministerial Conference in 1998 not to impose tariffs on electronic transmissions. Since then, tariff exemption measures continue to be in place. Regarding cross-border EC rules, it was recognized as a new challenge at the WTO Ministerial Conference in 2015, and discussions around rule-making commenced. Later in December 2017, Japan, Australia and Singapore launched the WTO Meeting for the Exploratory Work on Electronic Commerce with the aim of holding discussions on rule-making around the trade dimensions of EC.</p><p>The meeting has been convening since March 2018, and at the Informal Ministerial Meeting, which convened on Jan. 25, 2019 in Doha, a joint statement was released acknowledging the aim for high-level rule-making amongst as many WTO members as possible, and the intention of beginning negotiations at the WTO, which 78 member nations signed (as of March 2020, 83 member nations are taking part in this meeting). Cross-Border Movement of Data Next, let us look at cross-border movement of data. Rapid development of ICT enabled subdividing production process (so-called 'fragmentation') and its global location (so-called 'offshoring'), and the world economy is fast globalizing. In other words, with the global diffusion of ICT, the formation of global value chains (GVC) has progressed. Most recently, progress in data analysis technology and development of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics have enabled further progress in global competition over data accumulation and digitalization of the production process, as well as further globalization of production and development hubs, and the environment surrounding the global economy is greatly changing. In such an environment, cross-border movement of data is soaring.</p><p>According to the White Paper on Information and Communications in Japan published by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in 2017, around 40% of Japanese firms provide data to overseas.</p><p>Also, according to Jacques Bughin and Susan Lund (<url normalizedValue=\"https://voxeu.org/article/ascendancy-international-dataflows\">https://voxeu.org/article/ascendancy-international-dataflows</url>), the movement of global data increased by around 45 times in the 10 years between 2005 and 2014. Moreover, the amount of movement is estimated to be around nine times that of 2014 by 2021. Cross-border movement of goods is also increasing, but its speed falls far below that of data movement. Underlying this situation is thought to be not only a reduction in data transmission costs, but also because Big Data that have been digitalized and collected have become more important as an input of production activities. In other words, there has been a movement to improve productivity by digitalizing the production process which utilizes Big Data such as the Internet of Things (IoT), AI, and robotics. This implies that digitalization of economic activities such as movement and utilization of massive amounts of data is having a greater impact on the shape of international division of labour. It is now not too much to say that the global movement of data and its utilization is the key to not only the progress of globalization of the world economy, but also to the growth of the world economy. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe proposed 'Data Free Flow with Trust' at the January 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p>The Japanese government has stated that 'liberalization of cross-border transactions' and 'restriction on data localization' are important rules for data free flow, while 'banning disclosure requests on blueprints for software such as source codes' and 'banning of disclosure of encryptions' are important for its credibility. On rule-making for cross-border data, there is a need to be mindful of the differences in thinking by country or region. For example, European countries are highly concerned about privacy and personal information, and place importance on protection of personal data. With the aim of preventing illegal collection, illegal use and outflow of personal data via the Internet and other means, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was enacted by European Union member nations and also Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein in May 2018. Under the GDPR, firms are required to obtain individual consents to obtain personal information. Japanese businesses will also be subject to the GDPR if subsidiaries or branches are located within the EU, if products and services are offered within the EU, or if they are commissioned to process personal data from the EU. Transfer of personal data outside the bloc is only permitted when the country concerned has in place a data protection rule equivalent to that of the EU, but data transfer to Japan is not restricted. China is attempting to enclose data, which is the source of competitiveness in the digital economy, with the government playing a central role in collecting and managing it. For this purpose, China enacted its Cyber Security Law in June 2017 with the aim of achieving leadership and security in cyberspace. In particular, personal information and data collected and generated within China is required to be stored in China, and data transfer to outside of China is generally prohibited. Platform Businesses The so-called mega platform businesses such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (GAFA) or Big Tech (GAFA+Microsoft) have a huge presence in digital trade. Platform firms are businesses that offer systems and various services using IT. Google offers various web services such as email and video distribution with its search engines as the core of its business.</p><p>Apple also provides a cloud service in addition to online sales of applications and contents. Facebook operates a vast social networking website and obtains advertising revenue.</p><p>The core business of Amazon is operating an EC website. Microsoft develops and sells software such as Windows.</p><p>These firms have massive numbers of users and clients throughout the world, and through their operations they acquire and accumulate huge amounts of information, such as transaction information and personal data. China's Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT) are also mega platform businesses. Baidu operates or provides search engines, Alibaba EC, and Tencent social networking services. However, there is a major difference between BAT and GAFA. BAT grew rapidly with strong protection from the Chinese government.</p><p>The majority of BAT businesses are domestic, but because the Chinese market is huge, they grew to become mega platform firms. It is worth noting that the percentage China occupies in the world market of B2C-EC exceeds 50%. But at the moment, the role BAT plays in cross-border digital trade is small compared to GAFA since its main business is transactions for the domestic market. However, overseas businesses have begun, including in Japan, and as the Belt and Road Initiative progresses, the international presence of BAT is expected to increase. Platform businesses have brought great benefits to their users. For example, by using an EC platform, buyers can instantly search for products that are offered around the world, increasing exponentially the variety from which they can choose. In addition, the rating system of transactions is useful in resolving information asymmetry on the quality of products or the reliability of the transaction partners. In particular, information on prices has spread widely, allowing flexibility around price changes, and this has promoted competition among vendors. For sellers, although competition will become more heated as the usage of EC platforms progresses, it has the merit of an expanding market. When the market expands, producers are able to enjoy benefits of scale economies. When firms export, fixed costs for cultivating overseas markets (for example, information-gathering expenses and costs of cultivating sales channels) are incurred in addition to transportation costs and tariffs, but by using EC platforms, reductions in these fixed costs are expected. Professor Marc J. Melitz of Harvard University has demonstrated through firm level data that the percentage of firms engaging in exports is small, and due to the existence of trade costs, firms that are exporting are large-scale firms with high productivity. However, digitalization of the economy can increase the productivity of small and medium-sized firms, and EC platforms are thought to promote their exports. In essence, platform businesses can bring down costs to allow a better match between sellers and buyers, thereby benefiting both sides. On the other hand, there are concerns about platform businesses further increasing in size where their competitive advantage has become fixed and oligopolistic. In particular, the market share of Big Tech in the digital industry is extremely high.</p><p>According to Stat Counter, Google, for example, has around 92% of the global market share for search engines, while Facebook has more than 60% of the global market share in social media. For operating systems, Google, Microsoft and Apple make up almost 100% of the world market share. In short, there is a possibility that competition is not promoted and that users are at a disadvantage when market power is exercised. For example, it has been pointed out that platform businesses allow customers to use only payment methods they offer and manipulate information by enforcing their contracts that prohibit letting others know of the content of the contract (non-disclosure agreement), so that customers are corralled. It will become vital to operate competition policies properly to ensure fairness and</p><p>transparency. Moreover, digital economies facilitate transactions and transfers of intangible assets such as patents, software, and trademarks. By conducting cross-border transfer of intangible assets to tax havens, multinational corporations, including big platform firms, are attempting to ease tax burdens. In other words, they are shifting profits to tax havens by manipulating intra-firm transaction prices (so-called transfer pricing) when conducting cross-border intra-firm transactions such as for intangible assets. In order to curb excessive tax-burden easing by manipulating transfer prices, the OECD introduced the 'arm's length' principle. This principle asks for intra-firm transaction prices with overseas affiliates to be at the same level of pricing as with an independent third-party transaction.</p><p>The G20 and OECD are also leading work to put together a new rule for international taxation corresponding to the digitalization of the economy by the end of 2020. Digital Trade Rule-Making At the G20 Osaka Summit in June 2019, a 'Leaders' Special Event on Digital Economy' was convened. Leaders from 27 nations including US President Donald Trump, European Commission President (at that time) Jean-Claude Juncker, and President Xi Jinping of China, with 78 member nations taking part in the WTO Exploratory Work on Electronic Commerce, announced the 'Osaka Declaration on Digital Economy' to launch the 'Osaka Track' which aims to work on international rule-making around the digital economy, especially around data flows and EC. With regard to the WTO negotiations, an agreement was also reached to achieve substantial progress by the Twelfth Ministerial Meeting to be held in June 2020. However, India, Indonesia and South Africa which are G20 members are reluctant about international rule-making for digital trade and have not joined the 'Osaka Declaration on Digital Economy'.</p><p>There are concerns among the newly developed countries and developing countries that most of the gains from digital trade will be scooped off by the multinational corporations, including the Big Tech, with rules for digital trade being decided by developed countries. Thus, it is thought that agreeing on multilateral digital trade rules at the WTO, which has adopted the consensus method in its decision making, will be extremely difficult. In order to overcome that, just as an enabling clause was introduced for developing countries to the WTO rule on regional trade agreements, there may be a need to set some sort of exception clause for developing countries in digital trade. While digital trade rule-making at the WTO has been slow, rulemaking is progressing in regional trade agreements. In addition to its promotion of IT industries, the US is home to mega platform firms such as GAFA, and the US is thus aggressively promoting liberalization of digital trade. In order to gain global leadership in digital trade rule-making, the US is actively trying to include clauses on digital trade in Free Trade Agreements. Included in the agreement text for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which was signed in November 2018, was the digital trade chapter (Chapter 19). Rules in this chapter were developed from the electronic commerce chapter (Chapter 14) in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement.</p><p>The Japan-US Digital Trade Agreement which became effective in January 2020 can be described as being based on the rules of USMCA.</p><p>An overview of the Japan-US Digital Trade Agreement is as shown in the Table. In one sentence, the rules promote liberalization of digital trade once smooth digital trade and its reliability is secured. In the Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) which came into effect in February 2019, rules such as 'banning tariffs on electronic transmissions' and 'banning disclosure request on source codes and algorithms' (Chapter 8) are also included. But whether rules on free transactions of data should be included in the agreement will be re-evaluated within three years of its enforcement. In January 2020, Singapore, New Zealand and Chile came to a substantial agreement on the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), the negotiations on which began in May 2019. DEPA includes rules on use of electronic books in cross-border businesses, protection of personal information, digital IDs, financial technology, AI, transfer of cross-border Big Data, and opportunities on trade and investments for small and medium-sized firms. Singapore also came to an agreement on the scope of negotiations for the Digital Economy Agreement with Australia in October 2019. Similar rules to which Singapore agreed with New Zealand and Chile are thought to be the target of negotiations with Australia. In addition to developed countries, rule-making on digital trade is also under way in developing countries such as the ASEAN members.</p><p>The Framework on Digital Data Governance was adopted in December 2018, and then in March 2019, the ASEAN Agreement on Electronic Commerce which consists of 19 articles on EC was signed. Conclusion This article has given an overview of the sharp increase in digital trade with the rapid development of ICT, and the situation on the formulation of digital trade rules.</p><p>There are considerable differences in perspectives on digital trade, in particular on cross-border movement of data, and even on free transactions and movement perspectives vary widely by country and region. In such a situation, if rules on digital trade become excessive, varying by country and region, it could obstruct digital trade. On the other hand, multilateral rule-making on digital trade led by the WTO, although it has begun, has been slow and we are likely to continue seeing twists and turns. It is likely true that newly developed countries and developing countries are cautious about the rule-making process being led by developed countries. However, the world has fixed its attention on a small country and newly developed nation, Estonia, which has transformed itself into an electronic nation and offers electronic services such as 'e-residency' not only domestically but also to overseas. Singapore is also aggressively digitalizing and is trying to aggressively promote liberalization of not only trade in goods, but also digital trade. Digitalization of the economy and promotion of digital trade can be described as being an effective means for a newly developed country or a small country to leap forward in the global economy. Regardless of the situation, there is an urgent need for basic minimum multilateral rule-making for digital trade so that all nations can benefit from the digital economy with equal opportunities. Eying multilateral rule-making, the Japanese government is expected to continue demonstrating its leadership, as it did with the WTO Exploratory Work on Electronic Commerce or starting the Osaka Track.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JAPNEC-JEF300420200009</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JAPNEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXW-HJT1-F00C-6146-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3343\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Japan Economic Foundation (JEF) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Japan Economic Foundation</publicationName><volume>Vol. 39</volume><issueNumber>No. 02</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

In a white paper[1], Libra explains its mission as a euro;oelig;simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.euro;All the Right Steps, on the SurfaceReading through the white paper, I could not help but notice how Facebook masterfully ticked all the boxes that at least on the surface would ease concerns. Governance euro;ldquo; Libra will be governed by the Libra Association which is said to have 100 members by the time of its launch in mid-2020. Facebook is one of the founding members, and it will maintain a leadership role in 2019. The Libra Association is a non-profit membership organization headquartered in Geneva euro;ldquo; nothing says banking and independence better than Switzerland!</p><p> Independence euro;ldquo; Facebook created Calibra, a regulated subsidiary that will ensure separation between social media data and financial data. From permissioned to permissionless euro;ldquo; Libra will start with granting permission to someone to be a blockchain validator node, but the goal is to move to allow anyone who meets the technical requirements to be a validator. The set timeframe is five years from the launch of the Libra blockchain and ecosystem. In its early years, the founding members will be the validator nodes. Despite all of this, it is clear that Facebook is not in the charity business and the driver behind Libra and Calibra is monetizing from commerce by empowering more transactions to go through Facebook. While they say Calibra and Facebook will keep data separate, one has to wonder in how many different ways Facebook will be able to influence peopleeuro;trade;s purchase through advertising. Also keeping data separate does not mean that there will be no learnings shared between the two companies. If you think I am too harsh, I have two words to say to you: Cambridge Analytica! By now, it is also clear that Facebook does not seem to learn from its mistakes, so my level of trust that there will be no cross-pollination between the two is very low. I also have very little confidence that Calibra will be in a position to make decisions that put users first and Facebook second. In this case, the word I have for you is Instagram!Unsurprising Government OppositionI am not the only skeptic, though! As soon as the Libra white paper was made public, the initiative was met with strong opposition both in the US and in Europe. This really should not come as a surprise to anyone given the current stand that governments on both continents have taken on big tech and Facebook in particular. The concerns seem to be multiple, according to Bloomberg[2]. The French Finance Minister is adamant that Libra cannot become a sovereign currency. The European Central Bank calls for keeping Libra at the highest standard of regulation. In the United States, House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters asked Facebook to put Libra on pause while Congress and regulators get answers to their questions. These concerns might touch on different aspects of the cryptocurrency project, but ultimately, they are all about one thing: power. Government officials and regulators are terrified at the idea that Facebook could become even more powerful than it is today. Of course, power, coupled with a lack of regulations in an area that is the backbone of every capitalist economy is a huge threat to the current status quo and a significant risk for consumers.Vulnerability is My Main ConcernMy real concern about the Libra Project is the vulnerability of the audience it is aimed at. If we believe the problem statement in the white paper, Libra want to be a solution for the underserved: euro;oelig;All over the world, people with less money pay more for financial services. Hard-earned income is eroded by fees, from remittances and wire costs to overdraft and ATM charges.euro; I am sure that India will be a key market for Libra, given the high popularity of Facebook. India is not new to being targeted with payments solutions. Back in 2010/2011, when Nokia was still the market leader in the mobile phone market, a lot of attention and resources were put in using mobile payments and microfinancing to reach those mobile phone users who did not have access to formal lending institutions. Back then, it seemed like a no brainer that phones were the way forward: 850 million phone subscribers vs. 240 million bank account holders! The method, however, was not risk-free. Establishing both agent and customers authenticity was hard, technology issues, lack of regulations around privacy and an arduous process to follow when things went wrong, and one had to find someone accountable. Relatable? It should be, as I believe some of the risks and concerns that we had with mobile payments and microfinancing are the same as I have with Libra, but on steroids. I say on steroids because the power and the euro;oelig;profit firsteuro; attitude shown by Facebook time and again amplify these risks. When you have little to no alternative, you are usually more accepting of the solution that is presented to you even when there is a risk. I am not often one to call for regulations but given where we are with social media because nobody paid enough attention along the way, it is clear to me that we cannot afford to do the same with Libra. Thinking we have time because we look at Bitcoin and see it has not scaled would be a big mistake and would totally underestimate the Facebook machine. Today, if I do not trust Facebook I can delete the app, deactivate my account, or simply never bother to use it, once I come to rely on Libra as the backbone of my finances switching off would not be crippling.

Even if that's the goal, it doesn't justify these truly Orwellian means. The fact that the existence of the project was only publicly acknowledged after The Wall Street Journal exposed it indicates that even Google understands how unacceptable this kind of intrusion is.</p><p>Yet the two companies are doing it anyway - and there's apparently no law to stop it. That should change.</p><p>As the Journal reported Monday, Google last year penned an agreement with Ascension, the nation's largest nonprofit health care provider, to gather medical information from facilities across 21 states, including Missouri and Illinois. The data-sharing endeavor, code named \"Project Nightingale,\" was started secretly. The data includes patient names, lab results, diagnoses and other information that, as the Journal puts it, \"amounts to a complete health history\" of patients.</p><p>Consider it: Even as you read this, your personal medical information could be getting crunched in a Google database designed to help the company get a foothold in the health care industry. You had no ability to opt out; you were never even told of it, and neither was your doctor.</p><p>The goal is to develop health care focused artificial intelligence tools to improve clinical effectiveness, Ascension said in a statement - one that came only after the Journal report exposed the secret project. The company stressed it is operating in accordance with federal medical privacy regulations, but that isn't the point. At least 150 Google employees had access to data on tens of millions of patients. Some Ascension employees have raised ethical concerns about the project.</p><p>Google and other tech giants like Facebook and Twitter operate in a Wild West atmosphere of few regulations, even as they gather information about individual Americans on a scale that has never been possible before. Whether it's hyper-targeted advertising, manipulation of politics or, now, deep mining of medical data, their ability to access and monetize every corner of Americans' personal lives is out of control.</p><p>Google and Ascension can cite all the legal justification they want, but the apparent legality of this project only makes it all the more disturbing. Congress should investigate whether any patient data was improperly handled. Just as importantly, it should get aggressive about setting some rules of the road for these tech companies on the gathering and use of personal data. Without them, tech companies will continue to careen out of control.</p><p>- St. Louis Post-Dispatch</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOK-1774E2CFAB3318E8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28985DF53D10B8 NWBKOK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ4-FS01-DXVP-V1PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401975</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"498\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Lawton Constitution<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

And it's such an honor to meet you. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LANCE CORPORAL KYLE CARPENTER (RET), U.S. MARINES: Thanks for having me.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MACCALLUM: More of Kyle's untold story on the podcast. Podcast -- fox newspodcast.com. That's \"The Story\" for this Monday night. I'll see you back here tomorrow. Goodnight, everybody.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The television news business is a very small place, some might call it incestuous. Most of the people who do this weird job for a living know each other. Many have worked together over the years. There aren't that many employers. So it's not surprising that a number of people in this channel including me, once worked across the dial at CNN.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And as any of us can and will be happy to tell you, CNN has always been a liberal place. It was founded by Ted Turner who was an aggressive left winger. But CNN was not always nakedly partisan. They used to be a news network. It didn't always function as it does now as a political campaign. That's a new development.</p><p>What changed? Well, the head of the company changed. The President of CNN now is Jeff Zucker. He is responsible for the change. Here's how I once described him on this program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: From a shadowy layer hidden high above the newsroom, CNN's secretive Dwarf King slithered to the intercom and summoned his minions.</p><p>From across the Cable Empire, they gathered at his beckoning, each with talking points ready.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: So if it sounds like something out of Harry Potter, that's because in some ways it is. You won't see gargoyles at CNN headquarters, but you can feel the political ambitions of the man who runs every detail of that place.</p><p>Since Zucker took overseen and almost seven years ago, it often feels like every segment on that channel is choreographed for maximum political effect. If you have ever seen it, you know exactly what we're saying.</p><p>And it turns out, there's a reason it feels that way. Earlier today, the group Project Veritas released a series of audio and video recordings it says were made by someone within CNN.</p><p>Now as of tonight, we have not independently verified the tape we are about to show you. We did call over to CNN and asked them, but they did not respond. But we have no reason to believe any of this is fake.</p><p>The recordings we are about to show you indicate Zucker is dictating every detail of CNN's programming and doing so with clearly partisan objectives in mind. Here's one example. This is Zucker telling his minions how to shape the coverage of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF ZUCKER, PRESIDENT, CNN: So I just want to say on the Lindsey Graham front, I know that there's a lot of people at CNN that are friendly with Lindsey Graham Time to knock that off and it's time to call him out. And, you know, I think he's under full-time contract now with Fox News.</p><p>He's done his last 26 interviews in cable news with Fox. Okay? And, so, it's time to seriously call out what's going on here.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, got that? That's the standard. That's the news standard at the news network, the cable news network. Lindsey Graham has appeared on Fox, so attack him.</p><p>And so CNN did just that, all while pretending the coverage was legitimate. Here's Jeff Zucker telling his employees that no matter what else is going on in the world, the impeachment of Donald Trump which in effect is a symbolic act, since nobody believes he is going to be convicted is nevertheless the only story that really matters. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKER: We're moving towards impeachment. I mean, don't like, you know --</p><p>We shouldn't pretend, oh, this is going one way. And so, all these moves are moves towards impeachment. So don't -- don't lose sight of what the biggest story is.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: For a newsman, the distinct lack of clarity in those instructions, but the essence was clear enough. Don't lose sight of what the biggest story is, and that's an order.</p><p>Well, the message apparently has been received by the people who work for Jeff Zucker. Listen as a CNN staffer explains that he and the rest of them know exactly what Jeff Zucker wants.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTIAN SIERRA, CNN MEDIA COORDINATOR: Impeachment stuff ... there's new developments every day, more shoes drop and it's like ...</p><p>There's just nothing we can do if Zucker wants impeachment every single day to be the top story.</p><p>And so yes. He wants impeachment, so ...</p><p>JOURNALIST: So, above all else ... I am assuming.</p><p>SIERRA: Above all else.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: There's just nothing we can do if Jeff Zucker wants impeachment every single day. Impeachment above all, and so that's exactly what they deliver day after day, despite the fact that there's really anything new to report. Not really.</p><p>And yet, because projection is the signature hallmark of the left, Jeff Zucker accuses other people of trafficking in fake news. Hilarious. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKER: I think what's going on in America now is really fundamentally the result of years of fake news conspiracy nonsense from Fox News that has taken root in this country and I'm dead serious about this.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I'm dead serious about this. Harrumphs. One of the least serious people, least impressive people, least articulate people in public life.</p><p>Even his own employees can't take that seriously. Listen to one of them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK NEVILLE, CNN MEDIA COORDINATOR: Like, there's a lot of people who were out of here trying to like just do what they think is best of journalistic integrity. And then you get on the 9:00 a.m. call and big boss, Jeff Zucker, [bleep] tells you what to do.</p><p>And it's like you have to like ... to a certain extent, you have to follow his verdict.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, so we're laughing because how can you not laugh? It's just - - it's out there. It's like there's nothing hidden at this point. But it's also poignant.</p><p>Here, you have a kid who works there who thinks it is journalism, and he looks around and he sees people because there are good people at CNN. We know it. Anyone who has worked there knows there are good people who work there, and there are a bunch of them who are trying to commit journalism.</p><p>But the big boss Jeff Zucker, won't allow it. Integrity be damned. Just do what Jeff Zucker says whether it's true or not. Well, that's not journalism, of course, it's the definition of state media, relentless cheerleading; relentless, never ending shilling for the ruling class.</p><p>America doesn't love it. They don't watch it, but everyone in Washington loves Jeff Zucker. Not surprising.</p><p>Robby Soave is an Editor at \"Reason,\" author of \"Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump.\" And he joins us tonight.</p><p>Robby, great to see you tonight. So, look, I don't have any problem with opinion programming. This is an opinion show. We conduct a lot of opinion programming, as I often say, never attack Rachel Maddow because she is not lying to me. She is just giving opinions I disagree with.</p><p>If Jeff Zucker is out there claiming that he is running a news network and his employees are saying things like, there's nothing we can do if Zucker wants impeachment, we have to do what he says. I mean, is that journalism?</p><p>ROBBY SOAVE, EDITOR, \"REASON\": I mean, that's the most interesting thing about this, right? That there can only be one story, right? Every day, there is one story. There's nothing else happening in the world, nothing else worth covering.</p><p>If you're a journalist interested in exploring some other subject, please don't. Please, stop. We don't do that here. Right?</p><p>So that's frustrating, obviously, for the people who, as you said, are good journalists who work there and maybe some days, Trump is not the top story or the slightest minute new iota of news pertaining to Russia or Ukraine or whatever it is. Maybe there's something else that's more important to talk about. No, the orders are that can't be done.</p><p>CARLSON: Well that is so -- that is such an excellent point, and whatever, you know, the faults of Fox News may have, I can say with total sincerity, we've never once in three years been told what to cover. We don't have some centralized morning call where the big boss gets on and says, this is the story. Cover this.</p><p>It's like whatever you think. That's why they hired you, it is to make these calls. CNN, it's a command-and-control system. That just -- it all seems like a bad idea.</p><p>SOAVE: Well, and they act like they're the perfect purveyors of knowledge that can never air. I mean, I disagree with things people say on Fox because there's a range of people who say them on Fox News, you disagree internally.</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure. Yes, that's true. I agree.</p><p>SOAVE: But that's also -- there's nothing wrong with that. But these other networks, some of them, these other mainstream news outlets, they act as if they are -- they represent some sensible center position that is sort of beyond reproach.</p><p>It's different than what you're doing, right? What you're doing is weird or strange. What they're doing is just purveying objective information and they're not on anyone's side.</p><p>I think the thing that's happened over the last couple years, right, is people have realized that's not true. They've stopped believing that sort of lie, that narrative lie about what other journalists do.</p><p>CARLSON: So why wouldn't -- if you were CNN -- you just be honest and maybe have a couple people who really aren't right down the middle. You know, pick one or whatever. But you see the rest of these guys -- Don Lemon and the Cuomo kid -- like they're obviously partisans. There's nothing wrong with that. Why insult us? Continue to insult us by pretending otherwise?</p><p>SOAVE: Exactly, because you are actually a can-do, good journalist and someone with opinions. In fact --</p><p>CARLSON: I couldn't agree more.</p><p>SOAVE: Most people do have opinions. Right? That's kind of the galling thing here. Pretending that you're an objective purveyor of the truth when we know you have opinions.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SOAVE: I mean, that's the good thing about all of this. It's now more out in the open.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SOAVE: I think more people realize that no, there are opinions, and you should take that with a grain of salt when you're considering the information you're being given.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. Stop lying and we can get along.</p><p>SOAVE: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Robby, great to see you tonight.</p><p>SOAVE: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: As Project Veritas' footage does make clear, Jeff Zucker's regime at CNN is only possible with the help of others at the network.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>NEVILLE: Don Lemon is, I mean, love him or hate him, he is blatantly anti- Trump. He's blatantly left. So maybe Don Lemon could disclose that, but CNN makes it appear as though we have 24 hours of unbiased news. That's not true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I have a sense that the Nick Neville kid is in some trouble tonight, unfortunately. Author and columnist Mark Steyn joins us to assess all of this. What do you make of what we've learned tonight, Mark?</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: Well, it helps to confirm why CNN is in the state it is in. If you recall, I think this was the year before President Trump came down that escalator, CNN was -- went nuts over the Malaysia Airlines jet right leading up to their fantastic theory that the jet had flown into a black hole, which you may recall their respected journalists were advancing at one point.</p><p>And you can say what you like about that, but that has a kind of objective surreal nuttiness all of its own. It is in the tradition of a lot of tabloid huckstering and other things, but it's not just putting yourself at the service of one political party and doing the bidding of that party. And I think that's been a disaster for CNN.</p><p>You talk about Jeff Zucker. He has a network to run. And it seems to me a lot of the things that are terrible about CNN before you get to the bias, its sets look dreary compared -- I mean, I say this with whatever objectivity you take it with, but I think its sets look dreary compared to Fox. I think its anchors are not compelling.</p><p>When it has big special events, such as it's rather curious LGBT debate the other night when Joe Biden started riffing on gay bathhouses. In theory, that ought to be must-see TV, but it was a ratings bust, because of the way CNN covered that.</p><p>So there are actual things that as a television executive, Jeff Zucker should be trying to correct and once he has made it less bad in television terms, then if he wants to attend to his political biases, he would at least have accomplished his primary task, which is to be a functioning television executive.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's the interesting fact of all of this. I mean CNN for all of its effort to carry water for the Democratic Party, that's not actually working, so what is the point of this?</p><p>STEYN: No, it isn't and they're in this terrible trap because they started as the first cable news channel and they had a kind of \"USA Today\" image, people just thought of it as something that's there.</p><p>When you go to the airport, it's there, like \"USA Today\" is outside your hotel room door when you're staying at a Marriott or whatever.</p><p>When you when you go to a foreign hotel in Amman in Jordan or wherever, they've got CNN International playing over as you watch your breakfast in the restaurant.</p><p>So they have this bland image, and yet at the same time, they are hyper partisans and they can't make those two things align properly.</p><p>I mean CNN is right now, it is the most irrelevant of the networks. If you want hardcore lefty propagandists, they do that. Again, say what you like about MSNBC.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. It's totally true.</p><p>STEYN: They do that better than CNN.</p><p>CARLSON: I know. Much better. It's actually interesting, I think, I mean, I watch it in the gym every day. Mark Steyn, great to see you. Thank you for that.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, Jeff Zucker wasn't always at CNN. He was at another channel for many years. He ran NBC for a decade. Before that, he was the youngest executive producer at the \"Today\" show.</p><p>Now, things have not changed that much at NBC since Zucker left. We've repeatedly told you the network tried to cover up the Harvey Weinstein story. They sent the \"Access Hollywood\" tape over to \"The Washington Post\" and they're still lying about it.</p><p>Well, this Wednesday night, two nights now, someone who knows an awful lot about NBC is making her first TV appearance since parting ways with that channel nearly a year ago. Megyn Kelly will join us as a guest on this program for her first interview. She has got a lot to say. I hope you'll watch.</p><p>In many American cities, authorities have decided that public safety is in fact less important than the feelings of criminals. Not surprisingly, crime is rising -- violent crime in some places -- and ordinary people are becoming the victims of that.</p><p>In Washington for example, a boy was just stabbed to death at a station taken by thousands of Capitol Hill employees everyday -- a subway station.</p><p>Chief Breaking News Correspondent, Trace Gallagher has the latest on that.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Tucker. On one side of town, the D.C. Police Chief was laying out an initiative to combat crime at the very same time near the Capitol building, a 15-year-old boy riding the Washington Metro line stabbed in the neck allegedly by a 15- year-old girl.</p><p>The boy who was stabbed stumbled off the train, collapsed and died. Police believe the killing was sparked by a dispute between two teens or two groups of teens riding the train.</p><p>Because she's a minor, the 15-year-old suspect's name is not being released, and the reason the D.C. Police Chief was promoting a crime initiative is because the Nation's Capital had five murders last week alone, including a man with special needs.</p><p>But a violent weekend in D.C. is an average weekend in Chicago where seven people were killed, 21 injured, almost 2,200 people have been shot in Chicago this year.</p><p>In Philadelphia, there were two mass shootings this weekend that left one person dead and several wounded, including a 14-year-old boy who has life- altering injuries.</p><p>Finally, Los Angeles has seen 21 murders in the last 28 days -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Remarkable and sad, thanks a lot for that, Trace.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, in a lot of places around the country, authorities appear to be prioritizing the rights and feelings of criminals over your safety, but they're not stopping there.</p><p>They, at this very same time that our cities are becoming more dangerous, measurably more dangerous, the left is taking active steps to prevent you from protecting yourself. Now why is that? That's a larger question. We'll let you think about it.</p><p>But here are the facts. In the State of California, Governor Gavin Newsom designed to build that allows a person's co-workers, employers and teachers to seek gun violence restraining orders.</p><p>In other words, if the boss doesn't like you, now we can ask the cops to take your guns -- without a trial. Colion Noir is a gun rights activist, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>So this, I understand is being sold as a way to make America safer. A, is there any evidence that this would make America safer?</p><p>COLION NOIR, GUN RIGHTS ADVOCATE: No, it's not. You can't name any of the most recent mass shootings that would have been prevented because there was a red flag law in place.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>NOIR: And to be honest with you, I'd go so far as to say, this is probably one of the most dangerous pieces of legislation passed in the most recent history with respect to gun control laws, because the fact that he has broadened the type of people who can bring these types of claims, it basically turns this law into a social political weapon.</p><p>I've had conversations with individuals who simply thought I was crazy, because I had more than three guns. So what do you think is going to happen? Now, when you embolden these people with a law that says, guess what I can do now? I can get into an argument with you and if you raise your voice to a certain level that I don't like, I can now consider you crazy, go and report that and then have your guns taken away.</p><p>And it doesn't even have to be successful. All it has to do is cause a nuisance in my life because now my guns are gone. I have to pay upwards of $15,000.00 to $100,000.00, get a lawyer to defend the case, and I still may lose.</p><p>So essentially, what he has done is he has weaponized the idea of, if you are anti-Second Amendment or anti-gun, you now have the perfect tool to use it against people who are pro-guns.</p><p>CARLSON: So I mean, I missed this just growing -- I grew up in this country. I am 50 years old. I thought I understood our system and I thought under our legal system, you had to be proven guilty before they punished you, before they took your property away, for example, but that's not true.</p><p>NOIR: No, that hasn't changed, well, except for places like California, apparently. But yes, we have a due process right here in this country.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>NOIR: Just because you think something is a good idea, you don't just get to waive my right and say, well, no, I believe this is going to work so therefore your rights don't matter anymore.</p><p>It seems to me, they only had that type of liberal idea of rights when it comes to the Second Amendment and it's quite baffling.</p><p>CARLSON: I know. So what if I think you've got terrible judgment? What if I think you're going to vote for the wrong guy? Can I take your right to vote away?</p><p>NOIR: Again, I think that's exactly what this is designed to do under the cover, to be honest with you.</p><p>CARLSON: I think you're probably right. Colion Noir, great to see you tonight. Thank you for that.</p><p>NOIR: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it's not even a matter of opinion anymore that free speech is under siege in America. It's not a talking point. It's real.</p><p>Adam Carolla and Dennis Prager are pushing back with a fantastic new documentary. They're debuting the trailer for that film exclusively on this show. We will show it to you in just a minute.</p><p>Plus, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is so upset about the climate. She is weeping in public. Why is she flying all the way to Europe to prove her sincerity? We will investigate after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for well more than a century, people in this country, Americans have made the case for socialism. But that seed has never really sprouted and taken root. But that's changing.</p><p>Young Americans appear to be, every poll shows souring on our economic system -- capitalism. Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez set the agenda of the modern Democratic Party, and both of them call themselves socialists.</p><p>It's affecting the presidential field. You can see it every day. Here's one example. On ABC, recently Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont blasted his rival, Elizabeth Warren with the worst insults he could think of. She's a capitalist, he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But there are differences between Elizabeth and myself. Elizabeth, I think as you know, has said that she is a capitalist to her bones. I'm not. And the reason I am not is because I will not tolerate for one second, the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Another difference is, he might be actually even more self- important than she is. We will let you decide.</p><p>Any case, in 2019 that's a real attack on the left. My opponent is a capitalist. Whatever they choose to call it, the Democratic base is demanding socialist policies and increasingly the candidates are happy to oblige.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: I tell you what I believe in terms of democratic socialism, I agree with what goes on in Canada and in Scandinavia, guaranteed healthcare to all people as a human right.</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think undocumented people need to have a means by which they can be covered when they're sick.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants?</p><p>(Cheering and Applause)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Socialism with open borders. That's trend. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky is fighting it. He has got a brand new book out, it is called \"The Case Against Socialism.\" He joins us tonight. Senator, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: So, congrats on the book, by the way, and I bet -- I think your book tour is probably a very interesting window into where we are right now.</p><p>My deeper question is, why are we there? Most of the economic indicators seem positive. Why are people embracing socialism?</p><p>PAUL: Well, it's was kind of an extraordinary thing. I remember when I was a kid, we would say, well, that liberal -- that liberal is probably a socialist, but they would never admit to it.</p><p>CARLSON: Totally.</p><p>PAUL: Now, you have people who are actually running on the label of being a democratic socialist. I think some of it is they've forgotten their history.</p><p>So part of our book, we talk about the fact that Hitler was a socialist, the fact that Stalin was a socialist, the fact that Mao was and then about a hundred million people died in the last century, primarily from genocide and famine and primarily from collectivism and socialism, but they seem to have gotten that.</p><p>But what they now point to is they all say, well, it kind of worked for Castro, but not so much. I mean, we're kind of for Chavez and Maduro, but not so much. What we're really for is Scandinavian socialism.</p><p>So we spend a lot of the book describing the fact that Scandinavia first is not socialist. But we also report that you know what? Bernie is actually too much of a socialist to even get elected in Denmark.</p><p>The Prime Minister of Denmark said, Bernie, quit calling us socialist. We're not socialist. We're open for business, and you're ruining our business by telling the world we're socialists and we're not.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the socialism of Norway is based on oil deposits. It's a petrol socialist state. So what's interesting, though, is that conservatives often say socialism makes people poorer. But the people who run socialist systems always want it very rich, I've noticed.</p><p>PAUL: We make that point in the book that there's always a top one percent. In our country, it's largely based on merit and socialism is largely based on who you know, whether you are related to Maduro, you know you are wealthy and can have plenty to eat.</p><p>So for example, in Venezuela, the average person has lost 20 pounds over the last year, Maduro has gained about 50 pounds over the last couple of years. So Maduro is getting bigger and bigger --</p><p>CARLSON: Is that literally true?</p><p>PAUL: Oh, yes, he can't even fit work clothes. I mean, and so Maduro is so fat, his generals are fat. They're all well fed, but the average person has lost 20 pounds. That is a statement of what the top one percent is like in socialism.</p><p>CARLSON: So it doesn't care -- I mean, because I think it is fair, there's -- a concern I have, if inequality becomes so profound, it causes instability in your society. I think that's part of the reason what we're seeing now. But socialism is not the cure for that.</p><p>PAUL: Right. And actually, we looked at income inequality also and find that the studies by Thomas Piketty and others really aren't true. It actually turns out that if you look at income inequality in developed nations, income inequality is actually proportional to economic growth.</p><p>It doesn't slow down economic growth at all, and really what we should be concerned about, you know, which society would you rather live in where the average poor person makes $30,000.00 a year and the average rich person makes $100,000.00 or the average poor person makes $60,000.00 and the rich people make $4 million?</p><p>It really shouldn't matter what a rich person makes, you really want the average that the poor folks make to be increasing, and that's what's happening in capitalism.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. Envy is real. I have to ask you about the Syrian question, since you're one of the very few elected officials in Washington, who appears to be at least sympathetic to the President's position that we ought to pull troops out of Northern Syria.</p><p>Why is the response been bipartisan an outrage? Almost universally here, everyone hates this idea.</p><p>PAUL: It's sort of one of the strange compromises in Washington, they all seem to be in favor of continued intervention everywhere. They never believe you can come home.</p><p>When President Trump talked about coming home from Afghanistan, the immediate response was it would be precipitous, and I'm like 19 years and it's precipitous to come home?</p><p>So really, it's really appalling, but there seems to be almost nobody really looking at the situation, but we will tell you one extraordinary thing.</p><p>For months, I've been saying, you know what? The best chance the Syrian Kurds have is actually making an alliance with Assad to protect them against the Kurds. That's already happening.</p><p>As we speak, they're beginning to have an alliance. Their best chance of having some kind of autonomous zone is being part of Syria and reassuring Turkey that they're not going to be making incursions into Turkey.</p><p>That's what happened in Iraq. There is a Semi-Autonomous Region for the Kurds, but they're within the government of Iraq. And they've gotten the surety that they're not going to invade into Turkey.</p><p>Interestingly, there 1,800 Turkish businesses in Kurdistan, the Kurdish area of Iraq now and they are actually getting along pretty well. That could happen in Syria, too, but we've prevented it because we keep saying you can't talk to Assad. Assad must go.</p><p>But really, you probably do have to eventually talk to Assad to have peace there.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, it's not even clear why we're saying that. That's very confusing. Senator, thank you very much. Great to see you tonight.</p><p>PAUL: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Congrats on the book.</p><p>PAUL: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez isn't simply passionate about socialism, she also says she is so worried about the environment that she can barely function.</p><p>Last week, she took a jet to Copenhagen and was reduced to tears thinking about how irresponsible it would be for her to have children.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): If I were to have a child in the next few years, he, she or they will have to contend with a world where some of our most precious critical infrastructure goes underwater.</p><p>I speak to you as a human being, a woman whose dreams of motherhood now tastes bittersweet because of what I know about our children's future, and that our actions are responsible for bringing their most dire possibilities into focus.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: He, she or they, even when she is having a climate meltdown, Ocasio-Cortez always remembers to express the current gender orthodoxy. She knows what's most important.</p><p>Marc Morano is the publisher of \"Climate Depot\" and the author of \"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change.\" He joins us. Hey, Marc, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>So I don't want to dismiss this as what it obviously appears to be, which is something that a psychiatrist would address; I mean, this does seem -- right -- lacking in perspective? I think this is pretty common. I don't think she's the only person who feels this way.</p><p>MARC MORANO, PUBLISHER, \"CLIMATE DEPOT\": No, she's not, and there's actually about five decades of environmental left wing, you could argue the Socialist Movement behind going -- attacking having kids and scaring kids.</p><p>If you go back to the 1960s, Paul R. Ehrlich's overpopulation bomb book led to the same kind of thing. People fretting over having kids. People worried about kids.</p><p>CARLSON: But we don't have -- we don't have enough kids in the West. We're actually doomed to extinction, almost every western country and Japan, are they aiming this at Africa? Is Ocasio-Cortez looking at Sub Saharan Africa and saying, no more kids for you?</p><p>MORANO: I think she is sincere. She probably believes we're doing -- see Al Gore himself went to a Bill Gates function and said Africa is projected to have more population than China and India combined. And he called -- he called for what he called, quote, \"ubiquitous fertility management\" in Africa.</p><p>Here was Al Gore basically telling at a Bill Gates event that they're going to be too many Africans in the next century and we needed fertility management to keep Africans in check.</p><p>CARLSON: What's fertility -- dare I ask -- it is making me uncomfortable just thinking about it.</p><p>MORANO: I think he is talking about access to birth control somehow, but - -</p><p>CARLSON: Sterilization.</p><p>MORANO: But the best access to, you know, population control if that's what you want to call it is wealth. The wealthier a country gets, the smaller the family size gets. So if they were really worried they would want wealthier --</p><p>CARLSON: The left really wants to make this argument that the third world needs to stop reproducing. I mean, that's a creepy argument that the kids are the problem? Is that really what they're arguing?</p><p>MORANO: Absolutely. In fact, there was a climate activist named Eric Holthaus, he is a meteorologist who announced to the world he would not have kids. He and his wife decided they wouldn't. Two years later, he welcomed his kid into the world and said it gives them the greatest hope ever.</p><p>Kids are hope. And what they're trying to do is first of all scare the kids that we have and they're trying to scare people not having them and even worse now, they're scaring kids.</p><p>There's over 5,000 kids who signed a Canadian pledge not teenagers, not to have kids when they're older until government acts on climate.</p><p>They've tied having kids and scaring kids to pass it to the Green New Deal. Congress -- all teenagers testifying, calling themselves the Green New Deal Era. That's what they're calling themselves now.</p><p>The kids of the Green New Deal Era and they will not basically will not have a future. They said anyone who says they have a future is a liar unless we pass the Green New Deal.</p><p>CARLSON: That's not science. This is not science.</p><p>MORANO: This is so far removed from science.</p><p>CARLSON: It's a cult, obviously.</p><p>MORANO: Yes, it's sad.</p><p>CARLSON: Children signing a pledge not to have children. That's -- it's hard to believe. This is deeply --</p><p>MORANO: The state -- it is the regulatory state using kids now to try to argue. They are using the climate scare as nothing but the latest environmental scare to push central planning, sovereignty, limiting treaties and wealth redistribution.</p><p>There's nothing unique about the global warming scare, every scare since the 1960s has had the same as solutions.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. More power for them. Marc, thank you for that.</p><p>MORANO: Thank you, Tucker. Appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: Adam Carolla and Dennis Prager have a new documentary about the battle against speech on college campuses. They're debuting a new trailer for the film exclusively on this show. And that's next.</p><p>CARLSON: America's universities used to be centers of free thought and open inquiry. That was the whole point of having them. That era is fading from memory though.</p><p>Today's schools exist to compel far-left orthodoxy and dissent, any dissent, carry serious social, economic and sometimes physical risks.</p><p>Adam Carolla and Dennis Prager are not intimidated by any of this though. They are two of the country's most aggressive defenders of free speech, and they've teamed up on a new documentary called \"No Safe Spaces.\" That film has a new trailer and they've chosen to debut it on this program. We're flattered. We'll talk to both of them in just a minute. But first, here's the trailer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You are not listening.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want your job to be taken from you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A protest has turned violent at California Berkeley.</p><p>DENNIS PRAGER, FOUNDER, PRAGER U: This is why we're fighting for the soul of America.</p><p>ADAM CAROLLA, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: You should be able to share ideas without fear of being fired from your job or shouted down.</p><p>PRAGER: You are not to be heard. This is one of the few things one could say we have no precedent for in the United States.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You have the right to remain silent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The only way we separate the good ideas from the bad ideas is to be free to say whatever we want about them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Anything you say will be used against you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There's no free speech for a fascist.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Your posts on Facebook, Twitter and social media will be to saved to shame you.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Kevin Hart has stepped down from hosting this year's Oscars.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Anything you say that we don't like will be used to shut you up.</p><p>You can't be funny.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's creating an atmosphere of fear and repression and it's going to bust.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You cannot think differently.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It makes it difficult for you to learn from other people.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ain't it spooky we are having this discussion?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: You can't challenge us.</p><p>CAROLLA: Kids grew up dipped in Purell playing soccer games where they never kept score.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is no debate.</p><p>DAVE RUBIN, HOST, THE RUBIN REPORT: The type of diversity they hate is diversity of thought.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We reserve the right to be offended by everything.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No university should ever create a safe space.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you're not going to protect people, and so the best you can do is to make them strong.</p><p>PRAGER: It bothers me for the young people who are being deprived of anything that could open their minds.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: You have the right to remain silent.</p><p>TEXT: No Safe Spaces: You have the right to remain silent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Ah, it makes your heart pound. Adam Carolla, and Dennis Prager, join us tonight. Thank you both for coming on. Adam, first to you. You spent a lot of time thinking about this subject, particularly as you made this film? Are you more hopeful or less at the end of it?</p><p>CAROLLA: I'm more hopeful because, you know, we talk to our mutual friend, Dr. Drew all the time, and I do a podcast with him. And he keeps saying, when is the pendulum going to swing back? And I said, not yet for many years, but a few specials have come out.</p><p>The Dave Chappelle special came out, Bill Burr -- comedians. Comedians are going to lead the charge and those guys did stand up specials, basically saying screw you to the PC police. And that, to me is an indicator along with movies like this film, \"No Safe Spaces\" that we're starting to swing back towards sanity.</p><p>CARLSON: Man, I hope you're right. So Dennis for the average person watching this and I think a lot of our viewers will watch this. I hope they will. And they'll have the same reaction I did, which is you could feel the blood pounding your ears? What can they do? How can they advance the ball on free speech a little bit.</p><p>PRAGER: I divide good people into three groups, those who fight, those who help the fighters and those who do nothing. Unfortunately, throughout history, the third group is the largest.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>PRAGER: It's just a fact. I am not happy about it. But it's a fact. Those who help the fighters are as important as the fighters.</p><p>So this film is in the fighting category. It's also in the entertaining category. It's -- you'll laugh and you'll cry -- both. But if you go to the film, believe it or not, that would be a huge thing. If this film is a big success. This is a message to Hollywood. This is a message to the universities. People need to know what is happening.</p><p>As I have said for much of my career, sending your child to college is playing Russian roulette with their values.</p><p>CARLSON: That's true. That is absolutely true. So, I mean just to be -- I want to openly promote this film. How will we be able to see this and when?</p><p>CAROLLA: It's coming out in Phoenix on October 24th and the first show is sold out, but there's going to be shows added. And if we can get enough people --</p><p>I mean, the way the business works is if we can get enough people in early then we can expand it throughout the nation.</p><p>CARLSON: How have -- I mean, you guys both live out in California. Tell me how have your friends, people you know, responded to your doing this?</p><p>PRAGER: Let me let me tell you something. This may be almost out of line. I did not expect this film to be as excellent as it is. I thought it would be good. It's great. It's not great, because I'm in it. It's great and I'm in it.</p><p>CAROLLA: It would be better without Dennis that's for sure.</p><p>PRAGER: Right, but -- never the less it's great.</p><p>CAROLLA: Oh yes, in spite of you.</p><p>PRAGER: That's important.</p><p>CARLSON: That's how good it is.</p><p>CAROLLA: Right.</p><p>PRAGER: Yes.</p><p>CAROLLA: He is kind of a sandbag to my gondola, but it's -- I'm still soaring is what he is saying.</p><p>PRAGER: In fact, it's already prepared as an epitaph for me, Dennis Prager was a sandbag to Adam Carolla's gondola.</p><p>CAROLLA: And my beautiful bullhorn. Yes, you know the thing -- this is a bipartisan picture and I've showed it to crowds and my fans and other people's fans and it's equally balanced.</p><p>There are voices on the right voices and voices on the left and they all agree on one thing which is their voice. It's called voices on the right and voices on the left. We want our voices intact.</p><p>PRAGER: This, by the way is part of my thesis. This film proves a thesis of mine. There is a world of moral difference between the left and liberal. We have a lot of liberals who are very worried about the suppression of free speech. It's a divide -- it is one of the dividing lines along with race, a leftist believe in black dorms, liberals do not believe in all black dorms.</p><p>This free speech issue should be one of the great reasons why liberals are worried about the left.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's right. We interview decent people on the left, Glenn Greenwald, you know, and many others on this show who were every bit as exercised as anyone in -- you know, who works here about the lack of free speech.</p><p>Are there comedians, do you think apart from Dave Chappelle, who are the people who are going to be leading the renaissance of free speech?</p><p>CAROLLA: Other than the comedians? I think many podcasters. I think our Dave Rubin. Obviously.</p><p>PRAGER: Oh he is asking actually about comedians. Are there other comedians other than Chappelle?</p><p>CAROLLA: Oh, other comedians.</p><p>PRAGER: Other than you, obviously.</p><p>CAROLLA: There's me. There's Chappelle. I mean, there's -- here's what comedians do. Comedians hit a saturation point and then they push back. I mean, consistently throughout society, that's what they do.</p><p>And all the comedians, I know, had been hearing this pabulum that's been spoon fed to them with safe spaces and huggy boggies and you know, the PC police and it's all just been percolating inside them and then we vomit out the truth at some point.</p><p>So many comedians I know who were frightened four or five years ago to speak about certain subjects are now wanting to sort of come back with a vengeance the other direction.</p><p>CARLSON: That's great. I think guys like Jimmy Dore on the left, you know, I don't know what else we agree on. But I mean, I think there are people like that who are totally sick of this. Clearly totally sick of it. It is a kind of tyranny. And thank you both for fighting back against it this.</p><p>This film is out later this month and I hope that all of our viewers will watch it. Thanks a lot.</p><p>PRAGER: Thank you.</p><p>CAROLLA: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, China as you know is a rising threat to this country, not just economically, but militarily and that's ominous. How did that happen? Because our elected officials allowed it to happen. We have shocking new details on who, how and when? After the break.</p><p>CARLSON: For the past 30 years, China has risen from one of the poorer countries on the globe to of course, a superpower. And every step of the way, China has had help from the people who run our country, who most of the time have been happy to give the Chinese a boost in order to enrich themselves.</p><p>By the way, they haven't simply made China richer, they have made it far more powerful militarily. Here's one example. In 1994, the Clinton administration cut a deal with China to let them buy special machine parts for manufacturing missiles and aircraft.</p><p>China quickly broke its terms on the deal, so in return, for surrendering a major economic and military advantage, America got nothing.</p><p>It's a remarkable story and it's been chronicled in painful and fascinating detail by Matt Stoller, he is a fellow at the Open Markets Institute. He wrote about that deal in his book, which is outstanding called \"Goliath: The 100-Year War between Monopoly Power and Democracy.\" He joins us tonight.</p><p>Matt, thanks so much for coming on. I can't overstate how mesmerizing I found your account of this was. It's just jaw dropping. You have every detail, and it's infuriating, but sum it up for us in the few minutes that we have. What exactly happened here?</p><p>MATT STOLLER, FELLOW, OPEN MARKETS INSTITUTE: Well, it's a great question. So my book \"Goliath\" is about America's monopoly problem. And in the first half of the 20th Century, we took on concentrated power and then in the second half of the 20th Century, this is way of giving context to the basic problem.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STOLLER: We allowed concentration in markets all over the country, everything from search engines to syringes to baby formula, and part of that was a decision by people on the left and the right to say, big is good. And that decision happened in the 1970s.</p><p>By the 1990s, Bill Clinton came in with a strategy called Engagement for the Whole World. And his idea was that, if you allow our monopolies to trade with China, then China will become democratic, even if you have to make some moral compromises on the way.</p><p>And so part of what happened when they allowed McDonnell Douglas to sell these machine tools to China, they said, well, that's not a big deal, because all we really want to do is establish trading relationships with China. And obviously, it was a catastrophe.</p><p>But it was seen as sort of not a big deal in the context of the 1990s and the 2000s because the whole goal was to establish more and more trading relationships with our monopolies into China.</p><p>CARLSON: But it turned out to be a huge deal, because over the long run, it helped China come very close to eclipsing us.</p><p>STOLLER: Well, that's true, and it's -- we're in a really dangerous situation right now because we have again, we have monopolies all over our economy. And when you concentrate power domestically, then you empower foreign influences, in particular China to take power over us.</p><p>And you see it with the NBA, but you've also seen it in corporate America, Hollywood. You see our corporations, Marriott, Apple, all kind kowtowing into China because China has control over vital inputs and services and China is a large market. And this was a strategy that was put in place by the Clinton administration and then the Bush administration.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STOLLER: And it's about concentrating power in a small number of hands. So the way to deal with it is very simple. If something is too big, make it smaller. So the first thing that we need to do is make our corporations smaller.</p><p>If our corporations are smaller, then China won't have as much leverage over them.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I couldn't -- I couldn't agree with you more and the applicant -- one of your recommendations you said on the show is to break up some of the big tech monopolies.</p><p>Matt Stoller, I hope you will come back on the show. Congrats on the book. It's fantastic.</p><p>STOLLER: Thanks a lot.</p><p>CARLSON: The part I read was amazing. Up next, a Washington professor says that one of America's most pressing problems is a racist, sexist children -- it's a cartoon. You're going to want to know a lot more about that obviously, because it's a massive threat to you. After the break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Spongebob Squarepants.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: He lives in a pineapple under the sea. He is absorbent, yellow and porous. Those are the good points, unfortunately, he is also racist. That's what a University of Washington academic says about wait for it -- Spongebob Squarepants.</p><p>The problem, according to Professor Holly Barker who apparently actually works there is that Spongebob's underwater hometown is called Bikini Bottom. The name presumably comes from the Bikini Atoll, the nuclear test site and that's not okay according to Professor Barker.</p><p>Spongebob's big pineapple house, his favorite burger restaurant, the Krusty Krab, quote, \" ... normalized the settler colonial takings of indigenous lands while erasing the ancestral Bikinian people,\" end quote, all of which means the final and total collapse of American higher education can't come soon enough to save this country from morons like Professor Barker.</p><p>That's it for us. We'll be back tomorrow night. The show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Sean Hannity right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019101401cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8M-G9R1-DXH2-649J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7899\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Journalism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CNN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Children</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Socialism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Rand Paul</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Education</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Military</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Spongebob Squarepants</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Racism</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

NetCho...</p><p>A trade association for online businesses and a think tank in two research papers released Thursday pushed back against antitrust concerns raised about Facebook and other internet platforms, with both papers arguing the companies are not monopolies.  NetChoice and the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation both played down the concerns surrounding big tech companies even as U.S. and global competition regulators and lawmakers scrutinize the firms. As part of policymakers' inquiries, the heads of Google's parent company, Alphabet; Amazon; Apple; and Facebook are scheduled to testify before a House Judiciary subcommittee next week.  NetChoice's report argued that Facebook is nowhere close to a \"near-monopoly\" and currently faces growing competition, countering points levied in a paper released by the Omidyar Network last month. The Omidyar paper painted a \"road map\" of an antitrust case that could be waged against Facebook based on analysis conducted by the U.K.'s antitrust regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority.  NetChoice argues that Facebook is a \"two-sided platform\" that must compete for both social media users and advertisers.  On the user end, NetChoice claimed that Facebook must fight for eyeballs among competitors that include YouTube, Snapchat, Twitter, Pinterest and TikTok. On the advertising side, it said Facebook's current operations and capabilities were akin to those of a \"communications company.\" Thus, the market Facebook is competing in includes Google, Amazon, AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast.  The ITIF said tech firms as a whole were competing \"with each other for the scarce attention\" of the same users when selling ads, which meant that Google competed with TikTok and Facebook even if it held a dominant position in search engines. The think tank also said the firms competed with television, radio, and newspapers for the same ad dollars and eyeballs.  According to NetChoice, the Omidyar Network paper defines the markets too narrowly for Facebook, excluding competitor YouTube and adding together the market shares of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp to arrive at the total 75% share of the U.K. social media market that it touts.  \"[T]hey go on to define the relevant market so narrowly that their definition might as well be 'Facebook and only Facebook,'\" the report read.  The NetChoice paper also argues that Facebook will continue to face increasing competition as its target user base gets more dynamic. The social network has had a decline in market share and user time spent on the site since 2015, according to the paper. Facebook now competes with Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat for the attention of today's teenagers, who often use many social media platforms.  The ITIF argued that tech firms aren't actually as dominant as they seem when compared to the power of automobile and gas companies in the 1960s. While these large firms do attract large profits, the think tank said the companies did not have significant political or economic power.  Both NetChoice and ITIF both took the position that tech companies have engaged in pro-competitive conduct. NetChoice pointed to Facebook's development of \"data-backed tools\" that give advertisers more value and boost exposure for small publishers, while the ITIF said tech platforms were improving resource use and increasing competition by making the market bigger.  Netchoice also pointed to Facebook's acquisition of Instagram, which it claimed made the app better.  \"Facebook's acquisition made Instagram better, which thereby increased consumer welfare. Once it joined Facebook, the platform went from being a small player with few users to one of the most popular in the country,\" the paper read.  The Omidyar Network paper was pushed towards several government entities last month by the public interest group Public Knowledge. The paper was written by Yale University economics professor Fiona M. Scott Morton, a former chief economist at the DOJ's Antitrust Division, and David C. Dinielli, a senior adviser with the Omidyar Network. Recent reports said that Morton also has been working as an adviser for Amazon and Apple.

The corporation's goal is to replace democracy with algorithmic decision-making, believing the latter to be more efficient.\"</p><p>McNamee's letter comes as Sidewalk Labs'participation in Waterfront Toronto's Quayside project has come under increased scrutiny.</p><p>Quayside is a 12-acre patch of land for which Sidewalk Labs - selected by Waterfront Toronto as an \"Innovation and Funding Partner\" - is currently crafting a Master Innovation and Development Plan (MIDP) aimed at transforming the area.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto was created by all three levels of government and tasked with overseeing the city's redevelopment along Lake Ontario. (Andrew MacLeod, president and CEO of Financial Post owner Postmedia Network Canada Corp., was recently named to the agency's board of directors.) The agency has yet to receive Sidewalk Labs'proposal, but plans to make public when it does.</p><p>The project, however, has faced concerns over how personal data and privacy issues will be handled, with a #BlockSidewalk campaign pushing Waterfront Toronto to \"reset\" the project. A vote by the agency's board on the Quayside MIDP has reportedly been pushed back to late this year or early next.</p><p>In a statement on Twitter, a Sidewalk Labs spokesperson said the company looks \"forward to presenting more details of our proposal in the coming weeks\" and that the company believes \"that this new neighbourhood could in fact set a new standard of privacy and forward-thinking data policy.\"</p><p>A statement from a Sidewalk Labs spokeswoman to Financial Post also pushed back on McNamee's concerns, saying he \"does not seem very familiar with what Sidewalk Labs is actually proposing.\" The company cited a mention in the letter of facial recognition, a technology Sidewalk Labs says it had already ruled out.</p><p>\"As we have made clear, we believe that data collected in public space must be overseen and closely controlled by an independent and publicly accountable Data Trust, not Sidewalk Labs, Google, or any private company,\" Keerthana Rang wrote in an email.</p><p>\"We believe that this district will in fact set a new standard of privacy and forward-thinking data policy, and we look forward to presenting more details of our plan in the coming weeks.\"</p><p>Diamond, though, challenged whether or not the technology Sidewalk Labs will bring to the Quayside development will be at all innovative. Of the company's proposal to have freight delivery and waste collection through underground tunnels, Diamond says that \"was built in Chicago in the 19th century.\"</p><p>He calls a proposal to have \"building raincoats\" that shield structures from weather and regulate temperature \"laughable\" and a \"pathetic rainscreen.\"</p><p>\"The building designs illustrated could not be more conventional, not to say boring,\" adds Diamond.</p><p>He closes by saying the Sidewalk Labs \"process should be reversed,\" and that the city should set ground rules \"by establishing ownership of data, satisfying the need for personal privacy (ie., no data gathered without the individual's consent) the financial framework, spell out the implementation structure, the composition of the development company, and ownership of all data gathered.\"</p><p>\"Above all the City should retain consultants with expertise equivalent to that of Sidewalk Labs, which clearly is not the case at present.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

California Passes Landmark Privacy Law for Online Data</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Portland: Common Dreams has issued the following press release:  While some critics worry the legislation doesn't nearly go far enough, other observers are saying \"California could be the bellwether for the privacy movement\" after the state legislature on Thursday unanimously passed and Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law the nation's toughest digital privacy rules. As TechCrunch outlined, once the new law takes effect in January 2020:  Businesses must disclose what information it collects, what business purpose it does so for and any third parties it shares that data with.  Businesses would be required to comply with official consumer requests to delete that data. </p><p> Consumers can opt out of their data being sold, and businesses can't retaliate by changing the price or level of service.  Businesses can, however, offer \"financial incentives\" for being allowed to collect data.  California authorities are empowered to fine companies for violations. Even though it could set a new national standard, as Lee Fang reported earlier this week, citing emails obtained by the The Intercept, \"lobbyists for the largest tech companies\" quiety fought for the \"compromise privacy legislation\" in order to keep an even stricter measure off the ballot in November. The ballot initiative, Fang wrote, aimed to enable consumers \"to opt out of the sale and collection of their personal data,\" significantly expand \"the definition of personal information to include geolocation, biometrics, and browsing history,\" and even allow \"consumers to pursue legal action for violations of the law.\" The California Consumer Privacy Act (AB375) retains several of the initial provisions from the ballot measure, which had the same name as the bill and was backed by real estate mogul Alastair Mactaggart. However, there are a few key differences. For example, the law requires \"the disclosure of only the 'category' of a third-party that receives personal information, instead of the identity of the third-party itself,\" The Verge noted. \"Perhaps most importantly, passing the privacy rules as legislation allows lawmakers to more easily change them, while a ballot measure would be more difficult to amend.\" Despite the differences, AB375 is similar enough to the ballot initiative that Mactaggart's campaign agreed to withdraw its measure if the governor signed the law by the withdrawal deadline, which he did. \"We are thrilled that AB375 has become law. This is a monumental achievement for consumers, with California leading the way in creating unprecedented consumer protections for the rest of the nation,\" Mactaggart said Thursday. The ACLU of Northern California, meanwhile, was not satisfied with the legislation. \"Concern for privacy is at an all-time high in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and yet California has enacted a law that utterly fails to provide the privacy protections the public has demanded and deserves. Nobody should be fooled to think AB375 properly protects Californians' privacy,\" said Nicole Ozer, the group's technology and civil liberties director. \"This measure was hastily drafted and needs to be fixed,\" Ozer added. \"When that happens next year, effective privacy protections must be included that actually protect against rampant misuse of personal information, make sure that companies cannot retaliate against Californians who exercise their privacy rights, and ensure that Californians can actually enforce their personal privacy rights.\" The push for stricter privacy measures comes as part of an international wave of efforts to protect consumers' data following recent breaches and abuses by Big Tech. As Wired explained:  [AB375 is] similar to the General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect in the European Union last month, but adds to it in crucial ways. Under the GDPR, businesses are required to get users' permission before collecting and storing their data. But the way most companies have designed those opt-in pop-ups, \"you really don't have a choice,\" says Ashkan Soltani, former chief technology officer of the Federal Trade Commission who helped author the ballot initiative. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PROFFN-RLPMN640326220180630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PROFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SP0-H351-DXCW-D31J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"692\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Premium Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"511\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 30, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

INTRODUCTION</p><p>The need for net neutrality rules has been hotly and highly debated in recent years. Put in place by the Obama-era FCC in 2015, (1) and eliminated by the Trump-era FCC two years later, (2) the rules generally prohibited ISPs from engaging in practices that favor some online content or services over others. Proponents of the rules say they are necessary to prevent service providers from stifling competition in the provision of online content and services, for example, by blocking or slowing consumer access to services that compete with those of the ISPs themselves, or by charging online content or service providers for faster connections to consumers over that of their rivals. (3) On the other hand, those opposed to the rules say they are unnecessary and that they hinder investment and innovation by ISPs. (4)</p><p>With the Internet being a primary place for the exchange of ideas and information in modern society, the rules necessarily implicate free speech principles. Without the rules, proponents say, service providers could skew the marketplace of ideas to benefit themselves or those willing to pay. (5) On the other hand, ISPs have argued that by mandating the manner in which they carry others' online speech, their own free speech rights are impaired. (6)</p><p>A potential issue with net neutrality regulation, then, is whether it infringes on the First Amendment speech rights of ISPs. There has been little case law on this point. In two cases, federal district courts have ruled that ISPs' free speech rights are infringed upon when the government regulates the manner in which they provide service. (7) The D.C. Circuit, however, in a challenge to the FCC's 2015 net neutrality rules, determined that the First Amendment was not implicated by net neutrality regulation. (8) Prior to becoming a Supreme Court Justice, (9) Judge Kavanaugh, in a dissent to that opinion, came to the opposite conclusion: that net neutrality did infringe on the First Amendment rights of ISPs. (10)</p><p>This article examines the First Amendment issues that might be implicated by net neutrality regulation. Although the elimination of net neutrality requirements also eliminates the potential First Amendment concerns with the rule, there is great interest in reinstating the rules, (11) which would revive the First Amendment concerns. In analyzing those concerns, Part III addresses the question of whether ISPs even engage in speech when offering Internet access is considered. While the weight of authority leads to the conclusion that providing Internet access does not qualify as speech, Part IV considers the analysis courts would apply should the provision of Internet access be determined to constitute protected speech. Next considered is whether the particular medium being regulated affects the standards to which the speech restriction will be subject. Concluding that the fact that Internet speech is being regulated does not alter the test to be applied to the restriction, the article then observes that as a content-neutral regulation, it would be subject to intermediate scrutiny. In applying intermediate scrutiny, the importance of the government's identification of some \"special characteristic\" of the medium being regulated to help justify the intrusion on speech is discussed. With net neutrality, that characteristic has been identified as the ability of ISPs to act as \"gatekeepers\" who can restrict the access of online content providers to the service providers' users. By preventing ISPs from acting as gatekeepers who can restrict the flow of online speech, net neutrality would likely be found to advance an important government interest and survive intermediate scrutiny. Before reaching these First Amendment issues, however, the recent history of the FCC's actions on net neutrality is reviewed.</p><p>II. HISTORY OF NET NEUTRALITY</p><p>Although there were efforts to enforce analogous principles prior to 2005, (12) it was then that net neutrality regulation began to resemble its most recent form when the FCC released its Internet Policy Statement, laying out principles meant to protect and promote an open Internet. (13) These \"principles were intended to ensure consumers had the right to (1) access the lawful Internet content of their choice; (2) run applications and use services of their choice; (3) connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network; and (4) enjoy competition among network providers, application and service providers, and content providers.\" (14) Through 2011, the FCC's primary mechanisms for enforcing these principles was to require compliance with the principles as a condition for the FCC's approval of several mergers involving ISPs subject to its review. (15) At the same time, the principles were \"applied to particular enforcement proceedings aimed at addressing anti-competitive behavior by service providers.\" (16)</p><p>In 2010, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the FCC had failed to properly identify a valid basis of legal authority to support these actions, (17) thereby invalidating the FCC's enforcement of those principles. (18) This led the FCC, in 2010, to adopt an Open Internet Order codifying the policy principles of the Internet Policy Statement. (19) The 2010 Order imposed three requirements on ISPs: (1) no blocking, (20) (2) no unreasonable discrimination, (21) and (3) transparency. (22) In Verizon v. FCC, (23) in a court challenge to these rules, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the FCC did have the authority to regulate broadband ISPs, (24) and that \"the FCC had demonstrated a sound policy justification for the Open Internet Order.\" (25) Nevertheless, the Verizon court struck down the no-blocking and antidiscrimination rules on the grounds that these rules impermissibly imposed Title II common carrier obligations on broadband providers, when it had not classified the providers as such. (26)</p><p>A. 2015 Open Internet Rules</p><p>The FCC once again imposed net neutrality regulations in 2015. (27) This time, the FCC classified the provision of broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service, meaning that common carrier obligations could be imposed. (28) In its 2015 Open Internet Order, the FCC identified three practices that \"invariably harm the open Internet--Blocking, Throttling, and Paid Prioritization\" and banned each of these practices in the provision of \"both fixed and mobile broadband Internet access service.\" (29) The \"No Blocking\" rule required that broadband Internet access providers provide their subscribers with \"access to all (lawful) destinations on the Internet\" by prohibiting the blocking of \"lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.\" (30)</p><p>The \"No Throttling\" rule prohibited ISPs from impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic. (31) This rule applied to conduct \"that is not outright blocking,\" but that \"impairs, degrades, slows down, or renders effectively unusable particular content, services, applications, or devices....\" (32) The FCC feared that ISPs might \"avoid the no-blocking rule by, for example, rendering an application effectively, but not technically, unusable.\" (33) The FCC provided the example of a broadband provider providing its subscribers with slower access to a third-party over-the-top video service that competed with such a service of its own. (34)</p><p>The \"No Paid Prioritization\" rule prevented ISPs from providing preferential treatment to certain Internet traffic in exchange for money or other consideration, or to benefit an affiliated entity. (35) A concern behind the adoption of this rule was that allowing paid prioritization would create a \"'fast' lane [on the Internet] for those willing and able to pay and a 'slow' lane for everyone else.\" (36) Here, the FCC provided the example of independent filmmakers and user-created videos being at a disadvantage against video provided by the major studios, who have the resources \"to pay priority rates for dissemination of content.\" (37)</p><p>All but the no paid prioritization rule provided exceptions for practices that constituted \"reasonable network management.\" (38) The FCC recognized that this was necessary for the optimal functioning of the ISPs' networks. (39) However, the FCC emphasized that any such practice \"that would otherwise violate [a] rule must be used reasonably and primarily for network management purposes, and not for business purposes.\" (40) Furthermore, the FCC recognized that in addition to the three practices it had prohibited, there may be other practices, \"current or future... that cause the type of harms [the] rules are intended to address.\" (41) As a result, the FCC also adopted a \"no-unreasonable interference/disadvantage standard,\" which allowed the FCC, \"on a case-by-case basis,\" to prohibit \"practices that unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably disadvantage the ability of consumers to reach the Internet content, services, and applications of their choosing or of [online content and service] providers to access consumers using the Internet.\" (42)</p><p>The basis behind these rules was the FCC's belief that broadband Internet access providers had both the incentives and ability to threaten Internet openness. (43) As the FCC described it, an open Internet enables a \"virtuous cycle of innovation\" by allowing new uses of the Internet, \"including new content, applications, services, and devices,\" to be developed without any hindrance from access providers. (44) The new content and services lead to increased subscriber demand for Internet service. (45) This in turn leads ISPs to further invest in network improvements, which leads to additional new uses of the Internet, and so on. (46) In the past then, edge providers--those that \"provide content, services, and applications over the Internet,\" such as Netflix, Google, and Amazon (47)--developed new services, which increased subscriber demand for broadband Internet access, which led \"to increased investment in broadband network infrastructure and technologies, which in turn leads to further innovation and development by edge providers.\" (48) The FCC's fear was, without Open Internet rules, service providers could \"disrupt this 'virtuous circle' by '[r]estricting edge providers' ability to reach end users, and limiting end users' ability to choose which edge providers to patronize,'\" which would \"'reduce the rate of innovation at the edge and, in turn, the likely rate of improvements to network infrastructure.'\" (49)</p><p>These concerns are amplified by the FCC's finding that broadband providers can act as \"gatekeepers for both their end user customers who access the Internet, and for... edge providers attempting to reach the broadband provider's end-user subscribers.\" (50) Even in markets where there was competition for broadband Internet access, \"once a consumer chooses a broadband provider, that provider has a monopoly on access to the subscriber.\" (51) This position \"is strengthened by the high switching costs consumers face\" when changing ISPs, which could include \"high upfront device installation fees; long-term contracts and early termination fees; the activation fee when changing service providers; and compatibility costs of owned equipment not working with the new service.\" (52) Because of this, consumers may be unwilling or unable to switch providers, even when there is a choice of providers. (53)</p><p>The gatekeeper function is compounded by \"an information problem, whereby consumers are unsure about the causes of problems or limitations with their services--for example, whether a slow speed on an application is caused by the broadband provider or the edge provider.\" (54) Because of this, consumers may not know whether switching providers would resolve any access issues they are encountering. (55) The FCC thus found that \"broadband providers have both the incentive and the ability to act as gatekeepers standing between edge providers and consumers. As gatekeepers, they can block access altogether; they can target competitors, including competitors to their own video services; and they can extract unfair tolls.\" (56)</p><p>This gatekeeper position also provided ISPs with \"significant bargaining power in negotiations with edge providers\" because ISPs control the means of access to their subscribers. (57) As a result, broadband providers have \"powerful incentives to accept fees from edge providers,\" either for providing prioritized access for a service or for degrading or blocking access to a service's competitors. (58) Broadband providers could likewise prioritize access for their own or affiliated services and degrade access to competitive services. (59) The FCC further observed that these incentives to favor paying edge providers and affiliated services \"all increase when end users are less able to respond by switching to rival broadband providers.\" (60) The FCC thus concluded that \"broadband providers (including mobile broadband providers) have the economic incentives and technical ability to engage in practices that pose a threat to Internet openness by harming other network providers, edge providers, and end users.\" (61)</p><p>B. Elimination of Net Neutrality</p><p>On December 14, 2017, the FCC voted to eliminate the net neutrality rules adopted only two years earlier. (62) Supporting this decision was the view that removing the regulatory burdens associated with Title II common-carrier style regulation (63) \"is more likely to encourage broadband investment and innovation....\" (64) In fact, the FCC found that classifying and treating ISPs as common carriers had \"reduced ISP investment in broadband networks, as well as hampered innovation, because of regulatory uncertainty.\" (65) In addition, the FCC pointed to the \"flourishing innovation\" that occurred under the \"light-touch regulation\" of ISPs in the two decades preceding the FCC's subjecting ISPs to Title II regulation with its 2015 rules: (66) \"Edge providers have been able to disrupt a multitude of markets--finance, transportation, education, music, video distribution, social media, health and fitness, and many more--through innovation, all without subjecting the networks that carried them to onerous utility regulation.\" (67)</p><p>In addition, the FCC reversed its prior determination that ISPs could act as gatekeepers, finding that ISPs in fact \"frequently face competitive pressures that mitigate their ability to exert market power,\" (68) meaning that the primary justification for imposing net neutrality requirements was lacking. (69) Acting on the belief \"that competition is the best way to protect consumers,\" (70) the FCC asserted that these \"competitive pressures\" themselves protect \"the openness of the Internet.\" (71) In addition, the FCC concluded \"that ISPs have strong incentives to preserve Internet openness....\" (72) The FCC observed that ISPs themselves benefit from an open Internet, as the \"content and applications produced by edge providers often complement the broadband Internet access service sold by ISPs, and ISPs themselves recognize that their businesses depend on their customers' demand for edge content.\" (73) The FCC noted, in fact, \"that many ISPs have committed to refrain from blocking or throttling lawful Internet conduct notwithstanding any Title II regulation.\" (74)</p><p>Thus, the FCC concluded that \"the competition that exists in the broadband market, combined with the protections of our consumer protection and antitrust laws against anticompetitive behaviors, will constrain the actions of an ISP that attempts to undermine the openness of the Internet in ways that harm consumers, and to the extent they do not, any resulting harms are outweighed by the harms of Title II regulation.\" (75) Additionally, eliminating the 2015 net neutrality rules would \"facilitate critical broadband investment and innovation by removing regulatory uncertainty and lowering compliance costs.\" (76) The FCC asserted its belief that this \"light-touch framework\" would \"pave the way for additional innovation and investment that will facilitate greater consumer access to more content, services, and devices, and greater competition.\" (77)</p><p>The FCC did retain one aspect of the 2010 and 2015 Open Internet rules, with some modifications. (78) That rule is the transparency rule, which requires that:</p><p>Any person providing broadband Internet access service shall publicly disclose accurate information regarding the network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of its broadband Internet access services sufficient to enable consumers to make informed choices regarding the purchase and use of such services and entrepreneurs and other small businesses to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings. (79)</p><p>The transparency rule is intended to provide consumers with the ability to make informed choices regarding their choice and use of ISPs. (80) The FCC believes that such \"disclosure increases the likelihood that ISPs will abide by open Internet principles by reducing the incentives and ability to violate those principles, [as] the Internet community will identify problematic conduct, and ... those affected by such conduct will be in a position to make informed competitive choices or seek available remedies for anticompetitive, unfair, or deceptive practices.\" (81) As the FCC viewed it, \"[t]ransparency thereby 'increases the likelihood that harmful practices will not occur in the first place and that, if they do, they will be quickly remedied.'\" (82)</p><p>The FCC's 2017 elimination of the net neutrality rules resulted in a great deal of public uproar and opposition to the elimination. (83) The Internet Association, an industry group whose members include Google, Facebook, and Netflix, announced that it would join the legal fight to reinstate the net neutrality rules. (84) Over twenty state attorneys general sued to block the rules' repeal. (85) Bills were introduced in at least six states, including New York and California, that would prohibit ISPs from blocking or slowing access to websites or online services. (86) Democrats in the U.S. Senate \"obtained enough support to force a floor vote on whether the FCC should reinstate\" the rules. (87) Although the vote is seen as largely \"symbolic\" given the Trump administration's opposition to the rules, Democrats plan to make a campaign issue out of it in 2018, and \"the vote would put lawmakers on the record on such a contentious issue.\" (88) Thus, even though the rules have been eliminated by the FCC, along with any potential infringement they might have on the First Amendment rights of ISPs, many are working to reinstate the rules. The issue is therefore an ongoing one, meaning the First Amendment issues are still relevant. This article next turns to an examination of those issues.</p><p>III. DOES THE PROVISION OF INTERNET ACCESS CONSTITUTE SPEECH?</p><p>The First Amendment provides that the government shall \"make no law... abridging the freedom of speech.\" (89) The First Amendment, then, is a restriction on the government's ability to regulate speech, whether that be restricting or prohibiting speech, or in the case of net neutrality, possibly compelling speech. Net neutrality can be seen as promoting free speech interests due to its requirement of \"nondiscriminatory transmission of content,\" (90) which prevents ISPs from blocking or hindering Internet users' access to speakers, or speakers' access to users. (91) But by mandating the manner in which ISPs carry and treat Internet content--which consists largely of speech--ISPs are compelled by net neutrality to carry speech they might otherwise choose not to carry. (92) Net neutrality, then, might be seen as compelling speech by ISPs. Compelled speech has been found to raise First Amendment issues in other contexts, (93) which thus presents the question of whether net neutrality requirements are an unconstitutional infringement of broadband Internet access providers' First Amendment rights.</p><p>This is not a question that has been given much considerations by the courts: \"[e]ven after approximately two decades of enforcing net neutrality principles, there remains a lack of notable case law... pertaining to [net neutrality-related] free speech concerns....\" (94) Instead, court decisions addressing First Amendment interests on the Internet have primarily dealt with content-based regulation of specific categories of speech, such as obscene and indecent speech. (95) These cases differ from net neutrality requirements, which are not aimed at particular categories of speech. (96) The few courts that have considered regulations on the provision of Internet access have come to opposite conclusions on whether those regulations infringe on the First Amendment rights of access providers. (97)</p><p>A. Tests for Speaker Status</p><p>A threshold question that must first be considered is whether the ISP services and activities regulated under net neutrality constitute speech protected by the First Amendment? There are two components to this question. First, does the provision of broadband Internet access constitute speech itself protected by the First Amendment? Second, does compelling ISPs to transmit the speech of others infringe on an ISP's First Amendment rights? In regard to the first of these questions--whether the provision of broadband access is itself speech--the FCC observed, \"[c]laiming free speech protections under the First Amendment necessarily involves demonstrating status as a speaker--absent speech, such rights do not attach.\" (98) To answer the questions of \"whether an actor's conduct possesses 'sufficient communicative elements to bring the First Amendment into play,' the Supreme Court has asked whether '[a]n intent to convey a particularized message was present and [whether] the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.'\" (99)</p><p>The Supreme Court applied this test in Spence v. Washington, in which a college student hung an upside down U.S. flag in his window with removable tape affixed on the front and back in the shape of a peace symbol. (100) Prosecuted under a statute that, inter alia, prohibited the fixing of any figure on a U.S. flag, (101) the student \"testified that he put a peace symbol on the flag and displayed it to public view as a protest against the invasion of Cambodia and the killings at Kent State University, events which occurred a few days prior to his arrest.\" (102) In doing so, the student sought \"to associate the American flag with peace instead of war and violence.\" (103) In determining whether the student's act constituted speech falling within the First Amendment's protection, (104) the Court rejected \"the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea.\" (105) In this case, however, the requirements for conduct to be considered speech were present: The student's act was accompanied by an intent convey a message, which was likely to \"be understood by those who viewed it.\" (106) The Court thus found this to be \"the expression of an idea through activity\" (107) meaning the student's conduct was protected by the First Amendment. (108)</p><p>The Court has found this test--(1) an \"intent to convey a particularized message,\" (109) and (2) a likelihood \"that the message would be understood by those who viewed it\" (110)--satisfied in multiple contexts. In Texas v. Johnson, the Supreme Court found that the burning of a United States flag at a political protest fulfilled these requirements and thus constituted protected speech. (111) The Court has also found these requirements to be met by \"students' wearing ... black armbands to protest American military involvement in Vietnam,\" (112) blacks engaging in a sit-in \"in a 'whites only' area to protest segregation,\" (113) \"the wearing of American military uniforms in a dramatic presentation criticizing American involvement in Vietnam,\" (114) and by \"picketing about a wide variety of causes.\" (115)</p><p>It seems unlikely that the provision of broadband Internet access would satisfy this test, however. Broadband providers act in \"a passive role when providing content to end users,\" (116) \"simply transmitting third-party original content.\" (117) This passive transmission of the speech of others \"does not convey any identifiable message.\" (118) The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a denying a challenge to the 2015 net neutrality rules, concurred with this analysis. There, the court observed that,</p><p>when a subscriber uses her broadband service to access internet content of her own choosing, she does not understand the accessed content to reflect her broadband provider's editorial judgment or viewpoint. If it were otherwise--if the accessed content were somehow imputed to the broadband provider--the provider would have First Amendment interests more centrally at stake. (119)</p><p>However, \"nothing about affording indiscriminate access to internet content suggests that the broadband provider agrees with the content an end user happens to access.\" (120) Thus, \"a broadband provider does not--and is not understood by users to--'speak' when providing neutral access to internet content....\" (121)</p><p>B. Compelled Speech Cases</p><p>As for whether being compelled to carry the speech of others infringes on the broadband access providers' First Amendment rights, Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic &amp; Institutional Rights, Inc. (FAIR) (122) provides some guidance. FAIR involved the Solomon Amendment, which denied federal funding to institutions of higher education that prevented military recruiters from recruiting on campuses or from gaining access to students \"in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other employer.\" (123) The Solomon Amendment was a response to some law schools that had restricted military recruiters' access to their schools and students due to the schools' \"disagreement with the Government's policy on homosexuals in the military.\" (124) A number of law schools sued the government for violating the schools' First Amendment rights, (125) arguing that the law \"was unconstitutional because it forced law schools to choose between exercising their First Amendment right to decide whether to disseminate or accommodate a military recruiter's message, and ensuring the availability of federal funding for their universities.\" (126)</p><p>In its analysis, the Court pointed to the \"established... principle that freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say,\" (127) citing decisions striking down laws \"requiring schoolchildren to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and to salute the flag\" (128) and \"requir[ing] New Hampshire motorists to display the state motto--'Live Free or Die'--on their license plates.\" (129) However, the Court distinguished those cases from the situation in FAIR, observing that the law in question did \"not dictate the content of the speech at all,\" as it did not require schools to adopt or endorse any particular government message. (130) Instead, the Solomon Amendment regulated conduct. (131)</p><p>However, the Court observed that in addition to situations in which an individual was forced to speak the government's message, (132) its compelled speech cases also included situations in which the government attempted \"to force one speaker to host or accommodate another speaker's message.\" (133) Violations in these cases \"resulted from the fact that the complaining speaker's own message was affected by the speech it was forced to accommodate.\" (134) For example, in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, the Court held that a state law cannot require a parade to include a group whose message the parade's organizer does not wish to send. (135) Finding that a parade was expressive in nature, (136) the Hurley Court found that every participant in the parade \"affects the message conveyed by the [parade's] private organizers.\" (137) On the other hand, law schools being required to grant military recruiters access \"does not affect the law schools' speech, because the schools are not speaking when they host interviews and recruiting receptions.\" (138) According to the Court, law schools do not attempt to express any message when they allow recruiters on campus; instead they do so to help their students get jobs. (139)</p><p>The law schools, however, argued that by complying with the Solomon Amendment's requirements, \"they could be viewed as sending the message that they see nothing wrong with the military's policies, when they do.\" (140) Rejecting this argument, the Court pointed to PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, in which the Court \"upheld a state law requiring a shopping center owner to allow certain expressive activities by others on its property.\" (141) In doing so, the Court found \"little likelihood that the views of those engaging in the expressive activities would be identified with the owner, who remained free to disassociate himself from those views and who was 'not ... being compelled to affirm [a] belief in any governmentally prescribed position or view.'\" (142) Finding no First Amendment issue raised by the Solomon Amendment's requirements, (143) the Court observed:</p><p>The Solomon Amendment neither limits what law schools may say nor requires them to say anything. Law schools remain free under the statute to express whatever views they may have on the military's congressionally mandated employment policy, all the while retaining eligibility for federal funds... As a general matter, the Solomon Amendment regulates conduct, not speech. It affects what law schools must do--afford equal access to military recruiters--not what they may or may not say. (144)</p><p>Applying the analysis in FAIR to net neutrality regulations leads to the conclusion that ISPs' provision of Internet access service should not constitute speech protected by the First Amendment. To prevail on this point, an ISP \"would have to show that its own message was affected by the speech it was required to accommodate, or that the requirement interfered with its ability to communicate its own message.\" (145) Though ISPs are required by net neutrality to treat all content evenhandedly, they are not being compelled to carry any particular message. As net neutrality regulations do \"not dictate the content of the speech at all,\" (146) there is no government-mandated message that ISPs must provide because of the law. Nor is any message an ISP might wish to communicate interfered with by its being required \"to host or accommodate another speaker's message.\" (147) What is regulated by net neutrality is ISP conduct, not speech.</p><p>C. Cases Finding First Amendment Protection for ISPs Providing Internet Access</p><p>Despite the foregoing analysis, \"in two cases, federal district courts have concluded that the provision of broadband service is 'speech' protected by the First Amendment.\" (148) The first, ComcastCablevision of Broward County v. Broward County, (149) involved a challenge to a Broward County, Florida ordinance that required cable operators offering \"high-speed Internet service to allow competitors equal access to its system.\" (150) Cable operators, arguing that this infringed on their First Amendment rights, pointed out that they provided their own \"first pages\" that subscribers could access when going online. (151) These \"first pages\" included news, information, and advertising that was either produced or acquired by the operators. (152)</p><p>Referring to this \"first page\" content, the court rejected the argument that \"the conduit or transmission capability of speech can be separated from its content.\" (153) In fact, according to the court, the \"content and technology are intertwined in ways which make analytical separability difficult and perhaps unwise.\" (154) As support for this conclusion, the court pointed to Marshall McLuhan's well-known quote, \"'the medium is the message.'\" (155) With little more analysis or cited authority than this, the court concluded that \"[n]ot only the message, but also the messenger receives constitutional protection,\" (156) thus upholding the cable operators' First Amendment challenge to the ordinance.</p><p>The second case, Bell Telephone Company v. Village of Itasca (157) involved a challenge to \"a number of ordinances and actions taken by the municipalities allegedly depriving plaintiff [AT&amp;T] (158) of its rights to use the public rights-of-way for its telecommunications network.\" (159) The government argued that here, AT&amp;T was only engaged in the transmission of content, not \"offering a collection of content,\" and consequently did not qualify for First Amendment protection. (160) To support its rejection of that claim, the court relied on the holding in the ComcastCablevision case just discussed, as well as the Seventh Circuit's holding in Graff v. City of Chicago, (161) a case in which the First Amendment implications of a restriction on the erection on newsstands on public land was at issue. (162) The court noted that Graff was an en banc decision in which \"the complex First Amendment analysis produced a splintered court and four opinions.\" (163) The plurality opinion, consisting of five of the twelve judges hearing the case, suggested \"that the erection of newsstands on public property was conduct that fell outside the protections of the First Amendment.\" (164) However, the Itasca court focused on the three opinions produced by the remaining seven judges, all of which \"indicated that the erection of a newsstand was in fact protected conduct under the First Amendment.\" (165) The court then relied on Graff, ComcastCablevision, and \"the number of cases holding that cable and satellite companies are protected by the First Amendment\" (166) as support for its conclusion that the restrictions on AT&amp;T's access to public rights of way for purposes of upgrading its network violated its First Amendment rights. (167)</p><p>The FCC, in its 2015 Open Internet Order stated, without elaborating, that it disagreed with the courts' reasoning in both ComcastCablevision and Itasca. (168) In a concurring opinion in U.S. Telecom Association v. FCC, (169) a decision on the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order, Judge Srinivasan rejected the argument that the First Amendment is a barrier to net neutrality regulation. (170) In doing so, Srinivasan did not mention the ComcastCablevision or Itasca cases. Even more significantly, neither did Judge Kavanaugh, who argued in a dissenting opinion that net neutrality regulations do violate the First Amendment. (171) Thus, given the lack of in-depth reasoning behind the conclusions in the ComcastCablevision and Itasca decisions, and their lack of acceptance by other authorities, those decisions should be accorded little weight.</p><p>Nevertheless, the ComcastCablevision court did point to ISPs engaging in the provision of content to subscribers that they themselves have selected, such as the content on the \"first pages\" in that case. (172) This is an example of ISPs engaging in activities, apart from providing Internet access, that would qualify for First Amendment protection, such as creating \"web pages that contain content or offer links to content.\" (173) The FCC, however, in its net neutrality regulations, separated these \"information services\" from the \"telecommunications services\" encompassing the simple transmission of content, with net neutrality requirements only applicable to transmission services. (174) Thus, \"neither the [Open Internet] Order nor any popular conception of net neutrality would infringe on an ISP's liberty to create a website, offer a streaming service, or engage in other content provision.\" (175) As the FCC made clear under its net neutrality rules, \"[p]roviders remain free to engage in the full panoply of protected speech afforded to any other speaker.\" (176)</p><p>D. Editorial Discretion</p><p>ISPs have relied on another argument to try to bring their activities within the scope of the First Amendment: that they exercise \"editorial discretion\" in the provision of broadband Internet access and that this \"editorial discretion\" should bring them within the protections of the First Amendment. (177) For support on this point, ISPs point to the Supreme Court's holding in the Turner Broadcasting System v. FCC cases (Turner I (178) and Turner II (179)). At issue in the Turner cases was the constitutionality of the must-carry obligations imposed on cable operators under the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. (180) Must-carry requires cable operators to carry the primary signals of all local, full-power broadcast television (\"TV\") stations, subject to certain limited exceptions. (181) Cable operators objected to the mandated carriage of the speech of third parties--in this case, broadcast TV stations--saying that it required them to include channels in their lineups that they might otherwise choose not to include, and that--given the limited capacity of cable systems at the time--the capacity needed to carry those stations might have otherwise been used to carry different programming services. (182)</p><p>In its review of the First Amendment challenge to the rule, the Supreme Court observed that there was \"no disagreement\" that \"[c]able programmers and cable operators engage in and transmit speech,\" and were entitled to First Amendment protection: (183) \"Through 'original programming or by exercising editorial discretion over which stations or programs to include in its repertoire,' cable programmers and operators 'seek to communicate messages on a wide variety of topics and in a wide variety of formats.'\" (184) Thus, whether they were providing their own programming or selecting programming from independent programmers to offer subscribers, cable operators were engaging in protected speech. (185) As a result, by \"compelling\" cable operators \"to offer carriage to a certain minimum number of broadcast stations,\" must-carry \"interfere[s] with cable operators' editorial discretion.\" (186) This editorial discretion is similar to that exercised by newspaper publishers when they pick which articles and editorials to print, both with respect to original content and material produced by others. (187) With \"must-carry,\" then, \"cable operators' editorial discretion in creating programming packages\" is infringed by the laws' \"'reducing the number of channels over which [they] exercise unfettered control.'\" (188)</p><p>Similarly, ISPs have argued that net neutrality requirements interfere with their editorial control over their networks. (189) The FCC, in rejecting this argument, noted \"that broadband providers exercise little control over the content which users access on the Internet.\" (190) Providers do not edit or control the speech that Internet users access, and users access that speech directly. (191) The FCC did recognize that \"broadband providers engage in some reasonable network management designed to protect their networks from malicious content and to relieve congestion, but these practices bear little resemblance to the editorial discretion exercised by cable operators in choosing programming for their systems.\" (192) Broadband providers, then, in providing broadband access \"serve as mere conduits for the messages of others, not as agents exercising editorial discretion subject to First Amendment protections.\" (193)</p><p>The FCC further distinguished the situation in Turner, noting that the must-carry rules \"regulated cable speech by \"reduc[ing] the number of channels over which cable operators exercise unfettered control\" and \"render[ing] it more difficult for cable programmers to compete for carriage on the limited channels remaining.\" (194) The FCC observed that neither of these concerns was present on the Internet, where the \"arrival of one speaker to the network does not reduce access to competing speakers.\" (195) As a result, \"broadband is not subject to the same limited carriage decisions that characterize cable systems.\" (196) The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the FCC's reasoning on this point:</p><p>[B]roadband providers face no such constraints limiting the range of potential content they can make available to subscribers. Broadband providers thus are not required to make, nor have they traditionally made, editorial decisions about which speech to transmit. In that regard, the role of broadband providers is analogous to that of telephone companies: they act as neutral, indiscriminate platforms for transmission of speech of any and all users. (197)</p><p>In his dissenting opinion in a decision on the FCC's 2015 rules, Judge Kavanaugh argued that ISPs do \"exercise editorial discretion and choose what content to carry and not to carry,\" and thus do qualify for First Amendment protection. (198) To Judge Kavanaugh,</p><p>Just like cable operators, ISPs deliver content to consumers. ISPs may not necessarily generate much content of their own, but they may decide what content they will transmit, just as cable operators decide what content they will transmit. Deciding whether and how to transmit ESPN and deciding whether and how to transmit ESPN.com are not meaningfully different for First Amendment purposes. (199)</p><p>Despite Judge Kavanaugh's assertion on this point, these things are different. Cable operators affirmatively choose what programming services--like ESPN--to provide to subscribers. That is not the end of the matter though. A cable operator would then need to enter into an agreement with ESPN under which the terms of its carriage by the operator would be specified. Issues that would be included in such an agreement would include the license fee the cable operator would provide to ESPN and potentially specifications on the placement of ESPN in the cable operator's lineup. (200) There is no similar process an ISP needs to go through to make ESPN.com available to its subscribers. If the site is publicly available on the Internet, the ISP need do no more to make the site available to subscribers--It's simply there for subscribers to access if they so choose. (201) Kavanaugh also observed that some of the same entities that provide cable TV service--colloquially known as cable companies--provide Internet access over the very same wires. If those entities receive First Amendment protection when they transmit TV stations and networks, they likewise receive First Amendment protection when they transmit Internet content. It would be entirely illogical to conclude otherwise. (202) This assertion ignores the fact that the cable operator has selected the programming services--TV stations and networks--it will make available to its customers and packaged them so as to appeal to potential subscribers. The cable operator providing Internet access has not done this with regard to online content. In such a case, the cable operator is only providing the means by which a consumer can reach Internet content, such as that provided by Netflix. It's the role of selecting and packaging the content consumers can access that results in cable operators providing cable service being considered editors. Cable operators acting as ISPs do none of this selecting and packaging of Internet content; they simply provide the connection whereby the subscriber is able to access the content of his or her choosing.</p><p>As the foregoing analysis indicates, it does not appear that ISPs engage in speech when providing Internet access to subscribers, and if they do not engage in speech, no First Amendment issues are implicated by net neutrality regulation. However, there are those who argue that ISPs do engage in speech and thus do have First Amendment rights that are burdened by net neutrality requirements. (203) And, as has been discussed previously, there are precedents that support this position. (204) Thus, it is possible that other courts might agree that net neutrality rules do infringe on ISP speech. This Article next turns to an analysis of the First Amendment scrutiny that net neutrality rules would be subjected to were that to be the case.</p><p>IV. LEVEL OF SCRUTINY</p><p>If the courts were to be persuaded that ISPs do engage in speech and that net neutrality requirements do infringe on ISPs' First Amendment rights, it would then be necessary to determine whether that infringement is constitutional. To do that, the courts would first determine the appropriate test or level of scrutiny to be applied to the regulation. Strict scrutiny is generally applied to content-based regulations, (205) while intermediate scrutiny is generally applied to content-neutral regulations. (206) However, the level of scrutiny to be applied might be altered by the form of media to which the regulation is applicable, as different levels of First Amendment protection, and thus different levels of scrutiny, have been applied to different forms of media. (207)</p><p>A. Medium-Specific Considerations</p><p>Regulation of speech in the broadcast media (broadcast TV and radio) has been subject to a less demanding standard than restrictions on speech in other forms of media; as the Supreme Court has noted, \"our cases have permitted more intrusive regulation of broadcast speakers than of speakers in other media.\" (208) The justification for this is based upon the \"scarcity of broadcast frequencies,\" meaning there is only a limited number of licenses for broadcasting available for use by the public. (209) Not all who wish to have a broadcast license can have one. This scarcity of frequencies has been thought to require some adjustment in traditional First Amendment analysis to permit the Government to place limited content restraints, and impose certain affirmative obligations, on broadcast licensees. As we said in Red Lion, \"where there are substantially more individuals who want to broadcast than there are frequencies to allocate, it is idle to posit an unabridgeable First Amendment right to broadcast comparable to the right of every individual to speak, write, or publish.\" (210)</p><p>However, these factors do \"not readily translate into a justification for regulation of other means of communication.\" (211) Cable TV, for example, \"does not suffer from the inherent limitations that characterize the broadcast medium,\" (212) resulting in regulations of speech in the cable TV context being subject to a more stringent level of review than in broadcasting. (213) In addition, this scarcity has been found to be lacking with regard to the Internet, which \"provides relatively unlimited, low-cost capacity for communication of all kinds.\" (214) As a result, there is \"no basis for qualifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny that should be applied to [the Internet].\" (215) The level of scrutiny to be applied to net neutrality regulation--should the provision of Internet access be considered speech in this context--turns on whether the law is content-based or content-neutral.</p><p>B. Intermediate Scrutiny</p><p>Content-based laws are those \"that by their terms distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the basis of the ideas or views expressed....\" (216) Such laws are subject to strict scrutiny, which requires the government to show that the law \"is necessary to achieve a compelling governmental interest and be narrowly drawn to achieve that end.\" (217) Content-neutral laws are those \"that confer benefits or impose burdens on speech without reference to the ideas or views expressed....\" (218) As content-neutral laws \"do not pose the same 'inherent dangers to free expression' that content-based regulations do,\" they \"are subject to a less rigorous analysis....\" (219) Such laws are subject to intermediate scrutiny, which requires that the law advance important government interests and not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests. (220)</p><p>In finding the must-carry rules to be content-neutral in Turner I, the Court made the following observations:</p><p>The design and operation of the challenged provisions confirm that the purposes underlying [their] enactment.are unrelated to the content of speech. The rules... do not require or prohibit the carriage of particular ideas or points of view. They do not penalize cable operators or programmers because of the content of their programming. They do not compel cable operators to affirm points of view with which they disagree. They do not produce any net decrease in the amount of available speech. And they leave cable operators free to carry whatever programming they wish on all channels not subject to must-carry requirements. (221)</p><p>The same reasoning applies to the net neutrality rules, meaning they are content neutral. The rules make no distinctions based on the content of any speech. (222) In fact, their requirement is that ISPs treat all speech carried over their networks evenhandedly. As the FCC observed, the rules \"apply independent of content or viewpoint... The rules are structured to operate in such a way that no speaker's message is either favored or disfavored, i.e. content neutral.\" (223) Accordingly, the rules would be subject to intermediate scrutiny. (224)</p><p>C. Government Interest</p><p>Intermediate scrutiny first requires that the government regulation of speech serve an important interest. (225) In a discussion of the First Amendment issues related to net neutrality in its 2015 Order, the FCC asserted that the net neutrality rules \"serve First Amendment interests of the highest order, promoting 'the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources' and 'assuring that the public has access to a multiplicity of information sources' by preserving an open Internet.\" (226) The FCC further observed that \"the interest in keeping the Internet open to a wide range of information sources is an important free speech interest in its own right.\" (227) As support for the importance of this interest, the FCC noted that Turner I \"affirmed [that] 'assuring that the public has access to a multiplicity of information sources is a governmental purpose of the highest order, for it promotes values central to the First Amendment.'\" (228) In fact, the Turner I Court observed that \"it has long been a basic tenet of national communications policy that the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public.\" (229) (222.) The only distinction the law makes based on content is that ISPs are implicitly given the authority to block subscriber access to content that is not lawful. 2015 Open Internet Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 5648-49, paras. 112-13 (citations omitted). Speech that is not lawful receives little or no First Amendment protection. See Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 23 (1973) (\"obscene material is unprotected by the First Amendment\"); Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 111 (1990) (child pornography not protected by First Amendment). All lawful content is subject to net neutrality requirements, and no distinctions in the law are made on the content of lawful speech.</p><p>D. Advancement of Government Interest</p><p>Having established the importance of the government interest to be served by net neutrality regulation, it is then necessary to show that the rules \"will in fact advance those interests.\" (230) This requires the government to \"demonstrate that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.\" (231) Thus, the regulation must promote \"a substantial governmental interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.\"and must not \"burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests.\" (232) This does not require that the regulation \"be the least speech-restrictive means of advancing the Government's interests.\" (233) Instead, it merely requires that the government show that the \"regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.\" (234)</p><p>In a challenge to the FCC's authority to enact its 2010 rules, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in Verizon v. FCC (235) was tasked with determining whether the FCC's justification for those rules--\"that they will preserve and facilitate the 'virtuous circle' of innovation that has driven the explosive growth of the Internet--is reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.\" (236) Although the court was not analyzing these issues in the context of intermediate scrutiny, the analysis is largely the same. In evaluating the FCC's conclusions, the Verizon court noted that its role in that regard was to \"uphold the [FCC]'s factual determinations if on the record as a whole, there is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support [the] conclusion.\" (237) This required an evaluation of \"the [FCC]'s reasoning to ensure that it has examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\" (238) The court noted that in doing this, it \"must be careful not to simply substitute [its] judgment for that of the agency, especially when the agency's predictive judgments about the likely economic effects of a rule\" are at issue. (239)</p><p>Similarly, the Supreme Court in the Turner cases noted that in evaluating whether must-carry would advance important government interests, the Court was not to give its \"best judgment as to the likely economic consequences of certain financial arrangements or business structures, or to assess competing economic theories and predictive judgements....\" (240) Rather, it was the Court's role to determine \"whether, given conflicting views of the probable development of the [TV] industry, Congress had substantial evidence for making the judgment that it did. We need not put our imprimatur on Congress' economic theory in order to validate the reasonableness of its judgment.\" (241) This was so even though there was evidence in the record \"to support a contrary conclusion.\" (242)</p><p>In assessing the reasonableness of the FCC's conclusions underlying its 2010 open Internet rules, the Verizon court explained the FCC's rationale behind the rules: the rules, by preserving an open Internet, \"spur[] investment and development by edge providers, which leads to increased end-user demand for broadband access, which leads to increased investment in broadband network infrastructure and technologies, which in turn leads to further innovation and development by edge providers.\" (243) If broadband providers were to interfere with the ability of edge providers to reach Internet users, or users to reach edge providers, this could \"'reduce the rate of innovation at the edge and, in turn, the likely rate of improvements to network infrastructure.'\" (244) Such behavior by broadband providers, then, could \"'stifle overall investment in Internet infrastructure,' and could 'limit competition in telecommunications markets.'\" (245) The Verizon court concluded that \"the [FCC]'s prediction that the Open Internet Order regulations will encourage broadband deployment is, in our view, both rational and supported by substantial evidence.\" (246)</p><p>The Verizon court also found no \"reason to doubt the [FCC]'s determination that broadband providers may be motivated to discriminate against and among edge providers,\" citing the FCC's observation that broadband providers have incentives to interfere with online services that compete with their own, (247) such as Netflix and Hulu competing with subscription video services offered by ISPs AT&amp;T or Time Warner. (248) Furthermore, ISPs, even those that do not offer services in competition with third-party edge providers, \"have powerful incentives to accept fees from edge providers, either in return for excluding their competitors or for granting them prioritized access to end users.\" (249) The Verizon court also accepted the FCC's determination that ISPs have the \"power to act as a 'gatekeeper'\" (250) controlling \"access to the Internet for their subscribers and for anyone wishing to reach those subscribers.\" (251)</p><p>E. \"Special Characteristic \" of the Medium Being Regulated</p><p>In a dissenting opinion, Judge Kavanaugh argued that the FCC's failure to find that broadband providers possessed market power resulted in the open Internet regulations failing intermediate scrutiny. According to Kavanaugh, the Turner cases required the government to show not only the existence of market power, but that \"the market power would actually be used to disadvantage certain content providers, thereby diminishing the diversity and amount of content available.\" (252)</p><p>While Kavanaugh was correct that the FCC did not find that ISPs had market power, (253) the FCC did find that ISPs had the ability and incentive to act as gatekeepers that could interfere with the free flow of speech on the Internet. (254) The Verizon majority agreed with the FCC on this point, stating that \"Broadband providers' ability to impose restrictions on edge providers does not depend on their benefiting from the sort of market concentration that would enable them to impose substantial price increases on end users....\" (255) Instead, the court observed, this ability was the result of the fact that subscribers were generally unlikely to switch providers even if their provider restricted or disadvantaged access to certain edge providers. (256) This unlikeliness was due to the high cost and inconvenience of switching providers, as well subscribers potentially not even being aware that their provider was engaging in such activities. (257)</p><p>The Verizon majority rejected Kavanaugh's contention, which was also advanced by Verizon, (258) that the absence of a finding of market power was \"fatal\" to the FCC's open Internet regulations. (259) The court put it this way: \"to say, as Verizon does, that an allegedly speech-infringing regulation violates the First Amendment because of the absence of a market condition that would increase the need for that regulation is hardly to say that the absence of this market condition renders the regulation wholly irrational.\" (260) Furthermore, the Turner opinions never explicitly stated that a finding of market power was required. (261) The Turner I Court considered the market power issue in the context of the question of whether \"the First Amendment mandates strict scrutiny for any speech regulation that applies to one medium (or a subset thereof) but not others.\" (262) Rejecting this contention, the Court observed that \"such heightened scrutiny is unwarranted when the differential treatment is 'justified by some special characteristic of' the particular medium being regulated.\" (263) The \"special characteristics of the cable medium\" in the Turner cases were \"the bottleneck monopoly power exercised by cable operators and the dangers this power poses to the viability of broadcast [TV].\" (264) In the context of net neutrality, the FCC identified such \"special characteristics justifying differential treatment\" (265) as the gatekeeper position of ISPs and their \"economic power to restrict edge-provider traffic and charge for the services they furnish edge providers.\" (266)</p><p>\"Special characteristics\" have been identified and used to justify mandated access requirements in other forms of media. Such requirements typically put the interest of the public in receiving speech from independent speakers above the interest of the media property owner to provide only the speech it chooses. For example, the government has, consistent with the First Amendment, required that broadcasters provide access to their facilities to individuals who were the subject of an on-air personal attack (the personal attack rule) or to candidates for political office whose opposing candidate had been endorsed on-air by the broadcaster (the political editorializing rule). (267) In essence, the rules provided a right of reply for those attacked or opposed on-air by the broadcaster.</p><p>In Red Lion Broadcasting v. FCC, (268) broadcasters challenged these rules as a violation of their First Amendment rights, alleging they interfered with their ability to use their frequencies as they chose, including the right to exclude speakers from their airwaves when they so desired. (269) The Supreme Court noted that the inherent scarcity of the broadcast medium--with only a limited number of frequencies available for TV and radio stations--required an adjustment of the First Amendment protections for broadcasters. (270) As the Court viewed it:</p><p>A license permits broadcasting, but the licensee has no constitutional right to be the one who holds the license or to monopolize a radio frequency to the exclusion of his fellow citizens. There is nothing in the First Amendment which prevents the Government from requiring a licensee to share his frequency with others and to conduct himself as a proxy or fiduciary with obligations to present those views and voices which are representative of his community and which would otherwise, by necessity, be barred from the airwaves. (271)</p><p>Finding that the public had a right to have the broadcast medium function so as to \"preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail,\" (272) the Court pronounced, \"It is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount.\" (273) In other words, the public's right to have access to a wide range of speech outweighed broadcasters' right to restrict or prohibit certain speech over their facilities. (274)</p><p>In the absence of the rules, the Court was concerned that \"station owners and a few networks would have unfettered power to make time available only to the highest bidders, to communicate only their own views on public issues, people and candidates, and to permit on the air only those with whom they agreed.\" (275) The Court found that the First Amendment did not allow \"for unlimited private censorship operating in a medium not open to all.\" (276) It was permissible under the First Amendment, then, to treat broadcasters \"as proxies for the entire community, obligated to give suitable time and attention to matters of great public concern.\" (277)</p><p>Scarcity was also found to exist in the context of satellite TV services, which justified a requirement that satellite TV providers grant access to outside speakers. The 1992 Cable Act (278) required satellite TV providers (also referred to as direct broadcast satellite (DBS) providers) to set aside 4-7% of their channel capacity \"exclusively for noncommercial programming of an educational or informational nature.\" (279) DBS providers were to have \"no editorial control\" over this programming. (280) The government interest behind the DBS set-aside was to \"assur[e] public access to diverse sources of information.\" (281)</p><p>The set-aside, as the reviewing court saw it, required \"DBS providers to reserve a small portion of their channel capacity for [educational and informational] programs as a condition of their being allowed to use a scarce public commodity.\" (282) The court found that the same scarcity that applied to broadcast TV and radio applied to direct broadcast satellite as well, here stemming from the limited number of orbital slots for use by satellites providing DBS service. (283) As a result, the court applied \"the same relaxed standard of scrutiny that the court has applied to the traditional broadcast media,\" (284) noting that regulations of speech in broadcasting \"have been upheld when they further [the] First Amendment goal\" of promoting \"the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources.\" (285) The set-aside requirement achieved this, as its \"purpose and effect\" was \"to promote speech, not to restrict it.\" (286) This led the court to conclude that the set-aside requirement was not a violation of DBS providers' First Amendment rights. (287)</p><p>Mandated access requirements, however, may violate the First Amendment when the medium being regulated lacks such special characteristics. For example, a government-mandated right of access in the newspaper context--one not unlike those at issue in Red Lion--was found to violate the First Amendment rights of newspaper publishers in Miami Herald v. Tornillo. (288) At issue in that case was a Florida \"right of reply\" statute that required that a candidate who was \"assailed regarding his personal character or official record by any newspaper\" be given a right to reply in the newspaper. (289) Those in favor of the right of reply requirement argued that the \"government has an obligation to ensure that a wide variety of views reach the public.\" (290)</p><p>The Court acknowledged \"that a newspaper is not subject to the finite technological limitations of time that confront a broadcaster.\" (291) While the Court did not explicitly consider whether scarcity was present in the context of newspapers, there is no technological basis on which the number of newspapers needs to be limited, as is the case of broadcasters and DBS providers. Nevertheless, the Court noted that \"as an economic reality, a newspaper can [not] proceed to infinite expansion of its column space to accommodate the replies that a government agency determines or a statute commands the readers should have available.\" (292) However, the Court observed that even if this were not the case, the statute violated \"the First Amendment because of its intrusion into the function of editors.\" (293)</p><p>To the Court, the issue in the case was \"[c]ompelling editors or publishers to publish that which reason tells them should not be published....\" (294) The Court described a newspaper's editorial function: \"The choice of material to go into a newspaper, and the decisions made as to limitations on the size and content of the paper, and treatment of public issues and public officials--whether fair or unfair--constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment.\" (295) While a \"responsible press is an undoubtedly desirable goal... press responsibility is not mandated by the Constitution and like many other virtues it cannot be legislated.\" (296) As a result, the Court found that this interference with a newspaper's editorial discretion constituted a violation of the First Amendment. (297)</p><p>Intrusion into the editorial function of cable operators was justified in the Turner cases because of a special characteristic of the cable medium, the bottleneck monopoly control exercised by a cable operator. (298) Such a special characteristic was lacking in Miami Herald with regard to newspapers, with that intrusion on the editorial function of newspaper editors being a First Amendment violation. (299) Nor was the intrusion on the editorial function justified by scarcity, which is not a characteristic of newspapers. (300) Scarcity does exist in broadcasting, which justified compelled access in that medium. (301) There, the Court found that the right of viewers and listeners to have access to a wide range of viewpoints and the free flow of information outweighed the right of broadcasters to air only that content which they wished. (302) The same scarcity rationale justified a set-aside for DBS providers, in that there were a limited number of orbital slots to use to provide satellite TV service. (303) Thus, there needs to be a \"special characteristic\" of a medium for the government to be able to mandate that the public be granted a right of access to that medium, even when that compelled access infringes on the medium owner's speech. Absent such a characteristic, as in the case of newspapers, such a right of access is unconstitutional.</p><p>The FCC, in its 2015 Open Internet Order, found such a special characteristic in the provision of broadband Internet access, that being the ability of ISPs to act as gatekeepers in terms of edge providers' access to an ISP's subscribers. (304) In the absence of that or another special characteristic, however, it appears that net neutrality would likely fail intermediate scrutiny's requirement that the restriction advances the government interest without burdening more speech than necessary. Indeed, if ISPs are not effectively able to exercise gatekeeper power, much of the rationale for the regulations disappears. The Verizon court observed,</p><p>To be sure, if end users could immediately respond to any given broadband provider's attempt to impose restrictions on edgep roviders by switching broadband providers, this gatekeeper power might well disappear. For example, a broadband provider like Comcast would be unable to threaten Netflix that it would slow Netflix traffic if all Comcast subscribers would then immediately switch to a competing broadband provider. (305)</p><p>Nevertheless, the court saw \"no basis for questioning the [FCC]'s conclusion that end users are unlikely to react in this fashion.\" (306)</p><p>In eliminating the net neutrality rules in 2017, however, the FCC found \"that the gatekeeper theory, the bedrock of the [2015] Order's overall argument justifying its approach, is a poor fit for the broadband Internet access service market.\" (307) It thus found this special gatekeeper characteristic that had justified net neutrality regulation to be lacking, using that finding as a basis for the elimination of the rules. (308) Eliminating the rules also eliminated the potential First Amendment issues associated with net neutrality. Were the FCC to try to institute net neutrality requirements without a finding of such a special characteristic in the broadband Internet access market, those rules would likely fail intermediate scrutiny for the reasons just discussed.</p><p>F. Not Burdening Substantially More Speech Than Necessary</p><p>The final requirement of intermediate scrutiny is that the regulation \"not 'burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further'\" the government interest. (309) This is different from the analysis under strict scrutiny, which requires the regulation to be \"narrowly drawn\" to achieve its interest. (310) Part of that analysis can include a consideration of whether there are less restrictive alternatives for the government to achieve its interest. If there are, this can be fatal for the regulation under consideration. (311) This is not the case under intermediate scrutiny, which does not require that the regulation \"be the least speech-restrictive means of advancing the Government's interests.\" (312)</p><p>In Turner II, opponents of the must-carry regulation at issue offered a number of potentially less restrictive ways to achieve the government interests meant to be promoted by the rule. (313) The Court's response was that it would not strike down the must-carry law \"simply because there is some imaginable alternative that might be less burdensome on speech.\" (314) In fact, the Turner II Court went as far as to state, \"[i]t is well established a regulation's validity 'does not turn on a judge's agreement with the responsible decisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant government interests.'\" (315) Nevertheless, after considering the alternatives put forth by must-carry opponents, the Court was unable to conclude that any of them would be more effective in promoting the government's interests. (316) On this point, the Court stated that it could not \"displace Congress' judgment respecting content-neutral regulations with [its] own, so long as its policy is grounded on reasonable factual findings supported by [substantial] evidence.... [I]n these circumstances the First Amendment requires nothing more.\" (317)</p><p>In conducting its analysis of potentially less restrictive alternatives, the Court found that the burden of must-carry on cable operators was \"modest\" and that \"the vast majority of cable operators have not been affected in a significant manner by must-carry.\" (318) This would also seem to be the case with net neutrality regulations, as many providers were already acting in accordance with the law's requirements even when the law was not in effect. (319) Further, many providers have pledged to continue to act in accordance with those principles despite the rule's elimination. (320)</p><p>Net neutrality is also less of a burden than must-carry, in that ISPs do not face the capacity issues that were present in Turner. Being forced to carry a broadcast TV station meant that the cable operator was foreclosed from using that capacity for other speakers. (321) It also made it more difficult for independent programmers to gain carriage on cable systems. (322) Neither of these issues are present in the context of the Internet, as transmitting the speech of one online speaker does not foreclose an ISP from carrying the speech of any other, nor does it make it more difficult for any user or edge provider to transmit its speech online. (323) Finally, ISPs are not foreclosed by net neutrality from engaging in speech by providing online content; they must simply carry and transmit that speech in the same manner as they do the speech of others. (324)</p><p>Net neutrality regulations, then, should they be determined to infringe on ISP speech, would likely satisfy intermediate scrutiny's requirement that they serve an important government interest: \"promoting 'the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources' and 'assuring that the public has access to a multiplicity of information sources' by preserving an open Internet.\" (325) In identifying and detailing ISPs' abilities and incentives to act as gatekeepers, the FCC, as determined by the court in Verizon, also adequately supported the need for the rules and showed, to the court's satisfaction, that the rules would in fact advance these government interests. (326) Finally, net neutrality does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to achieve those interests, a point on which courts are likely to accept the FCC's conclusions, even if less restrictive alternatives are presented, so long as those conclusions are reasonable and supported by evidence. (327)</p><p>V. CONCLUSION</p><p>Free speech issues are intertwined with the net neutrality debate. Proponents argue the rules are necessary, in part, to ensure the free flow of ideas over the Internet. (328) However, the First Amendment may have little applicability here. The simple transmission of others' speech by ISPs is unlikely to be considered speech itself, (329) nor is any speech of ISPs themselves affected by net neutrality. (330) If that is the case, the First Amendment does not present a barrier to net neutrality regulation as enacted by the FCC in 2015. Should the provision of broadband Internet access be considered speech, however, net neutrality requirements would likely be upheld so long as they were found to be addressing some special characteristic of the medium that hindered the achievement of an important government interest. (331) With the 2015 rules, that characteristic was the ability of ISPs to act as gatekeepers that could restrict or block users' access to online speech. (332) This would hinder the achievement of the government interests of \"promoting 'the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources' and 'assuring that the public has access to a multiplicity of information sources' by preserving an open Internet.\" (333)</p><p>If ISPs are not gatekeepers, as determined by the FCC in 2017, (334) then net neutrality is not necessary, as competition will address the concerns that the regulations are intended to address in the absence of a special characteristic of the medium that hinders the achievement of the important government interest. (335) While it is not the purpose of this article to determine whether that is in fact the case, it should be noted that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that ISPs are gatekeepers as well as that they are not; both the FCC's 2015 and 2017 Orders spend much time providing support for their opposing conclusions on that issue. (336) When reviewing a governmental determination such as this, which can involve some degree of predictive judgment, the role of the courts is to determine if the decisionmaker's conclusion is reasonable and supported by evidence. (337) So long as that is the case, courts are unlikely to displace that conclusion.

Service providers may offer both telecommunications and information services, in which case the FCC must determine whether to treat the services as a single, integrated offering, meaning it will be considered an information service and thus not be subject to common carrier treatment, or to treat them as separate services, with the telecommunications component subject to common carrier regulation. The FCC for many years generally classified such combined offerings as information services.

In Congress' view, it was this market power that provided cable operators with the ability and the incentive to engage in the anticompetitive behaviors that resulted in the need for must-carry regulation. The practices Congress was concerned about focused on cable operators' incentives to \"drop local broadcast stations from their systems, or reposition them to a less-viewed channel.\" Turner II, 520 U.S. at 197. The reason cable operators would do this would be to \"favor their affiliated programming services,\" Turner II, 520 U.S. at 198 (citations omitted), or \"in favor of [other] programmers--even unaffiliated ones--less likely to compete with them for audience and advertisers.\" Turner II, 520 U.S. at 201-02.

The requirement to allow access was only triggered by the broadcaster attacking a person on air or its on-air endorsement of or opposition to political candidates. The rules required \"that under specified circumstances, a licensee must offer to make available a reasonable amount of broadcast time to those who have a view different from that which has already been expressed on his station.

It is a huge government imposition on the entirety of the Internet. It has zero business being even considered - by any nation laying even the remotest claim to being a free market economy.Net Neutrality is a ginormous\u00a0Fourth Amendment[2]\u00a0violation. Private Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have spent more than $1 trillion building their Web networks. Net Neutrality mandates nigh limitless government access to - and control of - those networks. </p><p>Net Neutrality is no Probable Cause, no Warrants - just one humongous, all-encompassing, infinite Unreasonable Search and Seizure.Net Neutrality is a ginormous\u00a0First Amendment[3]\u00a0violation. Private ISPs can assemble - or not assemble - their private networksany way they wish. Completely free from government interference or imposition. And in those privately assembled spaces - speak any way they wish. Completely free from government interference or imposition. Net Neutrality dumps all over all of this.You don't hear too many anti-Net Neutrality, free market, defenders-of-Reality people - make these particular Constitutional cases. I believe this has been a giant mistake. Constitutional rights should always be expressly defended - whenever they are under attack.In no small part because it forfeits the ability to point out the mind-melting hypocrisy of the other side - when they defend their non-Neutral actions on those grounds.Yet another reason Net Neutrality is absolutely awful policy - is its titanic cronyism. Big Tech Goliaths like Amazon (market cap:\u00a0$930 billion[4]), Google (market cap:\u00a0$866 billion[5]) and Facebook (market cap:\u00a0$523 billion[6]) - LOVE Net Neutrality. They have spent a lot of time and a LOT of money - propping up Leftist front groups pushing this regulatory inanity.Why? Because Net Neutrality is the government mandating ISPs charge these massive bandwidth hog Big Tech companiesNOTHING for all the bandwidth they hog. Net Neutrality - is the hugest of all government zero-price-controls.And guess who gets to pay massively more for their Internet service - to government-mandated augment the massive profits of massive Big Tech? You and me. Our relatively infinitesimal usage - will cost exponentially more. So the likes Amazon, Google and Facebook - can pad their fat bank accounts.Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter - have as their business models open-platform communications. The attractiveness of their products - was the ability of any and everyone to use them to speak freely.But do Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter - adhere to the Net Neutrality to which they have gone to such great lengths to have the government impose on ISPs? Again - it is, after all, their business model. Their reason for being. Heavens no. On their platforms - they are anything but Net Neutral.CENSORED! How Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube Are Suppressing Conservative Speech[7]Facebook\u00a0Algorithm Disproportionately Affected Conservative\u00a0Posts[8]Former Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News[9]Facebook's Big Meeting With Conservatives Is A Textbook Con Job[10]How serious is Facebook about addressing their anti-conservative bias? They hired to look into ituber-Leftist President Barack Obama's ex-Attorney General.Facebook Enlists Eric Holder's Law Firm to 'Advise'\u00a0on Anti-Conservative Bias[11]Wow - I feel better. What about Twitter?'Shadow Banning': How Twitter Secretly Censors\u00a0Conservatives\u00a0Without Them Even\u00a0Knowing It[12]Twitter Accused (Again) Of Anti-Conservative Bias[13]Twitter CEO Breaks Silence on Criticism for Sharing Article Promoting 'Democratic One-Party Rule'[14]And Big Tech's war on 'hate speech' and allegedly 'fake news' - is just another way for Big Tech to silence conservatives.Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, And Google Let Hate Profiteers Police Your Accounts[15]Facebook's Crackdown on Fake News May Censor Conservative News[16]Gee, you think? Too late - it already has. Again, and again, and. What about Twitter?'Disgusting!' Twitter Allows Anti-Jew Hate, Shuts Down Conservative Speech[17]Perfect.In defense of Big Tech's one-sided anti-Neutrality - even people on the Right are making the First and Fourth Amendment argumentsthey rarely make in defense of ISPs.Should Facebook and Twitter Be Regulated Under the First Amendment?[18]:'Are social media platforms like Twitter subject to the First Amendment? Is there a right to free speech on social media owned by private corporations?'And yes - conservatives are feeding the hands that bite them. (There is a monetary explanation - oh-so-many of themalso receive massive coin from Big Tech.) Again, please do not misunderstand - I am eminently down with the Constitutional arguments. It's why I made them in defense of ISPs.Will Republicans Ruin the Internet?[19]Get that massive bit of inanity? This 'conservative' joint watches Big Tech banning, blocking and brutalizing conservatives over and over and over again - and their concernis it is Republicans who will 'ruin the Internet.' Ummmtoo late, Swamp Things.For their part, Big Tech argues both sides of the Constitution - whichever is more helpful at each particular moment.Is Facebook a Publisher? In Public It Says No, but in Court It Says Yes[20]:'In its defense against a former app startup, Facebook is contradicting its long-held claim to be simply a neutral platform.'Well isn't 'its long-held claim to be simply a neutral platform' - hilarious. And the massive hypocrisy - special.Especially coming from one of the massive Big Tech companies - spending tons of money pushing Net Neutrality on ISPs.Preaching 'Neutrality for thee - but not for me.'[Originally Published at RedState][21]Originally posted at <url normalizedValue=\"http://blog.heartland.org/2018/08/pro-net-neutrality-big-tech-is-with-conservatives-as-anti-neutrality-as-you-can-get/\">http://blog.heartland.org/2018/08/pro-net-neutrality-big-tech-is-with-conservatives-as-anti-neutrality-as-you-can-get/</url>[22].The post Pro-Net Neutrality Big Tech - Is with Conservatives as Anti-Neutrality as You Can Get[23] appeared first on Western Free Press[24].

It is a huge government imposition on the entirety of the Internet. It has zero business being even considered - by any nation laying even the remotest claim to being a free market economy.Net Neutrality is a ginormousFourth Amendment[2]violation. Private Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have spent more than $1 trillion building their Web networks. Net Neutrality mandates nigh limitless government access to - and control of - those networks. </p><p>Net Neutrality is no Probable Cause, no Warrants - just one humongous, all-encompassing, infinite Unreasonable Search and Seizure.Net Neutrality is a ginormousFirst Amendment[3]violation. Private ISPs can assemble - or not assemble - their private networksany way they wish. Completely free from government interference or imposition. And in those privately assembled spaces - speak any way they wish. Completely free from government interference or imposition. Net Neutrality dumps all over all of this.You don't hear too many anti-Net Neutrality, free market, defenders-of-Reality people - make these particular Constitutional cases. I believe this has been a giant mistake. Constitutional rights should always be expressly defended - whenever they are under attack.In no small part because it forfeits the ability to point out the mind-melting hypocrisy of the other side - when they defend their non-Neutral actions on those grounds.Yet another reason Net Neutrality is absolutely awful policy - is its titanic cronyism. Big Tech Goliaths like Amazon (market cap:$930 billion[4]), Google (market cap:$866 billion[5]) and Facebook (market cap:$523 billion[6]) - LOVE Net Neutrality. They have spent a lot of time and a LOT of money - propping up Leftist front groups pushing this regulatory inanity.Why? Because Net Neutrality is the government mandating ISPs charge these massive bandwidth hog Big Tech companiesNOTHING for all the bandwidth they hog. Net Neutrality - is the hugest of all government zero-price-controls.And guess who gets to pay massively more for their Internet service - to government-mandated augment the massive profits of massive Big Tech? You and me. Our relatively infinitesimal usage - will cost exponentially more. So the likes Amazon, Google and Facebook - can pad their fat bank accounts.Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter - have as their business models open-platform communications. The attractiveness of their products - was the ability of any and everyone to use them to speak freely.But do Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter - adhere to the Net Neutrality to which they have gone to such great lengths to have the government impose on ISPs? Again - it is, after all, their business model. Their reason for being. Heavens no. On their platforms - they are anything but Net Neutral.CENSORED! How Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube Are Suppressing Conservative Speech[7]FacebookAlgorithm Disproportionately Affected ConservativePosts[8]Former Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News[9]Facebook's Big Meeting With Conservatives Is A Textbook Con Job[10]How serious is Facebook about addressing their anti-conservative bias? They hired to look into ituber-Leftist President Barack Obama's ex-Attorney General.Facebook Enlists Eric Holder's Law Firm to 'Advise'on Anti-Conservative Bias[11]Wow - I feel better. What about Twitter?'Shadow Banning': How Twitter Secretly CensorsConservativesWithout Them EvenKnowing It[12]Twitter Accused (Again) Of Anti-Conservative Bias[13]Twitter CEO Breaks Silence on Criticism for Sharing Article Promoting 'Democratic One-Party Rule'[14]And Big Tech's war on 'hate speech' and allegedly 'fake news' - is just another way for Big Tech to silence conservatives.Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, And Google Let Hate Profiteers Police Your Accounts[15]Facebook's Crackdown on Fake News May Censor Conservative News[16]Gee, you think? Too late - it already has. Again, and again, and. What about Twitter?'Disgusting!' Twitter Allows Anti-Jew Hate, Shuts Down Conservative Speech[17]Perfect.In defense of Big Tech's one-sided anti-Neutrality - even people on the Right are making the First and Fourth Amendment argumentsthey rarely make in defense of ISPs.Should Facebook and Twitter Be Regulated Under the First Amendment?[18]:'Are social media platforms like Twitter subject to the First Amendment? Is there a right to free speech on social media owned by private corporations?'And yes - conservatives are feeding the hands that bite them. (There is a monetary explanation - oh-so-many of themalso receive massive coin from Big Tech.) Again, please do not misunderstand - I am eminently down with the Constitutional arguments. It's why I made them in defense of ISPs.Will Republicans Ruin the Internet?[19]Get that massive bit of inanity? This 'conservative' joint watches Big Tech banning, blocking and brutalizing conservatives over and over and over again - and their concernis it is Republicans who will 'ruin the Internet.' Ummmtoo late, Swamp Things.For their part, Big Tech argues both sides of the Constitution - whichever is more helpful at each particular moment.Is Facebook a Publisher? In Public It Says No, but in Court It Says Yes[20]:'In its defense against a former app startup, Facebook is contradicting its long-held claim to be simply a neutral platform.'Well isn't 'its long-held claim to be simply a neutral platform' - hilarious. And the massive hypocrisy - special.Especially coming from one of the massive Big Tech companies - spending tons of money pushing Net Neutrality on ISPs.Preaching 'Neutrality for thee - but not for me.'[Originally Published at RedState][21]Originally posted at <url normalizedValue=\"http://blog.heartland.org/2018/08/pro-net-neutrality-big-tech-is-with-conservatives-as-anti-neutrality-as-you-can-get/\">http://blog.heartland.org/2018/08/pro-net-neutrality-big-tech-is-with-conservatives-as-anti-neutrality-as-you-can-get/</url>[22].The post Pro-Net Neutrality Big Tech - Is with Conservatives as Anti-Neutrality as You Can Get[23] appeared first on Western Free Press[24].

It is a huge government imposition on the entirety of the Internet.  It has zero business being even considered - by any nation laying even the remotest claim to being a free market economy.     Net Neutrality is a ginormous Fourth Amendment violation. </p><p> Private Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have spent more than $1 trillion building their Web networks.  Net Neutrality mandates nigh limitless government access to - and control of - those networks.  Net Neutrality is no Probable Cause, no Warrants - just one humongous, all-encompassing, infinite Unreasonable Search and Seizure.   Net Neutrality is a ginormous First Amendment violation.  Private ISPs can assemble - or not assemble - their private networks133;any way they wish.  Completely free from government interference or imposition.  And in those privately assembled spaces - speak any way they wish.  Completely free from government interference or imposition.  Net Neutrality dumps all over all of this.   You don\u2019t hear too many anti-Net Neutrality, free market, defenders-of-Reality people - make these particular Constitutional cases.  I believe this has been a giant mistake.  Constitutional rights should always be expressly defended - whenever they are under attack.   In no small part because it forfeits the ability to point out the mind-melting hypocrisy of the other side - when they defend their non-Neutral actions on those grounds.   Yet another reason Net Neutrality is absolutely awful policy - is its titanic cronyism.  Big Tech Goliaths like Amazon (market cap: $930 billion), Google (market cap: $866 billion) and Facebook (market cap: $523 billion) - LOVE Net Neutrality.  They have spent a lot of time and a LOT of money - propping up Leftist front groups pushing this regulatory inanity.   Why?  Because Net Neutrality is the government mandating ISPs charge these massive bandwidth hog Big Tech companies133;NOTHING for all the bandwidth they hog.  Net Neutrality - is the hugest of all government zero-price-controls.   And guess who gets to pay massively more for their Internet service - to government-mandated augment the massive profits of massive Big Tech?  You and me.  Our relatively infinitesimal usage - will cost exponentially more.  So the likes Amazon, Google and Facebook - can pad their fat bank accounts.   Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter - have as their business models open-platform communications.  The attractiveness of their products - was the ability of any and everyone to use them to speak freely.   But do Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter - adhere to the Net Neutrality to which they have gone to such great lengths to have the government impose on ISPs? Again - it is, after all, their business model.  Their reason for being.  Heavens no.  On their platforms - they are anything but Net Neutral.   CENSORED! How Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube Are Suppressing Conservative Speech   Facebook Algorithm Disproportionately Affected Conservative Posts   Former Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News   Facebook\u2019s Big Meeting With Conservatives Is A Textbook Con Job        How serious is Facebook about addressing their anti-conservative bias?  They hired to look into it133;uber-Leftist President Barack Obama\u2019s ex-Attorney General.   Facebook Enlists Eric Holder\u2019s Law Firm to \u2018Advise\u2019 on Anti-Conservative Bias   Wow - I feel better.  What about Twitter?   \u2018Shadow Banning\u2019: How Twitter Secretly Censors Conservatives Without Them Even Knowing It   Twitter Accused (Again) Of Anti-Conservative Bias   Twitter CEO Breaks Silence on Criticism for Sharing Article Promoting 'Democratic One-Party Rule'   And Big Tech\u2019s war on \u201chate speech\u201d and allegedly \u201cfake news\u201d - is just another way for Big Tech to silence conservatives.   Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, And Google Let Hate Profiteers Police Your Accounts   Facebook\u2019s Crackdown on Fake News May Censor Conservative News   Gee, you think?  Too late - it already has. Again, and again, and133;.  What about Twitter?   'Disgusting!' Twitter Allows Anti-Jew Hate, Shuts Down Conservative Speech   Perfect.   In defense of Big Tech\u2019s one-sided anti-Neutrality - even people on the Right are making the First and Fourth Amendment arguments133;they rarely make in defense of ISPs.   Should Facebook and Twitter Be Regulated Under the First Amendment?:   \u201cAre social media platforms like Twitter subject to the First Amendment? Is there a right to free speech on social media owned by private corporations?\u201d   And yes - conservatives are feeding the hands that bite them.  (There is a monetary explanation - oh-so-many of them133;also receive massive coin from Big Tech.)  Again, please do not misunderstand - I am eminently down with the Constitutional arguments.  It's why I made them in defense of ISPs.   Will Republicans Ruin the Internet?   Get that massive bit of inanity?  This \u201cconservative\u201d joint watches Big Tech banning, blocking and brutalizing conservatives over and over and over again - and their concern133;is it is Republicans who will \u201cruin the Internet.\u201d  Ummm133;too late, Swamp Things.   For their part, Big Tech argues both sides of the Constitution - whichever is more helpful at each particular moment.   Is Facebook a Publisher? In Public It Says No, but in Court It Says Yes:  \u201cIn its defense against a former app startup, Facebook is contradicting its long-held claim to be simply a neutral platform.\u201d   Well isn\u2019t \u201cits long-held claim to be simply a neutral platform\u201d - hilarious.  And the massive hypocrisy - special.   Especially coming from one of the massive Big Tech companies - spending tons of money pushing Net Neutrality on ISPs.   Preaching \u201cNeutrality for thee - but not for me.\u201d  In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN761230120180818</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T2N-MXB1-DXCW-D10Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"997\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 18, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is a huge government imposition on the entirety of the Internet. It has zero business being even considered - by any nation laying even the remotest claim to being a free market economy. Net Neutrality is a ginormousFourth Amendment[2]violation. Private Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have spent more than $1 trillion building their Web networks. </p><p>Net Neutrality mandates nigh limitless government access to - and control of - those networks. Net Neutrality is no Probable Cause, no Warrants - just one humongous, all-encompassing, infinite Unreasonable Search and Seizure.Net Neutrality is a ginormousFirst Amendment[3]violation. Private ISPs can assemble - or not assemble - their private networksany way they wish. Completely free from government interference or imposition. And in those privately assembled spaces - speak any way they wish. Completely free from government interference or imposition. Net Neutrality dumps all over all of this. You don't hear too many anti-Net Neutrality, free market, defenders-of-Reality people - make these particular Constitutional cases. I believe this has been a giant mistake. Constitutional rights should always be expressly defended - whenever they are under attack.  In no small part because it forfeits the ability to point out the mind-melting hypocrisy of the other side - when they defend their non-Neutral actions on those grounds. Yet another reason Net Neutrality is absolutely awful policy - is its titanic cronyism. Big Tech Goliaths like Amazon (market cap:$930 billion[4]), Google (market cap:$866 billion[5]) and Facebook (market cap:$523 billion[6]) - LOVE Net Neutrality. They have spent a lot of time and a LOT of money - propping up Leftist front groups pushing this regulatory inanity. Why? Because Net Neutrality is the government mandating ISPs charge these massive bandwidth hog Big Tech companiesNOTHING for all the bandwidth they hog. Net Neutrality - is the hugest of all government zero-price-controls.  And guess who gets to pay massively more for their Internet service - to government-mandated augment the massive profits of massive Big Tech? You and me. Our relatively infinitesimal usage - will cost exponentially more. So the likes Amazon, Google and Facebook - can pad their fat bank accounts.  Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter - have as their business models open-platform communications. The attractiveness of their products - was the ability of any and everyone to use them to speak freely.  But do Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter - adhere to the Net Neutrality to which they have gone to such great lengths to have the government impose on ISPs? Again - it is, after all, their business model. Their reason for being. Heavens no. On their platforms - they are anything but Net Neutral.   How serious is Facebook about addressing their anti-conservative bias? They hired to look into ituber-Leftist President Barack Obama's ex-Attorney General.  Wow - I feel better. What about Twitter?  And Big Tech's war on 'hate speech' and allegedly 'fake news' - is just another way for Big Tech to silence conservatives.  Gee, you think? Too late - it already has. Again, and again, and. What about Twitter?  Perfect.  In defense of Big Tech's one-sided anti-Neutrality - even people on the Right are making the First and Fourth Amendment argumentsthey rarely make in defense of ISPs.  'Are social media platforms like Twitter subject to the First Amendment? Is there a right to free speech on social media owned by private corporations?'  And yes - conservatives are feeding the hands that bite them. (There is a monetary explanation - oh-so-many of themalso receive massive coin from Big Tech.) Again, please do not misunderstand - I am eminently down with the Constitutional arguments. It's why I made them in defense of ISPs.  Get that massive bit of inanity? This 'conservative' joint watches Big Tech banning, blocking and brutalizing conservatives over and over and over again - and their concernis it is Republicans who will 'ruin the Internet.' Ummmtoo late, Swamp Things.  For their part, Big Tech argues both sides of the Constitution - whichever is more helpful at each particular moment.  Well isn't 'its long-held claim to be simply a neutral platform' - hilarious. And the massive hypocrisy - special.

The Unite boss, Len McCluskey, seen walking around the conference hall with a copy of Morning Star, told activists he would not listen to the \"professional racists at the Daily Mail and the Sun\". The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, also started his speech with an attack on \"our friends in the media\". Delegates refused to take free copies of the Times on the basis it was owned by Rupert Murdoch.</p><p>It all demonstrated the extent to which trust in much of the mainstream British press was now at a low point among Labour activists. The potential of a Corbyn-led government was also forcing the media industry to take seriously proposals from party activists, which until recently were on the fringes of media academia.</p><p>\"We are on the brink of government and are going to have to lay the groundwork for the next historical phase for reform of the media,\" said Tom Mills, a sociology lecturer at the University of Aston who has held informal discussions with members of Corbyn's team about press reform.</p><p>Speakers, during an event at the parallel Momentum-backed The World Transformed (TWT) fringe festival, proposed a series of ideas which would have been considered extreme only a few years ago, such as publicly funded regional news cooperatives with editors elected by the public to produce local journalism.</p><p>Angela Phillips, a journalism professor at the University of Goldsmiths, also warned of the challenges posed by the influence of Facebook and Google and called for a new approach, given many new leftwing news outlets were reliant on distribution through such sites.</p><p>\"The way forward is to start cooperating across Europe by providing a new search engine based on public service ideas of what an algorithm should be,\" she said.</p><p>Other ideas raised at TWT included a national voucher-based system for funding media, with every voter allocating their voucher to a favoured news outlet, and the ultimate aim of abolishing advertising in the media to avoid the incentive to create articles that only appealed to wealthy readers.</p><p>Whether any of this comes close to being incorporated into Labour policy could rely on which of the party's two media policy power bases gets the upper hand. Last month Corbyn himself <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/02/daily-mail-ed-miliband-row-press-regulation\">unveiled a range of policies</url> - largely developed within the leader's office - including a tax on big tech firms to fund the BBC and elections to the broadcaster's governing boards. The Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, who also holds the shadow culture secretary job and has campaigned on media issues for a decade, has adopted an approach that fits more with reform of the existing industry through a focus on regulation of tech companies, campaigns for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/02/daily-mail-ed-miliband-row-press-regulation\">greater diversity in journalism</url>, and a public inquiry into       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/02/daily-mail-ed-miliband-row-press-regulation\">online political advertising during the Brexit referendum</url>.</p><p>What has changed recently was that rightwing media outlets were having to take Corbyn's ideas seriously. News UK employees have been privately concerned that Corbyn's proposed reforms could go further - with fears that an incoming Labour government could choose to heavily restrict the foreign ownership of newspapers, in an effective block on US citizen Rupert Murdoch. They are already used to being excluded from Labour-related events: the Sun was blocked from covering TWT due to its coverage of the Hillsborough disaster; while employees of the newspaper stayed away from the annual Labour party v journalists conference football match because the pitch was owned by Liverpool council.</p><p>The Labour leader also showed his attitude to the media by simply skipping much of the press round, which usually accompanied a party conference speech, such as a traditional interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Newspaper reporters learned the hard way about how they were now perceived by the party - their desks at the conference were situated outside the main building, in a tent in a car park accessed by following signs for a \"dog exercise area\".</p><p>By contrast, Theresa May appeared to be making a pitch for herself as champion of the free press. The prime minister told the UN in New York on Wednesday: \"I do not always enjoy reading what the media in my country writes about me. But I will defend their right to say it - for the independence of our media is one of my country's greatest achievements. And it is the bedrock of our democracy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-47713907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TBY-GGH1-F021-64XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

But since we have had a patent system<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for a long time, it would be irresponsible, on the basis of our<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 present knowledge, to recommend abolishing it. (1)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1958, in the midst of public debate over the patent system, economist Fritz Machlup delivered the above \"non-opinion\" to a Senate subcommittee, disclaiming any definitive knowledge concerning whether or\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0not the patent system is a socially desirable institution. Just over\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fifty years later, a similar public debate over the intellectual property system proceeds in the Supreme Court, which has taken a renewed\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0interest in patent jurisprudence; Congress, which has been deliberating substantial reforms to the patent statutes; and other policymaking, judicial, and scholarly venues. While we certainly have a considerably improved theoretical and empirical understanding on localized points of interest, it is probably uncontroversial among most economically informed observers that Machlup's qualified statement still characterizes our current understanding of the net social value of the intellectual property system as a general matter. (2) Despite this indeterminacy, contemporary legal and scholarly commentary widely assertsthat intellectual property coverage has expanded excessively, especially in recently propertized markets that lie at the heart of a knowledge-based economy: business and financial methods, software, semiconductors, and biotechnology. (3) This often-dramatic commentary--whichI refer to globally as the \"too much property\" thesis--warns that a formerly unfettered exchange of ideas has been stifled by a thicket of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0intellectual property that on the whole impedes, rather than facilitates, technological progress or artistic creativity. But empirics have yet to track rhetoric: the too much property thesis has yet to be supported or denied by definitive evidence (4) and, more generally, stands in uncomfortable contrast with the continuing innovative vigor of the markets where intellectual property thickets are usually claimed to be most intense.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this Article, I take this empirical uncertainty as an analytical\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0given. I start from the agnostic assumption that we do not have sufficiently reliable information or sufficiently sensitive tools to ascertain whether there is excessive intellectual property protection inany innovation markets at any given time. Contrary to the normative mode of most intellectual property scholarship, I therefore maintain strict neutrality throughout as to the socially desirable level of effective property rights coverage--what I call the \"propertization outcome\"--in any field of technological or cultural innovation. Explicitand consistent recognition of our limited knowledge opens the door to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an alternative line of inquiry. In place of the \"substance\" question\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as to whether or not any given propertization outcome is excessive,I ask a \"process\" question: can the market assess if any propertization outcome is excessive and then undertake actions to move toward a socially preferable alternative outcome? Even if we cannot reliably assess whether or not intellectual property coverage in any given market is excessive, it may be possible to arrive at a reasonable approximation of this unknown datum indirectly by assessing whether the conditions under which coverage is effectively determined are likely to yield and tolerate excessive propertization levels. This approximates standard methodology in antitrust law, where regulators, courts, and scholars indirectly assess claims of anticompetitive conduct by assessing whether conditions exist that would tolerate and preserve inefficient pricing, rather than assessing whether existing pricing is inefficient. (6) So too intellectual property scholars may be able to indirectly assess claims of overpropertization by assessing whether conditions exist that would tolerate and preserve overpropertization outcomes, rather than assessing whether existing propertization outcomes are excessive.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To put this process-based approach into operation, I adopt three foundational assumptions. First, I assume that more or less propertization always involves a tradeoff between innovation gains (which require \"more IP\") and transaction cost losses, including all related social losses in the form of frustrated subsequent innovation (which require \"less IP\"). (7) This implies a simple social cost-benefit test for\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any propertization outcome: it must yield innovation gains in excess\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of transaction cost losses. Otherwise, it is excessive consistent with the various formulations of the too much property thesis. Second,in lieu of the top-down approach inherent to legal scholarship whereformal actions by the state determine the extant level of intellectual property coverage, I adopt the bottom-up approach of the new institutional economics literature, (8) where private-market investments are the primary factor in eliciting formal issuance of property entitlements. These investments then determine the effective strength of any\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0issued entitlements through adoption and enforcement actions as well\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a wide range of transactional arrangements for exchanging and distributing those entitlements. This methodological turn critically reframes entitlement strength as a moving variable linked to dollar investments by entitlement holders: that is, the strength of any intellectual property entitlement is a continuous function of its formal content plus the expenditures made to fund the costly actions required to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0implement it. Third, I suppose that these market expenditures then select propertization outcomes that can be situated along a graduatedpath of innovation regimes, which is bounded by the conventional alternatives of property and commons but comprises in its intermediate region a rich variety of limited-access property regimes--what I referto globally as \"sharing regimes\"--where some, but not all, relevant innovation assets are eligible for property rights protection.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This analytical framework supports this Article's primary exercise:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to identify the conditions under which privately interested innovator populations likely will, and will not, have the incentives and capacities to undertake lobbying, adoption, enforcement, and other actions that select socially interested points along the regime path, eachof which implements some tradeoff between innovation gains and transaction cost losses. Put slightly differently: is the market likely tomake a mistake as it selects among innovation regimes and, if so, can\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0we anticipate the direction of any such mistake? To formulate a meaningful response, I focus on stylized movements between two broadly defined regions on the regime path: (i) a property regime where innovation assets are substantially protected by property rights and (ii) asharing regime where innovation assets are substantially unprotectedby property rights. This theoretical exercise yields a property trapscenario where the market is inherently likely to get it wrong. The underlying mechanism is straightforward: as a result of negative externalities generated by innovators who exit a sharing regime for a newly introduced property regime, an innovation market is prone to move \"too quickly\" in abandoning the low transaction cost structure of a sharing regime, resulting in a net social loss consistent with the toomuch property thesis. Faced with increasing litigation risk from potential infringement claims and increasing input costs from a declining\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0innovation pool, each innovator rationally defects to the property regime even if it would elect otherwise if sufficient coordination could be achieved to control outward migration. This property trap thesis supplies an economic rationale for the widely expressed intuition that there seems to be too much intellectual property. But there is akey difference: the property trap thesis identifies the predicate conditions under which the market is likely to tolerate an excessive propertization outcome and does not directly take any view as to whether\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0propertization levels in any particular market are excessive. Wherethose conditions are not satisfied, there is a substantially reducedlikelihood that excessive intellectual property coverage would be tolerated by the relevant market, in which case, at some reasonable level of certainty, we can indirectly take the view that existing propertization outcomes are either not excessive or, if excessive, are likely to be cured by market action within some reasonable period of time.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Building in part on established lessons from the public choice literature on the rationally self-interested processes that drive policyoutcomes, (9) 1 argue that markets are likely to resist and correct overpropertization--that is, the property trap is likely to be broken--where two conditions are substantially satisfied. First, it must bethe case that adversely affected innovators are neither clearly net users nor clearly net producers of the relevant pool of intellectual goods, which is likely to be true in any market that relies on cumulative innovation--that is, a sequence of related first-mover and n-mover innovations--and thereby compels even highly integrated entities to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0access inputs from outside sources. Firms that tend to stand on both\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sides of intellectual property transactions--that is, tend to both purchase and sell intellectual goods to a meaningful extent--have a rational interest in an intermediate level of protection that both secures returns on the sale of intellectual outputs and reduces the costs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0incurred to obtain intellectual inputs in the course of product development. Second, it must be the case that adversely affected innovators enjoy low coordination costs, which is likely to be true where innovators are few in number (or act through a collective organization)and occupy a dominant market position. In small-number blocs that occupy a large portion of the relevant market, each individual firm mayexpect to derive a sufficient portion of the joint gains generated by\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0collectively beneficial restraints on the adoption and enforcement of intellectual property protections, thereby alleviating the free-rider problem that otherwise results in collective action failure.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These limited but potent capacities for market self-correction yield an important implication that challenges the conventional political\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0economy of intellectual property: concentrated and well-endowed economic interests--normally, the chief alleged culprits behind excessive\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0levels of intellectual property protection--are often most likely to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0have the strongest incentives and capacities to scale back overextended intellectual property coverage.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This proposition--which runs counter to widely held popular and scholarly views as to the political process by which intellectual property rights are typically determined--is far from a theoretical artifact. Ample empirical evidence illustrates robust self-correction capacities among large-firm incumbents, precisely in economically criticalinnovation markets that both stand at the heart of our knowledge economy and are presumptively most susceptible to, and widely believed to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0suffer from, excessive propertization. (10) I identify a wide rangeof \"truncation actions\" in the information technology, software, database, financial services, and biotechnology markets, where, contraryto oft-mentioned claims (and theoretical expectations) of runaway transaction costs and suppressed innovative output, incumbent firms have\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0substantially halted or curtailed movements toward enhanced propertization. These actions cover a broad range of activities, including direct influence through lobbying actions or, of greater practical interest, indirect influence through constrained enforcement, patent pools, research consortia, public access databases, and other voluntarily\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0formed sharing arrangements that substantially lower the transaction\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cost burdens and innovation losses associated with a robust property\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0regime. Most dramatically, these truncation actions include outright\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0forfeitures of intellectual assets to the public domain. Far from being the inveterate enemies of the social interest, the most influential holders of intellectual resources often self-interestedly act in substantial conformity with the collective interest in scaling back intellectual property protections so as to limit the transaction cost losses attendant to excessive propertization. An extended case study of the historical evolution of property regimes in the semiconductor market illustrates in detail this cautiously optimistic view: concentrated interests appear to periodically adjust propertization outcomesthrough cooperative arrangements that alleviate the transaction costburden imposed by a property rights regime.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The organization of the Article is as follows. In Part I, I construct the conceptual framework for a process-based analysis of propertization outcomes in innovation markets. In Part II, I apply this framework to identify both a \"mistake scenario\" where the market driven selection mechanism is likely to generate excessive propertization outcomes and a \"correction scenario\" where adversely affected innovator populations are likely to reverse or mitigate those outcomes. In Part III, I use this theoretical apparatus to develop a generic template for regime selection in innovation markets, which is then applied to generate a customized regime path that traces the historical evolutionof innovation regimes in the semiconductor industry.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS REGIME SELECTION<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this Part, I build the conceptual foundations for this Article's\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0process-based analysis of intellectual property expansion. First, Iargue that propertization outcomes are principally a function of private lobbying, adoption, and enforcement expenditures. Second, I provide a simple taxonomy of innovation regimes among which the market selects as it allocates resources to lobbying for, and then adopting and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0enforcing, state-provided property entitlements. Third, I articulate\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a constrained social cost-benefit principle that drives market movements along the regime path: namely, innovator populations that satisfy certain predicate characteristics will tend to make regime selections that implement a socially interested tradeoff between innovation gains and transaction cost losses.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A. Effective Propertization<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The expansion of intellectual property protections is usually construed in formal terms as a function of legislative, judicial, and agency actions (the relevant agencies being the Patent &amp; Trademark Office\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(PTO) and the Copyright Office). Consistent with this traditional approach, it is undoubtedly the case--as the \"too much property\" thesis\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0observes--that the past decades have witnessed a substantial expansion in the subject matter that is formally eligible for protection under the patent and copyright statutes, especially in biotechnology, software, semiconductors, and nontechnical business methods, (11) But there is an important qualification to this common observation: formally eligible does not mean actually used and enforced. Frequent characterizations of excessive propertization--for example, isolated references to \"crazy\" patents issued by the PTO--fail to take into accountthis critical difference between formal enactment and actual adoption\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and enforcement, thereby easily overstating the effective level of propertization. (12) A merely formal approach can substantially overestimate the effective level of propertization in any innovation market, principally because simple promulgation through legislative, judicial, or agency action is only the first and, almost certainly, least costly step in the propertization process. (13)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As depicted below in Figure 1 (using hypothetical values), throughout I view any propertization outcome as the aggregate result of fourimplementation actions, progressively increasing in cost as a general\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0matter: (i) formal promulgation of the relevant entitlement by legislative, judicial, or agency action; (ii) interpretation and application of the relevant entitlement by courts and issuing agencies; (iii)registration, notice, deposit, application, and other actions necessary to adopt the relevant entitlement; and (iv) enforcement of the relevant entitlement through monitoring activities, licensing negotiations, and actual or threatened litigation ending in trial or settlement.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[FIGURE 1 OMITTED] (14)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subject to the inherent distortions of \"political noise\" in the supply of intellectual property protections, all these implementation actions are entirely or substantially undertaken through, or in response to, resource expenditures by innovators or other affected populations. Formal extensions and subsequent applications by the state (including, in the patent context, field-specific examination criteria released periodically by the PTO) are undertaken in response to lobbyingexpenditures while adoption and enforcement actions are taken directly and demand substantial out-of-pocket expenditures by entitlement holders. (15) An emphasis on the determinative role of private influence on public laws is hardly foreign to intellectual property scholarship, which has closely documented that patent and copyright legislation is heavily guided and sometimes even negotiated by industry representatives, up to and including drafting of statutes and even congressional committee reports. (16) But legislative action is at best half the story. Once promulgation by the courts or legislature and robust application by the courts and/or agencies is achieved, the implementation process cannot be completed without substantial and continuing expenditures to support adoption and enforcement. (17) This is neitheran easy nor an inexpensive task given the intrinsically high definition and exclusion costs that characterize intangible assets, which inturn require investments in adoption and enforcement activities to an\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0extent not typically necessary in tangible-good contexts. To protect\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0its creative or technological assets by recourse to legal entitlements, a firm must make substantial expenditures to establish an internal administrative apparatus, hire or retain legal counsel, prepare application and registration documents and pursue relevant actions withthe issuing agency, monitor intellectual property generation within the relevant organization, detect infringements by third parties, andtake legal action against identified infringers.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These mundane activities are critical: without sufficient investments in adoption and enforcement, the underlying formal entitlement will wane in importance, resulting in a vestigial entitlement that has little practical effect. (18) Available data from the patent context show the impressive magnitude of these required expenditures, both individually and in the aggregate. While available estimates vary, it is\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0agreed that aggregate application and litigation expenditures run into several billions of dollars annually, (19) which, given relatively\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0meager government expenditures on enforcement actions, (20) constitute the lion's share of total social resources allocated to implementation of the patent system. A partial measure of adoption costs can be\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0obtained simply by reference to the filing, maintenance, and other fees paid to the PTO in fiscal year 2008 and the Copyright Office in fiscal year 2007, which amount to $1.625 billion and $24.7 million respectively. (21) Both figures omit the substantially larger fees paidto attorneys and other specialists during the application process. Available estimates of PTO fees plus legal fees are roughly $20,000 per\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0patent, which still covers only a minority of a fully maintained patent's lifetime cost, including renewal fees, (22) costs relating to PTO appeals and interference proceedings, and/or costs relating to foreign patent applications. (23) Even if a firm rationally incurs adoption (and subsequent renewal) costs, fears of runaway litigation costs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0may then drive it rationally to forego expenditures on subsequent enforcement, thereby entirely or partially releasing the relevant asset\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0into the public domain. These fears are well founded: the most recent estimates show that median patent discovery and litigation costs are $2.5 million and $4 million respectively in the case of litigations\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0involving (as is typical) claimed damages in excess of $25 million,(24) which rival corresponding costs in other fields of civil litigation. (25)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The big picture is clear: any robust level of intellectual property\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protection is dependent on (i) one-time (or, in some cases, a series\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of) fixed-cost lobbying expenditures to generate the initial set oflegal entitlements, followed by (ii) continuing variable-cost expenditures of several billions of dollars annually by entitlement holders,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0who consume legal entitlements as determined by marginal private cost-benefit valuations. So long as we allow for the possibility that marginal expected costs may sometimes run ahead of the marginal expected benefits of property rights coverage, it follows that a firm's actual consumption of intellectual property rights--specifically, its decision whether to adopt and then enforce an intellectual property entitlement--must sometimes fall below a firm's theoretically available levels of intellectual property rights as a matter of formal law. As I\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0describe immediately below, indicative data in the patent context suggest that the gap between actual and theoretically possible consumption levels is substantial, which means in the aggregate that a substantial percentage of all patent-eligible intellectual goods--even goods that are eligible for formally robust protections--are regularly given over to the public domain or, at least, are not protected to themaximum extent afforded by the underlying set of legal entitlements.This is functionally equivalent to a real property regime where, given high administration and enforcement costs, most potential entitlement holders fail to defend title, leaving it up for grabs to third parties who may seize it by force or simple occupancy.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A brief exercise to quantify this gap between actually implementedand theoretically available protection levels in the patent sector is\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0enlightening. The Figure below depicts a reasonable estimate of therelative distribution of patentable assets among (i) unpatented; (ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0patented; (iii) patented and_ renewed beyond \"mid-term\"; and (iv) patented, renewed (beyond mid-term) and licensed or enforced assets. Understandably, there are no precise data on the percentage of patentable assets that are not actually patented (region A makes what must be\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a very conservative estimate of roughly eighty percent). However, there are data on renewal rates: in jurisdictions with periodic renewal\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0requirements (the United States, for example), recent data show that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0approximately fifty percent of all patents lapse due to failure to pay renewal fees through the mid-point (26) of the twenty-year statutory term (27) (region B) and, in European jurisdictions with annual renewal requirements, older data show that approximately ninety-five percent of all patents lapse due to failure to pay renewal fees sometime prior to the end of the statutory term (not shown). (28) Hence, even if we make the more conservative assumption that all patent-eligible assets are patented, then patent protection on over half of those assets lapses by the middle of the term, and virtually all protectionlapses sometime prior to the end of the term. Given exorbitant legalfees relating to infringement litigation and substantial fees relating to licensing negotiations, it is reasonable to assume that a significant portion of the remainder pool of even renewed patents lapse because entitlement holders decline to incur some or all of these costs,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0either by declining enforcement or by accepting a below-market settlement offer (region C). (29) It therefore follows that substantiallyimplemented patent protection beyond the mid-term point (region D) is\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0almost certainly an exception, not the norm, within the total pool of patent-eligible intellectual goods. Fully implemented patent protection through the end of the term (not shown) is close to a negligible\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0minority of the total pool of patent-eligible goods, in which case the effective term and scope of patent protection are drastically smaller than would appear to be the case based on the formal law.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[FIGURE 2 OMITTED] (30)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This disjuncture between formal law and effective law reaches its apex in the case of entire intellectual property statutes that are mostly form and little substance (meaning that the combined size of regions B + C + D is nominal in these cases). This category includes multiple sui generis entitlements that are formally available but have generated low application and litigation volumes over the lifetime of the underlying statute. This intellectual property graveyard includes(in varying degrees of rigor mortis): the Design Patent Act, (31) Plant Patent Act, (32) Plant Variety Protection Act, (33) SemiconductorChip Protection Act, (34) and the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act.(35) These \"dead\" statutes (that is, underadopted and underlitigated)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0are the most striking illustrations of the fundamental relationshipbetween private investment and entitlement strength: without sufficient resources continuously allocated to adoption and enforcement actions, even the most potent formal protections lose practical importance.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0B. Graduated Propertization<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If we adopt the view that the market largely selects propertization\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0outcomes through expenditures on lobbying, adoption, and enforcement\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0actions, then we must identify the set of propertization outcomes (or innovation regimes) among which the market may make its selection.The familiar menu studied by legal and economic scholars typically offers a simple choice between (i) a property regime, which is the practical equivalent of complete or substantially complete propertization; and (ii) a commons, which is the practical equivalent of zero or nominal propertization. This dichotomy in turn drives the conventionalassumption that the high transaction cost burden of a formal property\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0regime is the necessary social price that must be paid in order to preclude the underinnovation outcome that prevails without it. But anextensive empirical literature on informal governance arrangements for common pool resources transcends this binary taxonomy, providing abundant examples where private parties establish and maintain limitedaccess sharing regimes that lie at various points in the intermediate\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0region between an open access commons and closed access property regime. This imposes some limits on unauthorized usage (thereby partially internalizing negative externalities that otherwise result in overconsumption), but without incurring all of the transaction costs of astate-administered property regime. (36) The same is clearly true ofinnovation markets (which face the converse problem of internalizingpositive externalities that otherwise result in underinvestment) : not all vigorous innovation markets are protected by any, or any robust, formal intellectual property protections, which (provided we retain\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the conventional assumption that imitation always depletes returns on innovation) necessarily implies an intermediate case where a remunerative mechanism other than state-provided property rights sustains innovation incentives.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This graduated scheme of propertization outcomes is depicted below:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sharing regimes occupy a broad intermediate region of lesser to greater propertization bounded on each side by zero to nominal propertization in the case of a commons regime and complete to near complete propertization in the case of a property regime.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[FIGURE 3 OMITTED] (37)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I describe in detail in a companion publication, (38) this intermediate region is occupied both historically and currently by variants of a mixed exclusionary structure that stands between the zero propertization of a commons regime and the full propertization of a property regime. This hybrid regime, explored extensively in the real property context but to a far lesser extent in the intellectual propertycontext, (39) can be described generically as follows. The relevant innovation asset is freely or substantially exposed to imitation, thereby resembling a commons regime that cannot independently generate any remunerative stream for the original innovator, but is bundled with\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0collateral assets that are legally, extralegally, or technologically\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protected against lower cost imitation, thereby providing an alliedexclusionary instrument that in turn generates a remunerative streamto the original innovator.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To provide a concrete illustration, consider the imitation threatsfaced by a financial services firm that periodically releases new investment products (for simplicity, assume prior to the definitive recognition of business method patents in the Federal Circuit's 1998 State Street decision (40)). The conceivable product space covers a broad\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0gamut of financial instruments: debt, equity, or equity-linked securities; call options, put options, and futures contracts; actively orpassively managed mutual funds; exchange-traded funds; real estate investment trusts; money management accounts; annuities and other insurance products; and so on. Since any new product is (in our historical\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0setting) ineligible for patent protection (41) and therefore exposed\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to lower cost imitation by third party competitors, it appears thatthe bank operates in a commons regime that fails to sustain innovation incentives, given that imitator firms bear none of the developmentcosts and risks borne by an innovator firm. But this conclusion is inaccurate, as evidenced simply by the fact that an abundant number ofnew securities, accounts, and other investment products have been regularly introduced into the market despite being prone to (and actually subject to) widespread imitation. (42) In actuality, the apparent anomaly is easily solved: the bank operates in a sharing regime where(i) the core innovation asset (namely, the investment product) is largely unprotected, either by legal, technological, or extralegal instruments, and therefore is immediately thrown into the collective industry pool, but (ii) the collateral assets are substantially protectedagainst third party imitation, either by legal instruments in the case of trademarked brand names (and associated goodwill), contractual rights, or technological characteristics in the case of all other product attributes. (43)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Figure below depicts the appropriation infrastructure that supports this result: while third party competitors can freely replicatethe bank's product innovation (which is therefore forfeited to the collective industry pool), this is not true of the bank's collateral assets-distribution and marketing relationships; production and distribution efficiencies; economies of scale and scope; \"learning by doing\"; and tacit knowledge (44)--that must be replicated in order to substantially imitate the total bundle of relevant product characteristics. By bundling the legally unprotected core asset with collateral assets subject to technological, legal, or extralegal protections, the innovator firm can protect substantially against the diversion of economic rents to competitors. The result: even assuming no legal protection against imitation of the core innovation asset, the firm can reasonably anticipate a positive remunerative stream from a successful innovation.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[FIGURE 4 OMITTED] (45)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if largely adopted for purposes of analytical expedience, thestandard property/commons taxonomy obscures the rich complexity of actual innovation regimes, which encompass a variety of hybrid arrangements that offer a workable incentive structure for avoiding the standard underinnovation outcome without primary, or sometimes any, recourse to state-provided property rights. A sharing regime is a plausible, inherently attractive alternative to a property regime: if successful, it supports innovation incentives through remunerative streams partially shielded from third-party appropriation while sustaining a collective innovation pool that alleviates the transaction cost expenditures that would otherwise inhibit subsequent innovation, which in turn substantially reduces the social price that must otherwise be paid\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to induce innovation investment. Based on repeated empirical surveys\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0consistently showing that most industries place limited reliance onpatent protection but substantial reliance on extralegal instrumentsto capture innovation returns (46) (and consistent with evidence described above indicating that innovators widely decline to maximally exploit available patent protections (47)), a sharing regime that mixes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0legal appropriation instruments, extralegal appropriation instruments, and open access zones represents by implication the typically adopted appropriation strategy in a large number of innovation markets. Multiple industries stand somewhere in between the commons/property alternatives at the ends of the propertization continuum: while some intellectual assets in the relevant market are securely protected by legal barriers, the substantial remainder are forfeited to an open-access innovation pool (or in milder variants to be discussed subsequently, limited-access innovation pools), while difficult-to-imitate or otherwise excludable collateral assets cover any resulting appropriability shortfall.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0C. Propertization Theses (or Demsetz Meets Marx Meets Coase)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If (i) we adopt the view that innovation regimes are largely a function of private expenditures on implementation actions; and (ii) we further adopt the view that innovation regimes are best situated along\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a graduated range of propertization outcomes, then we can complete our conceptual toolkit by identifying the selection mechanism that drives innovators' choice of implementation actions, which in turn substantially determines the propertization outcome. This line of inquirynecessarily takes as its point of departure the leading economic theory of property rights formation, as famously stated by Harold Demsetz. Namely, a society will expend additional resources to establish, administer, and secure property rights so long as (and only so long as)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0asset values sufficiently increase relative to rights administration\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0COSTS (48) (and/or, as Demsetz clearly implied and subsequent commentators clarified, rights administration costs sufficiently fall relative to asset values (49)). As further developed in the institutionaleconomics literature, this thesis is usually formulated more generally as stating that any market dedicates resources to the promulgationand enforcement of property rights just up to the point where marginal internalization gains equal marginal internalization costs. (50) In\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0applying this social cost-benefit calculus to the intellectual property context, it is important to observe (as stated at the outset) that innovation typically proceeds in a cumulative sequence consisting of an initial innovation followed by a derivative flow of subsequent innovations, which means that allocating entitlements over upstream innovations can generate transaction costs that in turn impede downstream innovations. (51) This cumulative sequence requires adjusting theDemsetz thesis such that internalization gains from increased propertization are offset against internalization costs in the form of both(i) transaction costs (understood broadly to mean all costs relatingto the administration, transfer, and enforcement of intellectual property) (52); and (ii) subsequent innovation that would have taken place but for those transaction costs. (53) Note how transaction costs act as the critical brake on propertization levels: if transaction costs were set to zero, propertization could be confidently ratcheted upto cover all product attributes, thereby achieving complete internalization of all social gains (in the form of innovative output) at no offsetting social cost (in the form of transaction costs and associated innovation losses). (54)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following this adapted formulation, any given propertization outcome generates a marginal net social gain only to the extent that, relative to some weaker propertization outcome, it yields a cumulative stream of marginal innovation gains (that is, initial plus subsequent innovation gains) in excess of marginal transaction costs. Where this is not the case, the propertization outcome is socially excessive: that is, it has depleted, rather than enlarged, the total social product\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0relative to some weaker propertization outcome. The Demsetz efficiency thesis (or what I will call the \"Never Too Much Property\" (NTMP) thesis) implies by definition that this adverse outcome will never berealized: that is, any observed increase in property rights coverageover any given pool of innovation assets necessarily results in a net\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0social gain by generating marginal innovation gains in excess of marginal transaction costs (otherwise it would never have taken place!).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If \"what is, is optimal,\" then the expansionary trend in intellectual property coverage need not raise any alarm: it simply constitutes a\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0socially cost-justified adjustment of property rights in response to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0an upward shift in relevant asset values (and/or a downward shift in\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rights-administration costs). This does not seem wholly implausible:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0historically, extensions of formal intellectual property coverage often appear to correlate roughly with apparent increases in the economic value of the relevant innovation market. Thus, software received increasingly stronger property rights protection (from copyright to unclear patent to clear patent protection (55)) roughly coincident with\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the rise of the personal computer and corresponding growth in demand\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for software applications; and the biotechnology industry received increasingly stronger property rights protection for some of its products as technological advances in the life sciences started yielding valuable research and therapeutic tools; (56) and so on.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is widely observed, however, this \"happy\" approach to property rights formation suffers from a crucial shortcoming: namely, it failsto operationalize the transition from commons to property and, consequently, fails to address the obvious possibility that, given the inherent divergence between the public interest and the private interests\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of market participants, the state's introduction of property entitlements may not always (or some would say, may only infrequently and accidentally (57)) result in a net social gain. (58) Following this distributive approach (which I will call the \"Always Too Much Property\"(ATMP) thesis), excessive propertization outcomes are endemic, either\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0actually or at least potentially, given the disproportionate rent-seeking incentives and capacities of large existing holders who seek to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0secure unequal resource distributions, even if this yields a net social loss. Put differently: private parties that exert determinative influence over state action have rational interests that inherently diverge from the public interest, and hence, there can be no confidence\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that rent-seeking investments will yield socially desirable propertization outcomes. Applied strictly to the contemporary intellectual property context, the ATMP thesis would necessarily imply that, despite\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0vigorous innovation in recently and substantially propertized markets such as biotechnology, semiconductors, and software, these marketswould have generated an even higher net social product (equivalent to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cumulative innovation gains less transaction costs) under some weaker level of propertization.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Translated into the more casual terms of popular and some scholarly\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0commentary on intellectual property, the rent-seeking critique corresponds approximately to the oft-stated view that \"Big Media,\" \"Big Pharma,\" or \"Big Tech\" consistently seeks to strengthen intellectual property rights to the maximum extent possible as political conditionsand resource constraints allow, irrespective of whether doing so imposes (or precisely in order to impose) high input costs on small innovators, thereby constraining entry, and high retail prices on individual end users, thereby maximizing profits. (59) In its more sophisticated and nuanced forms, the ATMP thesis tracks the widely expressed view that innovation markets suffer from an intellectual property thicket (or \"anticommons\") where a misguided proliferation of property rights stifles innovative output beneath access restrictions, dispute-resolution actions, and other administrative burdens. (60) At its core,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the ATMP thesis certainly has substantial merit--indeed, it is fully\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0compatible with this Article's functionalist view of propertizationoutcomes as largely the product of self-interested rent-seeking expenditures. However, it has a crucial blind spot: at least in its less nuanced formulations, the ATMP thesis almost certainly must be overstated as a complete account of ultimate rights allocation outcomes since it necessarily assumes that adversely affected populations never have sufficient incentives and/or capacities to maize adjustments thatyield at least a socially preferable propertization outcome. (61) Not\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0just almost certainly but actually: as we shall see subsequently, the extreme pessimism that characterizes the strongest versions of theATMP thesis is falsified by multiple instances where innovator populations--and in particular, concentrated and well-endowed innovator populations--that are adversely affected by increased propertization have undertaken corrective actions to alleviate the attendant transaction cost burdens on innovation activity, up to and including outright forfeitures of valuable pools of knowledge assets.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To understand why this pessimistic prognosis is almost certainly false merely as a blanket theoretical proposition, let us briefly revisit Demsetz through the lens of Ronald Coase, who is the source of the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0most influential theory of what might be called the private adjustment of state allocated entitlements. Assuming zero transaction costs (and setting aside distributive considerations), Coase shows that theinitial allocation of any legal entitlement is a matter of indifference from a social point of view because affected parties will rationally bargain to the efficient reallocation. (62) While this is obviously an idealized state of affairs that will rarely be realized as a practical matter, it yields the valuable implication that, where transaction cost obstacles are not exorbitant, private parties will have rational incentives and at least some capacity to adjust socially undesirable allocations of legal entitlements. This well-known insight canin turn be applied to generate a working hypothesis concerning an innovation market's potential ability to correct any excessive allocation of intellectual property rights. Assuming that the Coasean condition of minimal coordination costs is at least substantially satisfied,there is reasonable confidence that the socially preferred outcome envisioned (but not operationalized) by the Demsetz thesis (and entirely excluded by the rent-seeking critique except as a matter of chance)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0will be substantially realized over some reasonable period of time.This possibility will be realized so long as we do not exclude an important (and entirely reasonable) contingency (which must be the casefor the too much property thesis to hold in any single instance): namely, as the level of propertization increases, marginal transaction costs accelerate, with resulting losses in the form of depressed subsequent innovation, such that the diminishing stream of marginal innovation gains cannot make up the difference. Where this is the case, further movement down the regime path toward complete propertization will fail to yield a net social gain, in which case a less protected point on the regime path will be socially (and, at least for some innovators, privately) preferred to any more protected point. (63) Given this contingency, even (and, as I shall argue shortly below, especially) large entitlement holders--the presumptive culprits following the ATMP thesis--may therefore have individually rational incentives to scale back overextended intellectual property rights, thereby alleviating transaction costs and enhancing the cumulative stream of innovative output in at least partial consistency with the social interest.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In place of the ATMP thesis and the NTMP thesis, I pursue an intermediate position, which I call the \"Sometimes Too Much Property\" (STMP) thesis. The market will tend to adjust excessive allocations of intellectual property entitlements in order to maximize the cumulative stream of innovation gains net of transaction costs, assuming two conditions are satisfied: (i) adversely affected innovators tend to be neither substantially net users nor substantially net producers of therelevant pool of innovation assets, which implies that innovators have a close-to-neutral bias relative to the socially interested level of property rights coverage; and (ii) adversely affected innovators tend to be few in number (or collectively organized) and occupy a dominant market position, which implies strong individual incentives to undertake costly efforts to promote, and low coordination cost obstacles to reach collectively beneficial propertization outcomes. Substantial satisfaction of these predicate conditions yields an approximate alignment over time between private and social interests in selectingamong the possible range of propertization outcomes. First, resourceholders that tend to be both producers and users of intellectual assets--that is, they make substantial use of outside sources to access required innovation inputs--wish to accrue both internalization gains,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0which requires more \"property\" (consistent with the ATMP thesis), and to minimize at least some internalization costs, which requires less \"property\" (consistent with the NTMP thesis). (64) Second, if group\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0size is small (or large but collectively organized) and occupies a dominant portion of the relevant market, then the dilution of cooperation gains is inherently limited, in which case adversely affected innovators may rationally expect to accrue individual gains commensurate\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0with individual expenditures required to implement collectively beneficial adjustments to overpropertization outcomes. (65) While the NTMP thesis assumes that the market always gets it right by tending toward socially optimal propertization and the ATMP thesis assumes that the market always gets it wrong (subject to getting it right occasionally by chance) by tending toward socially excessive propertization, the STMP thesis assumes that, taking into account some reasonable lagtime required to implement adjustments by adversely affected and economically dominant interests, the market tends to get it at least substantially right over time, in general moving between propertization outcomes situated in the intermediate region between the exact perfection anticipated by the NTMP thesis and the gross imperfection anticipated by the ATMP thesis.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0II. ERRORS AND CORRECTIONS ON THE REGIME PATH<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the market always perfectly implemented the social cost-benefitprinciple as it selected points on the graduated regime path (following the NTMP thesis), then an erroneous propertization outcome would be an impossibility (and the ATMP thesis would be a complete falsehood), since innovators would rationally decline to use any extension ofintellectual property coverage that is not socially cost-justified relative to the existing set of legal and/or extralegal appropriation mechanisms. (66) But this undiluted confidence in the regime selection\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0process would necessarily assume that collective rationality will always coincide with individual rationality among innovator populations. To examine the extent to which individually rational consumption of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0intellectual property sometimes (but not chronically and irremediably, as the ATMP thesis would imply) diverges from socially interestedlevels, below I explore stylized movements between a property regimeand a sharing regime (67) for the purpose of identifying circumstances where innovation markets are likely to select and/or fail to correct socially excessive propertization outcomes within some reasonable time frame. Whether or not the market fails or succeeds in this endeavor is not a matter of chance. Consistent with the nuanced approach of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the STMP thesis (and contrary to both the pessimism of the ATMP thesis and the optimism of the NTMP thesis), I advance the following hypothesis: (i) where coordination costs are high, innovation markets are\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0likely to fall into a property trap that settles upon and cannot easily adjust socially excessive propertization outcomes; but (ii) where\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0coordination costs are low (and adversely affected innovators have a\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0close-to-neutral propertization bias), innovation markets are likely\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to escape from the property trap by undertaking collectively beneficial actions that directly or, perhaps of greatest practical interest,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0indirectly correct socially excessive propertization outcomes. While\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the property trap outcome is an inherent danger (so long as we assume conditions that give rise to positive coordination costs), it may sometimes be a self-correcting malady: even without state intervention, concentrated or well organized innovator populations that tend to stand on both sides of intellectual property transactions have rational incentives and inherent capacities to overcome coordination cost obstacles in order to accrue joint gains from recalibrating overextended levels of property rights coverage.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A. Falling into the Property Trap<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let us return to the financial services market prior to 1998. As described earlier, this constituted a sharing regime that sustained innovative output without intellectual property protections (other thantrademark), thereby sparing industry participants the transaction cost losses attendant to a formal property regime. But not all is well in paradise. This cooperative idyll-which arguably operated to the collective benefit of most firm participants--was inherently unstable so\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0long as any firm could, at some reasonable cost and at some reasonable likelihood of success, \"defect\" by seeking, or more aggressively enforcing, formal property rights protections made available by the state. The Figure below depicts three possible defection actions (where\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I\" denotes innovator) that can undermine a sharing regime, as follows:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[FIGURE 5 OMITTED]<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defect(adopt) and defect(enforce) are the least costly forms of any\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unilateral activation of formal property rights, corresponding approximately to \"crazy\" patents issued by the PTO or \"surprising\" court decisions upholding novel patent or copyright claims brought by \"aggressive\" entitlement holders, which together drive the incremental process by which doctrinal limitations on patentable or copyrightable subject matter are progressively dismantled. Over the course of almost two decades, the financial services market underwent incremental propertization as a result of defecting innovators that successfully elicited agency or court action to expand available intellectual propertycoverage. Starting in the 1970s, the PTO began to issue patents for nontechnical business methods (equivalent to defect(adopt)), which had\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0been widely understood to be unpatentable, (68) and which led to a handful of litigations (concluding in settlement). (69) Doubts arising\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from doctrinal obstacles to legal enforceability-most notably, the historical bar on patenting abstract ideas in general and mathematical\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0algorithms in particular--were eroded by Federal Circuit decisions issued during the 1980s and 1990s and a change in 1996 to PTO examination guidelines, which instructed examiners that claims could not be rejected solely because they covered methods of doing business. (70) These doubts were ultimately cast aside by the Federal Circuit's 1998decision, State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inc., which explicitly rejected the historical exclusion of business\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0method patents. (71) In that litigation, brought by a small financial services firm against a long-established market leader in custodial\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0services for the financial services industry, the court rejected subject matter objections to a patent for a computer implemented data processing system that facilitates the financial administration of multiple mutual funds through a common investment portfolio. (72) This progressive change in propertization outcomes, cultimating in the State\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Street decision, led to a sharp rise in business method patent applications, which, subject to periodic fluctuations, has continued through the present day. (73)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But patenting volume alone is not sufficient to imply that complete\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0or even substantial propertization of the financial services sectorwas and is an inevitable outcome of the 1998 decision and the extended sequence of defection actions that precipitated it. Any successfuldefection action by a single innovator formally promulgates a novel property regime, which in turn displaces the existing sharing regime only to the extent that a substantial portion of the general innovator\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0population then similarly defects by allocating resources to adopting the novel entitlement and enforcing it (equivalent to defect(enforce)). If a formal intellectual property entitlement is unilaterally introduced but then neither adopted nor enforced by most eligible holders, then it can safely be concluded that the innovator population has\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rationally declined to incur the expenditures necessary to implement\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0it, thereby perpetuating a sharing regime that persists in the shadow of a largely inactive property regime. In electing whether to incur\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0these implementation costs, any repeat-player innovator must weigh the expected net payoff streams available from two alternative actions: (i) the \"sharing payoff' available by electing to continue to cooperate with the existing sharing regime (practically equivalent to declining to petition, adopt, or enforce property rights protections); and (ii) the \"property payoff' available by electing to defect into the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0property regime following any of the defection actions indicated above. Any payoff amount is constituted by the discounted present valueof the cumulative stream of innovation gains (that is, initial plus subsequent innovation gains) less transaction costs and input costs. Whereas a property regime offers increased innovation gains at the price of increased transaction costs and input costs, a sharing regime offers reduced input costs and transaction costs at the price of reduced innovation gains. If there already exist other mechanisms by which\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0innovators can capture innovation returns (a typical case), (74) then the marginal gain in innovation returns under a property regime may\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0be insubstantial and fail to exceed the marginal losses attributable\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to the associated cost burden, in which case innovators will rationally decline to adopt and/or enforce a novel property right made available by the state.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now suppose that most firms in the financial services industry conclude that the sharing payoff exceeds the property payoff, in which case these firms should rationally decline to exploit the newly available patent right, which should in turn lapse into a practical nullity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But not all innovators will necessarily reach this conclusion; in particular, a one-shot player who seeks to maximize short-term payoffs(equivalent practically to the much maligned \"patent troll\" (75)) will never reach this conclusion and, assuming reasonable defection costs, will therefore vigorously pursue available legal protections. Given that initial innovation gains accrue immediately while the losses from transaction costs, input costs, and impeded subsequent innovation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0are mostly incurred sometime in the future, the one-shot innovator rationally ignores offsetting losses (other than immediate lobbying and/or litigation costs) and seeks to accrue the marginal innovation gains immediately available under a property regime. This observation reveals a crucial vulnerability of any sharing regime: it is exposed to unraveling by the one-shot player who anticipates, or any other \"idiosyncratic\" player who has some reason rationally to anticipate, a higher net payoff stream under a property regime for the duration of its anticipated participation in the market. (76) To see why, supposethat an idiosyncratic innovator (for example, the small financial services company that initiated the State Street litigation) makes an unconventional patent application that is surprisingly accepted by thePTO and then surprisingly upheld by a court when its validity is contested by an alleged \"nonidiosyncratic\" infringer (for example, the large financial services incumbent targeted in the State Street litigation). This unilateral activation of formal property rights by even asingle firm may then sufficiently reduce the expected payoff available under the existing sharing regime such that the general populationof nonidiosyncratic innovators rationally elects to defect into the novel property regime. This outcome will result so long as any nondefecting innovator anticipates that, as the number of defecting innovators increases, transaction costs and input costs will rise sufficiently due to contraction of the common innovation pool and expansion in the infringement claims pursued by defecting firms, such that a sharing regime loses its relative cost advantage over a property regime. Absent the ability to coordinate future migration, fears of an impending \"patent flood\" become a self-fulfilling prophecy: individual rational actions to protect against anticipated infringement claims and anticipated barriers to innovation inputs drive full-scale deployment of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a property regime even if joint payoffs would be maximized under the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0existing sharing regime.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Figure 6 potentially illustrates this effect: an initial activation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of property rights by a single plaintiff in the State Street litigation has resulted in the subsequent and rapid issuance of thousands of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0business methods patents in a market that had previously supported robust innovation rates without formal propertization and apparently had never previously lobbied for such rights. (77) Taking into account\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0natural lags in the patent application process (on average as of 2007, almost thirty-two months from application date to issue date (78)), we can roughly observe that, following initial erosion of the business methods limitation in 1994, patenting rates began to climb moderately and then climbed sharply following the July 1998 decision that expressly lifted the business methods limitation and continued in thesame direction following a 1999 Federal Circuit decision that reaffirmed State Street (79) and a 1999 district court ruling that issued apreliminary injunction in support of the notorious Amazon \"one-click\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0business method patent. (80) Patenting rates then spiked upward again following settlements of approximately $50 million in August 2002 and December 2003 by multiple financial exchanges with eSpeed, an aggressive litigant of financial method patents, (81) and, since 2002, litigation by the \"Data Treasury\" firm, which has brought suit againstover fifty financial services firms with claims of over $1 billion in\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0damages concerning a widely used check-processing and transmission technology. (82)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[FIGURE 6 OMITTED]<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether or not nonidiosyncratic innovators defect into a property regime largely turns on the litigation risk imposed by the activated set of property entitlements. Litigation risk is understood broadly to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0encompass both (i) input costs in the form of anticipated settlement\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0payouts to claimants; and (ii) transaction costs in the form of legal fees, monitoring and reporting procedures, or other costly precautions. A nondefecting innovator that elects to cooperate with the existing sharing regime is an exposed litigation target to the extent that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0either (i) it does not have its own portfolio of property rights with which to threaten, deter, or settle opportunistic litigation (or at\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0least lower the cost of settlement); or (ii) its privately practiced\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(but not publicly disclosed) innovations may be claimed by a third party under the property regime (as can be the case under the U.S. patent system, which usually does not recognize any prior user defense (83)). In the patent context, litigation risk is further aggravated by\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0two additional factors. First, when patent protection is initially extended to a new field of activity, inexperience on the part of the PTO, together with a limited prior art database, may make it easier for \"low quality\" and/or unjustifiably broad patents to be granted, thereby distorting upwards the scope and number of patents in the relevant market, which in turn enhances perceived litigation risk, and enhances incentives to migrate to the property regime. Second, the U.S. patent system does not require disclosure of patent applications until\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0eighteen months following the initial filing (and no disclosure until issuance in the absence of a foreign patent application), (84) which can lead to overestimates of the perceived migration rate that in turn give firms incentives to seek patent protection in the absence of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any credible commitment from other industry players that they will not do so (or have not already done so). Innovators' perceptions of litigation risk may be further exacerbated by the intermediary populations that derive income from the adoption and enforcement of formal intellectual property rights (mostly lawyers), who may have incentivesto promote adoption of the property regime among existing innovatorsby increasing the perceived defection rate, thereby further depressing expected payoffs under the sharing regime and further acceleratingthe actual defection rate.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0B. Escaping the Property Trap<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The property trap scenario approximately tracks the pessimism of the ATMP thesis, which envisions that the state imposes property rights\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0protections even in markets that can sustain vigorous innovation without them, which must then suffer the effects of constrained research\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and development. But there is a crucial qualification that fundamentally diverges from the ATMP thesis: namely, the property trap is strictly dependent upon the inability of adversely affected innovator populations to sufficiently overcome coordination costs so as to undertake collectively beneficial actions that would break the trap. Where this empirical fact does not hold (meaning, coordination cost obstacles are overcome) and the innovator populations are neither clearly net\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0users nor net producers of the relevant pool of intellectual assets,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0then there is substantially greater confidence that the market is likely to move to a socially preferred point on the regime path that generates marginal innovation gains in excess of marginal transaction costs. (85) Adversely affected innovators can sometimes stop the slide\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0into the property trap or, if not, climb their way out, by taking two actions that limit the practical scope of intellectual property coverage: (i) direct truncation, in the form of lobbying actions that, if successful, result in formal modifications that weaken the relevant\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0legal entitlement; and (ii) indirect truncation, in the form of voluntarily formed cooperative arrangements and other transactional structures embedded within the surrounding property infrastructure, whichis otherwise left formally unchanged.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These remedial actions do not occur unpredictably. If coordinationcosts are the \"glue\" that facilitates uncoordinated entry into a property trap, then these adverse propertization outcomes will be systematically likely to be corrected by innovator populations that exhibitcharacteristics that depress the coordination costs that would otherwise give rise to and preserve selection errors on the regime path. Truncation actions to halt an incipient property trap, sustain the existing sharing regime, and/or form a novel cooperative arrangement within an existing property regime, necessitate costly contributions, either (i) in the direct case, as a result of lobbying actions to reverse extensions of formal property rights; or (ii) in the indirect case,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a result of litigation risk being incurred by, or innovation gains being forfeited by, failure to adopt and/or vigorously enforce formally available property rights against mutual participants in a voluntary cooperative arrangement. Small number blocs of large participants or a collective trade organization that represents a large number of small participants can alleviate the free-rider problem that discourages individual firms from making these costly contributions towardthe collective good in the form of an improved propertization outcome. (86) This proposition follows from a simple application of public goods theory: small numbers and dominant market shares limit the dilution of cooperation gains, which improves the likelihood that any individual participant rationally anticipates that it will receive benefits that are at least commensurate with its contributions to the collective good in the form of an improved propertization outcome. (87) Trade organizations can alleviate free-rider obstacles that would otherwise discourage individually rational contributions to sustain a collectively beneficial sharing regime by coordinating each participant firm's contribution actions and spreading contribution costs among a large pool of individual participants. And even where trade organizations do not exist, profit-seeking entrepreneurs may emerge who self-interestedly devise organizational solutions to alleviate the transactional burdens borne by the adversely affected innovator population, which in turn yields profit streams for the organizational entrepreneur.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These well-known conditions for collective action yield simple differential expectations with respect to the market's self-correction capacities, as anticipated by the STMP thesis. In unconcentrated industries, or in concentrated industries where incumbents are completely integrated entities that make little use of outside inputs, pessimists\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(and adherents of the ATMP thesis) tend to win out: these markets are susceptible to being extensively propertized by idiosyncratic activations of state-provided legal entitlements, resulting in a propertytrap from which there may be no easy escape. Conversely, in concentrated industries that consist of a small number of large participants,or in unconcentrated industries that consist of a large number of small participants that act collectively through a trade organization, and assuming further that these firms or organizations rely substantially on outside sources for required inputs, optimists (and adherentsof the NTMP thesis) tend to win out. To be sure, this is not to denya meaningful scope of application to the ATMP thesis: there are well-founded theoretical reasons to believe that the market inherently tends toward overpropertization as a result of collective action failure\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in light of escalating input costs and transaction costs imposed byincremental propertization. This in turn is exacerbated in the case of firms that employ highly integrated research, development, and production processes and therefore make little use of externally sourcedtechnological inputs. But it is critical to observe that these pathological tendencies stand and fall--that is, the relevant innovator population may be substantially resistant to collective action failure--largely as a function of the coordination costs and propertization biases that characterize the relevant innovator population. Where innovators tend to stand on both sides of intellectual property transactions and litigations, which is most likely to occur in markets characterized by cumulative innovation that compels even highly integrated entities to access inputs from outside sources, innovators rationally take into account the expected losses from socially excessive property\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rights coverage and have incentives to undertake efforts to reduce it. And where coordination costs are low, which is most likely to occur under concentrated market conditions or unconcentrated market conditions subject to collective organization, then privately interested firms inherently tend to have the capacity to accomplish this objective.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. Direct Truncation<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial services market provides a possible illustration of the speed with which a successful sharing regime can rapidly convert into a property regime as a result of the unilateral defection of even\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a single firm. But that is only half the story. The financial services market also provides a possible illustration of the extent to which, and the speed with which, adversely affected innovators can truncate an unwanted propertization outcome through lobbying actions and constrained enforcement activity, which together cuts back the effective level of property rights coverage, which in turn limits litigationrisk. This, in turn, can hold back defection rates that would otherwise propel the market into further propertization. Below is the same Figure depicting patenting rates over the past decade in business methods; however, the indicated events now consist of a variety of actions undertaken by financial services firms to restrain implementation of formally available property entitlements. By July 1999, exactly twelve months after the State Street decision, financial services firmsbad already achieved enactment of a unique prior user defense, whichprotects against infringement claims over business method innovations\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that have been practiced privately but never disclosed to the public, (88) thereby directly reducing the litigation risk from staying outside of the property regime and preserving some of the cost advantage\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of the sharing regime. (89) In March 2000, the PTO responded to public pressure by introducing a second review process for \"class 705\" patent applications (90) in order to improve patent quality, which indirectly reduced litigation risk by increasing the costs of obtaining patents, thereby reducing anticipated adoption rates, which again preserves some of the cost advantage of the sharing regime. At roughly the same time, Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon (the same company that had aggressively litigated business method patents during the initial \"rushto patent\"), floated a proposal to limit the term of business methodpatents to three to five years and create an opportunity for the public to submit prior art to patent examiners to filter out \"bad\" business-method patent applications. (91) For purposes of our analysis, this represents an attempt to induce market coordination so as to accrue\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0joint gains from scaling back a collectively injurious propertization outcome.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the Bezos proposal for a sui generis reduced term for business method patents was never adopted, leading players in the financialservices community are currently lobbying for general legislation torelax patent protections (92) and unique legislation that would grant\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0specific immunity from the Data Treasury litigation described above.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(93) These same business pressures have apparently been reflected by\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Federal Circuit in recent decisions that appear to narrow the scope of State Street to methods that are embodied in a particular technological application, (94) culminating in 2008 in the decision in In\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0re Bilski. (95) In that decision, the court expressly reconsidered its 1998 decision, in part on the basis of a large number of amicus briefs filed with the court (including a brief by the financial services industry--as well as a brief by the computer and communications industry--urging the court to overrule State Street and its progeny). (96) While the court did not entirely repudiate State Street and rejected any flat prohibition against business method patents or other patents lacking a physical apparatus, it identified a \"machine-or-transformation test\" promulgated in older Supreme Court jurisprudence (97) as the principal test for patentable subject matter and suggested that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0patent claims that involve stand-alone \"abstractions\" would violatethe long-standing prohibition on patenting abstract intellectual concepts. (98) In re Bilski (now renamed Bilski v. Doll) has now been accepted for review by the Supreme Court, which will have an opportunity\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to clarify the standard for patentable subject matter in the field of non-technical business methods (and perhaps more generally). (99)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hence, in the space of ten years and against the background of especially high litigation risks posed by idiosyncratic resource holders,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0intensive investment by an adversely affected and concentrated innovator population--namely, large firms in the financial services community-has substantially truncated a formally available intellectual property regime and, pending the Supreme Court's review of In re Bilski,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0now threatens even to cause its near demise. Lobbying actions have been complemented throughout by a policy of constrained adoption and enforcement of financial method patents, whereby each firm contributes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to reducing perceived litigation risk by limiting its accumulated stock of patent rights and its exercise of those rights. Consistent with this mutual restraint strategy, large financial services firms generally have only made a relatively modest number of patent applications (100) and have brought many fewer infringement suits under these patents. (101) Litigations to enforce financial method patents have overwhelmingly been brought against asset-rich investment banks, creditcard issuers, and/or trading exchanges by small-firm outsiders that typically have no business operations, acquired the relevant patent from a third party, and/or lack the brand capital and other bundled product attributes of a large financial services firm. (102) It may seem\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0curious that firms expend resources to amass even a modest patent inventory while failing to reap the fruits of these expenditures through infringement actions (and taking lobbying actions to reduce the value of these entitlements). But it is fully consistent with an effortby incumbent innovators (i) to partially adopt state-provided property entitlements so as to limit litigation exposure to enforcement actions by idiosyncratic holders, but (ii) to refrain from enforcement (and to seek legislative changes that would limit enforcement) in order\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to avoid a collective loss in the form of the transaction cost burdens inherent to a fully deployed property regime.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[FIGURE 7 OMITTED]<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Indirect Truncation<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Popular and scholarly commentary widely assumes that certain innovation markets--especially multicomponent markets such as biotechnology, software, and information technology--suffer from thickets of overlapping property rights that restrain and encumber research and development activities, thereby slowing, rather than promoting, innovativeoutput. But this often-repeated statement loses considerable force given that empirical inquiries to identify patent thickets or related \"anticommons\" effects in these markets have so far failed to confirm or reject any inhibitory effect on innovation activity. (103) Moreover, these indeterminate (if still preliminary) findings are consistentwith the broad sweep of intellectual property history: unambiguous cases of \"IP bottlenecks\" are few, whereas transactional solutions that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0solve or preempt actual or potential bottlenecks are abundantly documented. (104) These solutions extend across an impressively broad range of periods and markets, each of which engineers a customized transactional landscape where the surrounding property regime is formallyunchanged but is displaced in part by embedded cooperative arrangements that pool knowledge assets among various firms, thereby effectively lifting property rights protections among the participant group and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0preserving in part the low transaction cost structure of a sharing regime. Historical and contemporary arrangements include: tens of patent pools that covered a large number of manufacturing industries in the pre-World War II era; (105) thousands of strategic alliances and knowledge-cooperative arrangements in the biotechnology industry between private firms and academic or other not-for-profit entities, including the formation of public or quasipublic databases for biologicaland genetic materials that are freely or substantially accessible toa large pool of academic and commercial users (for example, Merck Gene Index, SNP Consortium, and GenBank); (106) widespread cross-licensing, constrained enforcement, and, more recently, research and development consortia that characterize the semiconductor industry; (107) and patent-pooling arrangements in the consumer electronics and telecommunications industries, including the \"MPEG LA\" pools that cover patents relating to essential data-compression and other technology standards, involve hundreds of patent holders and thousands of patents, and cover hundreds of millions of dollars in worldwide sales. (108)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The impressive diffusion and variety of cooperative solutions to excessive propertization outcomes, and the resulting effective recalibration of state allocated legal entitlements, broadly track the limited optimism of the STMP thesis: an adversely affected innovation market that does not suffer from high coordination costs or a skewed propertization bias is unlikely to be stuck with an excessive property regime it does not want or need. This qualified optimism in the self-correction capacities of certain innovation markets relies on a straightforward profit-maximization principle: subject to coordination cost obstacles, any transaction cost inefficiency as a result of excessivepropertization inherently induces rational investments by adversely affected innovators to accrue the gains from correcting it. Even in the otherwise adverse case where no individual firm has sufficient interest or resources to undertake corrective action to scale back an excessive propertization outcome, third-party intermediaries may have arational profit incentive to do so (something which has occurred in the case of the long-established American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) and Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) organizations in the music industry and the newly formed \"MPEG LA\" patent poolsin the consumer electronics industry). Following this guardedly optimistic view, even complex innovation markets that are inherently susceptible to a property trap that entrenches unneeded intellectual property protections will rationally engage in some meaningful level of mutually beneficial Coasean bargaining, which in turn yields cooperative mechanisms that trade off innovation gains against transaction costs and associated losses. These cooperative arrangements are fully consistent with the underlying social cost-benefit rationale that lies behind the Demsetz model of rights formation (and the Coasean model of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rights reallocation), but working in reverse (109): competing firmspartially abandon or otherwise constrain a property regime in order to enter into mutually beneficial arrangements that generate collective gains in the form of reduced transaction costs and associated innovation gains.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0C. Why \"Too Much\" Property Often Does Not Last<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The STMP thesis--and, in particular, the expectation that individually rational innovators will sometimes take actions to adjust collectively irrational propertization outcomes--directly anticipates a real-world scenario of substantial importance largely overlooked by the intellectual property literature: large resource holders actively andsuccessfully resist the imposition of novel intellectual property protections, actively lobby for the withdrawal, reversal, or dilution of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0intellectual property protections, and, most strikingly, regularly forfeit large pools of knowledge assets to the public domain. The essential reason behind this otherwise curious behavior is simple: largeresource holders do not simply seek to maximize initial innovation gains, as various versions of the ATMP thesis assume or imply; rather,they self-interestedly seek to maximize the cumulative stream of initial plus subsequent innovation gains, net of transaction costs, as the STMP thesis correctly observes. (110) Assume that a large firm is a\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0repeat player that tends to stand on both sides of intellectual property transactions and litigations with roughly equal frequency (111)(or more precisely, tends over time to have roughly equal economic values at stake as, respectively, seller/plaintiff or buyer/defendant).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It will then rationally assign roughly equal weight to each component of the net social product generated by intellectual production--innovation gains and transaction cost losses attendant to increased propertization--which, in turn, implies that it will demand property rights approximately at a level that mimics the social interest in maximizing the social product yielded by innovation investment. Contrary to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0natural intuitions, it may therefore be the case that the largest resource holders will tend to have the strongest incentives to relax intellectual property protections where incremental transaction costs and associated innovation losses race ahead of incremental innovationgains, thereby self-interestedly acting to expand the public domain in at least partial consistency with the social interest. Further challenging natural intuitions (and setting aside distributive considerations), this implies in turn that individual end users and individualinventors will tend to have the weakest incentives to demand socially\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0compatible levels of intellectual property protections. End users will demand too little property (by underweighting initial innovation gains and overweighting transaction costs) while individual inventorswill demand too much property (by overweighting initial gains and underweighting transaction costs and associated innovation losses), especially (as may typically be the case) if these firms or individuals are not repeat players. (112)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The surprising proposition that large firms may sometimes act as the strongest bulwark against too much property accounts not only for the widespread distribution of knowledge sharing arrangements among direct competitors in technology markets but also for even bolder and more curious varieties of rational forfeiture of knowledge assets. Self-interested efforts by large firms to reduce transaction costs (andthereby accrue resulting innovation gains) can account for the surprisingly widespread practice whereby firms with rich innovation portfolios make substantial giveaways of knowledge assets, tolerate infringement, and advocate relaxed forms of intellectual property protection(which is functionally equivalent to forfeiting exclusivity over some\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0existing and future pool of knowledge assets). Consider, in chronological order:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1) The Automotive Technology Giveaway. Starting in 1911, virtually\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0all U.S. automobile manufacturers automatically cross-licensed patented technologies at a zero royalty rate. In 1938, Ford Motor Companyreported that it offered its patents to \"any applicant\" at no chargeand declined as a matter of policy to bring enforcement actions evenagainst parties that used its technology without obtaining the zero-royalty license. (113) Similar policies have continued in the automotive industry formally and informally through the present day (114) (as\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0indicated in part by its relatively low incidence of patent litigation (115)).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2) The AT&amp;T/Bell Labs Giveaway. Starting in 1952, AT&amp;T made available to all applicants its transistor and related patents at low royalty rates of 0 to 2% of sales (subject to a cross-license obligation in some cases), which provided the foundation for the semiconductor industry. The policy was rendered mandatory by a government consent decree in 1956; however, AT&amp;T reportedly exceeded the decree's requirements in its efforts to disseminate transistor technology and related know-how to licensees. (116)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3) The IBM Know-How Giveaway. From 1958 through 2998, IBM, through\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0its Technical Disclosure Bulletin, released substantial know-how concerning unpatented technical improvements that it had developed, which in turn have been cited as prior art in 48,000 patent applications.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(117)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(4) The Corporate Research Giveaway. Technology firms contribute to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the public domain large amounts of valuable knowledge, either in scientific journals or in vanity trade journals established precisely for this purpose and distributed among research laboratories. (118) Between 1991 and 2000, IBM and AT&amp;T were the first and second most prolific publishers of papers in computer science, AT&amp;T was the most prolific publisher of papers in physics, and IBM was one of the five mostprolific publishers of papers in physics. (119)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(5) The Financial Information Giveaway. The Bloomberg Corporation,one of the world's leading providers of data to the financial markets, has vigorously (and successfully) resisted the imposition of intellectual property protection (120) precisely because it is a heavy user\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of informational inputs and rationally anticipates that enhanced propertization would be unlikely to generate internalization gains in excess of internalization costs.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(6) The Information Technology Giveaway. In the information technology markets, major firms regularly contribute patented technology toindustry standard-setting organizations, which then take ownership of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the technology or require that the contributing firm license the technology to organization members on a royalty-free or \"reasonable andnondiscriminatory\" basis (and sometimes even compels licensing to nonmembers that use the standard). (121)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(7) The Biotech Giveaway. Following the advent of case law that strengthened patent protection for certain genetic material (122) and the subsequent exploitation of these rights in the biotechnology industry, large pharmaceutical companies have sponsored the creation of public access databases for certain genetic and other biological material. For example, Merck &amp; Co. has sponsored, in collaboration with Washington University, the Merck Gene Index for expressed gene sequence tags, and thirteen major pharmaceutical companies have sponsored the SNP Consortium, which provides private funding for a project dedicated\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to developing a \"next-generation\" map of the human genome in coordination with various government health ministries and academic research\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0institutes. (123)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(8) The Proprietary Software Giveaway. In 2005, IBM, Sun, and Nokia\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0issued pledges not to enforce their patents against open source software developers. (124) In the same year, IBM and other major technology companies agreed with leading universities on guidelines to permit\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the free availability of software developed in \"precompetitive\" industry-academic collaborative projects. (125)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(9) The Open-Source Software Giveaway. In the open-source softwaremarket, where applications are released largely without copyright protections against third-party usage and distribution (subject to certain contractual restrictions), substantial funding (roughly estimatedat $1 billion per year) and hundreds of technical staff are now supplied by proprietary software firms. Some of these firms are participants in the Open Invention Network, a nonprofit entity that patents, or\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0acquires patents to, open-source technologies and then contributes them into an open access innovation pool. (126)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistent with this historical pattern of voluntary forfeitures by\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0large holders of knowledge assets, the country's leading information\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0technology and financial services firms, acting through a trade group known as the Coalition for Patent Fairness, (127) are now pushing for patent reforms that would increase the difficulty in obtaining patents, reduce the difficulty in contesting patents, and lower the damages for which infringers are liable. (128) These \"publicly interested\" efforts to constrain intellectual property protection jar with thefamiliar observation of rent-seeking actions by large-firm incumbents\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to push through socially excessive levels of intellectual property protection and enclose the public domain, all of which is purported to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0operate consistently to the public detriment while enriching the pockets of the relevant corporate treasury. Such cases certainly exist and have been documented in extensive detail. (129) Indeed, these pathological cases are fully anticipated by the theoretical discussion above, which contemplates a strong propertization bias in the case of highly integrated entities that make little use of outside sources toaccess required inputs. It may therefore be no accident that some ofthe most vigorous articulations of the too much property thesis are advanced with respect to the entertainment and other content-dependent\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0industries, where there is a reasonable case that the most dominantfirms have rich copyright estates that necessitate little recourse to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0outside sources for creative inputs, thereby implying a skewed biasin favor of excessive propertization levels, (130) and adversely affected groups tend to be highly dispersed, thereby implying a weak ability to undertake any corrective action. The extent to which the entertainment industry as a whole exhibits a skewed propertization bias, and the extent to which adversely affected groups--which broadly include users, (some) creators, hardware manufacturers, and distribution intermediaries--have capacities to correct excessive propertization outcomes, both through legal and extralegal strategies, are open and complex empirical questions deserving of further inquiry. (131)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is quite certain, however, is that a large number of economically critical markets--including the information technology, software,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0database, financial services, and biotechnology markets--are not always pathological. Specifically, large firms in these markets have periodically made impressive undertakings to limit the coverage and strength of formal intellectual property rights and have done so precisely in newly propertized innovation markets that are widely claimed tosuffer from too much property.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following the one-sided view of the ATMP thesis, and the distributive critique that presumptively casts doubt on most (if not all) propertization outcomes, these recurrent attempts by large resource holders (often necessitating substantial dollar investments) to cut back intellectual property coverage are difficult to explain. Why would IBM,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the world's largest patent holder with over $1 billion a year in royalty income from its patent portfolio, (132) consistently lobby to secure legislative and judicial actions (including repeatedly filing briefs in recent Supreme Court and Federal Circuit patent cases in favor of relaxed patent protections (133)) that would limit its ability to obtain and defend patents and thereby reduce the value of its portfolio and associated licensing income? Why would Apple, Cisco Systems,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hewlett Packard, Intel, and Microsoft (just to name a few) all do roughly the same? Each of these firms individually holds thousands of patents but files, or participates in industry associations (134) that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0regularly file, amicus briefs recommending outcomes that would relax\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0patent protections (135) and, as noted above, actively lobbies for currently pending reforms that would generally make it harder to obtain patents, easier to contest patents, and lower damages for patent infringement. (136)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Failure to explain what facially appear to be irrational giveawaysof substantial proportions is a major shortcoming. This explains whyconventional intellectual property commentary sometimes misinterprets\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pro-reform lobbying actions by the high technology industry as a \"surprising\" turnaround in strategy. Not at all. This IP-resistant strategy is consistent with past positions taken by large firms in cumulative innovation markets. In 1938, the CEO of Ford Motor Company, together with his legal counsel, testified before a U.S. Senate committeein support of proposed reforms that would increase the difficulty ofobtaining and renewing patents, a position fully consistent with Ford's then publicly stated policy of open licensing and nonenforcement of patents. (137) Ford and its automotive peers in the 1930s and IBM and its information technology peers today are far from non sequiturs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These voluntary truncations and forfeitures of property rights protections recur periodically as innovator populations recalibrate runaway propertization outcomes from time to time. Today the IP resistanceof large incumbents in technology-based industries is targeted most vigorously at patent holding companies (known pejoratively as \"trolls\"), which are widely portrayed as acquiring patents for the purpose of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0extracting hold-up payouts from cash-rich firms faced with the threat of a shutdown injunction and treble damages in the case of an adverse judgment. (138) Consistent with the STMP thesis, these firms haveinvested efforts in lobbying for legislative reforms to the patent statute (139) and, as noted above, filing amicus briefs in a recent series of high-profile patent litigations, in each case advancing positions that limit a patent holder's ability to prevail and/or win damages in an infringement suit. Those litigations have resulted in decisions that advance this objective considerably, most notably making it much harder for a nonpracticing patent holder to obtain injunctive relief even after a finding of validity and infringement (thereby neutralizing the shutdown threat), (140) making it easier to contest the validity of a patent on obviousness grounds, (141) and making it harder\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for a patent holder to show willful infringement (which would entitle it to treble damages). (142) As a minor complement to these lobbying efforts, large firms have formed nascent transactional arrangements\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0intended to protect against the \"patent troll\" threat; as noted previously, (143) a consortium of leading technology companies has launched the Open Invention Network, which seeks to acquire a portfolio ofcritical patents to be made available at no cost to any firm that agrees not to assert its patents against Linux open source software developers. (144)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The STMP thesis fully anticipates these strategic actions by dominant IP-rich firms to roll back intellectual property protections in the face of third parties' idiosyncratic adoption and enforcement practices: long-term industry players rationally seek to constrain property rights protections in order to maximize the cumulative stream of innovation gains net of transaction costs. To achieve this objective, these firms undertake lobbying, adoption, and/or enforcement actions.They also form various transactional arrangements, subject to the coordination cost constraints and political \"noise\" that sometimes prevent realization of socially preferred propertization outcomes. The constrained optimism of the STMP thesis, which envisions imperfect Coasean bargaining in the political and commercial marketplace subject tocoordination cost constraints (rather than the unconstrained pessimism of the ATMP thesis, which assumes uniformly high coordination costs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and therefore rules out Coasean outcomes, or the unconstrained optimism of the NTMP thesis, which assumes uniformly low coordination costs and therefore universally assumes Coasean outcomes) is apparently often (if only partially) satisfied in practice.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0III. REGIME SELECTION IN PRACTICE<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether or not the process-based approach to propertization outcomes is a useful analytical construct will ultimately be determined in its sustained application to particular innovation markets, which will\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in turn yield a finer grained understanding of the ability (or inability) of adversely affected innovator populations to scale back excessive propertization outcomes. In this Part, I preliminarily apply this approach for the purpose of illustrating its potential explanatorypower as a positive account of regime selection in innovation markets. First, I exploit the interaction between property trap effects andtruncation actions to yield a general regime template that sketches a\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0partially deterministic pattern consisting of an initial rush to propertization. This initial rush is then followed by self-correction actions, which are respectively aggravated and promoted principally asa function of coordination cost conditions and propertization biasesamong the dominant innovator population. Second, on the basis of this\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0template, I describe a unique regime path for the semiconductor market, which has the useful characteristic that, in the course of several decades, it has traveled along virtually the full length of the extended regime path, which uniquely illustrates incumbents' capacity to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0recalibrate propertization outcomes in order to defend against imitation threats (which demand more property), and lower transaction cost\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0burdens (which demand less property), both of which endanger long-term maximization of net gains from innovation investments.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A. Regime Template<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The standard narrative of intellectual property expansionism assumes a discrete one-way jump from a pristine \"state of nature\" commons to a state imposed property regime, which is then situated within a rigid framework where large resource holders consistently deploy disproportionate lobbying and enforcement resources to promote increased propertization subject only to budget constraints, presumably at the expense of small innovators, individual end users, and the social interest more generally. (145) By this stage, it should be clear that this\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0story is naive insofar as it overlooks (among other things) the demonstrated possibility that even--or, most strikingly, especially and only--large resource holders will rationally decline to seek and willeven resist expansions in intellectual property coverage if this generates anticipated transaction costs and associated innovation lossesin excess of anticipated innovation gains. So long as we do not exclude the possibility that increasing transaction costs, and resulting innovation losses, may overwhelm innovation gains from increased propertization (which must hold true in some single instance for any formulation of the too much property thesis to have any practical relevance), a far more complex narrative emerges. Innovator populations continuously pursue the cumulative stream of net innovation returns by allocating resources to lobbying, adoption, and enforcement actions, aswell as the formation and maintenance of cooperative arrangements, which in turn generate a variety of possible movements along a graduated regime path that is reversible, consists of multiple stages, and travels over a range of commons, property, and sharing regimes (including truncated and other hybrid property regimes).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Figure below provides a graphical illustration of these various\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0regime types and some of the possible movements between, from, and to each type. Starting with a sharing regime that sustains innovationthrough extralegal appropriation mechanisms, the innovator population\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0is driven by idiosyncratic actions or some other triggering event toward a state-provided property regime, which may then immediately orultimately take several alternative forms. These include: (i) a fully\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0deployed property regime; (ii) a directly truncated property regimewhere any legal protections are mostly a dead letter (as noted earlier, a not-uncommon occurrence (146)) and a sharing regime effectivelypersists as the dominant governance structure; or (iii) an indirectly\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0truncated property regime, where the dominant property regime has some meaningful force but is substantially displaced by embedded cooperative arrangements voluntarily formed by adversely affected innovator\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0entities.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[FIGURE 8 OMITTED] (147)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These generic movements among regime types are consistent with thehandful of existing discussions of evolutionary tendencies in intellectual property law, which envision alternating periods of underprotection and overprotection in response to external technological developments and exaggerated legal responses. (148) In contrast to these approaches, however, this model links the historical ebbs and flows in intellectual property coverage with an underlying tradeoff between (i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0innovation gains (which tend to demand more property); and (ii) transaction costs plus associated innovation losses (which tend to demand\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0less), the practical implementation of which is in turn influenced by propertization biases and coordination cost conditions among dominant innovator populations. More specifically: this model anticipates that (i) any idiosyncratic lobbying or enforcement action will inherently tend to elicit excessive propertization whereby transaction costs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(and resulting innovation losses) overrun innovation gains, which, barring sufficiently high coordination costs or a sufficiently skewedpropertization bias, will then inherently be followed by (ii) truncation actions by adversely affected innovator populations that apply lobbying pressures or, of greater practical interest, form transactional structures to move toward a weaker propertization outcome. In the following case study, I will first assess the extent to which this idealized model of regime evolution tracks the actual evolution of intellectual property rights over approximately six decades in the U.S. semiconductor market.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0B. Case Study: Regime Selection in the Semiconductor Industry<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The semiconductor market, (149) which dates its inception from theinvention of the transistor in 1947 (or alternatively, the subsequent\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0invention of the integrated circuit in 1961), is a field of obviously paramount importance (2007 worldwide revenues of $275.5 billion (150)) in modern economies based on the ubiquitous use of electronic components. Roughly following the generic template sketched above, thishistorical case study begins in a sharing regime that supports a collective innovation pool largely bereft of robust propertization, thenexperiences substantially increasing adoption and enforcement of intellectual property rights, and then backtracks to a hybrid regime where cooperative arrangements are embedded within a property regime. AsI shall now examine in greater detail, the hybrid structure under which semiconductor firms currently operate is the result of an ongoingcalibration process that can be understood in terms of three primarymovements along a regime path moving between greater and lesser propertization, which is driven both by idiosyncratic actions that activate formally available property rights and self-correction efforts to minimize the transaction cost burdens associated with a robust property regime.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. Property at Bay (c. 1956-1982)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first stage coincides with the industry's early years of technological development, during which time the U.S. semiconductor industry effectively operated under a sharing regime where basic technologies were widely disseminated. Observers widely report that firms typically did not place great value on patent protection and devoted limited resources to obtaining and defending patents, (151) for the most part tolerating reverse engineering and relying on lead time and tradesecrecy protections in order to secure returns. (152) This cooperative convention was rooted historically in two major actions. First, a collective innovation pool was generated through open licensing practices at IBM and AT&amp;T, (153) which predated the 1956 antitrust consentdecrees that made these mandatory, and are credited with institutingan industry convention of cross-licensing among domestic firms at below-market royalty rates. (154) Second, to protect against supply disruptions, buyers customarily insisted that any supplier designate a \"second source\" supplier to cover any production shortfall, which in turn necessitated sharing process and product technology with a competitor. (155) Given the fundamental technological breakthroughs achieved\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0during this period, it is hard to argue that this sharing regime did\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0not provide a sustainable regime for innovation investment under then existing market conditions.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Property Unleashed (c. 1982-1988)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second stage starts with a \"demand shock\" and \"supply shock\" to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the sharing regime that had previously governed the semiconductor market: in respective order, this refers to the growth of the consumerelectronics market and the market penetration achieved in the early 1980s by lower cost firms from Japan, which halved U.S. firms' share of the worldwide market in less than ten years. (156) U.S. firms' loss\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of market share to Japanese firms, who drew on but (following standard accounts) made little contribution to the existing innovation pool, (157) strained the appropriation capacities of the sharing regime that had theretofore governed the industry. These pressures ultimately\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0resulted in abandonment of the sharing regime in two separate actions. First, in 1984, U.S. firms successfully lobbied for the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act (158) (SCPA), which provides sui generis protection for the \"mask work\" (that is, the circuitry layout design) ofa semiconductor chip. The statute uniquely authorizes reverse engineering for purposes of creating a new mask work, (159) a feature that is consistent with an attempt to preserve low-cost sharing practices within a surrounding property regime. (160) The second action, however, is more suspect. In 1985, Texas Instruments (TI) (161) defected from the industry's low enforcement norm-at the time, to the loudly expressed chagrin of its competitors (162)--by bringing patent infringement suits against Japanese firms, and then subsequently demanding increased royalties from domestic licensees, often based on patents thatTI had held since the early 1970s but, consistent with the then prevailing low enforcement convention, had not previously asserted? (163)Prominent firms such as IBM, Motorola, and AT&amp;T--all of which had once been firm advocates for weak intellectual property rights in the semiconductors market--followed TI's defection, exploiting the newly activated property regime to push royalty rates on chips above historically below-market levels, (164) which subsequently led the entire market into active deployment of patent protections. This result is consistent with the property trap model: absent coordination, perceived litigation risk and associated costs trigger rapid propertization-even\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by firms that had previously opposed it--following even a single defection from the existing cooperative norm.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Property Constrained (c. 1988-present)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third stage is characterized by two contradictory developments.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, propertization has been accelerated throughout the market: the \"TI strategy\" became the industry norm as patenting rates increased\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0dramatically among all semiconductor firms, (165) even exceeding the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0overall increase in U.S. patenting during the same period. (166) Small design-based firms in particular have made extensive efforts to adopt and enforce patent rights, (167) including both \"fabless\" firms that lack any independent fabrication capacity (168) and \"chipless\" firms that provide modular components (known as \"IP blocks\" or \"cores\")\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for assembly into complex integrated circuit products. (169) Second,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0formal propertization has been simultaneously limited by efforts undertaken by large firm incumbents, consisting of: (i) constrained enforcement of patent rights against other large firm competitors (who have not initiated more patent litigation since the early 1980s, controlling for increases in the number of patents held and/or amount of R&amp;D spending); (170) and (ii) multiple industry-level and firm-level cooperative ventures, covering a wide variety of research consortia, strategic alliances, (171) and broad \"field of use\" cross-licensing agreements among holders of similarly valued patent portfolios, which often set royalty payments at low or nominal levels consistent with the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0underlying objective of ensuring reciprocal access. (172) At the industry level there exist several large-scale ventures of substantial magnitude, including: (i) the Semiconductor Industry Association (the\"SIA\"), founded in 1977 by leading firms as the industry's trade association; (173) (ii) through SIA and cognate associations in other countries, the International Semiconductor Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, a trade group that sets technological milestones that guide\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0R&amp;D investment by member firms; (174) and (iii) several international standard-setting consortia that are vital to the development of the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0market in \"IP modules\" that are sold as intermediate inputs to fabless firms and integrated manufacturers. (175) Technology sharing is most expressly implemented in SEMATECH, (176) a unique institution in U.S. industrial policy that was founded in 1988 by thirteen firms (with assistance from the federal government) then representing eighty percent of the U.S. semiconductor chip market and now includes domestic\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and foreign members representing fifty percent of the worldwide semiconductor chip market. (177) This cooperative arrangement has facilitated the improvement of semiconductor-manufacturing technology and coordination of industry technological standards through internal R&amp;D programs and funding of external R&amp;D programs at private firms, the results of which are then disseminated to SEMATECH members in rough conformity with a knowledge sharing model. (178)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. End Result: Regime Bifurcation<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The semiconductor industry illustrates a hybrid innovation regime generated by a multidecade process of moving up and down the regime path between lesser and greater levels of propertization, each of which\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0achieves some tradeoff between innovation gains and transaction cost\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0losses. Figure 9 below provides a graphical overview of this mixed regime landscape, where (i) an actively deployed innovation regime, employed to the fullest extent by small-firm entrants and to a partialextent by large-firm incumbents, is infiltrated at multiple points by\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(ii) firm-level and industry-level cooperative mechanisms, used primarily by large-firm vertically integrated incumbents with similarly sized innovation portfolios. The analytical payoff from a bottom-up approach to understanding propertization processes in innovation markets should be apparent: the substantial complexity--or \"regime diversity\"--relative to the standard commons/property dichotomy is striking.On the one hand, widespread adoption and aggressive use of the formal\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0property rights regime (mostly, but not always, by smaller firms) is\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0indicative of a property regime, which is sometimes afflicted by arduous patent litigations. Exhibit A for this unwelcome side effect isthe Dickensian litigation currently being pursued by Rambus, a semiconductor firm that is pursuing suits against several firms for infringement of patents that purportedly cover technologies adopted by an industry standard-setting consortium. (179) On the other hand, the transaction cost burdens attendant to a formal property regime are ameliorated by constrained patent enforcement among large-firm enterprises,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cross-licensing arrangements, and an impressive variety of industry-level cooperative institutions, as a result of which mostly larger firms share valuable knowledge with similarly situated competitors.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[FIGURE 9 OMITTED] (180)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through this bifurcated structure (which can be described as a potential overpropertization outcome adjusted by corrective truncation actions), the low transaction cost environment that initially characterized the industry partially persists to the present day among incumbent firms despite stark changes in the total resources the industry allocates to the adoption and enforcement of formal intellectual property rights. Hence, despite operating under the burden of tens of thousands of patents and periodic patent litigations, it can fairly be argued that the industry has substantially (but certainly not entirely)escaped the property trap that could stifle product development beneath transaction cost burdens. Following the too much property thesis and its related variants, this is an inherently surprising achievement\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0given that multiple overlapping property rights and extraordinarilyhigh capital investments would appear to make the semiconductor market an especially strong candidate for falling prey to a patent thicket\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that stifles innovative output. Following a process-based approach,however, this surprising result is largely predictable: the rationalincentives of large resource holders in maximizing the cumulative stream of net innovation returns, together with inherently low obstacles\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to mutually beneficial coordination in concentrated markets, generate cooperative structures that relieve transaction cost burdens that might otherwise endanger innovative output.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CONCLUSION<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Article offers a process-based approach to understanding propertization processes in innovation markets: namely, the expansion andcontraction of intellectual property rights is viewed predominately as a function of private market investments in lobbying, adoption, and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0enforcement actions as well as a wide range of transactional and organizational arrangements for distributing and exchanging intellectual\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0assets. Application of this bottom-up framework confirms the standard view that individually rational pursuit of economic rents can yield\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0collectively irrational levels of intellectual property coverage: rational expectations of infringement liability and resource bottlenecks drive mutually destructive overconsumption of intellectual property\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rights. But a process-based approach makes the critical observationthat this overpropertization outcome is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain predicate conditions, which implies that it will sometimes be subject to modification or reversal. Where adversely affected\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0firms face low coordination costs (which is most likely to characterize concentrated or well-organized economic interests) and are neither clearly net users nor net producers of intellectual resources (which is most likely to characterize large firms in cumulative-innovation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0industries), then overpropertization is likely to be alleviated by lobbying actions or, more typically, a wide range of voluntarily formed sharing arrangements or even forfeitures of intellectual assets. Conversely, where these conditions are not substantially satisfied, then the pathological result is likely to be realized. This cautiously optimistic view of propertization processes relies on a reasoned application of private interest in service of the public interest: subject\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to coordination costs and propertization biases, transaction cost inefficiencies generated by overpropertization induce political, transactional, and organizational entrepreneurship to accrue the gains from\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0correcting it. To be sure, this proposition is far from a comprehensive account of regime selection in innovation markets: it is well known that political markets are \"noisy\" and further inquiry will demand\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0elucidation of the complex interaction between demand-side and supply side dynamics in the aggregate determination of propertization outcomes. It can nonetheless be observed that there exists some meaningful range of circumstances where the most influential market participants are likely to have socially compatible incentives and capacities to correct the transaction cost burdens and associated losses that arise from overpropertization outcomes. And if that is the case, then widespread but inherently uncertain claims that innovation markets chronically suffer from too much property are presumptively vulnerable for a simple reason: sometimes, the market will not stand for it.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1.)

By \"innovation market,\" I mean any market for the distribution\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of cultural, technological, or other ideational assets. For the most\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0part, empirical support for my thesis is drawn from markets for technology that are covered by patent rights (as well as database markets\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that are subject to minimal forms of copyright protection and certain semiconductor products that are covered by sui generis forms of protection). However, my thesis is formulated generically and is logically applicable to cultural markets that are covered by copyright. Forfurther discussion, see infra note 131.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(6.) This approach drives modern economically informed antitrust analysis. For a well-known account, see ROBERT H. BORK, THE ANTITRUST PARADOX: A POLICY AT WAR WITH ITSELF 116-33 (The Free Press 1993) (1978). Note that this \"alternative\" approach is the standard approach in\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0conventional microeconomic analysis, which generally seeks to demonstrate how competitive markets produce efficient outcomes, in contrast\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to most law and economics analyses, which generally seek to addresswhether particular legal rules or doctrines are efficient. See Paul H. Rubin, Judge-Made Law, in 5 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF LAW AND ECONOMICS : THE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ECONOMICS OF CRIME AND LITIGATION 543, 544-45 (Boudewijn Bouckaert &amp;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gerrit De Geest eds., 2000).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(7.) This standard does not exhaustively account for the complex bundle of social gains and losses generated by any extension of intellectual property coverage. However, it is a reasonably close translation of various formulations of the idea that intellectual property coverage is \"excessive\" and supplies a workable standard by which to isolate the market's ability and incentives to implement propertization outcomes in conformity with the social interest (understood in this limited but meaningful manner). For a precise definition of \"transaction cost losses,\" including subsequent innovation losses, see infra notes 52-53 and accompanying text. To avoid any broader efficiency implications, I endeavor throughout to describe \"correct\" propertization outcomes as \"socially compatible,\" \"socially preferred,\" \"socially desirable,\" or \"socially interested.\" For further discussion, see infranote 49.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(8.)

In particular, Figure 1 does not capture: (i) increases in the length of copyright and patent terms; (ii) increases (or decreases)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the ease of showing eligibility when applying for the relevant entitlement and infringement when bringing suit, especially relevant in\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the patent context; and (iii) increases (or decreases) in the typical range of damages awards and the availability of injunctive remedies.

The horizontal axis is \"normalized\" so that \"o\" designates zero propertization and \"1\" designates complete propertization. Note that this Figure is simplified to the extent that: (i) lobbying activities are confined to the promulgation and application stages, which will be a simplification in some cases where the legislature, agencies,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0or courts contemplate modifications to previously promulgated entitlements; and (ii) the application of promulgated entitlements by the courts or relevant agencies may sometimes lower propertization levelsor, alternatively, may be collapsed into the adoption and/or enforcement rubrics.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(15.) Some enforcement and administrative expenditures are made bygovernment agencies (which in turn can be construed as a function oflobbying by entitlement holders). As a practical matter, however, (i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"out-of-pocket\" administrative costs are negligible since the PTO is\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0now fully \"self-funded\" and the Copyright Office is partially \"self-funded\" by filing and other fees; and (ii) government enforcement expenditures fall well short of private expenditures (and can thereforehe safely omitted for analytical convenience).

See infra notes 19-24 and accompanying text.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(18.) The reverse is also possible: a weak level of formal intellectual property protection may effectively be enhanced through aggressive enforcement actions by entitlement holders. Several scholars haverecently pursued variations of this scenario in the copyright context, arguing that aggressive threats of infringement litigation againstcash-poor and/or risk-averse firms or individuals can lead to licensing practices that effectively extend the scope of the corresponding intellectual property entitlement and are sometimes subsequently entrenched through judicial decisions.

While not\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0based on hard data, Lemley's conjecture is consistent with other data that imply an extremely skewed distribution of patent values. See F.M.

As noted previously, this\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0is not intended to be a complete statement of the welfare effects of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0increased levels of intellectual property coverage; there may be social costs in addition to transaction cost losses that must be offsetagainst innovation gains. In particular, this standard omits the deadweight losses that are usually associated with increased levels of intellectual property protection as a result of output constraints imposed by intellectual property holders who rationally implement supracompetitive pricing, which in turn blocks efficient sales to some users\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0willing at least to pay a price equal to marginal cost. Even from aconsumer-welfare perspective, however, it is not clear that taking into account deadweight losses would make any difference \"on net\" so long as we also take into account the deadweight losses attributable to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0reduced levels of intellectual property protection. That too results\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in a decline in output, which in turn implies blocked efficient sales to users who would have been willing to pay the supracompetitive price that would have been demanded by the hypothetical intellectual property rights holder. Multiple antitrust commentators have expressedthe view that the social costs to consumers from supracompetitive pricing are far outweighed by the social costs to consumers from technological delay as a result of reduced innovation. See, e.g., Phillip Areeda, Antitrust Law as Industrial Policy: Should Judges and Juries Make It?, in ANTITRUST, INNOVATION, AND COMPETITIVENESS 29, 31 (ThomasM. Jorde &amp; David J. Teece eds., 1992) (noting the widespread view among economists that \"innovation has been thought to contribute far more to our well-being than keeping prices closer to costs through competition\"); Frank H. Easterbrook, Ignorance and Antitrust, in ANTITRUST, INNOVATION, AND COMPETITIVENESS, supra, at 119, 122 (\"An antitrustpolicy that reduced prices by 5 percent today at the expense of reducing by i percent the annual rate at which innovation lowers the costs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of production would be a calamity.\"); Donald F. Turner, Basic Principles in Formulating Antitrust and Misuse Constraints on the Exploitation of Intellectual Property Rights, 53 ANTITRUST L.J. 485, 485 (1985) (noting that \"in the long run, technological progress contributes far more to consumer welfare than does the elimination of allocative inefficiencies caused by noncompetitive pricing\").<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(50.) See, e.g., PROPERTY RIGHTS: COOPERATION, CONFLICT, AND LAW 5(Terry L. Anderson &amp; Fred S. McChesney eds., 2003).

NORTH, INSTITUTIONS, INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE (1990); and ANDREW SCHOTTER, THE ECONOMIC THEORYOF SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS (1981).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(51.) On the sequential nature of most innovation processes, see WILLIAM J. BAUMOL, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, MANAGEMENT, AND THE STRUCTURE OF PAYOFFS 181-84 (1993). For the leading economic analysis of sequential\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0innovation, see Suzanne Scotchmer, Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Cumulative Research and the Patent Law, 5 J. ECON. PERSP. 29 (1991).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(52.) This broad definition is standard usage in the property rights literature. Note, however, that I exclude: (i) costs related to appropriating the value of unprotected intellectual assets, which wouldbe reduced by intellectual property protections; or (ii) amounts paid\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to access protected intellectual assets, which are transfer payments\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0without any implications from a social efficiency perspective.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(53.) A clarification and a caveat. First, note that subsequent innovation losses must be restricted to subsequent innovation that still\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0would have been generated under some weaker level of propertization(either due to the assumption of intrinsic motivations or access to equivalent technological inputs in the public domain). This is sometimes overlooked. Second, to reiterate earlier disclaimers, see supra notes 7 and 49, the tradeoff stated above does not completely describethe bundle of social costs and benefits generated by greater or lesser levels of propertization.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(54.) In a zero transaction costs world, the holder of any intellectual property entitlement would rationally bargain to mutually efficient transactions with any derivative follow-on inventors. I note that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0more complex economic analysis of the first-mover/second-mover scenario stipulates additional conditions for this efficiency result to hold with certainty, although these too can be at least partially satisfied by assuming prior agreements between first-mover and second-mover innovators (which would by definition take place in a zero transaction costs world). See Scotchmer, supra note 51.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(55.) The leading decision is Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175 (1981), which recognized the eligibility of software for patent protectionso long as the software is implemented by a process or apparatus that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0itself would be eligible for patent protection. This decision was expanded subsequently to progressively remove the \"process or apparatus\" limitation. See AT&amp;T v. Excel Commc'ns, 172 F.3d 1352, 1356-60 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (following the decision in State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998),which rejected the claim that patentable software must have physicalstructure associated with it, so long as it otherwise produces a \"useful, concrete and tangible result\") ; In re Alappat, 33 F.3d 1526, 1540-45 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (en banc) (holding that the \"statutory process\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0or apparatus\" test is satisfied so long as the relevant claim is drafted to include a general purpose computer or standard hardware or memory element necessary for useful application of the relevant algorithm).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(56.) For the leading judicial decisions and agency actions, see Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980), which upheld a patent on genetically engineering microorganisms; 1118 O.G. 19 (1987), which stated that PTO \"now considers non-naturally occurring non-human multicellular living organisms, including animals, to be patentable subjectmatter\"; and Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., 927 F.2d 1200(Fed. Cir. 1991), which upheld a patent on purified and isolated DNAsequences encoding a red blood cell-stimulating protein.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(57.) See DOUGLASS C. NORTH, INSTITUTIONS, INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE AND\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 73, 110 (1990), Given this deficiency, the Demsetz thesis has been called a \"naive\" theory of property rights formation.

LEGAL STUD. $421(2002). In the economics and political science literature, there exist several dedicated critiques of the Demsetzian and related efficiency driven theories of institutional formation from a distributive and/or strategic bargaining perspective. See, e.g., DANIEL W. BROMLEY, ECONOMIC INTERESTS AND INSTITUTIONS: THE CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY (1989) ; JACK KNIGHT, INSTITUTIONS AND SOCIAL CONFLICT (1992) ; ITAI SENED, THE POLITICAL INSTITUTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY (1997).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(59.)

Other scholars have made similar observations. See, e.g., David E. Adelman &amp; Kathryn L. DeAngelis, Patent Metrics: The Mismeasureof Innovation in the Biotech Patent Debate, 85 TEX. L. REV. 1677, 1679 (2007) (noting but also challenging \"the widely held belief that the rapid growth in biotechnology patenting over the last decade is impeding innovation\"); F. Scott Kieff &amp; Troy A. Paredes, Engineering a Deal: Toward a Private Ordering Solution to the Anticommons Problem, 48 B.C.L. REV. 111, 112 (2007) (noting the recent \"explosion\" in the intellectual property literature on the anticommons problem, which asserts that the proliferation of patent rights can retard innovation).For the leading expression of the anticommons thesis, see Michael A.Heller, The Traegedy of the Anticommons: Property. in the Transitionfrom Marx to Markets, 111 HARV. L. REV. 621 (1998), which states that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0excessively fragmented property rights can generate net social losses by impeding, rather than facilitating, innovation (or, in a broader\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0real property context, other) investments; and Michael A. Heller &amp; Rebecca S. Eisenberg, Can Patents Deter Innovation ? The Anticommons in Biomedical Research, 280 SCIENCE 698 (1998), which advances the same thesis with respect to gene patents. For some of the most sophisticated arguments and empirical evidence advanced in favor of various forms of the patent thicket thesis, see JAMES BESSEN &amp; MICHAEL J. MEURER, PATENT FAILURE: HOW JUDGES, BUREAUCRATS, AND LAWYERS PUT INNOVATORS AT RISK (2008); ADAM B.

Jaffe, Josh Lerner &amp; Scott Stern eds., 2000). This is a highly selective listof references; a much larger legal literature has applied the thicket\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and anticommons concepts in a variety of contexts.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(61.) For related views, see Robert P. Merges, Contracting into Liability Rules: Intellectual Property Rights and Collective Rights Organizations, 84 CAL. L. REV. 1293, 1320-21 (1996), which argues that the conventional approach falsely imagines that private parties can dolittle about property entitlements incorrectly issued by the state and advances instead an approach that focuses on parties' ability to modify legal entitlements through social norms and cooperative institutions. For a similar statement in the property rights school more generally, see CARL J. DAHLMAN, THE OPEN FIELD SYSTEM AND BEYOND: A PROPERTY RIGHTS ANALYSIS OF AN ECONOMIC INSTITUTION 220 (1980), which states that the property rights approach recognizes that even the \"losers\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in institutional change\" can use bargaining power and/or form voluntary associations to adjust the effective property rights allocation.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(62.) See R.H. Coase, The Problem of Social Cost, 3 J.L. &amp; ECON. 1(1960).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(63.) This point recalls two important propositions found in the transaction costs literature on property rights. First, Demsetz observed in another publication that complete markets may sometimes be lesspreferred relative to incomplete markets to the extent that fully pricing all externalities in a complete market is an activity that diverts resources to policing market exchanges without necessarily generating commensurate social benefits in the form of allocative efficiencies. See Harold Demsetz, The Exchange and Enforcement of Property Rights, 7 J.L. &amp; ECON. 11 (1964). Second, other commentators have shown that an increase in asset values may not always precipitate further expenditures on rights enforcement since an increase in asset values can attract greater third party investments in thievery, thereby increasing policing costs that may swap any gains from increased propertization. See Douglas W. Allen, The Rhino's Horn: Incomplete Property Rights and the Optimal Value of an Asset, 31 J. LEGAL STUD. $339 (2002);\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Barry C. Field, The Evolution of Property Rights, 42 KYKLOS 319, 328\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1989). In more general forms of the latter point, other commentators have observed that property rights over any given item may not be fully defined to the extent that doing so generates transaction costswithout commensurate efficiency gains. See BARZEL, supra note 49, at64-67.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(64.) For further discussion, see infra note 112 and accompanying text.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(65.) For further discussion, see infra notes 86-87 and accompanying text.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(66.) For the only dedicated statement of this view (to my knowledge), see Easterbrook, supra note 2, at 412.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(67.) Generally, I do not focus on market movements between a commons and a property regime, which is the more typical focus in the economic and legal literature on the evolution of property rights, both in the real-property and intellectual property contexts. This is bothfor reasons of brevity and because I am of the view that the commonsis not especially relevant, for the simple reason that zero propertization usually does not offer a sustainable environment for innovation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0investment. I address this point in greater detail in a companion piece. See Barnett, supra note 38.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(68.) For the decision establishing the business methods limitation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(that is, the ineligibility of non-technical methods of doing business for patent protection), see Hotel Security Checking Co. v. Lorraine Co., 160 F. 467 (2d Cir. 1908).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(69.) See Josh Lerner, Where Does State Street Lead? A First Look at Finance Patents, 1971-2000 (Nat'l Bureau of Econ. Research, Working\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paper No. 7918, 2000), at 8. For one such litigation, see Paine, Webber, Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inc., 564 F. Supp. 1358, 1368 (D.

The erosion of the business methods limitation is largely a function of the expansion of protection for software applications. For\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the leading decisions that anticipated State Street, see Diamond v.Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 187-88 (1981), which upheld a patent claim about\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a process for curing rubber even though it \"employs a well-known mathematical equation\" and stating generally that a claim directed to subject matter that is otherwise patentable does not become unpatentable \"simply because it uses a mathematical formula, computer program, or digital computer\"; and In re Alappat, 33 F.3d 1516, 1542-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (en banc), which, following Diehr, held that the statutory\"process\" or \"machine\" test for patentable subject matter is satisfied so long as the patent claim \"as a whole\" is directed to an apparatus to produce a \"useful, concrete, and tangible result,\" even if the claimed machine accomplishes that result through a mathematical formula that would not be patentable subject matter by itself. In turn, these decisions were grounded in the Court's earlier decision, Diamond v. Charkrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980), which generally counseled a broad interpretation of patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. [section] 101.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(71.) 149 F.3d 1368 (Fed.

For further discussion, see infra notes 138-243 and accompanying text.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(76.) In a companion publication, I provide greater content to idiosyncratic preferences for defecting from a sharing regime, arguing that poorly endowed and richly endowed innovators (who, respectively, are rationally excluded from or rationally decline to participate in the collective innovation pool that sustains a sharing regime) are most likely to abandon an existing sharing regime. See Barnett, supra note 38.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(77.) The Figure shows the number of patents classified (either onan \"original\" or \"cross-reference basis\") under Class 705 of the U.S.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Patent Classification system, which is commonly associated with business method patents (and therefore includes, but is not restricted to, financial method patents) and is called \"Data Processing: Financial, Business Practice, Management, or Cost/Price Determination.\" Sources for the data shown are from Part A1, Table A1-2 of U.S. PATENT &amp; TRADEMARK OFFICE, PATENT COUNTS BY CLASS BY YEAR (2008),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.uspto.gov/go/taf/cbcby.htm\">http://www.uspto.gov/go/taf/cbcby.htm</url>. Note that Class 705 is both underinclusive and overinclusive with respect to finance-related patents: (i) underinclusive since some financial method patents may be classified under other categories and, of greater relevance; (ii) overinclusive since some Class 705 patents may be business method patents but not financial method patents. Nonetheless, Class 705 is a useful proxy for showing general trends. For a similar approach, see Merges, supra note 12,at 4 tbl.

All patent applications filed on or after November 29, 2000 must be published within eighteen months of the date of filing, unless\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i) the applicant requests that the PTO not publish the applicationand (ii) the applicant has not filed an application for the same invention in a foreign jurisdiction that also requires publication. See 35 U.S.C. 122(b)(1)(A)-(B) (2000); American Inventors Protection Act of 1999, Pub. L.

The free-rider problem in this context can be summarized as follows: without a credible agreement to enforce individual contributions (or without collateral benefits to induce individual contributions), each firm maximizes its individual payoff by declining to contribute and instead choosing to enjoy the gains generated as a result ofother firms' contributions; thus, when no firm contributes, the public good is not funded and all firms are left worse off.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(87.)

I note that some \"MPEG\" pools operate as simple cost-effective solutions to licensing large pools of patents, akin to the performance-rights licensing organizations in the content industries (for example, BMI and ASCAP), whichdoes not alter the formal propertization outcome; however, others appear to permit access to standard technologies by competitors for purposes of facilitating product development, which does diverge materially from formally allocated entitlements.

For discussions of a similar reversal in the classic sequence anticipated by Demsetz, see Merges, supra note 106, at 200-01, which argues that \"property-preempting investments\" in software, biotechnology, and cultural markets appear to reverse Demsetz's proposed correlation between an increase in property values and an increase in property rights, insofar as increases in the value of the relevant asset\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0class apparently trigger voluntary abandonment of property rights. Note that, whereas Merges primarily attributes the voluntary abandonment of property rights for competitive advantage to an increase in the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0value of the underlying asset, id., I attribute this phenomenon entirely to an increase in the transaction costs of sustaining participation in the property regime relative to the innovation gains that could be accrued by abandoning the regime. That is consistent with the Demsetz thesis, which provides that property rights will increase as afunction of increasing value, subject to the administration and enforcement costs of doing so. See supra notes 48-49 and accompanying text.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(110.) This is not the exclusive motivation for giving away knowledge assets that are, or could be, protected by patents or other entitlements. Most obviously, firms may forfeit patentable assets in orderto preempt competitors front patenting those assets, for which \"vanity journals\" are used in order to establish a prior art record. Some scholars have argued that firms will prefer to \"give away\" private technology in order to induce follow-on innovation that increases the value of the original innovation. See Oren Bar-Gill &amp; Gideon Parchomovsky, The Value of Giving Away Secrets, 89 VA. L. REV. 1857 (2003) (describing the increasing tendency among firms to publish, rather than patent, valuable private knowledge, which is attributed to a rationalinterest in credibly committing to share surplus with follow-on innovators). In the fashion context, I and co-authors have argued that luxury apparel firms prefer incomplete protections against third-party imitation--that is, to effectively \"give away\" a portion of any season's revenues on a winning product--in order to accrue \"runner-up\" awards in other seasons where the firm misjudges the winning style outcome. See Jonathan M. Barnett, Gilles Grolleau &amp; Sana El Harbi, The Fashion Lottery: Cooperative Innovation in Stochastic Markets, 39 J. LEGAL STUD. (forthcoming 2010).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(111.) This assumption has empirical grounding. Based on a datasetof U.S. public firms involved in 20,522 patent lawsuits during the period 1987-1999, Professors James Bessen and Michael Meurer have estimated that the hazard of being an alleged patent infringer has been slightly less than being a patent litigant (where hazard is calculatedas the sample mean rate of litigation per firm divided by the samplemean deflated R&amp;D expenditure). See James Bessen &amp; Michael J. Meurer,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Patent Litigation Explosion 17-18 (Boston Univ. Sch. of Law Working Paper Series, Law &amp; Econ. Working Paper No. 05-18, 2005),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ssrn.com/abstract\">http://ssrn.com/abstract</url>=831685. Importantly, these data show that a publicfirm's risk of being an alleged patent infringer (measured relative to R&amp;D spending) has risen sharply during the subject period (a seventy percent increase), id. at 18, which would in turn be consistent with the fact that (as I discuss shortly) these firms (in some industries) are the principal proponents behind proposed reforms to relax patent protections. Note that if hazard is measured alternatively as therate of litigation per patent, then the hazard rate does not change significantly during the subject period in general and behaves differently in different industries. See id. at 33.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(112.) It should be noted that the \"propertization bias\" of individual inventors and small firms may have some countervailing efficiency\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0benefits, to the extent that either (i) small firms are uniquely situated to generate certain types of innovations, or (ii) large firms have differential access to substitutes for intellectual property (inwhich case, reducing intellectual property protection necessarily protects incumbents against entry). For further discussion, see Jonathan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Barnett, Is Intellectual Property Trivial?, 257 U. PA. L. REV. 2691, 1726-29, 1736-37 (2009); and Barnett, supra note 44, at 1285-98.That in turn raises the broader question (outside the immediate scope\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of this Article) of whether \"second-best\" considerations would sometimes recommend some level of \"excessive\" propertization in order to offset the inefficiencies resulting from the concentrated market conditions that otherwise facilitate private-market efforts to reduce thetransaction cost losses attendant to an actively deployed property regime. Put differently: we may face an inherent choice between (i) a heavily propertized market with high transaction costs and associatedlosses but lower barriers for small-firm entry, and (ii) a lightly propertized market with low transaction costs and associated losses but\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0higher barriers for small-firm entry.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(113.)

There may be other reasons why, relative to other industries, entertainment firms are both more sensitive to the innovation gains\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and less sensitive to the transaction costs attendant to increased intellectual property rights. First, these firms generally operate ina capital-intensive \"hits market,\" which implies especially high requirements for copyright protection given a large \"appropriability gap\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0between creation costs (which must take into account the costs of creation across the large number of Failed projects) and imitation costs, which can be close to negligible depending on the quality of then-existing reproduction technologies. Second, while these firms produce\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0multi-component products akin to the information technology sector,firms can limit exposure to the transaction costs of a property rights system through (i) \"work for hire\" contracts (which preempt copyright infringement and \"joint works\" claims by freelance contributors);(ii) \"errors and omissions\" insurance against copyright infringementsuits; and (iii) regular refusal to review unsolicited submissions (which protects against copyright infringement and common-law misappropriation claims). These are all standard practices at Hollywood studios. Interview with David Fierson, Senior Vice President, Alcon Entm't,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in L.A., Cal. (Nov. 20, 2009). On studios' reluctance to review unsolicited manuscripts, see Igor Dubinsky, The Race to the Box Office Leads to Cinematic Deja Vu: Modifying Copyright Law To Minimize Rent Dissipation and Copyright Redundancy at the Movies, 29 WHITTIER L. REV.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0405, 411 (2007).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(131.) Note that the conventional view assumes that adversely affected populations in entertainment and other content markets lack any feasible means by which to influence propertization outcomes or otherwise reduce transaction cost burdens (which in turn would support thestandard normative view that copyright persists at excessive levels in these markets). Some preliminary observations suggest a murkier picture. Consider: (i) users can influence propertization outcomes by mass infringement and through conventional lobbying by collective organizations such as library associations and higher education institutions; (ii) hardware manufacturers can influence propertization outcomes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by selling devices that lower the costs of user infringement; and (iii) distribution intermediaries can influence propertization outcomes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by taking greater or lesser precautions against user infringement. Moreover, individual creators exercise leverage in the movie and television industries through trade guilds, and collective clearance organizations have largely solved transaction cost obstacles in performance rights over recorded musical works through associations such as BMI\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and ASCAP. See Merges, supra note 61, at 1328-40. More recently, some individual creators have adjusted propertization outcomes to a limited extent through \"Creative Commons\" licenses that waive certain copyright protections. In short, there is a rich mix of constituencies and strategies that imply a complex balance of power, which, without further analysis, may not immediately support the standard inference of excessive propertization.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(132.)

Some intellectual property commentators take the view that strong intellectual property protections hurt both end users and small\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0innovators.

As used herein (and following standard usage), \"semiconductors market\" refers to the market for integrated circuits (also known as a \"chip\" or \"device\"), which in turn generally fall into the threemajor categories of (i) memory components; (ii) logic devices; and (iii) integrated circuits (including microprocessors used in PCs) madeof components that combine categories (i) and (ii).

See supra note 116 and accompanying text. It is commonly stated that the consent decrees were the \"but for\" reason for these \"open licensing\" practices. As Richard Levin shows in detail, this is arguably not the case given that these practices predated the decree and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bell Labs exceeded the decree's requirements thereafter.

Japanese (and later, Korean and Taiwanese) firms pushed U.S.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0firms' share of the worldwide semiconductor market from approximately 56.7% in 1982 to 42.6% in 1992 and 48.3% in 2005.

At the time, U.S. manufacturers claimed that Japanese firmscopied the circuitry layout of U.S.-developed chips, which was not subject to intellectual property protections. See Leon Radomsky, Sixteen Years After the Passage of the U.S. Semiconductor Chip Protection Act: Is International Protection Working?, 15 BERKELEY TECH. L.J. 1049, 1051-52 (2000). Some commentators attribute Japanese success principally to superior, lower-cost production methods, with little importance placed on imitation of existing technology.

This exception permits reproduction of a protected mask work for purposes of \"evaluating the concepts\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0or techniques embodies in the mask work\" and then incorporating theresults of such analysis into a new mask work, which then in turn qualifies for protection assuming it meets the statutory originality requirement.

AS a practical matter, the statute has become an underused \"dead letter,\" largely due to certain technological advances thathave frustrated third-party imitation that relies solely on reverse engineering the layout design. See Radomsky, supra note 157, at 1077-82. Others argue that it retains some residual function in facilitating licensing of \"IP blocks\" among \"design only\" firms in the industry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See Jeffrey T. Macher, David C.

However, Fitch analysts note some potentially disruptive issues to watch: rising litigation costs and social inflation in the liability space and the risk of catastrophe losses.</p><p>In addition, countering upward price movements in other lines, workers compensation and personal auto rates are continuing to drop. Although workers comp pricing has declined for five straight years, it remains the most profitable of the commercial lines. On the personal lines side, automobile pricing may have peaked, Fitch says in the and in a separate report, \".\"</p><p>For personal auto specifically, Fitch Ratings projects a 2019 statutory combined ratio of 98, rising to breakeven levels in 2020.</p><p>The bottom line: \"The U.S. property/casualty insurance industry is positioned for moderate improvement in underwriting profits for 2019 and 2020,\" says James Auden, managing director and North American head of Non-Life Insurance Ratings atFitch Ratings. Pricing momentum in many commercial insurance lines is offset by prospects for weakening performance in personal auto and workers comp. Concern regarding adverse claims trends in several casualty segments also tempers the potential for near-term profit improvement.</p><p>(Read more in the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carrier Management</emphasis>articles, \"\" and \".\")</p><p>\"Unprecedented Discipline\": Willis Towers Watson Sees Rate Hikes Persisting Into 2021</p><p>\"We predict that rate hikes and capacity constrictions will continue throughout 2020 and likely into 2021.\"</p><p>Joseph C.

[If] you have a great pricing opportunity, companies try to imitate the successful [insurers], and it goes away pretty quickly.\"</p><p>The bottom line: The overall market is in a hardening pricing phase after gaining momentum in the past two quarters, Fitch Ratings says. However, competitive forces and less favorable claim trends in some key segments make it unlikely that recent rising premium rate trends will lead to enduring hard market profits and double-digit returns.</p><p>(Read more in the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carrier Management</emphasis>article, \".\")</p><p>USI Sees Rate Hikes Continuing in Most Lines</p><p>In a November 2019 report, USI Insurance Services predicted that rate increases and reductions in capacity for many property/casualty lines would continue into the new year, with the strongest price hikes in public D&amp;O.</p><p>For 20 of 28 different product lines included in theUSI lists higher rate change indications for the fourth-quarter 2019 than at midyear, anticipating more of the same in 2020.</p><p>Highlights from the report:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Expected pricing conditions are getting worse for buyers of public D&amp;O insurance, where the report shows late-2019 and early-2020 rate hikes of 25-50 percent-and doubling rates for troubled accounts.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>While many factors play in, \"the main driver is simply increased loss costs colliding with more than a decade of historically low premiums in the D&amp;O space, eroding insurer profitability.\"</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>For property insurance, fourth-quarter and early-2020 price hikes are coming in at anywhere from 10-20 percent for non-cat accounts to 30-60 percent on accounts with cat potential and poor loss history.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>With several years of attritional losses and higher-than-expect development on 2017 and 2018 catastrophes prompting higher pricing and reduced coverage from carriers, the report says that \"resetting this market will likely carry [on] into 2020.\"</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>In casualty lines, USI sees rate hikes of 5-10 percent for primary liability and anywhere from 10-30 percent on excess (the higher end for larger buyers).

Pricing complacency may be the more immediate yet less palatable impetus for this hardening pricing cycle, one that we believe will continue to play out into 2020,\" says S&amp;P Global Ratings credit analyst Tracy Dolin.</p><p>S&amp;P analysts said they don't look at headline pricing movements alone; they recognize that the industry has been making adjustments to underwriting standards. On the other hand, they find continued reserve releases to be a bit worrisome. They expect to see more slippage of reserve strengthening on a by-line basis, but aggregate reserve releases will remain positive into 2020. Overall, S&amp;P says prudence-in the form of capital preservation and underwriting discipline-supports its stable view of the sector.</p><p>KBW Expects Commercial Lines Rate Increases, Personal Lines Competition to Continue</p><p>For 2020, Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods's Meyer Shields expects sustained reinsurance and commercial-particularly specialty-rate increases (other than for workers compensation), with continuing competitive personal lines pricing.</p><p>Actual core commercial combined ratios should generally improve as these increases earn in, but many insurers will probably raise recent accident-year loss ratios to reflect higher liability loss trends, according to KBW's \"Property/Casualty Insurance .\"</p><p>Shields expects persistent rate decreases and fading reserve releases to raise reported workers comp combined ratios, while core personal lines margins should compress modestly. He mostly prefers specialty commercial insurers and reinsurers and expects individual company reserve adequacy to be the biggest differentiator.</p><p>Shields' top picks for 2020 are Outperform-rated AIG, AIZ, ARGO, AXS, BRP, CB, HIG, PROS, RNR, THG, WTRE and WLTW.</p><p>Deloitte: Integration of Old and New Necessary for Growth in 2020</p><p>The biggest challenge facing the P/C insurance industry in 2020 is \"how to integrate new tools, technologies and techniques with legacy systems while reconciling bold new ideas from InsurTechs, ecosystem partners and new hires with time-honored status quo practices,\" says The Deloitte Center for Financial Services in its \".\"</p><p>The outlook breaks that challenge into segments, offering advice on how to strategically address each. Here are a few highlights:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>InsurTech funding continues to flow from venture capital outside of the insurance industry. Deloitte advises insurers to actively engage in the development of InsurTech and become part of the transformation. Don't treat them like vendors but rather collaborate with innovators and even consider an acquisition. Insurers benefit from the ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit of startups while the InsurTechs benefit from the insurer's capital, expertise and market validation.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Compliance to state, federal and international regulation will continue to challenge insurers as the limitations of legacy systems and quantities of data maintained are problematic. Deloitte suggests routine data minimization (carefully and legally discarding information not needed), comprehensive governance programs, and use of new technologies that manage data while also making better use of it.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Innovation brings greater risk in 2020 and beyond. As insurers engage in external technological partners, expand use of connected devices, AI, quantum computing and 5G capabilities, the cyber threat increases. Deloitte suggests incorporating cybersecurity into all aspects of system development, timely patchworking of existing systems and empowering the CISO with greater input at the executive level to prioritize cybersecurity strategies.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Private flood markets offer growth, requiring investment in risk modeling and innovative methods to penetrate markets as property owners remain reluctant.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Partner with InsurTech to develop new products and distribution channels to meet the growing needs of the small business market.

Argo expects carriers will focus on their strengths \"and let go of the rest.\"</p><p>As well, Argo said it sees underwriters driving a superior customer experience through \"a light touch\" and by leveraging data and analytics.</p><p>Even as insurers get back to basics, however, they will have to confront trends such as social inflation, which Argo said will continue to rise. Social inflation involves the rising costs of insurance claims stemming from increased litigation, broader contract interpretations, plaintiff-friendly legal decisions and larger jury awards. These elements all grew in 2019 and Argo said they'll continue to increase in 2020.</p><p>Allianz Warns D&amp;O Insurers Must Prepare for 'Bad News' Litigation and Climate Change Risks</p><p>Allianz said it sees five major risk trends affecting directors and officers insurance in 2020, according to a new report, \"</p><p>Among the biggest: more litigation is coming to directors and officers stemming from bad news not necessarily connected to financial results. These problem areas include product snafus, manmade disasters, environmental disasters, corruption and cyber attacks, according to Shanil Williams, global head of Financial Lines at Allianz Global Corporate &amp; Specialty.</p><p>Allianz said it is so concerned about these types of cases because they can lead to major securities or derivative claims from shareholders when the bad news in question leads to a share price dip or regulatory investigation.</p><p>Climate change is another worry-the idea that a company's failure to disclose climate change risks could increasingly result in more litigation. As Allianz noted, climate change cases have already been filed in at least 28 countries, with 75 percent of them filed in the United States. The central argument of many of these lawsuits: Companies haven't adjusted how they do business to address changing climate conditions. Importantly, companies that fall short on climate change can see their brand values drop as a result, Allianz said.</p><p>Allianz said it is also concerned about the growth of securities class actions globally, the impact of bankruptcies and political challenges, and the global spread of litigation funders.</p><p>Forrester: 2020 Will Be All About Sustainability and Technology</p><p>As Forrester sees it, insurers and their brands will be all about sustainability and technology in 2020.</p><p>The consulting firm has taken notice of companies whose success depends more and more on their social and political values, and it argues that insurers are both paying attention and following suit, competing on their ethical credentials, according to its report, \".\"</p><p>Technology will matter, too, particularly the idea of connected home tech, sensors, smart home products, smart speakers and smart home data aggregators. Forrester predicts that the increasing adoption of these innovations will nudge insurers into exploring home and health insurance products and services that can work in tandem with the technology as its customers take it on.</p><p>Forrester also envisions the global growth of parametric insurance, a trigger-based fixed payout, among other innovations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRMNGT-cm202272</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRMNGT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0F-8D81-DY07-D42P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465779</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3513\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2020 Wells Media Group, Inc.

The full lineup of speakers is here and the agenda is here. Read through for the highlights of the 17 panels and news made at the summit. The conversation was also lively on Twitter with the hashtag #ProSummit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Treasury Secretary <person><nameText>Steven Mnuchin </nameText></person>says the idea of using a U.S. government plane for his recent honeymoon was about national security, and \"not about convenience.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reports that Mnuchin had asked to take a government plane with his new wife, actress Louise Linton, to Europe for their honeymoon this summer prompted immediate criticism yesterday.</p><p>But Mnuchin described the controversy over the request as overblown. The Treasury Department considered it, he said, because he needed access to secure communications channels while on the trip. He added that he ultimately withdrew the request after finding another option.</p><p>\"Let me be clear: I'm very sensitive to the use of government funds,\" Mnuchin said. \"I've never asked the government to pay for my personal travel, and this was purely about alternatives of how I'd be able to be involved for national security.\" </p><p>Mnuchin said he spends \"probably over 50 percent\" of his time on national security issues and sanctions and speaks to President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and officials such as Defense Secretary <person><nameText>James Mattis </nameText></person>almost daily.</p><p>Read more.</p><p>- Madeline Conway</p><p>A specific corporate tax rate will be included in the next tax reform outline coming from White House and congressional negotiators, Treasury Secretary <person><nameText>Steven Mnuchin </nameText></person>said.</p><p>\"You're going to see a specific rate proposal in that,\" he said.</p><p>The plan, which will be released the week of Sept. 25, will also include details on cutting the tax deduction businesses get for interest on their loans, Mnuchin said.</p><p>Tax reform legislation won't give tax cuts to the rich, he added, boosting comments made by President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>yesterday. Trump is referring to income taxes, and the objective is for the rich not to get an income tax reduction, Mnuchin said.</p><p>\"On the high end, the plan is to eliminate state and local deductions,\" he said. \"Even if we do end up with a slight reduction on the high end, that will offset by a reduction in the deductions.\"</p><p>After the tax reform details emerge, lawmakers should vote on budget plans to pave the way for tax reform legislation. Members of the tax-writing committees in Congress will then fill in the blanks on tax reform and mark up legislation to get it to Trump for his signature by the end of the year, Mnuchin said.</p><p>- Aaron Lorenzo</p><p>House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas), acknowledging Trump's cooperation with Democrats on major policy issues, said Republicans would welcome working with Democrats on areas of common ground within tax reform. </p><p>\"If Republicans aren't willing to unite and deliver on tax reform, he'll find someone else,\" to work with on tax reform, said Brady, who also kept the door open to working with Democrats on the tax overhaul. \"That doesn't preclude bringing the best minds ... from our Democratic colleagues [to the table] as well.\"</p><p>\"I think there's common ground to build on,\" Brady said, though he signaled that much work remains, including passing a budget. </p><p>\"We need to take a hard look at all that underbrush in the code,\" to drive business rates lower and preserve immediate expensing for large purchases in a tax overhaul. </p><p>- Colin Wilhelm</p><p>Summit attendees have some advice for Amazon as it considers where to build a second North American headquarters. An overwhelming 75 percent of those who responded to a poll at the Pro Summit say the online retailer should choose a region that needs jobs versus a city that already has strong job growth and a ready high-tech workforce. Sixty percent suggest Amazon choose Detroit or another former big-city industrial powerhouse.</p><p>Attendees, by a large majority, also agreed that the stock market is overvalued. Of those polled, 72 percent said - after being told the S&amp;P 500 has added $2 trillion in value since Trump took office - deemed the market overvalued. Another 20 percent said it's accurately valued, while 7 percent said it's undervalued.</p><p>There was no consensus on where to put priorities for tax reform. Reducing individual tax rates was deemed tops by 31 percent of respondents, 22 percent voted for reducing the corporate tax rate, 20 percent said repatriation of offshore earnings. But many aren't sure at all with 27 percent saying none of the above.</p><p>(Disclaimer: These polls of Pro Summit attendees were not scientific.)</p><p>- Angela Greiling Keane</p><p>Treasury Secretary <person><nameText>Steven Mnuchin </nameText></person>declined to say whether the Trump administration will allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to retain capital rather than transfer it to the Treasury, but he said he has told their regulator he still expects their dividends.</p><p>\"I've been pretty consistent with [Federal Housing Finance Agency head] Mel Watt on - we expect our dividends to be paid,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p>His statement comes on the heels of calls by Senate Democrats and the Republican National Committee to allow the mortgage giants to build cash to prevent another taxpayer bailout.</p><p>Fannie and Freddie, wards of the state since the 2008 housing collapse, currently sweep all their profits into the Treasury's general fund. At the end of this year, they will be devoid of capital, making them more likely to tap a taxpayer lifeline to get through less profitable quarters.</p><p>- Victoria Guida</p><p>The top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee is optimistic about possible bipartisan coordination on tax reform.</p><p>Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.) said he thinks there's \"room there for conversation\" on \"building out\" tax reform around provisions aimed at aiding the middle class. </p><p>\"I think there's some room given that for the moment, just for the moment, that the administration seems to be in sync with the middle-class positions that we would adopt,\" he said.</p><p>Still, Neal said, \"the key is to pay attention to the distribution tables,\" as to who would benefit from tax reform the most. He also raised concerns over the president's rhetoric on the topic. </p><p>\"I think the president from time-to-time has used words interchangeably like 'tax cut' and 'tax reform,'\" Neal said. </p><p>- Colin Wilhelm</p><p>Steve Case warned big tech companies to be \"careful\" about the changing sentiment toward the industry in Washington and encouraged them to look for ways to create opportunity outside of Silicon Valley. </p><p>\"There is this growing sense - and you're starting to hear it more in D.C. - maybe these companies are a little too powerful. Maybe Silicon Valley is a little bit out of touch with the reality out there,\" the venture capitalist and AOL co-founder said. </p><p>Firms like Amazon and Apple should try to \"figure out ways to invest in the middle of the country, support entrepreneurs in the middle of the country and create jobs in the middle of the country,\" he said.</p><p>Read more.</p><p>- Steven Overly</p><p>Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) criticized tech companies for seeking tax breaks from cities in exchange for big investments, taking a direct swipe at Amazon as the e-commerce giant searches for its second headquarters. </p><p>\"I don't think they should be demanding tax breaks up front,\" Khanna said. \"That can lead to a race to the bottom. And it takes advantage of communities that may not have the infrastructure. This is why I think we need a federal policy that will help encourage investment.\"</p><p>Foxconn is seeking $3 billion in tax breaks from Wisconsin in exchange for a manufacturing plant. Apple is planning to build a data center in Iowa, a project that also garnered state tax incentives. </p><p>- Steven Overly</p><p>Attendees at the summit aren't holding their breath for tax reform this year. </p><p>Only 11 percent said they think tax reform will be accomplished by the end of 2017, despite it being the top stated priority of President Trump.</p><p>(Disclaimer: This is certainly not a scientific poll.)</p><p>At the summit, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said Republicans would welcome working with Democrats on areas of common ground on tax reform.</p><p>- Angela Greiling Keane</p><p>The first widespread use of self-driving cars could be shared-mobility fleets, Waymo CEO John Krafcik says.</p><p>\"We have our cars sitting parked idly about 95 percent of the time,\" Krafcik said. \"It's sort of an astonishing level of capital inefficiency. ... Most miles we drive in the U.S. we're driving ourselves. We'd probably rather be doing a lot of other things.\"</p><p>Krafcik says self-driving fleets are more likely to roll out in \"denser\" urban environments where people commute shorter distances due to the concept of power ownership - people who drive longer distances are more likely to prefer to own their own cars. The Waymo CEO cited the example of not enough parking infrastructure around the Santa Monica, Calif., train station as a reason for people using ridesharing fleets.</p><p>- Maya Parthasarathy</p><p>Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said Trump should focus on getting big tech firms like Apple to expand technical jobs rather than manufacturing ones in the U.S.</p><p>Khanna said Apple counts 80,000 employees in the U.S. \"What's more relevant is their 2 million app developers. I want those jobs to be across this country,\" he said. </p><p>- Steven Overly</p><p>Top House tax writer Rep. Kevin Brady says he's \"open\" to the idea of including a dedicated revenue stream for infrastructure as part of a tax reform plan, but that's not the focus of discussions at this point. </p><p>\"Infrastructure's sort of the satellite that continues to circle tax reform,\" Brady told reporters after his appearance at the POLITICO Pro Summit today. \"We'll continue the discussion with the White House and other members that would like to see that as part of it.\"</p><p>However, he made it clear that infrastructure is not top of mind as he crafts tax reform legislation.</p><p>\"Right now we'll focus on getting the details right and the policies right on the tax reform side of it,\" he said. \"At some point [infrastructure] may enter these discussions.\"</p><p>\"We need to be open as the process goes forward,\" he said. \"It's just hard to predict.\"</p><p>- Tanya Snyder</p><p>A domestic content provision in NAFTA that would require a certain percentage of manufactured goods come from within the U.S. - rather than from any North American country - would be \"inconsistent with a trilateral trade agreement,\" Canada's ambassador to the U.S. said.</p><p>Ambassador David MacNaughton added that any tightening of the trade agreements' rules of origin must be done carefully, so as not to restrict trade among the three countries. Rules of origin dictate what percentage of a product be sourced from one of the three NAFTA countries to qualify for reduced tariffs. </p><p>\"What we really want to do is make sure that whatever is being proposed doesn't have unintended consequences that hurt all three of our countries,\" MacNaughton said.</p><p>Geronimo Gutierrez, Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., cautioned that any changes made to the rules must be done in connection with industry. </p><p>Asked whether Mexico would agree to tightening the auto rules of origin from its current 62.5 percent to something like 70 to 75 percent, Gutierrez responded: \"We'll take a look at that ... but we do not want to alter rules of origin in a way that makes more sense to actually end up buying the finished product from other regions, which can very well happen.\"</p><p>\"Then you run the risk of having shot yourself in the foot,\" he said.</p><p>- Megan Cassella</p><p>Trump's use of his presidential bully pulpit - particularly his powerful Twitter feed - to call out individual companies and industries has been effective at home and at the World Trade Organization, Commerce Secretary <person><nameText>Wilbur Ross </nameText></person>said.</p><p>Asked for his take on Trump's unpredictable tendency to go after companies or business leaders from his perch in the West Wing, Ross responded: \"You achieve a lot by doing that.\"</p><p>\"I don't think that some of the trade cases that are going to WTO would have gone nearly as well if people didn't realize that he is somewhat skeptical about WTO,\" Ross said. \"I don't think a lot of the corporate decisions about whether or not to go offshore would have been made the same way without the tweets.\"</p><p>- Megan Cassella</p><p>A renegotiated NAFTA must have \"some form of dispute resolution mechanism\" for Canada to sign onto it, the Canadian ambassador to the U.S. says.</p><p>David MacNaughton said Ottawa is not \"looking to walk away\" from the deal, nor was he trying to make a threat.</p><p>\"We want to see a good improvement to the agreement, not something that sets us back,\" he said.</p><p>When asked if there were any red lines that would force Canada to walk away from the negotiating table, MacNaughton responded: \"The one thing we have said very clearly is that there must be some form of dispute resolution mechanism within the NAFTA agreement.\"</p><p>Mexican Ambassador Ger&amp;oacute;nimo Gutierrez said Mexico City shares the view that \"there needs to be a dispute resolution mechanism.\" </p><p>- Megan Cassella</p><p>The Trump administration's proposal to reshape the income-driven federal student loan repayment system will be beneficial to students in the long term, former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation chair Sheila Bair said today. </p><p>\"I think the concept is right and it builds on the direction that the Obama administration was going,\" Bair said.</p><p>Bair said she expects payments that account for a higher percentage of a student's income over a shorter period of time will save students money by lowering what they'll pay in interest. She said she also supports the administration's proposal to meld five current programs into one. \"They want to simplify, which I think it's good,\" she said. </p><p>- Mel Leonor</p><p>Commerce Secretary <person><nameText>Wilbur Ross </nameText></person>says one metric of success for his tenure would be if Trump gets reelected for a second term.</p><p>He also said that many business leaders he's spoken with applauded the regulatory rollbacks since Trump took office, saying it's felt like a \"gigantic monkey being taken off the backs\" of many companies. </p><p>When pressed about the emerging antitrust questions about tech giants, Ross said that they were \"regular companies and some of them are getting to be quite big regular companies.\" </p><p>He said some of the policies the EU has implemented have been discriminatory against American companies and served protectionist interests. Fining Apple $14.5 billion for back taxes and Google $2.7 billion for antitrust violations are among the actions the European Commission has taken in recent years. </p><p>- Li Zhou</p><p>The president of a group representing for-profit colleges said today that \"pressure from Washington\" may be needed to assist students who have problems transferring course credits between schools.</p><p>Steve Gunderson, president of Career Education Colleges and Universities, pointed to an audit the GAO released this week that found students who transferred schools between 2004 and 2009 lost, on average, 43 percent of the credits they had earned.</p><p>The rate is more pronounced for students who transferred from a for-profit college to a public school. While those students accounted for just 4 percent of all transfers, they lost 94 percent of their credits, on average, the report said. The average credit loss for students who transferred between public schools was 37 percent.</p><p>- Mel Leonor</p><p>Net neutrality legislation is \"not there yet,\" Jessica Ashooh, Reddit's director of policy, said. \"Frankly we're puzzled that there is such a rush to repeal the current rules.\" It's \"premature,\" she said while saying the predictability of legislation would be good if a bill had strong enforcement mechanisms. </p><p>Republicans in the House and Senate sought bipartisan compromise on legislation this year, and House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden initially had sought a Sept. 7 hearing on the topic. After many meetings, his staff did not come up with a draft that ISPs and tech industry officials could agree on. </p><p>AT&amp;T would back legislation that codifies rules banning internet service providers from blocking and throttling websites and retaining a 2015 FCC rule's transparency provisions, Vice President Brent Olson said. </p><p>- John Hendel</p><p>There is \"no indication\" that the White House will intervene in House GOP primaries, said Joe Pileggi, political director of the National Republican Congressional Committee.</p><p>\"Our job is to protect our members in the primary,\" Pileggi said. \"We have a great relationship with the White House.\"</p><p>The president has gone after GOP Senate members - namely Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who he has called weak on crime and the border. </p><p>But Pileggi said the idea of Trump intervening in the House field was \"hypothetical. ... There is no indication that is happening.\"</p><p>Read more.</p><p>- Kelsey Tamborrino</p><p>FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb says the Obama administration's rushed approach to nutrition labeling rules forced him to issue a delay of about 18 months.</p><p>\"I haven't talked about it in public yet ... [but] the agency was not ready to implement that on schedule,\" Gottlieb said, adding that he consulted with career staff before pushing off compliance with the rule. \"We're going to be taking some time to put out some guidance on added sugar\" and other nutritional issues, he said.</p><p>Gottlieb said he understood why the Obama administration was rushing to finalize the rule, given that the issue had been a priority for senior leaders including former First Lady Michelle Obama. \"They're not the first administration to do that ... but it put the agency in a difficult position,\" he said. </p><p>- Dan Diamond</p><p>(This item has been updated to reflect the delay length after the commissioner misspoke during his remarks.)</p><p>Commerce Secretary <person><nameText>Wilbur Ross </nameText></person>confirmed today the Trump administration wants the new NAFTA agreement to include a provision that would automatically terminate the deal after five years, unless the three countries agree to renew it. </p><p>\"The five-year thing is a real thing,\" as opposed to a withdrawal provision in the current NAFTA agreement that is much less likely to be used, Ross said. </p><p>The proposal \"would force a systematic re-examination\" of NAFTA every five years, Ross said. \"Why that's important is the forecasts that have been made at the initiation of NAFTA and of other trade agreements mostly have been wildly optimistic as to the results.\" </p><p>Such a re-evaluation would create an ongoing opportunity to try to fix things that aren't going as well as expected, he said. </p><p>- Megan Cassella and Doug Palmer</p><p>Working with China to stem North Korea's nuclear program doesn't hinder the U.S.'s ability to get tough on Beijing's trade policy, Commerce Secretary <person><nameText>Wilbur Ross </nameText></person>said.</p><p>Ross said resolving the nuclear missile problem is the administration's \"No. 1 priority.\"</p><p>\"The primary responsibility of the president is to protect the American people, so that has to be the sine qua non,\" Ross said. But, he added, there is \"nothing logically inconsistent with that and having a trade policy that's better economically for us.\"</p><p>President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and his administration have been grappling with how to fulfill campaign promises to crack down on China's trade policy while also asking for its help in reigning in North Korea. Trump earlier this month threatened to cut off all trade with any countries doing business with Pyongyang - a move that was aimed almost entirely at Beijing. </p><p>- Megan Cassella</p><p>FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb says his agency is focused on boosting pharmaceutical competition when it comes to the hot-button topic of drug prices.</p><p>\"We think about it from the standpoint of competition, trying to facilitate competition,\" Gottlieb said, noting that the agency is targeting generic drugs as an avenue to address cost and access issues.</p><p>The FDA commissioner added that the agency has long focused on increasing competition - and that this isn't a hallmark of a new administration - but is working to be more transparent about those internal deliberations.</p><p>Gottlieb declined to address how or when the White House would take action on drug prices. Trump campaigned on a pledge to reduce the nation's high drug prices.</p><p>Read more. </p><p>- Dan Diamond</p><p>FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb defended the Trump administration's regulatory approach, saying the agency is taking a principled approach to thinning out unnecessary rules.</p><p>\"I don't think about it as more or less regulation,\" Gottlieb said. \"The way I approach it is ... thinking about what our public health challenges are and how we're going to address them.\"</p><p>Gottlieb said there are some areas where FDA will prioritize new regulations and may seem \"interventionalist,\" like coming up with new rules around opioids and addiction-related treatments or imposing new clinical trial standards to allow drugs to be developed. \"I don't think that means sacrificing on safety and efficacy,\" he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"some regulations are very old,\" Gottlieb said, citing mammography standards that he thinks are outdated. And \"I'm not sure we need a regulation to define how people should be [baking] cherry pie,\" Gottlieb said, referencing one regulation that's still in development and that might not be necessary.</p><p>- Dan Diamond</p><p>The White House's Office of American Innovation has had conversations with tech companies as recently as the last 24 hours, says Matt Lira, a top tech aide to Trump. </p><p>Following a June meeting with companies including Apple, Alphabet and Amazon to discuss the challenge of modernizing federal IT, Lira said more discussions are happening on issues including updated services for veterans and testing platforms. </p><p>\"There are people in the Valley support us, even if it's not the average or the mean,\" Lira said, when pressed on the tension between many members of the tech community and the Trump administration. </p><p>Read more.</p><p>- Li Zhou</p><p>The National Republican Congressional Committee's political director says the key to keeping the majority in the House comes down to two words: Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>\"We know exactly what she'd done and what she will do again if she's speaker again,\" says Joe Pileggi.</p><p>Dan Sena, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee executive director, shot back during the same panel that \"opportunity\" will allow Democrats to regain the chamber.</p><p>\"Sitting members are used to working under a Democratic president,\" he said. \"They are not used to the environment they are in\" and are reverting to \"old tactics\" that \"don't fit under a sitting Republican president.\" </p><p>Sena said there are 60 to 85 races this cycle that are viable for Democrats. </p><p>\"We will spend in any race if the option is viable to take back that House,\" he added. </p><p>- Kelsey Tamborrino</p><p>Rep. Adam Schiff shot down the idea that the House Intelligence Committee would issue an interim report about its probe into Russia's digital meddling in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>\"It will be a challenge enough for us to reach a final report,\" Schiff said, adding he wasn't sure he wants to \"take on the additional obligation.\" </p><p>The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee have met at least once about the idea of providing a public update into their investigation into Moscow's influence effort and plan to discuss it more in the future.</p><p>Schiff declined to say when the House examination, which has at time stalled over partisan bickering, would end.</p><p>Questions, including the roles Facebook and other social media platforms played in spreading Russian misinformation, remain unanswered.</p><p>\"There's a lot that we need to know further from the social media companies,\" Schiff said, adding he wants the firms to testify about fake Russian accounts that were purchased as political ads during the campaign. </p><p>Read more.</p><p>- Martin Matishak</p><p>\"We're in what I would call concern-about-the-debt-free zone,\" former Sen. Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat, said about whether Congress will try to reduce the national debt.</p><p>Panelists weren't optimistic about the prospects for debt reduction in the current tax reform push. House Republican leaders plan to release more details this month.</p><p>\"The dream died when the border-adjustment tax died,\" said James Pethokoukis, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \"I'd almost rather have this whole tax reform debate stop and think hard\" about long-term solutions.</p><p>The national debt surpassed $20 trillion for the first time last week, and Conrad said Social Security could be insolvent by as early as 2029. \"There is a fiscal reality out there that has to be dealt with,\" he said.</p><p>- Eli Okun</p><p>Mike McKenna, president of the lobbying firm MWR Strategies, says the Energy Department should reject a request from Southern Co.'s Georgia Power to increase loan guarantees for the long-delayed and over-budget nuclear reactor project at the Vogtle power station. </p><p>\"There comes a time in every administration when you have to look your friends, and even not your friends, in the eye and say, 'bank's closed,'\" he said.</p><p>Under the Obama administration, DOE approved loan guarantees totaling $8.33 billion for the project's three owners, including $3.4 billion for Southern. The company is awaiting a DOE decision on its request to hike that amount.</p><p>But an official from Exelon Corp, which operates the biggest fleet of nuclear power plants in the U.S., defended its utility peer. </p><p>\"I see Southern as a pretty good risk to invest in, in terms of loan guarantee,\" said David Brown, senior vice president for government affairs for Exelon. </p><p>- Eric Wolff</p><p>Matt Lira, a technology aide to Trump and member of the Office of American Innovation, says government technology systems are \"failing routinely.\"</p><p>\"The systems aren't optimized anywhere near the private sector,\" he said. \"It's a true crisis in the federal government.\" </p><p>Lira said the initial collapse of Healthcare.gov during the Obama administration was not an \"outlier\" among government projects in the problems it faced. </p><p>- Li Zhou</p><p>The nation's top health insurance lobbyist says dramatic drug price increases are harming public health goals and applauds new legislation intended to tamp down rapid hikes.</p><p>\"We all sit here and say we want to cover more people, [but we] can't do that if we don't deal with the underlying cost problem,\" said Marilyn Tavenner, the head of America's Health Insurance Plans. She pointed to significant drug price increases as a stress for insurers. \"We can't tolerate that.\" </p><p>- Dan Diamond</p><p>Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas), the appropriator who oversees NASA funding, says he'd like the space budget increase to 2 or 3 percent of gross domestic product - a huge increase from the .5 percent being spent now. Back in the Apollo mission NASA heyday, the U.S. was spending 4 percent of GDP on space exploration, he said.</p><p>The congressman predicts it'll take a large discovery to \"electrify\" the public to support increased spending on space and NASA. He crystal balls that the big discovery will be of life on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. This discovery is so important that he actually legally required NASA to complete the mission to Europa in the space appropriations bill being considered on the House floor today. </p><p>- Jacqueline Klimas</p><p>Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides envisions eventually sending millions of private citizens into space. To allow that to happen, the head of one of the top private space companies urged policymakers not to overregulate the commercial space sector, saying that a lot of today's policies are working well and allowing companies to innovate. </p><p>\"We don't want to screw it up by over regulating,\" Whitesides said. \"There's some really enlightened policy right now as it pertains to human space flight and I think we need to maintain that regulatory framework.\"</p><p>Virgin Galactic is planning to send paying tourists into space as soon as next year. Whitesides gives full support to NASA, but says it's up to private companies to offer the masses the opportunity to get to space, albeit at a steep price.</p><p>\"NASA's job has not been to open up space for the rest of us, it's been to explore,\" he said.</p><p>- Jacqueline Klimas</p><p>The single best move the Trump administration could do for Obamacare is to stop undermining the law, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee, said.</p><p>\"I really think we're at a crucial moment now where the sabotage has to end,\" Pallone urged. \"I'm not even asking the president to support any particular legislation. I just want the administration to stop the sabotage.\"</p><p>- Dan Diamond</p><p>It might take President <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>intervention to spur the Senate HELP Committee to craft a package of reforms to stabilize Obamacare's fragile markets, panelists discussing health care reform said.</p><p>\"I think we have a good chance of passing a bipartisan bill in both [chambers],\" said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), listing off provisions like funding for Obamacare's cost-sharing reductions and spending on ads and outreach, which HHS recently cut back. \"Most Americans want us to improve the Affordable Care Act, and most members of Congress do as well.\"</p><p>Former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, who expanded Medicaid in his state, countered: \"I don't think the leadership of the House or the Senate will make this happen. They need to head to the White House\" and get Trump involved.</p><p>- Dan Diamond</p><p>The summit kicks off with the issue that never dies: What will Congress do about health care? That's especially timely this week, with Senate Democrats and Republicans pulled between three different efforts - whether to tear down Obamacare, stabilize it or replace it with Medicare-for-all.</p><p> What to watch on the health care panel at the first plenary session: How Marilyn Tavenner - the head of America's Health Insurance Plans and the nation's top health insurance lobbyist - addresses the bipartisan Senate effort to patch Obamacare's troubled insurance markets, and if Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) thinks any legislation to repair the ACA has a chance in the House. Meanwhile, Tevi Troy, a conservative policy analyst and former top HHS official, and ex-Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear may have on-the-ground insights into Republican efforts to roll back the health law.</p><p>The commercial space realm is an emerging - and largely unregulated - policy area that the second plenary will explore. Key questions policymakers are wrestling with include how much the government should regulate space and how traditional defense contractors can work with entrepreneurial commercial companies to make the space program stronger through more competition. </p><p>What to watch on the space panel: What Rep. John Culberson, a top appropriator for space matters, and George Whitesides, the CEO of Virgin Galactic, say about where there can be greater cooperation between traditional contractors and new companies, what the government can do to facilitate commercial access to space and what their hopes are for the administration's stated focus on space. </p><p>House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff - the leader of the lower chamber's high-profile investigation into Russia's meddling during last year's election - sits down for the third plenary amid escalating concerns about the role Facebook's platform played in helping the undermine the presidential race. The social media giant recently revealed that Russian fronts purchased geographically-targeted ads during the campaign, and it was later reported that Russian operatives used Facebook pages to promote anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rallies in the U.S.</p><p>What to watch on the cybersecurity panel: Schiff's rundown about whether the committee wants to bring Facebook officials to Capitol Hill for a briefing and what questions he thinks the Silicon Valley stalwart needs to answer. And listen to Crowdstrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch, who had a front row seat to last year's election hacks after his firm was called in to eradicate the alleged Russian hackers from the Democratic National Committee's networks, detail what those groups are up to now and what they might try to do in the 2018 election.</p><p>FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is on the hook to talk about how his regulatory philosophy - at an agency whose primary purpose is to regulate the safety of food, drugs, cosmetics and tobacco - fits in with the broader Trump administration deregulatory agenda. </p><p>What to watch on the FDA panel: Gottlieb will be pressed on what areas of regulation he thinks the FDA can back down on or revise and what regulations need to stay or be added to protect the public health. How does he determine when the government should intervene and when it needs to back off? Expect him to face questions on hot topics like menu labeling and regulation of e-cigarettes, as well as drug pricing and the obesity and opioid epidemics. </p><p>Commerce Secretary <person><nameText>Wilbur Ross's </nameText></person>interview with POLITICO co-founder John Harris comes as the administration is working through a renegotiation of NAFTA, which it's hoping to finish by the end of the year. Trump has recently revived threats to withdraw from the deal if Canada and Mexico refuse to agree to the changes he wants - something Ross has backed him up on even as most members of the Republican party and broad swaths of U.S. industry warn that doing so would bring more harm than good.</p><p>What to watch in the Ross interview: In addition to NAFTA, Ross' department is weighing whether to limit imports of steel and aluminum for national security reasons. The timing of those reports - as well as what they will say - remains unclear.</p><p>House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady hopes to shepherd a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code through his committee and the House of Representatives. Ranking Member Richard Neal has told Republicans he'd like to work together on tax reform, in the spirit of the bipartisan tax reform of 1986, but that current Republican proposals don't encourage him or his fellow Democrats. Republicans remain eager for details about a plan, but the chairman, congressional leadership and the White House remain tight-lipped for fear that outside interest groups could tee off on any items that would end or alter deductions they favor.</p><p>What to watch for on the tax panel: On Wednesday Brady promised more details for a unified framework between the House, Senate, and White House would be released the week of Sept. 25. Brady may reveal more of the direction that Republicans plan to go on tax reform, while Neal may signal some potential common ground between the parties on taxes. </p><p>Foxconn is building a multibillion-dollar plant in Wisconsin. Apple is slated to open a data center in Iowa. And Amazon insists any city could be home to its second headquarters. As big tech pushes deeper into the American heartland - at a time when Trump wants to add jobs there - it begs the question of how state and local governments should prepare for their arrival.</p><p>What to watch for on the Jobs in Small-Town America plenary: \"Rise of the Rest\" advocate Steve Case will join CaliforniaDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna, both of whom can be expected to tout Middle America as fertile ground for Silicon Valley-style entrepreneurship. Meanwhile, Dayton, Ohio Mayor Nan Whaley and Chauncy Lennon, the head of workforce initiatives for JP Morgan Chase's Global Philanthropy, can address the challenges of bracing people for the changes that would bring.</p><p>Driverless cars are all but commonplace to see in the Silicon Valley - but before they become available to the public, there are plenty of concerns policymakers will need to address. Among those are safety guidance from the Transportation Department, whether driverless trucks will hurt jobs in the future and what kinds of opportunities self-driving cars will provide to both the private and public sectors.</p><p>What to watch for the interview with self-driving car company Waymo's CEO John Krafcik: What's the latest from the skunkworks on the technology behind the cars and how might the growing ubiquity of autonomous vehicles change our society, economy and public policy?</p><p>Treasury Secretary <person><nameText>Steven Mnuchin </nameText></person>is in the middle of tax reform negotiations, and there's plenty of interest in details he could divulge. Questions continue to swirl around how low Trump administration officials like him and congressional Republicans can drive down tax rates, among other changes they're considering. </p><p>What to watch for from Mnuchin: Reducing tax rates is expensive, as are other ideas in play, like letting businesses immediately write off the cost of their new investments. That means potential trade-offs - including getting rid of the deduction businesses get for interest on their loans - will prove increasingly contentious as their defenders fight to keep them on the books. Look for Mnuchin to illuminate how the administration plans to navigate this process.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-242734</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PGJ-9CX1-F118-91PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6099\"/><timeReceived>8:51 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 14, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

And the companies would have to make the shows available to third-party devices.<br/><br/> The cable industry\u2019s supporters are opposed to this move, lashing out at what they view as government overreach and a threat to consumers. Many of them joined a new group that launched Wednesday called the Future of TV coalition.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NAPDNW-N0007933632</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NAPDNW2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HYG-RKH1-JCW9-X1PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"312\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Collier County Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Naples Daily News (Florida)</publicationName><edition>Naples Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 28, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTZBMDc1MUI2MjU2NDQxOTg5M0M1Q0I0MEUxNzE1Mzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTZGRjRGMTBDNjBFNDQ3NDk4Qjc1MUMwRTRDNDMyNjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RE3</classCode><className>CABLE SYSTEM REGULATION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTZGRjRGMTBDNjBFNDQ3NDk4Qjc1MUMwRTRDNDMyNjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzNFQTlENUZGNUIyNEUyMzhEOEZFNUEzNzYzNEE4Qzg</classCode><className>Cable Systems</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N926130QJ</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Federal Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0008WWI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;
