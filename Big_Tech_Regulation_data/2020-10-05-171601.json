CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg have been focused on ...</p><p>Under pressure from large corporations and government antitrust regulators, Facebook has been highlighting the fact that the majority of its ad revenue does not come from the biggest brands. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg have been focused on small business tools as the Covid-19 crisis threatens the survival of many Main Street shops and entrepreneurs. Business closures from mid-July to the end of August rose by 23%, according to Yelp data, and since March, 60% of business closures have been permanent.  Facebook is increasing its focus on the small business community, launching a new interface called \"Business Suite\" on Thursday which is targeted at small businesses that have struggled throughout the Covid-19 pandemic .   The platform is available exclusively to small businesses at launch, according to a release from the social media and advertising giant, but it will expand offerings to larger businesses next year.   \"This is a long-term investment to make this the main interface for businesses of all sizes who use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp,\" said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in a statement announcing the new platform.    The focus on the small business community comes as Facebook has faced a number of challenges. On Tuesday, a group of celebrities including Kim Kardashian West, Katy Perry, Michael B. Jordan and Ashton Kutcher, participated in a 24-hour Instagram \"freeze\" as part of the Stop Hate For Profit movement to protest what the organization calls \"Facebook's repeated failures to address hate speech and election disinformation on their platforms.\"   During the summer, many prominent corporate brands took a break from Facebook ads to highlight their concerns over the same issues.   Facebook CFO David Wehner noted in its Q2 earnings discussion that the top 100 advertisers represented 16% of Facebook ad revenue, which was a lower percentage than a year ago.   This year, the company has deployed information centers as a tactic to combat the spread of misinformation on Facebook and Instagram. The company launched a  Covid hub  in March, and in August, Facebook rolled out a  voter information center .   Facebook also is among the big tech firms under pressure from the federal government and facing potential antitrust action.   At a virtual CNBC event last month, Sandberg said the social media company needs to work with whoever wins the 2020 U.S. election to address their concerns about dominant technology companies.   \"We know that there's real concern about the size and the  power of the American tech companies , both here in our country and around the world,\" said Sandberg, speaking at the  CNBC Small BusinessPlaybook virtual summit . \"It's our job to work with anyone who's in office, whether they're in the Senate or anywhere around the world, to address those concerns.\"   In the wake of ongoing social unrest throughout the U.S., Facebook  recently announced that it's dedicating $40 million from its $100 million small business grant program to 10,000 Black-owned businesses in the U.S. Those grants include $2,500 in cash and a $1,500 Facebook ad credit. Facebook is also updating its Businesses Nearby platform, announced in May, to surface Black-owned businesses within the tool so people can discover them more easily.   Despite the ongoing fallout that surrounds Facebook, engagement and reach are critical to small business owners. The pandemic has caused dramatic economic upheaval,  putting millions of Americans out of work  as governments ordered nonessential businesses to temporarily shutter in order to help slow the spread of Covid-19. For many small businesses, the closures may end up  being permanent .    About 60% of over 163,000 total business closures reported on  Yelp  since March were permanent, according to data from the reviews platform available.   There are several small businesses that have already put the new Facebook product to use.   \"Facebook Business Suite makes it faster and easier to analyze post results from both Facebook and Instagram all in one glance,\" said Amanda Stefl, owner and operator of Timber Hill Winery in Milton, Wisconsin. \"The inbox feature organizes messages and comments nicely, making it effortless to reply to customers, which will increase our engagement and reach on both platforms.\"   Facebook also rolled out a series of 30 online video classes for entrepreneurs during the summer, covering topics like marketing, online branding and finding customers, and which Sandberg, speaking at the recent CNBC virtual event, said had been watched by 15 million people.    According to a recent Facebook report , published in partnership with Deloitte, nearly half of small business owners surveyed who advertise on Facebook said they have spent more money online overall since the outbreak. Additionally, 40% of small business owners have increased their use of social media and online messaging for product and business recommendations.   Many small business owners are behind in creating their online presence. In the United States pre-Covid, one in three companies still did not have a website, according to Facebook. But those online are growing digital sales. Earlier this year, in partnership with the World Bank and OECD, Facebook published its first Global State of Small Business report, surveying more than 30,000 small business leaders across more than 50 countries. In the majority of countries, at least one-third of SMBs reported earning a minimum of 25% of their sales from digital channels in the previous 30 days.   \"180 million businesses use our family of apps every month,\" said Rich Rao, Facebook's vice president of small business, adding that nine million of those businesses advertise with the company every month. \"Our vision is to have a single place for those people to manage their business.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43096581555</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VS-6981-JCSC-J07G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1020\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 17, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In fact, venture capital investments in Israeli tech companies, including in early-stage start-ups, were strong in 2015.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to a new report by Israel Venture Capital (IVC) and law firm APM and Co., over 300 start-ups in 2015 got first-time funding from the country's most active venture capital funds \u2013 with Singulariteam, founded by Moshe Hogeg and Kenges Rakishev, leading the pack.</p><p>Hogeg, known for his affinity for investing in early-stage start-ups \u2014 including offbeat ones like the Yo! App, which does nothing but send a \"Yo!\" message to contacts \u2013 invested in 12 start-ups with his partner in 2015. Among them: E-gift card redemption and sales platform Kukupal, BidFlyer, which provides an online space for airlines to sell off their hard-to-sell seats on flights via a bidding process, and web design portal Webydo.</p><p>Placing second, with nine first investments each, were Israeli fund Carmel Ventures and American fund Innovation Endeavors, co-founded by Google's Chairman, Eric Schmidt, and Dror Berman.</p><p>Among Carmel's investments: CrediFi, the first big data firm to analyze hard data about the commercial real estate market, and CellWize, which develops self-organizing networks for mobile operators. Innovation Endeavors, meanwhile, invested in CropX, which uses smart sensors and smartphone apps to save water in standard irrigation systems for farmers, and Illusive Networks, a cyber-security firm that provides phony data for hackers to \"play around\" with, keeping the \"real\" data on a server safe.</p><p>Third place is also shared by two funds, Israeli Magma and First Time, with eight investments each. Magma, with $450 million under management, invested from its fourth fund, raised in 2014. First Time is a vintage 2014 fund, managing $60 million and managed by TheTime technological incubator's founders, focused mainly on supporting the incubator's graduates with supplemental funding.</p><p>The biggest VC, however, invested in Israeli start-ups is Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP), which, according to IVC, has invested some $1.2 billion in Israeli tech firms over the past decade. JVP made seven first-time investments last year \u2013 among them ScadaFence, which develops cyber-security solutions for the critical infrastructure and manufacturing industries, Iguaz.io, a big data management and storage firm, and Secret Double Octopus, which encrypts and unencrypts data sent over networks without requiring encryption keys.</p><p>Among the investment trends last year, said IVC, was a decrease in the total number of first investments, as well as the total number of active VC funds in 2015, compared to 2014's record numbers. The downtrend is a direct result of foreign funds' relative lowered activity in 2015, following a similar global trend, while Israeli funds actually increased their activity in 2015, both in the number of funds and number of deals made.</p><p>With that, foreign funds led the way for venture capital investment. Foreign funds made 178 first investments (52% of total invested in those firms) last year, compared to 221 investments (58%) in 2014, the report showed. Israeli VC funds made 166 investments, compared to 157 in 2014, with the Israeli funds' investment share climbing from 42 percent to 48 percent in 2015.</p><p>Venture capital, along with private equity investments, have become the vehicle of choice for investors seeking to make money in the tech business, according to Jon Medved, CEO of crowdfunding investors OurCrowd, which made 10 first-time investments in Israeli tech firms last year \u2013 making it the most active micro-capital venture fund (a million dollars or less per investment) for the year.</p><p>Almost all the returns for big tech companies that went public after 2000 \u2013 including Google (2004), Facebook (2012) and Twitter (2013) \u2013 have accrued to VC or private equity investors.</p><p>\"IPOs are messy, because you have to comply with a lot of regulations and issue public reports and the like,\" said Medved. \"If you can raise $60 billion without going public \u2013 that's the current valuation of Uber \u2013 then why would you want to go public?\"</p><p>Koby Simana, CEO of IVC Research Center, observed another difference between Israeli and foreign VCs: \"Our analysis of the data shows a significant difference in first investment patterns between foreign and Israeli funds. Traditionally, more than 80 percent of first investments by Israeli funds are made in the early stages of a company's life \u2014 start-up seed and R&amp;D \u2014 while foreign funds activity is a little more evenly balanced between various stages, from seed and growth to late stages,\" he added.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/46/145518678142.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/46/145518678142.jpg</url></p><p>JVP partners Kobi Rozengarten, Gadi Tirosh and Raffi Kesten (Courtesy)<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TIMISR-66235199</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TIMISR2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J2G-SJN1-F11P-X2HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428572</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Times of Israel.

This meeting will be conducted in Dutch. For those of you who wish to choose the English translation, translation is available.</p><p>[Interpreted]</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome to this Annual General Meeting at ASML. We are at the beginning of a general meeting under special circumstance, following the outbreak of the coronavirus. And it goes without that for ASML, the health of its employees, shareholders and stakeholders is a top priority. That is why we've been forced to take these additional measures around this meeting as announced on our website. The general meeting, therefore, is not being held in the auditorium as per usual, but we've moved to the plaza on our campus.</p><p>In light of the coronavirus outbreak, this year, we've enabled shareholders to virtually participate and to cast their votes. A special welcome to you all who are virtually participating in this fashion. With respect to the developments regarding the coronavirus, we have taken consequences for the presence of our Board members as well.</p><p>In order to minimize the risks for all present, it was decided to minimize the number of members of the Board of management as well as the Supervisory Board present at this meeting in person. The Board members who are not present are attending remotely. And that is why I'd like to introduce ASML's President and CEO, Mr. Peter Wennink, who is sitting here next to me at the correct distance. And in addition, I'd like to introduce Mr. Reinier Kleipool, Deputy Civil Law Notary at De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek, who will act as secretary of the meeting. Mr. van Delden, I'd like to introduce him as well, present on behalf of KPMG accountants, our external accountant. He will only be able to answer questions regarding the auditor's report on ASML's 2019 financial statements.</p><p>Now despite the fact that they are not present in person, I would like to extend a welcome to the other members of the Board. Mr. Van den Brink, Dassen from Hout, Schneider-Maunoury and Fouquet. The same applies to the other members of the Supervisory Board, Mrs. Aris, Smits-Nusteling and Kelly, as well as gentlemen, Grose, Stork, Schwalb and Ziebart. I would also like to extend a special welcome to Misters Duncan and East. Their appointment as a member of Supervisory Board is on the agenda today.</p><p>This year, there are 2 possibilities to ask questions. Before the meeting, shareholders were granted the option of submitting questions in writing. Furthermore, they can see the Q&amp;A on our website in this respect and these questions will be addressed in the relevant agenda items. Then shareholders have the opportunity to not only virtually participate, but also to submit questions during the meeting via the chat function. For clarification, this only concerns asking further questions about the answers we've given in writing to the questions previously received.</p><p>Now for each agenda item, I will deal with the questions that were asked prior to the meeting. Questions that are being submitted during the meeting will be dealt with when discussing the relevant agenda item as much as possible. If you still have a question about an agenda item that has already been dealt with, you can still submit that question. It will be under agenda Item 13, any other business.</p><p>Now if multiple questions are received, though, on the same subject, they will be clustered and answered in one go. In this way, the dialogue is optimized under special circumstances. Microphones are available for those present in the room. I'd like to ask you to state your question as clearly and as briefly as possible and to introduce yourself by name.</p><p>Now I will be able to limit speaking time and/or the number of questions accordingly.</p><p>The registration details, by the way, for this meeting are currently being processed. Once all data has been processed, Mr. Kleipool will announce how many people are present as shareholders or proxy holders. This means, both the shareholders and proxies in the room as well as remotely. It will also be announced how many votes can be cast. Then Mr. Kleipool will explain the voting procedure, after which the possibility of casting votes will be opened.</p><p>This general meeting has been convened in accordance with ASML's articles of association, the legal requirements. Shareholders participating via the virtual voting platform are able to vote remotely in real-time if they are logged in online via the voting platform. The shareholders present in the room vote via their own smartphone or tablet or via the device issued at the registration desk.</p><p>Now all votes may be cast during the entire meeting. At the end of the meeting, before any other business, the vote will be closed for all voting items. The voting results on all voting items will then be announced after the any other business agenda item. As usual, an audiotape will be made of the meeting for the preparation of the minutes.</p><p>I will now move on to Agenda Item 2. This is an overview of recent events and the state of affairs financially at -- and socially responsible entrepreneurship by Mr. Wennink.</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK, CHAIRMAN OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, ASML HOLDING N.V.: Thank you, Gerard. I would like to start with a presentation on the financial year 2019, and I'd like to refer to the safe harbor statement, which is posted on our website.</p><p>The financials now. 2019. When we speak about 2019, the financial year, it seems ages ago with all the turbulent times that we're living in now. Nonetheless, it is a subject of today's meeting. So I'd like to concentrate on it for a moment. If we look at 2019, we see that our industry in 2019 experienced a year that can be characterized as a year of very limited growth, actually shrink because the Memory industry in 2019 after several years of growth '16, '17 and '18 started to consolidate in 2019. So the industry in 2019, was declining. But at ASML, we were able to show an 8% growth. And this really has to do with an extraordinary position because customers were very much focused on investing in future technology, particularly in EUV. And our net sales grew to a record of EUR 11.8 billion at 44% gross margin. This led to a net income of EUR 2.6 billion, which led to EUR 6.16 earnings per share. EUR 2.6 billion equals the net income in 2018. As I said, EUV, extreme ultraviolet, EUV lithography, very important for us in 2019 and will become increasingly important over the next few years. We shipped 26 systems, 9 systems of the C model, which is the model that we are selling now exclusively with better capacity and a better throughput, productivity, if you will. And it's particularly EUV focused on the market for Logic, logical chips and we see a first use in the market for memory chips. But particularly in the Logic market, we see that there's a great demand for EUV.</p><p>So in terms of EUV, we've got to be careful. The next-generation EUV, which is High-NA, High-NA equipment, and we're working full force on the preparation thereof with ASML, but also suppliers ZEISS. And this -- after 2025, in this decade, it will be an important way to make advanced, sophisticated chips. DUV, our bread and butter remained because in part of the demand for advanced EUV that you cannot exclusively use for these chips, you also need DUV remained very healthy despite the fact that the memory market, as I said, in 2019 could be characterized as outright weak. Our Application business, which is the business that makes sure that the DUV systems process technology of our clients have better performance. In this business line, we saw 50% growth of our YieldStar systems. And once again, driven by leading-edge logic. So these are the most advanced and sophisticated chips.</p><p>As far as capital return is concerned, EUR 1.7 billion has been returned to dividend -- to shareholders, excuse me, and most of the money was returned by means of dividend payments, full dividend for 2018 was paid out in 2019. And the first interim dividend was also paid out at year-end 2019.</p><p>I can't really reflect on 2019 without briefly commenting on the current situation, the first quarter, we reported on that last week. Net sales of EUR 2.4 billion, EUR 1.6 billion in system sales, installed base management sales, these are services and upgrades of EUR 850 million -- EUR 857 million. So this amount of $2.4 million was lower than we had envisaged earlier in this quarter, and this had to do with the fact that the number of shipments. The number of shipments either had to be postponed to the second quarter or were we also affected by the COVID-19 virus and sales will be accounted for in the second quarter. So it's not a loss of sales, it's a shift, if you will. And the fact that our customers are positive, in terms of their businesses and their outlook, their capacity, that is reflected in the number of orders, EUR 1.3 billion, half of which are EUV systems. These net bookings are very important. And of course, in this situation, we have to reflect on the COVID-19 outbreak, the crisis that so far has had a bit of an impact on our manufacturing capability, but it's been limited and that had to do with the fact that across the world, there were lockdown situations and obviously, a number of our suppliers were affected. And so deliveries of parts were delayed, postponed and one of the reason -- that was also one of the reasons that we conducted our shipments somewhat later. But also in our systems, in our plant were adjusted. We found alternatives, and albeit with some delay of a couple of weeks in some cases, we were able to continue our production, our manufacturing capability. But there still is a strong demand from our customers. Our customers have not canceled any orders or delayed them for this year. So the outlook for this year, for the moment, is unchanged, is good. But obviously, we cannot turn our backs on what is going on.</p><p>We see a decline of macroeconomic growth. And these percentages have declined because we're talking about decline percentages, they vary somewhat, but double-digit decline is what people are talking about. So that's quite substantial. So it is to be expected that, that will affect consumer spending and particularly, consumer electronics. That will also be affected. This is something that we may not be seeing right now. But in the future, it may well be the case, but we cannot estimate how big the effect will be. But there are positive signs. We live in a digital world more than ever and this digital infrastructure is part of our lives, it's not going to disappear and in many cases, and many of us have experienced this personally or the office, that the infrastructure doesn't always comply with the standards and our criteria. So we'd see an enormous increase of data traffic that needs to go through the data centers. Data centers need sophisticated chips, memory chips, logic chip and you see this also in the demand for PCs, which is indeed growing. So -- and this also has to do with the fact that people are working from home and children are being -- are following their schooling at home. But all in all, it's incredibly difficult to estimate what the effect will be of this COVID-19 crisis, the effect on our business and all the business of our customers and so, therefore, on our business. So there's so many uncertainties. And given those uncertainties, we cannot give guidance for sales in this quarter and especially not for the full year 2020.</p><p>So let's go back to 2019, as I said, an increase of net sales, 3.9 -- as you can see on Slide 7, the blue bit, the blue bit of the last bar, you see that particularly, the logic chip market is much bigger than in 2019, twice as big. Because in 2018, we depended on a strong memory market. And if we look at Slide 8 and then if we look where those systems went, you can see this because if we look at the left-hand side of the slide, we see. But in terms of technology, EUV in its share in overall sales system sales, increased from 23% to 31% and this is a trend that we will see continuing this next year.</p><p>EUV as a percentage of sales will only increase. And as far as end-use is concerned, I said earlier on 2018, most of the sales went to memory customers in 2019, we see that almost 75% of sales was accounted for by logical chips, chips that we call high-power compute. That is where we really need the arithmetic power, data centers, artificial intelligence, we saw an enormous increase of demand there. And where are these logical chip makers in Taiwan, particularly U.S. and also, in part, in Korea, and if we then compare that to 2018, we see that Korea became much more important in our sales and that had to do with the fact that Korea has most, by far, most of the memory chip manufacturers and in 2018, that market was very good -- was good in 2019. In China, there may be questions. Decline from 19% to 12%. So we need to take into account here, that in China, the Chinese customers -- it is to Chinese customers, but also foreign companies that have operations in China, and particularly foreign companies in China focus very much on the memory market. I'm not saying well, as I said, the memory Market declined, but also sales to China. Foreign companies in China declined, whereas the Chinese companies themselves remained pretty strong.</p><p>If we then look at Slide 9. This is an overview of the last 5 years, overview of sales, net profit. Last 5 years, sales almost doubled. The same applies to R&amp;D costs. You see almost -- a bit more than EUR 1 billion in 2015, almost EUR 2 billion in 2019. R&amp;D costs, the general costs have not doubled, they increased by about 50%, and you might well say, well, then your operational profit should increase, which is not the case and this has to do with our gross profit margin is lagging behind somewhat. And this has got to do with the fact that our EUV sales, it is increasing, but we are still not at the desired profit level and this takes a couple of years. We've said it before in order to achieve the same gross profit margins as in DPV. All in all, a healthy financial performance.</p><p>If we now proceed to Slide 10, this is the cash flow statement. Cash flow or the cash generated by operational activities 2019 between EUR 3.3 billion and we've returned to shareholders, we've talked about that already, 1.1 -- between 1.1, 1.2 in terms of investment activities were conducted. And in the past, in 2016, for instance, we had acquisitions 2019 who were mainly investments in fixed assets, and we need to keep in mind that these are -- this is money that we paid to our partner ZEISS for the H&amp;E program. And at the year-end, EUR 4.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. So that is a healthy situation with respect to cash and cash equivalents. In the current situation, with more uncertainty, this is a comfortable position.</p><p>If we then look at the balance sheet, you can see that the company's solvency is good, in excess of 50%. And the company also has strong liquidity, not only in cash and cash equivalents, but also, the short-term invested capital. We've also got short-term liabilities. You see that the situation is very healthy. In other words, we're financially strong and robust company.</p><p>Slide 12, an overview of the capital returns to shareholder -- shareholders, as I said, EUR 1.7 billion in total, EUR 1.3 billion thereof was paid out in the form of dividend, the dividend 2018 and interim dividend 2019. And we also purchased shares worth EUR 410 million. The overall dividend 2019 is proposed at $2.40 per ordinary share. Interim dividend of EUR 1.05 cents per ordinary share in November 2019 and the final dividend payment of EUR 1.35, per ordinary share is proposed for 2020. And our 3-year share buyback program for 2020, 2022 up to EUR 6 billion in the first quarter, about EUR 500 million was bought back In the first quarter, when it became clear that it was going to be difficult to make an estimate of the impact of the corona crisis, we discontinued this and we decided for the second quarter also given the uncertainties not to conduct any further share buybacks until we have more clarity. And we hope to have more clarity in about 3 months' time. So the 3-year program remains in place.</p><p>And now I'd like to briefly reflect on the people and the world around us and obviously also reflect on the current crisis, employees and in current crisis, our main concern and our main responsibility are our employees, 25,000, approximately, 25,000 FTE's, 107 nationalities, a very diverse company and also in Veldhoven, over almost 100 or more than 100 nationalities, 55% of the 24,900 people work in Europe and the other 45% distributed equally across Asia and the United States and the growth in Asia is slightly higher than in the U.S. In both continents, we see considerable growth in the number of employees. And this, again, is a reflection of the company's growth.</p><p>This then takes us to where we stand, COVID-19, the corona crisis. What are we dealing with? This is not what we would call a single event, a one-off. Every day, every week, we are dealing with the impact of this crisis, whether it's the impact from government measures or supply chain. Customers are not really feeling anything, but also our plants, the number of people that can go to work, the guidelines of the WHO, there are several things, several events, as we call them, several things that we need to follow on a day-to-day basis. And this is something that is affecting all of us across the world, whether it be suppliers, our own people, our own employees, the operations of our customers. This is a pandemic and so it affects each and every one of us without exception. And so it's affecting all our stakeholders. As we said earlier on, this is impacting on our customers, our suppliers, our shareholders our employees and society at large. And let's not forget about that. And everything is sort of covered by uncertainty. We don't know how long this is going to take. We don't know when we will be in a situation in which we can actually proceed to a new normal. We are preparing for such a situation, a situation in which we will transition from a situation of extreme risk to high-risk to average risk. But the timeline is unknown. If we then look at how the crisis developed, it's clear that the first signs arose in China, Asia, China that impacted on us in the first quarter. Shipments of products of our clients in China, particularly Wuhan, could not take place and we see that the crisis is now sort of softening, but it's not in control. It can reemerge again. So there are strict measures, China and other countries have not opened up, so to speak, and since March. We've seen how we've been impacted in Europe and the U.S. by the crisis. But then, later on, we see a slight decline. You could venture to say that we've already passed the peak, but it may be early days yet to be able to optimistic. And indeed, there's a reason for these governments to announce strict measures, which has an impact on industry, on businesses, people working in businesses. So that's why it's so difficult to estimate the impact of all of that.</p><p>What are we doing? Well, we have rolled out a package of crisis measures, and we did that about 2 months ago, perhaps a bit longer and it, first of all, focuses on the safety of our employees. And we then have 2 main subjects. First of all, business-critical projects. What are the things that we really need to do? And what kind of process improvements can we implement? Let me explain briefly. Business-critical projects, our technology, our technology road map. Implementation of our technology program is crucial. People who have been following ASML for a longer time will know that we always continue to invest. Despite crisis, this company has always emerged stronger from crises and the crisis will end someday and then we expect that the demand for sophisticated chips, that will have to strengthen digital infrastructure, new economic models, models of cooperation will be fostered and enhanced by electronic innovations. And we will have to be ready for that, along with our customers, securing the road map, making sure that the implementation of our projects, our programs are not delayed in critical terms. Second, our customers. As I said, there is demand from the customers. At this point in time, we're not completely capable also because of delays and the impact of the COVID-19. We're not completely capable of fulfilling the demand in the first quarter. Also, a number of shipments had to be delayed and took place in the second quarter and perhaps, some shipments from the second quarter will be moved forward to the third quarter. So customers, very important. We need to continue to service those customers. We need to focus on the supply chain. We need to focus on the manufacturing plants and then we've got to make the product, ship the product and service the product mix. That's how we make the money. And as I said, the business looks relatively healthy, and I absolutely expect that over the next quarters, our industry, the customers of our customers and our own customers will be affected somehow. We don't know entirely how, but it's all about the customers because the customers at the end of the day, pay the invoice, pay the bill.</p><p>And then what you do, last but not least, in a situation of great uncertainty? You keep an eye on your cost, discretionary spending, only spending money. If it's absolutely necessary investing in fixed assets, things that are really necessary, particularly focusing on manufacturing and rolling out new technology and cash. Cash is king and in every crisis, ASML has always had a healthy cash balance, and that is going to help us in this case.</p><p>Last point, process improvements, we've got improved processes. Excluding our people in the plants, 90% to 95% of our employees are working from home. So you should never waste a good crisis. You need to improve those processes that we've been needing to improve for a long time. So we're going to concentrate on that as well. Now a brief explanation as to why it is so important that we continue to focus and work on the technology road map. High-NA, why is that so important? I spoke about the second half of this decade. Well, the development times are very long and in High-NA machine, this technology is the certainty our customers get to be able to continue their own road map, making processes more simple. It leads to cost reduction. It -- and the quality of chips, high-power computers, that is what we see. So there's an absolute necessity to continue to invest and you see this in the fixed assets as well. So wherever it's necessary to strengthen our production process at ASML and it -- and to support that by means of better manufacturing facilities. If that is the case, we will conduct investments. And this applies to 2020, but also 2021. And one of the most important stakeholders here for our company is society. What have we been able to do for our communities in this crisis? We've tried to lend a helping hand as much as possible. Whether it be the medical-grade cleanroom gloves that we donated, the tablets, the PCs for children in underprivileged situations that had to do their homework online, online schooling, hundred thousands of face masks that we donated to the hospitals. So not only that, our expertise is being required.</p><p>We're being asked to use our expertise to find Technical solutions, simple things. If you look at, for instance, at Slide 21, what is that airplane doing there? We have extraordinary expertise in the field of logistics. We have operations across the world. And as you know, many medical suppliers come from China, Asia, our procurement, our logistic capacity. To be able to procure to buy those products and to transport them with the capacity that we have. That contributes to bringing to Europe and to the U.S., this medical equipment, but also setting up production line for face masks.</p><p>I think that concludes my presentation. Perhaps a bit detailed, but given the circumstances, I'm sure you'll understand, for 2019 is important, but it's also important to reflect on the current situation because it's such an extraordinary situation. Gerard.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Thank you, Peter. We'll now continue with questions. A couple of questions were sent in before the meeting. Let me start with the first question that comes from the Foundation for the Legal Protection of Investors, SRB. They are about the impact around the corona crisis. Working at home, data storage, data traffic, artificial intelligence, medical care, what kind of influences that have in the consumers' need for computers, laptops, et cetera, mobile phones and others, what can ASML say?</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: This is a question that is being asked repeatedly, and I've answered some of its aspects already, specifically looking at the future. The demand then will indeed concentrate on data traffic, data storage, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, et cetera. That is where more arithmetic power is necessary, more capacity. It's quite clear that sophisticated chips will be an even stronger demand. On the other hand, this is a warning because we expect a significant shrinkage of economy, and this will impact consumer behavior. So it's difficult to look into the future. The question is whether a reduction in disposable income with consumer households will lead to refraining from making purchases, some of them will still have higher demand with respect to a better PC, a better WiFi connection, children with homeschooling and online lessons, they may have an increased demand. So there are various aspects that play a role here. We believe that the demand for sophisticated chips will increase and also demand for sophisticated devices. So EUV has a role to play. EUV is being bought by our customers because, indeed, the development of Menzis that we've sort of rolled out for the coming 10 years, where every year-on-year, new EUV systems are planned in with the capacities of those systems to make those sophisticated chips. So I believe that what we see at this point in time, the request for EUV systems doesn't really have a much to do with that. But in general, if the demand for more sophisticated chips are -- is increasing, then we'll have an increased demand for lithography systems, not in the short-term but in the long term.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: A second question from the Foundation SRB. And I'm sure many others share this question. Will the corona measures adversely affect labor productivity, given the fact that people in the factory of where special work close?</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: Indeed, that will play a role. That will have an impact. We follow all guidelines by the Dutch RIVM, all the guidelines in other parts of the world from the governments as well. And they indicate very clearly that as soon as anyone shows symptoms of COVID-19, they must remain at home. And that has really had an impact on absenteeism in our factories. We were able to compensate that. It did lead, though, to a delay of 1 to 2 weeks. So it does have an effect on productivity. In the supply chain, we've seen effects as well. Of course, this is all a combination of the crisis measures that have been announced by the governor with respect to personal protection equipment, but also it -- the lockdown situation has its effect as we have suppliers in areas that have to deal with quite strict lockdown situations. Just to mention Mexico, Malaysia, Italy. There, of course, we needed to come up with alternatives. This led to short delays. But in general, I believe I can say that our production capacity was only impacted slightly. No shortfalls, only delays. Sure. It has its effect, but it is controllable.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: A following question, Peter, asks about the increased sales of ASML and ASML's stronger role in the supply chain and in its added value, how does ASM deal with this increased role?</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: I think that in that respect, and I mean by we, ASML and its customers. We have a joint responsibility. We -- it is an empirical economic rule that when the costs per arithmetic function are not continuously reduced, there is no reason to buy the following generation of sophisticated chips. And that's why we are in close contact and consultation with our customers, ensuring how the cost per function of a chip can be reduced. ASML cannot claim a large share and all of that because otherwise, there's no stimulus for the customer to indeed introduce a new generation of chips in the market. So all this happens in close consultation. If you look at ASML's share in the value chain, on our Capital Markets Day in 2018, I showed a slide in that respect. I talked about the ecosystem, ASML, our customers, the customers of our customers and their customers. And then you talk about Google, Amazon et cetera platforms and the big tech companies, they are all dependent on this technology. If you look at the business model of that whole ecosystem, it is about $400 billion in -- excuse me, $1 trillion in operational profit and we're only 20% of that. So I wouldn't indeed exaggerate our share in all of this.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Let me ask the next question from the Dutch Investors association. They point to the publication of the half year figures, where you indicated the current crisis has a limited impact on the production capacity of ASML. At the same time, net turnover in the first quarter turned out to be below expectations by at least EUR 700 million.</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: Very good question. Well, you have to imagine that an EUV machine was a couple of million euros value. If those systems have a couple of weeks of delay. And that then moves over to the next quarter. This isn't an outage or a failure, but this is just a delay. Then that has its impact. We shipped too. That had a delay because of the COVID-19 situation. So the shipment went into the second quarter. Of the 4 that we did manage to ship, 2 of them based on accounting guidelines could only be included in the second or third quarter figures because the customer had logistic problems to indeed transport those systems. There's not always sufficient capacity. Normally, we do the full testing in our factories and then we indeed book the sales. In this case, it was different. We transported it. The final testing took place at the customer's premises, which means that you cannot book the sales yet because the final testing hasn't taken place yet. And those are delays. Those are delays in the sales of the first quarter that then move over to the second one, I believe, we're looking at EUR 500 million based on COVID-19 and EUR 200 million that had its reasons in shipping difficulties from China. And now I am quite hopeful because the airport at Wuhan is open again.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: The next question about -- by VEB. The workarounds that ASML needed to circumvent temporary disruptions of production processes. Until when and in which circumstances do you believe these deviating routines are necessary? How long will that be viable?</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: Well, I wish I had that answer, then we would know much more. All of this has to deal with the measures announced by the government officials in the Netherlands. Yesterday, we had another announcement by our minister by our Minister -- by our Prime Minister. And in that announcement, he made very clear that we haven't come for enough to indeed lift measures in a substantial way. In other countries, lockdown situations haven't been lifted or eased either. I believe we're still in the situation, a situation that will take a couple of weeks more. Situation that continues from the last 6 to 8 weeks. There is no certainty. There's no foreseeability. We will have to resort to creative solutions. And those solutions will not have to come only from ASML, but also from our suppliers. We'll just have to deal with it. And to date, this -- we've been successful with some delay though.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Another question again from the VEB pertains to critical suppliers. We said in the annual report that for some components, we only have 1 supplier.</p><p>Does that make us more vulnerable in this situation? And how does the management intend to mitigate these vulnerabilities?</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: Very important question. In this situation, we decided that the first tire suppliers for critical components that we have a unique relationship with them. This is a unique supplier relationship. There, we, of course, do not purchase huge amounts or volumes, but we do purchase at high value. And all of this has its economic reasons. The first suppliers, the first tire are so-called system integrators. We then purchase with other tiers, second, third and fourth tier suppliers. These are many ASMLs. From economic perspective, we choose to entertain these relationships that they are the sole suppliers does not mean that they have those competencies only or specifically. We have ZEISS with unique competencies. We have certain suppliers where they have one product and others that supply us with another product, but they do have comparable competencies. So if supplier A cannot deliver, then the second supplier is called in and can indeed produce what we need with a certain delay. That is exactly how we approach it. And this led to the measures we took in the lockdown situation of the first quarter. Moving forward production, finding alternative solutions being created creative cost time. This leads to some delay, and that means that the exact date of the shipment of a product to the customer has to be reviewed.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Next question shows -- refers to the large interest of the consequences of the border closures in China and the U.S. for the production process at ASML.</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: Now with respect to the production process, the border closures do not really have great consequences for ASML. We don't really source much products from there. There are some suppliers in China, if you go from the first tier to the second, third, fourth, then the complexity goes -- decreases step by step. So it's easier to find alternative solutions. In China, we didn't have any difficulties. Wuhan was closed, is now open again. We have a well-trained service crew in China. They can take care of the installations. It's quite difficult to send over other experts, there are certain measures that we have to follow and there are strictest visa requirements. We were able to manage around all of that to date. In the U.S., the situation is different. We have more suppliers. There is some difficulty in tackling the differences between the various states in the U.S.A., not all states, such as San Diego, California, and the county of San Diego, where we belong to the critical industry, same is the case on the East Coast and Wilton. But in Silicon Valley, we have a couple of suppliers where the production industry for chips does not belong to critical -- the critical sector. And we had some difficulties there, specifically with the shipment of our first multi-beam tool, which was ready for shipment. Shelter in place, then everything was closed down. And unfortunately, this machine was not transported. We do hope and we believe that it will be shipped this quarter. China, therefore, no problem, the U.S.A. inconsistent. But as I said, we're on top of it and managing it.</p><p>No</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Well, thank you again, Peter. Another question by the VEB, asking about ASML's breakeven level for net sales under the current circumstances.</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: This is a question that we could answer if we were to work on a number of scenarios. But it is not a question that is on our minds yet. The breakeven level, it's difficult to establish. You need to know the mix. Some customers request certain products, others, others. The products have various margins. There's still a lot of flexibility. 80% of the cost price of our goods is cash out 2/3. So we if some of the internal sales falls breaks down, then the cash falls down and decreases as well. We also have a remuneration costs. We have expenses in which we can take decisions, whether they are business-critical or not. So there is some flexibility in this whole situation. So the breakeven point has to be looked at from various perspectives. So we don't have to think about breakeven yet either.</p><p>Let's go back to demand. The demand is there. Our customers still request our products. There have been no cancellations of orders. I do believe that the following months will have negative impact in consumer electronics, but positive impact in investments in digital infrastructure. And whether that sets each other off or compensates, I'm not really sure, I cannot say at this point. But thinking of crisis situations and breakeven point, that is not topical at the moment. Now in that connection. In the first quarter, we've seen some postponement of deliveries, as you've just explained. ASML is optimistic that, that can be caught up with the course of this year, will investors be able to trust that this catch-up demand is 100%.</p><p>As I've already said, in the EUV system, certainly, the ones that weren't shipped will go out this quarter, there were a couple of updates, adaptations of systems that these systems can perform even better. These adaptations weren't possible to date because of COVID-19, this will happen, though, in the second quarter. This is a postponement of sales, not a decrease in sales.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Thank you. There is interest in knowing about the consequences for ASML. From the political difficulties between the U.S.A. and China with the Netherlands in the middle, what does ASML do to deal with this?</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: This is primarily a political issue. And I've said already, we are a commercial business, we deliver to customers that we are allowed deliver to. They are not on blacklists. We accept orders, we accept prepayments. So we will deliver, but of course, within the rules and regulations. The applicable rules and regulations, of course, are determined by the various governments, the American, the Chinese and the Dutch government. So what happens there is a political issue. We are going to wait and see. We don't need to take on lobbying organizations to work for us in any form or fashion, fares and industrial organization in the U.S.A. That tackles this subject. And you can imagine that our American colleagues in the chip machine industry that they, of course, wish this conflict not to escalate.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Well, thank you. I think you indeed answered a question by SRB, asking about possible consequences with respect to the export restrictions by the U.S.A. and the possibility of China to retaliate now that the world leads medical equipment from China is that, again, a political issue, we don't want to get mixed up with?</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: No there have been suggestions, but we see no relation and we haven't felt any kind of consequences here. So there's no relationship between the shipment of our machines and the access to medical equipment from China.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Back to a question by VEB with respect to the long term, ASML has a very wide bandwidth with regard to the turnover target for 2025 projected from a number of scenarios VEB is asking whether the Board of Directors, despite the corona pandemic is now unable to narrow this bandwidth.</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: Well, of course, I'd like to answer that. If we look at this bandwidth, with respect to 2025, we will have to have a secure understanding of how we established this bandwidth. It was based on 3 scenarios, market scenarios. What you're actually talking about is where is GDP in 2025. Is that going to create a market that is a slow market or a market at average economic level or at a high economic levels? Now those 3 scenarios are scenarios that we've worked on. And even with a low economic scenario, you'll see lower demand, and we translated that into the demand for a certain number of lithography machines. That is the lowest number in the bandwidth, 25 -- excuse me, 5 billion or the highest bandwidth number 25 billion. Now can the management give you more certainty about this bandwidth?</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: I would like to reask that question. Can you give us more certainty about GDP in 2025? Mr. Kleisterlee adds.</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: I think that will only be more difficult.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: The next question by VB. What percentage of sales can services make in the long run? And how do you see that development?</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: Well, service revenue, that's a very good question. What we see is that the number of installed base in the field is increasing. Our industry, the industry of ourselves, of our customers and of the customers of our customers is more and more important for society. So we are becoming more and more mature. The investments into a chip factory, $15 billion per factory. Those investments, of course, mean that our customers wish to maintain the long-term productivity of such factories. They gave these factories upgrade and they managed the installed base. And this becomes increasingly more important. We are noticing this. In 2018, this is traditional service, this is upgrading. The installed base management includes those 2 factors, keeping a factory economically productive and profitable.</p><p>In 2010, it was about 15% of our turnover. In 2019, approximately 25%. If you look at our 2025 models, it is between 26% and 32%. And this shows the development and the maturing of our industry. Now let's now look at the climate. That is important, specifically in this corona day and age. A question by the association of investors for sustainable development. ASML conducted research on the first-order physical impact of climate change for the company's operations and its supply chain. Has ASML used climate scenario analysis, and related to this is ASML willing to develop policies in line with the TCFD recommendations related to the management of physical impacts of climate change. Well, my answer here is that we do apply various mechanisms to assess the climate change-related risks and opportunities, and this includes engagements with our stakeholders, business continuity, business impact analyses, supplier recovery plans, and of course, the questionnaire is about climate change. At this moment, though, we've not yet included the 1.5 degrees and 2.0 degrees scenario. Because there is not yet an unambiguous global industry methodology or framework to conduct such scenario analyses. So we assess risk related -- the risk related to climate change and its impact using the assessment guidelines of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures, the TCFD, we're currently exploring how we can enrich our disclosures and that in line with those recommendations, and how they would fit with our current annual reporting standards. ASML also participates in the annual CDP program and its climate risk questionnaire, which is fully in line with the TCFD recommendations.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: A second question by VBDO pertains to the exact origin of 3TG Minerals, conflict minerals, which are used in its products. There is nonavailable or incomplete information related to the supply chain. So does ASML have ambitions to further increase the traceability of all minerals and include information on risks beyond conflict regions? Furthermore, is ASML willing to map its supply chain more broadly as part of the due diligence process and communicate about this to stakeholders in 2020.</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: Well, with respect to this, as per the 1st of January 2021, a new EU regulation will be effective. This is Regulation 2017/821 for supply chain due diligence on conflict minerals. In this regulation, the EU has adopted the OECD guidelines. And this means at the current scope, DRC and adjoining countries will expand to conflict-affected and high-risk areas. ASML is member of the RBA. This is responsible business alliance and adheres to the RBA code of conduct. Now in this alliance, we work together with a global network of manufacturers in the electronic industry. At this point in time, the RBA is revising their code of conduct to become effective in 2021. And in this revised code of conduct, the OECD guidelines will be adopted to meet the EU regulation and also the growing interest from stakeholders in this subject. Now as part of this project, the RBA will also update their tools to support their members, at least that is what we do hope so we can conduct due diligence procedures. And in addition to that, we are working on a conflict minerals policy this year.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Well, thank you very much for the questions by VBDO. VBDO has indicated that it's pleased with the way in which ASML has approached the topic of diversity. I see that there are no women represented in the management board, contrary to the balanced composition of Supervisory Board. VBDO acknowledges the difficulties in finding female personnel in technology-related sectors. Nevertheless, VBDO is curious if ASML is willing to develop a concrete diversity strategy that serves a more gender-balanced and diverse composition of the boards, workforce and senior management. What can VBDO expect on this topic in 2020?</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: Well, the VBDO has indicated this itself, achieving real solid gender diversity in a technology environment or hard technology environment such as ASML has proven to be challenging. And in general, the ratio of women compared to men in technology and science-related studies is lower. We are supported -- supporting initiatives to get young women interested in technology. We're working hard on that by creating awareness, attention for the career prospects in our sector. We believe that there are so many development opportunities, not only in technology, but also in general management in our way. We tried to increase the number of women across ASML so that the future talent pool can grow. And to be quite honest, we do see that the number of women at ASML is growing, and I'm talking about management positions here. We see an increase, and we've included this in our 2019 integrated report. Obviously, it's not enough. There's -- we do see a change in the trend in the sense that the trend is moving in the right direction, but we are indeed intending to develop additional activities in order to enhance gender diversity. We're working on inclusiveness strategy, which will include gender diversity, we'll be doing more in terms of -- in gender diversity and inclusion. And in the course of this year that will be ready so that we can proceed to implement it. On behalf of the Supervisory Board, I can add that as a Supervisory Board, we are specifically asking for more attention on the gender diversity issues and that at ASML, when we hire people for senior management positions, we always ask the head hunter to include and to propose a number of women for the selection.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Back to the question of VB. A question that has to do with last year's sales, that VB wonders what the causes of the relative increase of sales to the largest customer by more than 12 percentage points, almost a doubling in absolute numbers. I'm sure you can explain.</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: Well, fortunately, I had the opportunity to look at this question, and I looked it up, and any reference to the question was found in the ASML integrated report, Page 147. Indeed, it's not specified as such, but it does indicate the size of the largest customer in relation to our sales. In 2019, it was EUR 4.7 billion, almost 40%, 39% of sales. In 2018, it was EUR 2.5 billion. So EUR 2.5 billion to EUR 4.9 billion. That is probably the doubling that the VB is referring to. This is in euros, but it need not be the same customer because in 2019, as I said earlier on, we mainly had logic chips, the foundries were the main customers. 2018, the memory manufacturers, our Korean customers were the customers. The doubling doesn't have to be one customer. On a percentage to try and understand because the largest customer in 2018 had 22% of sales instead of 39%, which is a 17% difference. But in 2017, it was 27%. So that's 12%. So there may be a minor confusion here. And if this question remains to be an urgent question, Investor Relations department will certainly be able to answer that question. The Chairman? Yes.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Question of SRB, asked a question about ASML's intention to agree on an own collective labor agreement. And what the views are, the unions and the staff and SRB refers to the staff bonus, which in 2019, is lower than in 2018. The CEO, Mr. Wennink.</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: As ASML, we are -- we form part of CLA in the metal industry. Well, there's a great deal of diversity there. There are shipyards, there are fitters that are part of this collective labor agreement. So the CLA includes companies that supply the industry, and there are companies such as ASML. And the nature of ASML is significantly different. Heterogeneity is a wonderful thing on the one hand. On the other hand, you see that because of this heterogeneity, there are differences in terms of what is important to a specific company. If you look at the age buildup at ASML, average age is 38 years. I know that in certain companies in the metal industry, the average age is about 20 years more. So you can imagine that the employment conditions in one company can be quite different than another company because the focus of the employees themselves can be different. And this is precisely what we envisage to achieve that the voice of the employee be better reflected in the labor agreements, in the collective labor agreements because a simple fact is that, first of all, we're a different type of company and second, that the composition of our workforce is quite different. But there's one thing that is very important, a number of unions and not all unions, not all unions are against it. There are a number of unions that are in favor. But there are unions that disagree and they then say that we're doing this in order to apply a negative adjustment to the employment conditions, it won't surprise you that particularly in this tech business, it's a war on talent. It's all about recruiting the best engineers, 107 nationalities. Now you cannot recruit the best possible people by applying a downward adjustment to your employment conditions. So that's absolutely not an issue here. And I would reject any suggestion in that direction. What we did was we conducted an overall survey. And in the Netherlands, we have about 13,000 employees, but there are a number of flexible workers that are not part of our FTE numbers. They are not covered by a CLA. Between 10,000 and 11,000 FTEs of fixed employees, 7,000 of them filled in a survey. We ask them, \"What they consider to be important?\" We are analyzing the input as we speak. And that input will be the framework for the employment contract because it has to be a reflection of what is important to our employees given their average age. And also what is important to the company. And I would just like to highlight that we are going to adjust our profit distribution system. It's not true that we adjusted that. Our bonus system in 2019 has remained exactly the same, but as a percentage of net profit. And if net profit declined slightly, well, then also the incentives will decline. That's simply how it works. And this applies to a minority of ASML employees across the world. The vast majority of our employees of our workforce in the world is paid a variable remuneration according to the exact same rules and conditions that apply to the management board. So most of our employees, the majority of our employees follow the short-term incentive plan of the company, and a minority has the same conditions as the management board.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Last question that was submitted beforehand were some points of interest of the association of stockholders with respect to these times of crisis. This concerns matters such as how to deal with variable remuneration and additional review by the auditor, possible impact of the crisis on climate change and also incentives.</p><p>PETER T. F. M. WENNINK: Well, in part, these questions require further studying, and it would also be determined by what turns out to be market practice in the future, but I think by and large, we can say that a large part of the problems at this point of time, the way we see it seems to pass ASML by -- despite the crisis, we can speak of a reasonable visible operation. There's no decline -- no disappearance of demand or production capability, there's still performance and performance should be rewarded decently and the Remuneration Committee, part of the Supervisory Board has found no reason to deviate for the ordinary rules that apply to remuneration of ASML employees. And with respect to other positions, ancillary positions, there's a time pressure for members of the Supervisory Board and companies that go through a crisis obviously require more attention of their board members. And there is a downward pressure on the number of supervisory directorships that are allowed, and we are complying with those rules at ASML and we don't really see the crisis as a touchstone for the maximum or minimum number of supervisory directorships that a board should have. This is a debate that one should pursue once the situation has normalized. And as far as the additional review of the auditor is concerned, I'd like to allow Han van Delden to say a few words about the closing of the books at ASML and his personal views thereof.</p><p>HAN VAN DELDEN;KPMG;PARTNER: Thank you. Today, on our agenda, we have the IFRS accounts of ASML. We issued 3 opinions for the consolidated accounts, the nonfinancial information, the ordinary accounts and on the 11th of February, we issued an opinion to the U.S. GAAP statements that were audited according to the American principles and the extraordinary thing is that we also issued an opinion on the internal audit with respect to financial information. I pointed out earlier on -- it has been pointed out how ASML is organized, and we can do most of the audit here in Veldhoven with the Dutch team with the exception of the business unit in size which is in audit, conducted by EY. The scope of our audit is 93% for sales and 60% of assets. And we checked the financial statements with a materiality of EUR 130 million. In our audit statement, we specify the work that we've done and we've also included the key audit matters. Those are the matters that the auditor based on his professional view considers to be the most significant elements in the audit for us. This is revenue recognition. Revenue recognition is a very complex process at ASML focused on system sales, but also sometimes other products are delivered, warranty, training, service, their arrangements on discounts, systems that are being delivered have discount -- may have discounted so attributing this to individual performance is very complex and we turned this into a key audit matter. There was a question of the VEB, the Stockholders association. It was about the fact that there's only 1 key audit matter, whether that's not very little. But it's all about what we consider to be the most significant in the audit. It's very complex, and we dedicated a lot of time to that. And we report to the Audit committee about it quite extensively. In the past, we have included other elements in our opinion, goodwill in the first year, better understanding of the company, profitability of ASML. Well, we didn't make it a key audit matter anymore. Acquisition of HME was also included at some point as a key audit matter. That doesn't mean that there are no other important things, and the audit plan is at the Supervisory Board, we've included other issues such as the valuation stock, goodwill, tax positions, but also the implementation of ERP systems. And one of the units of ASML.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Another question of VB was about the current -- in the current condition of 2020, whether that would continue to be the case that you only have one significant key audit matter?</p><p>HAN VAN DELDEN;KPMG;PARTNER: In the presentation to the Audit Committee last week, in our risk analysis, we put one big question mark, which is the impact of COVID-19 with respect to the business operation of ASML and possible impact on financial information.</p><p>Obviously, we will be following this closely. Mr. Wennink already shared his extended analysis. We will be doing that in the course of the year. And the question is how this will impact on suppliers and customers of ASML. Should there be significant disruptions, obviously, that will also have an impact on those items that require estimates such as valuation of stocks, goodwill, deferred revenue and other items. So that would be different for 2020.</p><p>You have indicated that the VEB is interested in a further opinion on the half-yearly figures, a review thereof. I'll be prepared to do that, but it's up to management to decide on that and the Audit committee. I would like to add to that, that the auditor's opinion is quite different from a review. A review would involve less work and provides less certainty. But it's up to the company to decide on that.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Thank you very much, Mr. Van Delden. I confirm that at this point in time, there are no additional questions from the meeting. And now I would like to give the floor to the Secretary of the meeting, Mr. Kleipool.</p><p>REINIER KLEIPOOL;DEPUTY CIVIL LAW NOTARY AT DE BRAUW BLACKSTONE WESTBROEK: Thank you. On the record date for this AGM, the total number of outstanding ordinary shares with a value of EUR 0.09, 425,659,415 ordinary shares, 7,476,943 shares, thereof are kept by the company's treasury shares. Number of outstanding ordinary shares with a value of EUR 0.09, connected to voting rights amounted to 418,181,472 shares. So as one share gives an entitlement to 9 votes, the foregoing number of shares gives entitlement to 3,763,633,248 votes. We know that 3,104 shareholders of ASML are represented or present. EUR 29,072,344.23 are represented here today, entitling to EUR 2,907,234,423 votes, which means a 77.25% of subscribed issued capital is represented of the meeting. There are 2 items on the agenda that require 75% majority at this meeting, which is item 6 and 7 with regards to Remuneration Policy. All the other points of the meeting can be adopted with a simple majority of the votes cast since more than the -- more than half the outstanding share capital is represented. Now let me explain the voting procedure. Since there are no shareholders physically present at this AGM, at this meeting, we will be able to vote by means of the voting platform. There's an explanation of virtual voting posted on the website of ASML.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Different from other years, after the voting has been concluded, the voting will be opened for all agenda items. So you can vote on all items up to any other business. So you don't have to wait until an agenda item has come up through the virtual voting platform, you can vote. And you can select your vote, and you have the opportunity to do so until the vote is closed, and that will be prior to agenda Item 3, which is any other business. The vote for the different items on the agenda is open up to any other business. I will ask the operator to activate the system, and we can proceed with agenda Item 3A, which is an advisory vote with respect to the remuneration report for the Board of Management and Supervisory Board for the financial year 2019. Agenda item concerns the discussion of remuneration report of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board as prepared for the financial year 2019. Remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the revised EU shareholders' directive as implemented in the Deutsche legislation on the 1st of December 2019. Under this new legislation, the general meeting has an advisory vote on the remuneration report. This item on the agenda is also a voting item as stated in the agenda in the explanatory note to the agenda. And the general meeting is asked to vote on the fact that the remuneration report is clear and understandable. I shall now give a brief explanation on this topic. The remuneration report 2019 for the Board of Management, Supervisory Board is in accordance with the revised EU's Shareholders Rights Directive as implemented in Dutch law as per December 1, 2019. Pursuant to this new legislation, the general meeting has an advisory vote on the remuneration report. Changes to the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management were adopted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2019 and became effective as per the 1st of January 2019. The main elements in the implementation of the Remuneration Policy 2019 are the base salaries of the Board of Management have been increased by 2.3% for the President and 2.9% for the other Board of Management members. Short-term incentive and STI payout over 2019 amounted to 89.2% of the maximum of 133.8% of the target, the target being 80%, which means 107% of the base salary.</p><p>The nonfinancial performance criteria, such as technology leadership index and market position, were both achieved between target and maximum performance level. On the financial performance criteria, the EBIT margin amounts to 122% payout of target. The EUV gross margin is 150% payout of target and free cash flow, 150% of payout target long-term incentive, LTI payout over the performance period 2017, 2019 has been 82.7% of maximum. The ASML total shareholder return outperformed the semiconductor index, the Philadelphia semiconductor index with 55.4 points, leading to a payout of 100% of MAX. Return on capital payout with 62% of MAX quality targets such as technology leadership and index and sustainability are between target and maximum achievement.</p><p>So having explained this, we can now proceed to the vote. I see that there are no further questions. And I'd like to wrap up this agenda item and invite you to cast your vote. You can vote until the end of any other business.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: And now we can proceed to 3B. 3B concerns the proposal to adopt the financial statements of the company in the financial year 2019 as prepared in accordance with the Dutch law. As you've been able to see, ASML has published the integrated report with financial and nonfinancial information. This year, ASML, again, prepared 2 financial statements, one based on the accounting principles as generally accepted in the United States, the so-called U.S. GAAP principles and one based on the International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, and Dutch law. The 2019 integrated report based on IFRS and Dutch law are now submitted to you for adoption. And this has been available for inspection at the offices of the company and has also been posted on ASML's website.</p><p>Mr. Van Delden of our external auditor, KPMG, is attending this meeting. He will provide some insight on the audit activities that KPMG has conducted for ASML in 2019. He can answer any questions concerning audit performed. So once again, I'd like to give the floor to Mr. Van Delden.</p><p>HAN VAN DELDEN;KPMG;PARTNER: Chairman, actually, I was so excited. So I more or less covered all the activities that we conducted in the context of the audit. So I think I can leave it at that.</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Thank you for that. Since there are no further questions, we can wrap up this item on the agenda, and I would urge you to proceed to cast your vote on this item. I repeat that you can vote until any other business.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: And let's proceed to 3C. This is a discussion item, not a voting item. It concerns the clarification of the company's reserves and dividend policy. The company aims to pay out a dividend on a yearly basis that will grow and that will be paid every 6 months. For further explanation, I would like to refer to the explanatory notes in the agenda. So there are no questions on this agenda item either. So we will proceed to wrap up this item and the vote.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: And then we can proceed to 3D. The next item of the agenda, which is the adoption of dividend for the financial year 2019. On November 15, 2019, the company paid an interim dividend of EUR 1.05 per ordinary share for the first time. The Board of Management now proposes to the general meeting to declare a final dividend of EUR 1.35 per ordinary share. And that brings the total dividend for the financial year 2019 to EUR 2.40 per ordinary share, which is an increase of 14% compared to last year. For the sake of completeness, I would inform you the Supervisory Board has approved this proposal. As this topic has already been discussed under agenda items 2 and 3C, I'd like to refer to the explanation which was provided earlier. And here, once again, we can proceed to the vote.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: And I will continue with agenda Item 4, which is the proposal to grant discharge to the members of the Board of Management from liability for their responsibilities in the financial year 2019. And so we can wrap up this agenda item now as well, and I would urge you to cast your vote.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: And we can proceed with agenda Item 4B, which is the proposal to grant discharge, the members of the Supervisory Board from liability for their responsibilities in the financial year 2019. This agenda item can be wrapped up now.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: And we can proceed to item 5, which is the proposal to approve the number of shares to be allocated to the Board of Management. Agenda Item 5 concerns the approval of the maximum number of ordinary shares being 200,000 ordinary shares that is actually made available for remuneration of the Board of Management and a number of shares that will actually be allocated to members, the Board of Management will be determined by the Supervisory Board based on applicable Remuneration Policy by applying the calculation method as described in the policy. Furthermore, it is proposed to the general meeting to designate the Board of Management as the body authorized to issue aforementioned shares subject to approval of Supervisory Board. This designation is requested for a period from this meeting until the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2021. ASML has previously committed to inform the general meeting each year about the exact number of shares that is granted conditionally. In 2020 -- for the financial year 2020, 41,362 shares will be granted conditionally to the Board of Management. The volume-weighted average share price during the last quarter's financial year 2019 amounted to EUR 242.75. In 2021, the general meeting will also be informed about the number of shares granted conditionally to the Board of Management for the financial year 2021. I'd urge you to proceed to the vote on this agenda item.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: We can proceed to 6. Proposal to adopt some adjustments to the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management. Now the reason for this implementation lies in the fact that on the 1st of December 2019, the revised EU Shareholders Rights Directive has been transposed into Dutch law. Now this directive sets requirements for the content of the Remuneration Policy. To meet these requirements, a number of changes to the current Remuneration Policy are required, which are further explained in the explanatory notes to the agenda. The amended Remuneration Policy does not contain any substantial changes to remuneration structure and elements. The Works Council was given the opportunity to advice on this policy in good time and informed the Supervisory Board that was positive about this. On the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Supervisory Board proposes to adopt the changes in the remuneration policy for the Board of Management. If adopted, they will take effect with retroactive effect as per the 1st of January 2020. Again, I would like to move to the vote.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: We are now going to continue with agenda Item 7. This agenda item concerns the proposal to establish the remuneration policy of the Supervisory Board. Now the Shareholder Rights Directive, which was also discussed in agenda Item 6 requires that a remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board is drawn up and adopted by the general meeting as well. The Supervisory Board's Remuneration Policy meets the requirements set by the shareholder rights Directive and the Dutch law. The remuneration policy has not made any changes to the remuneration structure or the amounts as determined by the general meeting in 2019 and as further explained in the explanatory notes for this meeting. As for the changes to the policy for the Board of Management, the Works Council was, again, timely given the opportunity to provide advice on the remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board. It is indicated to be positive about it. On the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Supervisory Board proposes to adopt the Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board. If adopted, this policy will take effect with retroactive effect as per the 1st of January 2020.</p><p>There are no questions. I would like to invite you to vote on this agenda item.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Before we continue with the next one, I would like to indicate that we're halfway down the agenda. And I would like to remind you to cast your vote in time before the -- any other business agenda item because the vote will be closed then. We will now continue and move on to agenda Item 8. This agenda item consists of 3 voting items and 4 discussion items. As announced last year, Mrs. Aris and Mr. Ziebart will retire rotationally at this general meeting. Mr. Ziebart has indicated that he is not available for reappointment and will, therefore, step down as member of the Supervisory Board. Dear Wolfgang, we would like to thank you for your strong commitment to ASML's Supervisory Board, not only as a member of the Supervisory Board for the past 11 years, but also as a member of the Audit Committee and the Technology Committee. We will miss your valuable contribution to the Supervisory Board. And as soon as this corona period is over, we are going to take, say, our goodbyes in a face-to-face meeting. Mrs. Aris though has indicated that she is available for reappointment, and the Supervisory Board has nominated her for reappointment as a Member of the Supervisory Board of ASML. Mrs. Aris' nomination is based on the enhanced recommendation right of the Works Council. Now in addition to the vacancies that arise as a result of the resignation of Mrs. Aris and Mr. Ziebart, the Supervisory Board intends to nominate an additional candidate as a member of the Supervisory Board. As a result of which, the number of members of the Supervisory Board will increase from 8 to 9. In this way, Supervisory Board will be more extensive than in previous years.</p><p>I would, therefore, like to proceed to agenda Item 8A. The Supervisory Board considers it desirable to nominate an additional candidate as a Member of the Supervisory Board during this general meeting. Now this nomination meets the need within the Supervisory Board to have more experience in semiconductor technology and semiconductor industry in the ranks. This is considered desirable in view of the company's growth and size and complexity. For the time being, the increase in the number of members of Supervisory Board is temporary. This has also been further explained in the explanatory notes.</p><p>I will now continue with agenda Item 8B. During the course of 2019's AGM, the Supervisory Board notified the vacancies that would arise from rotation due to rotation of Mrs. Aris and Mr. Ziebart. The shareholders were given the opportunity to make recommendations for the nomination of candidates for these vacancies. Now with regard to the additional vacancy, the general meeting has given the opportunity during this agenda item to make recommendations for the nomination of candidates for this new vacancy. The Supervisory Board intends to fill the 3 vacancies, including this additional vacancy by nominating Mrs. Aris and Mr. Durcan and East, for appointment by the general meeting in accordance with the profile of the Supervisory Board. The nomination of the Supervisory Board for the filling of the extra vacancy is made on the condition that the general meeting does not make a recommendation. I note that the general meeting does not exercise its right of recommendation for the new vacancy and will, therefore, finalize this agenda item and proceed to agenda Item 8C. 8C, the Supervisory Board announces its intention to nominate Mrs. Aris for reappointment and to nominate Mr. East and Mr. Durcan, for appointment as members of the Supervisory Board. Now the explanatory notes to the agenda contain the motivations for these nominations as well as the details of the candidates. The reappointment of Mrs. Aris and the appointment of Misters East and Durcan will apply for a period of 4 years from the date of this AGM. Because of the coronavirus, it is not possible for Misters East and Durcan to be present in person or to personally introduce themselves. I will, therefore, very briefly say something about them. Mr. Durcan has extensive experience in the semiconductor industry, 1984. He was in -- with microtechnologies, and he had various positions up to 2017. Mr. East, at this point in time is CEO of Rolls-Royce. He had a career at Texas Instruments. And in 1994, he worked for Arm Holds in various management functions. And in '21 -- '01, he was Chief Executive Officer there, a function that he held until 2013. We are convinced that ASML and the Supervisory Board will profit from the knowledge, the experience and the leadership capacities that both candidates bring. The Works Council did not recommend any candidates for these vacancies. And the Works Council, furthermore, has been given a timely opportunity to determine its position regarding the proposed reappointments and the vacancies, but withheld because of the temporary characteristics of this increase in members of the Supervisory Board.</p><p>Furthermore, the nomination for appointment of Ms. Aris is based on the enhanced recommendation right of the Works Council. And furthermore, the Works Council has had timely opportunity to determine its position regarding the proposed reappointment and the appointment of Misters East and Durcan and as indicated to the Supervisory Board that is in favor thereof.</p><p>I would now like to walk you through the next agenda items. 8D. 8D, concerns the proposal to reappoint Mrs. Aris as a Member of the Supervisory Board of the company for a period of 4 years. Agenda Item 8E concerns a proposal to appoint Mr. Durcan as member of the Supervisory Board of the company for a period of 4 years. And agenda Item 8F concerns the proposal to report Mr. East as a Member of the Supervisory Board of the company for a period of 4 years. You can now vote on these agenda items. As you know, you can vote up to the agenda item, any other business.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: We will now continue with agenda Item 8G. 8G, the composition of the Supervisory Board in 2021. This Item 8G is a discussion item. The Supervisory Board gives notice of the vacancies that will arise in Supervisory Board in 2021. In 2020, Ms. Smits-Nusteling and Mr. Grose will retire by rotation. Mr. Grose has indicated that he is not available for reappointment. The vacancy created by the resignation of Mr. Grose will not be filled, bringing the number of Supervisory Board members back to 8. Ms. Smits-Nusteling has also indicated that she is not available for reappointment. The general meeting and the Works Council have the right to recommend candidates for the vacancy that has arisen. I would also like to conclude this agenda item and proceed with the next slide.</p><p>Item 9, proposal to appoint KPMG as external account auditor for the reporting year 2021. As described in the explanatory notes of the agenda, the Audit Committee finalized an assessment of the performance of KPMG as ASML's external auditor over the past year. The survey addressed, among others, the quality, scope and planning of the audit and the independence and reporting of the external auditor. Pursuant to the outcome of the survey has conducted, it is proposed by the Audit Committee to again appoint KPMG as external auditor. Therefore, the Supervisory Board, per the recommendations of its audit committee now proposes to appoint KPMG as the company's external auditor. Before the meeting, the following question was received by the VEB. With regard to ASML, KPMG is able to draw attention to a key point in the audit of users of the financial statements. This is low given the practice that other companies and the environment complexity and global presence of ASML. VEB is asking what is the reason that you have not found it necessary to identify more than one key audit matter, while noting that the loss of attention to transition to IFRS 15 is justified. The VEB further is asking which key audit matters usually were selected from a list of topics eligible for additional attention and control and which were part and partial of the discussion with the Audit Committee? And the VEB further hopes that ASML will have an extensive review carried out on the half year figures. If revenue inclusion will also be a key audit matter and recognition, what would be different in KPMG's approach given the current rapidly changing environment? These questions were dealt with Han van Delden in his earlier explanations, and I hope that they were satisfactorily answered. Still, the question is for ASML, what to do with the half year audit and as management boards, we shall discuss that and take a viewpoint on it.</p><p>There are further no questions. I will then proceed to the next agenda item after having asked you to vote on this item.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: Agenda Item 10 consists of 4 voting points, A, B, C and D. Although it's an annually recurring agenda item, this item remains important for ASML. It is in the company's interest and that of its shareholders to be able to react timely and quickly if particular circumstances for which an issue of shares required arise. Therefore, the Board of Management would like to have the authorization to issue shares when such circumstances arise and to exclude the pre-emption right in situations, which is necessary to act quickly. In 2012, this authorization was used, for example, in connection with the acquisition of Cymer, and in 2016 in connection with the acquisition of Hermes Microvision. In the past, this authorization was also used for the issue of convertible bonds. The authorizations to be granted will be valid for a period of 18 months, i.e., until and including October 22, 2021. If you approve the proposals of this agenda item, the existing authorizations will cease to apply.</p><p>Agenda Item 10A concerns the authorization of the Board of Management to issue ordinary shares or grant rights to subscribe for ordinary shares in the company's share capital, limited to 5% of the issued share capital for general purposes at the time of authorization, subject to Supervisory Board approval. Agenda Item 10B concerns the authorization of the Board of Management to subject to Supervisory Board approval, restrict or exclude the pre-emption rights accrued to shareholders in connection with agenda item 10A. Agenda Item 10C is the authorization of the Board of Management to subject to Supervisory Board approval, issue shares or grant rights to subscribe for shares for an additional 5% of the current share capital of the company. This additional 5% can only be used in connection with or on the occasion of mergers, acquisitions and/or strategic alliances.</p><p>Finally, agenda Item 10D. This is the authorization for the Board of Management to subject to Supervisory Board approval, restrict or exclude the pre-emption rights accruing to shareholders in connection with the issue of shares or rights to subscribe for shares as described under 10C. I see there are no further questions. I would like now ask you to vote on this item.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: You can vote up to the -- any other business item, and you can take this -- we can take this vote because there is more than 50% of the shares represented. We will now continue with agenda items 11 and 12. ASML wishes to have suitable flexibility in the execution of a return of capital to its shareholders. To enable such flexibility, ASML requests the general meeting to mandate further share repurchases and to approve further cancellation of shares to be able to implement further share repurchase programs should the company decide to do so. As you will understand, the implementation of further share repurchase programs is dependent on many factors. Shareholders are advised that there is no certainty as to further return of capital or as to the timing or of another potential execution of a return of capital to shareholders nor as to the method of achieving such return. The current share repurchase program, which started on January 23, has been explained before this meeting under agenda Item 2.</p><p>I will now deal with agenda items 11 and 12 separately. Now agenda item 11 consists of 2 voting items, A and B. The 2 authorizations proposed in this agenda item allow ASML, in combination with the proposal under agenda item 12, to, one, acquire a maximum 10% of the issued tier capital; and two, cancel these shares; subsequently three, acquire once again, a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital; and subsequently four, cancel these shares.</p><p>Agenda Item 11A concerns the proposal to authorize the Board of Management to acquire a maximum of 10% of the current outstanding share capital of the company. Shares can be acquired on the conditions that are set out in the explanatory notes. Agenda Item 11B is the proposal to grant the Board of Management the authorization to acquire additional shares up to a maximum of 10% of the current outstanding share capital of the company. Shares can be acquired on the same conditions set out under agenda item 11A and subject to the additional conditions as set out in the explanatory notes. The reason for requesting this additional authorization is to have further flexibility in the execution of our return of capital to the shareholders. These authorizations are requested for a period of 18 months, commence today and end on October 22, 2021. If the general meeting approves the 2 proposals of this agenda item, the existing authorizations will cease to apply.</p><p>I know that there are no further questions. I invite you to vote on these 2 items on the agenda. If you've not already done so, it is still possible to vote, I will say again, until the agenda item of any other business.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>GERARD JOHANNES KLEISTERLEE: I will now proceed to agenda Item 12. In this agenda item, it is proposed to cancel ordinary shares repurchased by the company. It is proposed to cancel any or all ordinary shares and share capital of the company held or repurchased by the company under the authorization referred to on our agenda item 11 to the extent that such ordinary shares are not used to cover obligations under employee share and stock option plans. This cancellation may be executed in one or more tranches. The number of ordinary shares that will be canceled will be determined by the Board of Management, but may not exceed 20% of the issued share capital at 22 April, 2020.

Continue reading A sneaky attempt to end encryption is worming its way through Congress</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EARN IT Act co-sponsor Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., talks with reporters in the Capitol on March 3rd | Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A thing about writing a newsletter about technology and democracy during a global pandemic is that technology and democracy are no longer really at the forefront of everyone s attention. The relationship between big platforms and the nations they operate in remains vitally important for all sorts of reasons, and I ve argued that the platforms have been unusually proactive in their efforts to promote high-quality information sources. Still, these moves are a sideshow compared to the questions we re all now asking. How many people will get COVID-19? How many people will die? Will our healthcare system be overwhelmed? How long will it take our economy to recover?</p><p>We won t know the answers for weeks, but I m starting to fear the worst. On Wednesday the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 had officially become a pandemic. A former director for the Centers for Disease Control now says that in the worst case scenario, more than 1 million Americans could die.</p><p>This piece by Tomas Pueyo argues persuasively that the United States is currently seeing exponential growth in the number of people contracting the disease, and that hospitals are likely to be overwhelmed. Pueyo s back ground is in growth marketing, not in epidemiology. But by now we have seen enough outbreaks in enough countries to have a rough idea of how the disease spreads, and to understand the value of  social distancing    that is, staying behind closed doors. So I want to recommend that everyone here reads that piece, and consider modifying your behavior if you re still planning events or spending a lot of time in public.</p><p>* * *</p><p>One risk of having the world pay attention to a single, all-consuming story is that less important but still urgent stories are missed along the way. One such unfolding story in our domain is the (deep breath) Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies ( EARN IT ) Act, which was the subject of a Senate hearing on Wednesday. Here s Alfred Ng with an explainer inCNET:</p><p>The EARN IT Act was introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (Republican of South Carolina) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Democrat of Connecticut), along with Sen. Josh Hawley (Republican of Missouri) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Democrat of California) on March 5.</p><p>The premise of the bill is that technology companies have to earn Section 230 protections rather than being granted immunity by default, as the Communications Decency Act has provided for over two decades.</p><p>For starters, it s not clear that companies have to  earn  what are already protections provided under the First Amendment: to publish, and to allow their users to publish, with very few legal restrictions. But if the EARN IT Act were passed, tech companies could be held liable if their users posted illegal content. This would represent a significant and potentially devastating amendment to Section 230, a much-misunderstood law that many consider a pillar of the internet and the businesses that operate on top of it.</p><p>When internet companies become liable for what their users post, those companies aggressively moderate speech. This was the chief outcome of FOSTA-SESTA, the last bill Congress passed to amend Section 230. It was putatively written to eliminate sex trafficking, and was passed into law after Facebook endorsed it. I wrote about the aftermath in October:</p><p>[The law] threatens any website owner with up to 10 years in prison for hosting even one instance of prostitution-related content. As a result, sites like Craigslist removed their entire online personals sections. Sex workers who had previously been working as their own bosses were driven back onto the streets, often forced to work for pimps. Prostitution-related crime in San Francisco alone   including violence against workers   more than tripled.</p><p>Meanwhile, evidence that the law reduced sex trafficking is suspiciously hard to come by. And there is little reason to believe that the EARN IT Act will be a greater boon to public life.</p><p>Yet, for the reasons Issie Lapowsky lays out today in a good piece in Protocol, it may pass anyway. Once again Congress has lined up some sympathetic witnesses who paint a picture that, because of their misfortune, whole swathes of the internet should be eliminated. It would do that by setting up a byzantine checklist structure that would handcuff companies to a difficult-to-modify set of procedures. One item on that checklist could be eliminating end-to-end encryption in messaging apps, depriving the world of a secure communications tool at a time when authoritarian governments are surging around the world. Here s Lapowsky:</p><p>The EARN IT Act would establish the National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention, a 19-member commission, tasked with creating a set of best practices for online companies to abide by with regard to stopping child sexual abuse material. Those best practices would have to be approved by 14 members of the committee and submitted to the attorney general, the secretary of homeland security, and the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission for final approval. That list would then need to be enacted by Congress. Companies would have to certify that they re following those best practices in order to retain their Section 230 immunity. Like FOSTA/SESTA before it, losing that immunity would be a significant blow to companies with millions, or billions, of users posting content every day.</p><p>The question now is whether the industry can convince lawmakers that the costs of the law outweigh the benefits. It s a debate that will test what tech companies have learned from the FOSTA/SESTA battle   and how much clout they even have left on Capitol Hill.</p><p>The bill s backers have not said definitively that they will demand a backdoor for law enforcement (and whoever else can find it) as part of the EARN IT Act. (In fact, Blumenthal denies it.) But nor have they written the bill to say they won t. And Graham, one of the bill s cosponsors, left little doubt on where he stands:</p><p>Facebook is talking about end-to-end encryption which means they go blind,  Sen Graham said, later adding,  We re not going to go blind and let this abuse go forward in the name of any other freedom. </p><p>Notably, Match Group   the company behind Tinder, OKCupid, and many of the most popular dating apps in the United States   has come out in support of the bill. (That s easy for Match: none of the apps it makes offer encrypted communications.) The platforms are starting to speak up against it, though   see this thread from WhatsApp chief Will Cathcart.</p><p>In the meantime, Graham raises the prospect that the federal government will get what it has long wanted   greatly expanded power to surveil our communications   by burying it in a complex piece of legislation that is nominally about reducing the spread of child abuse imagery. It s a cynical move, and if the similar tactics employed in the FOSTA-SESTA debate were any indication, it might well be an effective one.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Ratio</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trending up:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis>and the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gates Foundation</emphasis>might team up to deliver coronavirus test kits to Seattle homes.

The proposals mirror taxes countries like France have also considered. Ashley Gold at The Information has the story:</p><p>The proposals vary in approach and scope, but they all center around the idea that big internet companies, having built their fortunes in part through the use of consumers  personal information, should be contributing more to government coffers. The bills, which face mixed prospects for adoption, have drawn the ire of tech companies and other business groups, who say it could be challenging to determine precisely how much of their ad revenue comes from each state. In addition, tax experts said, the proposals could run afoul of federal law.</p><p>But lawmakers and other advocates believe the proposals might find favor with voters concerned about the power wielded by Silicon Valley and large corporations in general.</p><p>Also: The UK government confirmed that it will levy a 2 percent tax on  the revenues of search engines, social media services and online marketplaces which derive value from U.K. users  starting on April 1st.

The proposal would not only roll back restrictions that keep broadband providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T from blocking or collecting tolls from services they don't like, it would bar states from imposing their own rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The broadband industry promises that the internet experience isn't going to change, but its companies have lobbied hard to overturn these rules. Protests have erupted online and in the streets as everyday Americans worry that cable and phone companies will be able to control what they see and do online.</p><p> That growing public movement suggests that the FCC vote won't be the end of the issue. Opponents of the move plan legal challenges, and some net-neutrality supporters hope to ride that wave of public opinion into the 2018 elections.</p><p> Concern about</p><p> the FCC plan</p><p> FCC Chairman Ajit Pai says his plan eliminates unnecessary regulation that stood in the way of connecting more Americans to the internet. Under his proposal, the Comcasts and AT&amp;Ts of the world will be free to block rival apps, slow down competing service or offer faster speeds to companies who pay up. They just have to post their policies online or tell the FCC.</p><p> The change also axes consumer protections, bars state laws that contradict the FCC's approach, and largely transfers oversight of internet service to another agency, the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p> After the FCC released its plan in November, well-known telecom and media analysts Craig Moffett and Michael Nathanson wrote in a note to investors that the FCC plan dismantles \"virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.\"</p><p> That could result in phone and cable companies forcing people to pay more to do what they want online. The technology community, meanwhile, fears that additional online tolls could hurt startups who can't afford to pay them \u2014 and, over the long term, diminish innovation.</p><p> \"We're a small company. We're about 40 people. We don't have the deep pockets of Google, Netflix, Amazon to just pay off ISPs to make sure consumers can access our service,\" said Andrew McCollum, CEO of streaming-TV service Philo.</p><p> Trust your internet service provider</p><p> Broadband providers pooh-pooh what they characterize as misinformation and irrational fears. \"I genuinely look forward to the weeks, months, years ahead when none of the fire and brimstone predictions comes to pass,\" said Jonathan Spalter, head of the trade group USTelecom, on a call with reporters Wednesday.</p><p> But some of these companies have suggested they could charge some internet services more to reach customers, saying it could allow for better delivery of new services like telemedicine. Comcast said Wednesday it has no plans for such agreements.</p><p> Cable and mobile providers have also been less scrupulous in the past. In 2007, for example, the Associated Press found Comcast was blocking or throttling some file-sharing. AT&amp;T blocked Skype and other internet calling services on the iPhone until 2009. They also aren't backing away from subtler forms of discrimination that favor their own services.</p><p> There's also a problem with the FCC's plan to leave most complaints about deceptive behavior and privacy to the FTC. A pending court case could leave the FTC without the legal authority to oversee most big broadband providers. That could leave both agencies hamstrung if broadband companies hurt their customers or competitors.</p><p> Critics like Democratic FTC commissioner Terrell McSweeny argue that the FTC won't be as effective in policing broadband companies as the FCC, which has expertise in the issue and has the ability to lay down hard-and-fast rules against certain practices.</p><p> Public outcry</p><p> Moffett and Nathanson, the analysts, said that they suspect the latest FCC rules to be short-lived. \"These changes will likely be so immensely unpopular that it would be shocking if they are allowed to stand for long,\" they wrote.</p><p> There have been hundreds of public protests against Pai's plan and more than 1 million calls to Congress through a pro-net neutrality coalition's site. Smaller tech websites such as Reddit, Kickstarter and Mozilla put dramatic overlays on their sites Tuesday in support of net neutrality. Twitter on Wednesday was promoting #NetNeutrality as a trending topic. Other big tech companies were more muted in their support.</p><p> Public-interest groups Free Press and Public Knowledge are already promising to go after Pai's rules in the courts. There may also be attempts to legislate net neutrality rules, which the telecom industry supports. Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, on Tuesday called for \"bipartisan legislation\" on net neutrality that would \"enshrine protections for consumers with the backing of law.\"</p><p> But that will be tough going. Democrats criticized previous Republican attempts at legislation during the Obama administration for gutting the FCC's enforcement abilities. Republicans would likely be interested in proposing even weaker legislation now, and Democrats are unlikely to support it if so.</p><p> Some Democrats prefer litigation and want to use Republican opposition to net neutrality as a campaign issue in 2018. \"Down the road Congress could act to put in place new rules, but with Republicans in charge of the House, Senate, and White House the likelihood of strong enforceable rules are small,\" Rep. Mike Doyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat, wrote on Reddit last week. \"Maybe after the 2018 elections, we will be in a stronger position to get that done.\"</p><p> A future FCC could also rewrite net-neutrality regulation to be tougher on the phone and cable industry. That could bring a whole new cycle of litigation by broadband companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKUT-6a44c4be55682d1b750ad253f6a0ddfe5a823f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C87D78E2008 NWBKUT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R60-T961-JBCN-43NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1002\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Daily Herald.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The proposal would not only roll back restrictions that keep broadband providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T from blocking or collecting tolls from services they don't like, it would bar states from imposing their own rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The broadband industry promises that the internet experience isn't going to change, but its companies have lobbied hard to overturn these rules. Protests have erupted online and in the streets as everyday Americans worry that cable and phone companies will be able to control what they see and do online.</p><p>That growing public movement suggests that the FCC vote won't be the end of the issue. Opponents of the move plan legal challenges, and some net-neutrality supporters hope to ride that wave of public opinion into the 2018 elections.</p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE FCC PLAN</p><p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai says his plan eliminates unnecessary regulation that stood in the way of connecting more Americans to the internet. Under his proposal, the Comcasts and AT&amp;Ts of the world will be free to block rival apps, slow down competing service or offer faster speeds to companies who pay up. They just have to post their policies online or tell the FCC.</p><p>The change also axes consumer protections, bars state laws that contradict the FCC's approach, and largely transfers oversight of internet service to another agency, the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>After the FCC released its plan in late November, well-known telecom and media analysts Craig Moffett and Michael Nathanson wrote in a note to investors that the FCC plan dismantles \"virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.\"</p><p>That could result in phone and cable companies forcing people to pay more to do what they want online. The technology community, meanwhile, fears that additional online tolls could hurt startups who can't afford to pay them -- and, over the long term, diminish innovation.</p><p>\"We're a small company. We're about 40 people. We don't have the deep pockets of Google, Netflix, Amazon to just pay off ISPs to make sure consumers can access our service,\" said Andrew McCollum, CEO of streaming-TV service Philo.</p><p>TRUST YOUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</p><p>Broadband providers pooh-pooh what they characterize as misinformation and irrational fears. \"I genuinely look forward to the weeks, months, years ahead when none of the fire and brimstone predictions comes to pass,\" said Jonathan Spalter, head of the trade group USTelecom, on a call with reporters Wednesday.</p><p>But some of these companies have suggested they could charge some internet services more to reach customers, saying it could allow for better delivery of new services like telemedicine. Comcast said Wednesday it has no plans for such agreements.</p><p>Cable and mobile providers have also been less scrupulous in the past. In 2007, for example, the Associated Press found Comcast was blocking or throttling some file-sharing. AT&amp;T blocked Skype and other internet calling services on the iPhone until 2009. They also aren't backing away from subtler forms of discrimination that favor their own services.</p><p>There's also a problem with the FCC's plan to leave most complaints about deceptive behavior and privacy to the FTC. A pending court case could leave the FTC without the legal authority to oversee most big broadband providers. That could leave both agencies hamstrung if broadband companies hurt their customers or competitors.</p><p>Critics like Democratic FTC commissioner Terrell McSweeny argue that the FTC won't be as effective in policing broadband companies as the FCC, which has expertise in the issue and has the ability to lay down hard-and-fast rules against certain practices.</p><p>PUBLIC OUTCRY</p><p>Moffett and Nathanson, the analysts, said that they suspect the latest FCC rules to be short-lived. \"These changes will likely be so immensely unpopular that it would be shocking if they are allowed to stand for long,\" they wrote.</p><p>There have been hundreds of public protests against Pai's plan and more than 1 million calls to Congress through a pro-net neutrality coalition's site. Smaller tech websites such as Reddit, Kickstarter and Mozilla put dramatic overlays on their sites Tuesday in support of net neutrality. Twitter on Wednesday was promoting (hash)NetNeutrality as a trending topic. Other big tech companies were more muted in their support.</p><p>Public-interest groups Free Press and Public Knowledge are already promising to go after Pai's rules in the courts. There may also be attempts to legislate net neutrality rules, which the telecom industry supports. Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, on Tuesday called for \"bipartisan legislation\" on net neutrality that would \"enshrine protections for consumers with the backing of law.\"</p><p>But that will be tough going. Democrats criticized previous Republican attempts at legislation during the Obama administration for gutting the FCC's enforcement abilities. Republicans would likely be interested in proposing even weaker legislation now, and Democrats are unlikely to support it if so.</p><p>Some Democrats prefer litigation and want to use Republican opposition to net neutrality as a campaign issue in 2018. \"Down the road Congress could act to put in place new rules, but with Republicans in charge of the House, Senate, and White House the likelihood of strong enforceable rules are small,\" Rep. Mike Doyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat, wrote on Reddit last week. \"Maybe after the 2018 elections, we will be in a stronger position to get that done.\"</p><p>A future FCC could also rewrite net-neutrality regulation to be tougher on the phone and cable industry. That could bring a whole new cycle of litigation by broadband companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOWELL-31525118</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOWELLMMNG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R5T-V1T1-JCB3-40KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270099</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1002\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 MediaNews Group, Inc.

The proposal would not only roll back restrictions that keep broadband providers like Comcast, Verizonand AT&amp;T from blocking or collecting tolls from services they don't like, it would bar states from imposing their own rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The broadband industry promises that the internet experience isn't going to change, but its companies have lobbied hard to overturn these rules. Protests have erupted online and in the streets as everyday Americans worry that cable and phone companies will be able to control what they see and do online.</p><p>That growing public movement suggests that the FCC vote won't be the end of the issue. Opponents of the move plan legal challenges, and some net-neutrality supporters hope to ride that wave of public opinion into the 2018 elections.</p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE FCC PLAN</p><p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai says his plan eliminates unnecessary regulation that stood in the way of connecting more Americans to the internet. Under his proposal, the Comcasts and AT&amp;Ts of the world will be free to block rival apps, slow down competing service or offer faster speeds to companies who pay up. They just have to post their policies online or tell the FCC.</p><p>The change also axes consumer protections, bars state laws that contradict the FCC's approach, and largely transfers oversight of internet service to another agency, the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>After the FCC released its plan in late November, well-known telecom and media analysts Craig Moffett and Michael Nathanson wrote in a note to investors that the FCC plan dismantles \"virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.\"</p><p>That could result in phone and cable companies forcing people to pay more to do what they want online. The technology community, meanwhile, fears that additional online tolls could hurt startups who can't afford to pay them - and, over the long term, diminish innovation.</p><p>\"We're a small company. We're about 40 people. We don't have the deep pockets of Google, Netflix, Amazon to just pay off ISPs to make sure consumers can access our service,\" said Andrew McCollum, CEO of streaming-TV service Philo.</p><p>TRUST YOUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</p><p>Broadband providers pooh-pooh what they characterize as misinformation and irrational fears. \"I genuinely look forward to the weeks, months, years ahead when none of the fire and brimstone predictions comes to pass,\" said Jonathan Spalter, head of the trade group USTelecom, on a call with reporters Wednesday.</p><p>But some of these companies have suggested they could charge some internet services more to reach customers, saying it could allow for better delivery of new services like telemedicine. Comcast said Wednesday it has no plans for such agreements.</p><p>Cable and mobile providers have also been less scrupulous in the past. In 2007, for example, the Associated Press found Comcast was blocking or throttling some file-sharing. AT&amp;T blocked Skype and other internet calling services on the iPhone until 2009. They also aren't backing away from subtler forms of discrimination that favor their own services.</p><p>There's also a problem with the FCC's plan to leave most complaints about deceptive behavior and privacy to the FTC. A pending court case could leave the FTC without the legal authority to oversee most big broadband providers. That could leave both agencies hamstrung if broadband companies hurt their customers or competitors.</p><p>Critics like Democratic FTC commissioner Terrell McSweeny argue that the FTC won't be as effective in policing broadband companies as the FCC, which has expertise in the issue and has the ability to lay down hard-and-fast rules against certain practices.</p><p>PUBLIC OUTCRY</p><p>Moffett and Nathanson, the analysts, said that they suspect the latest FCC rules to be short-lived. \"These changes will likely be so immensely unpopular that it would be shocking if they are allowed to stand for long,\" they wrote.</p><p>There have been hundreds of public protests against Pai's plan and more than 1 million calls to Congress through a pro-net neutrality coalition's site. Smaller tech websites such as Reddit, Kickstarter and Mozilla put dramatic overlays on their sites Tuesday in support of net neutrality. Twitter on Wednesday was promoting #NetNeutrality as a trending topic. Other big tech companies were more muted in their support.</p><p>Public-interest groups Free Press and Public Knowledge are already promising to go after Pai's rules in the courts. There may also be attempts to legislate net neutrality rules, which the telecom industry supports. Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, on Tuesday called for \"bipartisan legislation\" on net neutrality that would \"enshrine protections for consumers with the backing of law.\"</p><p>But that will be tough going. Democrats criticized previous Republican attempts at legislation during the Obama administration for gutting the FCC's enforcement abilities. Republicans would likely be interested in proposing even weaker legislation now, and Democrats are unlikely to support it if so.</p><p>Some Democrats prefer litigation and want to use Republican opposition to net neutrality as a campaign issue in 2018. \"Down the road Congress could act to put in place new rules, but with Republicans in charge of the House, Senate, and White House the likelihood of strong enforceable rules are small,\" Rep. <person><nameText>Mike Doyle, </nameText></person>a Pennsylvania Democrat, wrote on Reddit last week. \"Maybe after the 2018 elections, we will be in a stronger position to get that done.\"</p><p>A future FCC could also rewrite net-neutrality regulation to be tougher on the phone and cable industry. That could bring a whole new cycle of litigation by broadband companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The proposal would not only roll back restrictions that keep broadband providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T from blocking or collecting tolls from services they don't like, it would bar states from imposing their own rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The broadband industry promises that the internet experience isn't going to change, but its companies have lobbied hard to overturn these rules. Protests have erupted online and in the streets as everyday Americans worry that cable and phone companies will be able to control what they see and do online.</p><p>That growing public movement suggests that the FCC vote won't be the end of the issue. Opponents of the move plan legal challenges, and some net-neutrality supporters hope to ride that wave of public opinion into the 2018 elections.</p><p>CONCERN ABOUT THE FCC PLAN</p><p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai says his plan eliminates unnecessary regulation that stood in the way of connecting more Americans to the internet. Under his proposal, the Comcasts and AT&amp;Ts of the world will be free to block rival apps, slow down competing service or offer faster speeds to companies who pay up. They just have to post their policies online or tell the FCC.</p><p>The change also axes consumer protections, bars state laws that contradict the FCC's approach, and largely transfers oversight of internet service to another agency, the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>After the FCC released its plan in late November, well-known telecom and media analysts Craig Moffett and Michael Nathanson wrote in a note to investors that the FCC plan dismantles \"virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.\"</p><p>That could result in phone and cable companies forcing people to pay more to do what they want online. The technology community, meanwhile, fears that additional online tolls could hurt startups who can't afford to pay them - and, over the long term, diminish innovation.</p><p>\"We're a small company. We're about 40 people. We don't have the deep pockets of Google, Netflix, Amazon to just pay off ISPs to make sure consumers can access our service,\" said Andrew McCollum, CEO of streaming-TV service Philo.</p><p>TRUST YOUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER</p><p>Broadband providers pooh-pooh what they characterize as misinformation and irrational fears. \"I genuinely look forward to the weeks, months, years ahead when none of the fire and brimstone predictions comes to pass,\" said Jonathan Spalter, head of the trade group USTelecom, on a call with reporters Wednesday.</p><p>But some of these companies have suggested they could charge some internet services more to reach customers, saying it could allow for better delivery of new services like telemedicine. Comcast said Wednesday it has no plans for such agreements.</p><p>Cable and mobile providers have also been less scrupulous in the past. In 2007, for example, the Associated Press found Comcast was blocking or throttling some file-sharing. AT&amp;T blocked Skype and other internet calling services on the iPhone until 2009. They also aren't backing away from subtler forms of discrimination that favor their own services.</p><p>There's also a problem with the FCC's plan to leave most complaints about deceptive behavior and privacy to the FTC. A pending court case could leave the FTC without the legal authority to oversee most big broadband providers. That could leave both agencies hamstrung if broadband companies hurt their customers or competitors.</p><p>Critics like Democratic FTC commissioner Terrell McSweeny argue that the FTC won't be as effective in policing broadband companies as the FCC, which has expertise in the issue and has the ability to lay down hard-and-fast rules against certain practices.</p><p>PUBLIC OUTCRY</p><p>Moffett and Nathanson, the analysts, said that they suspect the latest FCC rules to be short-lived. \"These changes will likely be so immensely unpopular that it would be shocking if they are allowed to stand for long,\" they wrote.</p><p>There have been hundreds of public protests against Pai's plan and more than 1 million calls to Congress through a pro-net neutrality coalition's site. Smaller tech websites such as Reddit, Kickstarter and Mozilla put dramatic overlays on their sites Tuesday in support of net neutrality. Twitter on Wednesday was promoting #NetNeutrality as a trending topic. Other big tech companies were more muted in their support.</p><p>Public-interest groups Free Press and Public Knowledge are already promising to go after Pai's rules in the courts. There may also be attempts to legislate net neutrality rules, which the telecom industry supports. Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, on Tuesday called for \"bipartisan legislation\" on net neutrality that would \"enshrine protections for consumers with the backing of law.\"</p><p>But that will be tough going. Democrats criticized previous Republican attempts at legislation during the Obama administration for gutting the FCC's enforcement abilities. Republicans would likely be interested in proposing even weaker legislation now, and Democrats are unlikely to support it if so.</p><p>Some Democrats prefer litigation and want to use Republican opposition to net neutrality as a campaign issue in 2018. \"Down the road Congress could act to put in place new rules, but with Republicans in charge of the House, Senate, and White House the likelihood of strong enforceable rules are small,\" Rep. Mike Doyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat, wrote on Reddit last week. \"Maybe after the 2018 elections, we will be in a stronger position to get that done.\"</p><p>A future FCC could also rewrite net-neutrality regulation to be tougher on the phone and cable industry. That could bring a whole new cycle of litigation by broadband companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Introduction</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><anchor id=\"ref5b0035\"/>Technological innovations involving digital online platforms for the exchange of goods and services between peers has enabled the emergence of the so-called \"sharing economy\" (<link><marker>Belk, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0035\"/></link>), which is experiencing rapid growth as it is heads towards a forecast global economic value of USD335 billion by 2025 (<link><marker>Yaraghi and Ravi, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0380\"/></link>). While definitions vary, at its core the sharing economy involves accessing rather than owning resources, exchange facilitated by digital platforms, and a community-based dimension rooted in the formation of new social connections and shared purpose (<link><marker>Acquier et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link>). However, while sharing economy platforms have the potential to create new social connections and build communities, this does not necessarily mean that the exchange practices they facilitate will be accepted by all communities impacted by them. Increasing awareness of this point has led to calls for more academic research into the so-called \"dark side\" of the sharing economy (<link><marker>Breidbach and Brodie, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0045\"/></link>; <link><marker>Murillo et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0245\"/></link>) and the application of analytical frameworks to these emerging issues (<link><marker>Frenken and Schor, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0135\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0140\"/>To provide some examples, Airbnb has emerged as a key focal point for the concerns of local residents in Barcelona about overtourism (<link><marker>Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0140\"/></link>), including street protests in August 2017 (<link><marker>Independent, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0185\"/></link>). A month later in the UK, Transport for London declined to renew the regulatory licence of the ride-sharing platform Uber, citing \"a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications\" (<link><marker>Transport for London, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0340\"/></link>), including the reporting of serious criminal offences. In the same month, an Australian Senate committee raised concerns about pay rates and conditions for \"gig economy\" platforms where users bid for work (<link><marker>The Senate Education and Employment References Committee, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0325\"/></link>), including Sydney-based Airtasker, which has also faced union criticism for \"allowing minimum industry standards to be completely eroded\" (<link><marker>UnionsNSW, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0345\"/></link>, p. 7). More recently, Australia has witnessed disquiet around a very different example of the \"sharing economy\": dockless bike-share schemes, with concerns raised around bicycles being left in inappropriate locations. For example:<br/>\"I think it's been clear the operators are not cleaning up their act... We're not happy with what they're doing. Residents are not happy with what they're doing\".<br/>- John Wakefield, Mayor of Waverley Council (Sydney), March 2018 (<link><marker>ABC News, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0010\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0110\"/>In this article, we present a specific framework for analysing community acceptance of emerging practices such as those described above, social licence to operate (SLO), and evaluate its applicability to the sharing economy. Our choice of SLO as an analytical framework stems from a realisation that, while the use of online engagement platforms to access goods and services is relatively new, the issue of affected communities choosing to accept or reject emerging industry practices is not. Mining and forestry businesses have long had to contend with a diverse range of responses from local communities, and it is in these contexts that the SLO concept first emerged in the 1990s (<link><marker>Edwards et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0110\"/></link>; <link><marker>Franks et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0130\"/></link>; <link><marker>Prno and Slocombe, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link>). Over the past two decades, SLO has been applied to a diverse range of contexts and SLO frameworks have been developed that emphasise factors such as distributional fairness, procedural fairness, governance, adaptability and trust (<link><marker>Baumber, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link>; <link><marker>Dare et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link>; <link><marker>Hall et al., 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0155\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zhang et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0075\"/>There are at least two examples of the term \"social licence\" being applied to sharing economy activities in academic papers. <link><marker>Cohen and Kietzmann (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0075\"/></link> explore ways for ridesharing platforms to enhance social licence, while <link><marker>Stanford (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0315\"/></link> highlights the risk that \"gig work\" platforms like Uber and Airtasker could lose it. However, neither article attempts to define social licence or to draw on the history of academic research into the concept over the past two decades in mining, forestry and other sectors. Our objectives in this article are to engage with this history, to assess the applicability of the SLO concept to the sharing economy, to propose a framework for analysing SLO in the sharing economy, and to outline an agenda for future research.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Conceptualising the sharing economy</emphasis></h><p>The four examples of Airbnb, Uber, Airtasker and share-bikes provided in the introduction highlight the diverse range of practices and contexts to which the term \"sharing economy\" can be applied. We recognise that some readers may dispute that some or even all of these examples should be classified as sharing economy. However, given that our evaluation of the SLO concept may have implications for how the sharing economy is defined, we don't wish to pre-empt our results by adopting an overly restrictive definition of the sharing economy at this stage. Instead, we follow the approach of <link><marker>Acquier et al. (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link> in viewing the sharing economy as an umbrella term and a contested space.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref80005\"/>The challenge of defining and putting boundaries around the sharing economy has been highlighted not only by <link><marker>Acquier et al. (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link> but also in other recent reviews by <link><marker>Breidbach and Brodie (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0045\"/></link> and <link><marker>Frenken and Schor (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0135\"/></link>. <link><marker>Acquier et al. (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link> conceive of the sharing economy as three overlapping \"organising cores\", which they term the \"access economy\", \"platform economy\" and \"community-based economy\" (<link><marker>Fig. 1</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80005\"/></link>). These three foundations of the sharing economy broadly reflect the arguments of <link><marker>Belk (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0035\"/></link> that sharing implies temporary access to goods or services rather than ownership (i.e. access economy), that the emergence of new sharing practices has been driven by internet-based platforms (i.e. platform economy) and that the term \"sharing\" implies some sense of community rather than simply seeking to maximise economic value (i.e. community-based economy).<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference80005\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref80005\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000152600401625v146sCS0040162518311041mainassetsgr1SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000152600401625v146sCS0040162518311041mainassetsgr1LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 1 - Three organising cores of the sharing economy with areas of overlap.</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0085\"/>While <link><marker>Acquier et al. (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link> regard the intersection of the three organising cores to represent a \"sharing economy ideal\", they recognise that sharing economy language is often applied to examples that lie outside this overlap zone. Furthermore, the definitions they apply to each of the organising cores are themselves contested. For example, <link><marker>Acquier et al. (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link> require assets be \"underutilised\" to qualify as part of the access economy, a view which is shared by <link><marker>Frenken and Schor (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0135\"/></link> and <link><marker>Cusumano (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0085\"/></link>, but not by <link><marker>Breidbach and Brodie (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0045\"/></link>. Conversely, <link><marker>Acquier et al. (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link> diverge from <link><marker>Frenken and Schor (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0135\"/></link> by including skill-sharing alongside the sharing of resources under their model. For <link><marker>Frenken and Schor (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0135\"/></link>, the sharing economy is restricted to physical goods, with skill-sharing classed instead as \"on-demand\" or \"gig\" economy.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0055\"/>In relation to the platform economy core, <link><marker>Acquier et al. (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link> follow <link><marker>Cannon and Summers (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0055\"/></link> and <link><marker>Hamari et al. (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link> in requiring that exchanges be between \"peers\". Other authors use terms such as \"individuals\" (<link><marker>Cusumano, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0085\"/></link>) or \"interdependent economic actors\" (<link><marker>Breidbach and Brodie, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0045\"/></link>), which can have different connotations to \"peers\". This has implications for examples such as Sydney's bike-share schemes, which have employed sharing terminology (<link><marker>Fig. 2</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80010\"/></link>), but otherwise resemble more traditional hire services rather than \"peer-to-peer\" platforms. <link><marker>Belk (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0035\"/></link> classifies activities of this nature as \"pseudo-sharing\".<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference80010\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref80010\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000152600401625v146sCS0040162518311041mainassetsgr2SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000152600401625v146sCS0040162518311041mainassetsgr2LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 2 - Bike-sharing company slogan photographed in Sydney, Australia in March 2018.</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0040\"/>In relation to the \"community-based\" dimension of the sharing economy, <link><marker>Acquier et al. (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link> argue this requires a consideration of the types of interactions involved (i.e. non-contractual, non-hierarchical or non-monetized rather than traditional economic exchanges) as well as whether there is a shared purpose behind the exchange. The shared purpose may be to create social bonding or achieve a social mission, such as enhanced sustainability by using local or underutilised resources (<link><marker>Botsman and Rogers, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0040\"/></link>; <link><marker>Demailly and Novel, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0095\"/></link>; <link><marker>Heinrichs, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0175\"/></link>). Using shared purpose to define the community-based economy allows for money to change hands provided that the exchange is not solely about profit. This represents a kind of middle ground approach between that of <link><marker>Belk (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0035\"/></link>, who argues that \"true sharing\" must be free of profit motives and expectations of reciprocity, and <link><marker>Breidbach and Brodie (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0045\"/></link>, who regard monetary rewards for the sharing of resources to be one of the central tenets of the sharing economy.</p><p>For the purposes of this article, we take a broad view regarding which activities qualify as part of the access, platform and community-based economies. For the access economy, we include the sharing of skills (<link><marker>Acquier et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link>) rather than just physical resources (<link><marker>Frenken and Schor, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0135\"/></link>). For the platform economy, we allow for exchange between \"interdependent economic actors\" (<link><marker>Breidbach and Brodie, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0045\"/></link>) rather than strictly \"peers\" (<link><marker>Cannon and Summers, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0055\"/></link>; <link><marker>Hamari et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link>). In relation to the community-based economy, we allow for monetary exchange and profit-making within the sharing economy (<link><marker>Breidbach and Brodie, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0045\"/></link>) as long as there is some form of shared purpose motivating the exchange (<link><marker>Acquier et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0235\"/>In this article, we focus most closely on the community-based dimension of the sharing economy, as the SLO concept relates to \"the ongoing acceptance or approval of an operation by those local community stakeholders who are affected by it\" (<link><marker>Moffat et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0235\"/></link>). This requires careful consideration of who is part of an affected community and what makes them a community. In addition, the sharing economy presents an opportunity to expand and reconceptualise SLO due to the potential for digital, online platforms to create new types of community bonds based on shared interests rather than physical proximity (<link><marker>Acquier et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link>). As similar debates around \"communities of place\" versus \"communities of interest\" have also emerged in relation to the SLO concept (<link><marker>Dare et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link>; <link><marker>Ford and Williams, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0120\"/></link>), bringing these concepts together presents an opportunity to enhance our understanding of community around both the sharing economy and SLO. In the following section, we explore some of the issues that have emerged in attempting to define and conceptualise social licence to operate, before evaluating its relevance to the sharing economy.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. What is a \"social licence to operate\"?</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0080\"/>Social licence to operate (SLO) provides a way of both conceptualising and strategically building community acceptance or approval for new activities or practices that goes beyond the requirements of a formal regulatory process. Over the past two decades, it has been applied to a diverse range of land use activities, including mining (<link><marker>Cooney, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0080\"/></link>), forestry (<link><marker>Edwards et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0110\"/></link>), wind farms (<link><marker>Hall, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>), cotton farming (<link><marker>Roth, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0290\"/></link>), energy cropping (<link><marker>Baumber, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link>), the creation of protected areas (<link><marker>Voyer et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0355\"/></link>) and, to a more limited extent, to service industries such as finance (<link><marker>O'Brien et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0250\"/></link>) and education (<link><marker>Haynes, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0170\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0335\"/>While SLO definitions vary, they most frequently emphasise \"ongoing acceptance\" of a project or activity by a local community and other stakeholders (<link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>, p. 1779). At its core, social licence is based on an analogy with a regulatory licence. However, a social licence is distinguished from a regulatory licence by its informal and intangible nature, the fact that it is sourced from a local community rather than a government agency and the complex and uncertain processes by which it may be obtained, maintained, denied or lost (<link><marker>Joyce and Thomson, 2000</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0190\"/></link>; <link><marker>Moffat et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0235\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0125\"/>Notwithstanding the challenges in determining whether or not a social licence has been obtained for a particular activity, numerous researchers have pointed out the risks that can arise from failure to obtain one, or from losing one that was previously held. These risks can include increased operating costs for industry (<link><marker>Franks et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0130\"/></link>), increased regulatory restrictions on future developments (<link><marker>Hall et al., 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0155\"/></link>) and/or the closure of operations (<link><marker>Franks et al., 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0125\"/></link>). A loss of social licence does not automatically equate to a loss of regulatory approval, but, as highlighted by the Uber and bike-sharing examples we referred to in the introduction, a lack of community acceptance can increase pressure on governments to restrict activities and affect the economic viability of a company's operations. Conversely, a strongly-held social licence may reduce transaction costs and protect a business from government attempts to restrict their operations.</p><p>In the present article, we will argue that the SLO concept could help to better understand the breadth and depth of acceptance of sharing economy platforms by particular communities or community groups. It could also shed light on the key determinants of community acceptance and the capacity of these platforms to withstand disturbances such as the community opposition encountered by Airbnb in Barcelona or bike-share operators in Sydney. In turn, the SLO concept, including its associated frameworks, variables and methodologies, may be enriched through application to new activities with different characteristics to the mining, forestry, agriculture and energy-related activities to which it has been most commonly applied to date.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. SLO frameworks</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.1. Characteristics of SLO</emphasis></h><p>While definitions vary, the key characteristics of the SLO concept are its intangible and informal nature, the analogy with a regulatory licence and the idea that is awarded or withheld by a \"community\" of some kind. <link><marker>Ford and Williams (2016)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0120\"/></link> also argue that SLO can be distinguished from the broader, overlapping concept of social acceptability by the use of the licence metaphor and a principal focus on relationships between businesses and local communities rather than on relationships with regulators or consumers.</p><p>Because of the analogy with a formal regulatory licence, the SLO concept can evoke ideas of a clear process that must be followed, a set of conditions that must be met and a degree of certainty that the social licence provides to an activity's proponents (<link><marker>Ford and Williams, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0120\"/></link>). However, <link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link> caution against attempts to define SLO as something permanent, arguing that SLO is \"dynamic and nonpermanent because beliefs, opinions, and perceptions are subject to change as new information is acquired\" (p. 1779). This highlights that social licence is not simply something that a proponent must obtain once, but is something that needs to be actively maintained over time.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0255\"/>Measuring and monitoring SLO can be challenging due to its intangible and informal nature, with some authors emphasising the difficultly or impossibility of such a task (<link><marker>Owen and Kemp, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0255\"/></link>; <link><marker>Parsons and Lacey, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0265\"/></link>). However, <link><marker>Moffat et al. (2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0235\"/></link>, p. 484) argue that, for the mining sector at least, \"drivers of SLO at the local operational level as well as at national and international scales can be systematically modeled and measured by conducting large-scale surveys of citizen attitudes\". For example, <link><marker>Zhang et al. (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link> use large-scale surveys in Australia, China and Chile to assign quantitative values to key SLO variables such as distributional fairness, procedural fairness, confidence in governance and trust.</p><p>Compared to <link><marker>Zhang et al. (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link> and <link><marker>Prno and Slocombe (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link> present a more qualitative approach to measuring SLO. They conducted semi-structured interviews with local stakeholders about their perceptions of whether a SLO exists for an Alaskan mine, concluding that \"arguably, a relatively strong and long-lasting SLO has been granted for the Red Dog Mine by a majority of individuals in the region\" (<link><marker>Prno and Slocombe, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link>, p. 681). <link><marker>Hall (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link> also discusses SLO in terms of \"majority\" acceptance, while others consider SLO to represent a \"consensus\" amongst stakeholders (e.g. <link><marker>Moffat et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0235\"/></link>; <link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>). At present, there is no clear consensus in the SLO literature around the thresholds for determining whether a SLO is held for a given activity.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.2. SLO variables, criteria and influencing factors</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref80015\"/>A number of frameworks for assessing, building and maintaining SLO have emerged from the different industries in which the concept has been applied. <link><marker>Fig. 3</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80015\"/></link> summarises the key factors identified as influencing SLO across six such frameworks from the mining, forestry, wind energy and bioenergy industries. The first five were identified as generalised frameworks for determining SLO in a literature review by <link><marker>Baumber (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link>, while the sixth framework is the result of Baumber's integration of key factors from the first five frameworks. The authors of the frameworks vary in how they describe the factors shown in <link><marker>Fig. 3</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80015\"/></link>, using terms such as \"variables\" (<link><marker>Baumber, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link>; <link><marker>Prno, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0280\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zhang et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link>), \"criteria\" (<link><marker>Hall, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>; <link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>) and \"influences\" (<link><marker>Dare et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link>). The use of \"variable\" implies a degree of quantitative measurement that is in fact present only in the article by <link><marker>Zhang et al. (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link>, who surveyed stakeholders on the extent to which they, for example, \"Trust the mining industry to act responsibly\" <link><marker>Zhang et al. (2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link>, p. 1067).<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference80015\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref80015\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000152600401625v146sCS0040162518311041mainassetsgr3SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000152600401625v146sCS0040162518311041mainassetsgr3LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 3 - Key influencing factors identified in existing SLO frameworks.</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p>Distributional fairness refers to fairness in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">outcomes</emphasis> of resource allocation, while procedural fairness refers to perceived justice in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">processes</emphasis> of decision-making by those carrying out a particular practice such as mining (<link><marker>Zhang et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link>). <link><marker>Baumber (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link> regards confidence in governance as a sub-component of procedural fairness while <link><marker>Zhang et al. (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link> separate it out into its own variable relating to a community's perceptions of whether government regulations covering approval and reporting processes, environmental assessment and public participation are adequate to hold industry to account.</p><p>Adaptability may be classed as a sub-component of other SLO factors, as companies may adapt the way they distribute costs and benefits or the way they conduct decision-making. However, <link><marker>Dare et al. (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link> and <link><marker>Baumber (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link> highlight the value of considering adaptability as a separate factor. For example, business operators may have distributional and procedural strategies that rate highly in terms of fairness at a particular point in time, but are unable to respond quickly to changing community attitudes due to structural inflexibility or poor information flows. <link><marker>Baumber (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link> describes adaptability as encompassing the flexibility, responsiveness and agility of those carrying out a particular practice, while <link><marker>Dare et al. (2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link>, p. 193) refer to the \"ability of organisations to respond to changing expectations\".</p><p>Trust appears as a key factor in each of the six frameworks in <link><marker>Fig. 3</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80015\"/></link> and occupies a central position in the frameworks of <link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link> and <link><marker>Zhang et al. (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link> in particular. In the context of mining, <link><marker>Zhang et al. (2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link>, p. 1064) define trust as \"the extent to which the general public is confident that the mining industry is adhering to a set of accepted principles\". They regard distributional fairness, procedural fairness and confidence in governance as factors that each contribute to trust-building. <link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link> consider that once \"full trust\" is achieved, a community will support and protect an activity as their own, a state they refer to as \"psychological co-ownership\", the highest possible level of SLO. <link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link> regard credibility as the \"foundation of trust\" (p. 1785), with credibility built by keeping small promises early on in the community engagement process and responding to disturbances in a manner that shows a commitment to the affected community.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0195\"/>Legitimacy does not appear as a specific factor in <link><marker>Fig. 3</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80015\"/></link>, but is commonly discussed in SLO frameworks. <link><marker>Dare et al. (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link> equate the granting of a SLO with being \"deemed legitimate\". Similarly, <link><marker>Moffat et al. (2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0235\"/></link>, p. 479) equate social licence with \"legitimacy and social acceptance\". Of the six frameworks shown in <link><marker>Fig. 3</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80015\"/></link>, that of <link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link> is most heavily influenced by prior scholarship into legitimacy. They frame legitimacy as a starting point for SLO, arguing that an entity must first achieve legitimacy before it can achieve credibility and \"full trust\". Drawing on <link><marker>Knoke (1985)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0195\"/></link> and <link><marker>Suchman (1995)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0320\"/></link>, they define legitimacy as public acceptance of a \"right to exist\" that encompasses pragmatic legitimacy (based on shared interests and concerns), moral legitimacy (based on the following of accepted social norms) and cognitive legitimacy (based on whether a practice \"makes sense\" to the community). In contrast, Thomson and Boutilier regard credibility to be related to perceptions of honesty and the keeping of promises, and \"full trust\" to be related to a sense of co-ownership.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref72000\"/>While trust is a key factor in SLO, the value of the SLO concept also lies in its capacity to consider factors other than trust. SLO frameworks from the mining, forestry and energy sectors highlight that social licence is about more than just trust and can also be influenced by the distribution of benefits (<link><marker>Hall, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>), perceived fairness of process (<link><marker>Prno, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0280\"/></link>) and a company's responsiveness to changing expectations (<link><marker>Dare et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link>). This has parallels in the sharing economy. For example, research into share-bikes in China by <link><marker>Liu and Yang (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference72000\"/></link> found that factors relating to user benefits and company processes (usefulness and ease of use) had a more direct impact on behavioural intent than trust, with users prepared to keep using sharebikes even when they \"do not believe that providers will keep their promises and commitments and have customers' best interests in mind\" (p. 11).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.3. SLO states and systems thinking</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0360\"/>Under the framework of <link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>, SLO can exist in a number of different states based on the strength with which it is held. The highest state, \"psychological co-ownership\", requires a threshold of \"full trust\" to be passed. This state is described by <link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link> as a dissolution of the \"us-them boundary\", with the company becoming an insider in the community social network and members of the community actively defending the company against criticisms from outsiders. The notion of multiple potential SLO states also features in the work of <link><marker>Prno and Slocombe (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link> and <link><marker>Baumber (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link>, who apply systems thinking to the SLO concept. Systems thinking involves consideration of multiple potential system states with differing degrees of stability and resilience (<link><marker>Walker et al., 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0360\"/></link>) and is based on the view that determinist and reductionist approaches are unable to fully explain the processes operating in complex social or ecological systems characterised by pervasive uncertainty, non-linear change, unpredictable disturbances, emergence and self-organisation (<link><marker>Holling et al., 1978</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0180\"/></link>; <link><marker>Meadows, 2008</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0225\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref80020\"/><link><marker>Prno and Slocombe (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link> combine the idea of SLO states with the systems thinking concept of resilience, with SLO resilience defined as the degree to which \"widespread community approval is maintained ... even amid crisis events and other stresses on the company-community relationship\" (<link><marker>Prno and Slocombe, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link>, p. 679). SLO resilience is represented in <link><marker>Fig. 4</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80020\"/></link> using the \"basins of attraction\" approach to modelling complex systems (<link><marker>Levin et al., 1998</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0210\"/></link>; <link><marker>Walker et al., 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0360\"/></link>), with each basin representing a different system state (e.g. SLO held or not held). The \"ball\" may represent an activity or an entity (e.g. proponent or company), as the SLO concept can be applied at the scale of an individual entity such as a mine (e.g. <link><marker>Prno, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0280\"/></link>) or to a broader activity such as mining (e.g. <link><marker>Zhang et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link>). A high level of SLO resilience may prevent a social licence being lost when disturbances to the system occur, such as environmental damage, job losses or political influence from outside the local community. However, resilience has limits and a social licence may be lost when a combination of low resilience and/or a large disturbance pushes the system past a threshold for change. The ball may also shift into an \"altered\" state whereby SLO is not lost but key characteristics of the state have changed (e.g. resilience has been lowered or a key threshold has shifted).<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference80020\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref80020\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000152600401625v146sCS0040162518311041mainassetsgr4SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000152600401625v146sCS0040162518311041mainassetsgr4LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 4 - Hypothetical shift in SLO in state for a given activity or entity in a given community.

Note that the ball can move in either direction.</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0020\"/>The application of systems thinking concepts such as resilience is still an emerging area of research into SLO. However, it offers the potential to generate new strategies for building SLO and in particular for maintaining it as circumstances change and disturbances to SLO are encountered. A range of general resilience factors that have been shown to enhance resilience in a variety of social, ecological and business contexts (<link><marker>Armitage, 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0020\"/></link>; <link><marker>Carpenter et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0060\"/></link>; <link><marker>Erol et al., 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link>), including:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Trust: an element of social capital that can help to overcome social dilemmas such as the incentive to cheat on agreements;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Diversity: particularly having a diversity of response options that can be drawn on when disturbances arise;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Reserves and buffers: redundant capacity that can be drawn on in times of need;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Modularity: the ability to break off parts of an enterprise when needed and to make localised decisions through self-organisation; and</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Monitoring: maintaining good flows of information about the state of the system with short time lags that reduce response times.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The potential interactions between these general resilience factors may have important implications for SLO. For example, while trust has been highlighted as a critical factor in multiple SLO frameworks that have emerged over the past decade, resilience studies highlight that trust is also an important enabler of self-organisation and that reserves of trust built up through repeated interactions can act as a critical buffer when disturbances arise (<link><marker>Carpenter et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0060\"/></link>). Thus, understanding SLO resilience may require measurement of not only current trust levels, but also of the size of trust reserves built up through past interactions and the strength of feedbacks between trust and self-organisation.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. Developing a SLO framework for the sharing economy</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.1. Relevance of the SLO concept to the sharing economy</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0205\"/>Despite the differences in context between the sharing economy and the types of land use activities to which SLO has predominantly been applied to date (e.g. mining, forestry, energy), many of the issues identified in SLO studies have parallels in the sharing economy. Trust, governance and fairness, all factors emphasised in SLO frameworks, have been highlighted by <link><marker>Frenken and Schor (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0135\"/></link> as critical considerations for sharing economy activities such as home-sharing and transport. Psychological ownership, which <link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link> consider to be the highest SLO state, has been identified amongst sharing economy stakeholders such as Airbnb hosts (<link><marker>Lee et al., 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0205\"/></link>). Community acceptance of sharing economy practices can also be tested by system disturbances, as shown by protests against rising housing costs in Barcelona (<link><marker>Independent, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0185\"/></link>). The link between loss of social licence and tighter government regulation explored in previous SLO research (e.g. <link><marker>Hall, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>) is also apparent in examples such as Sydney's share-bikes and Uber's 2017 loss of its regulatory licence in London (<link><marker>Transport for London, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0340\"/></link>).</p><p>While the SLO concept appears broadly applicable to the types of community impacts that are emerging around the sharing economy, a range of factors require further consideration for the development of a specific SLO framework for application to the sharing economy. Sections 5.2 to 5.5 consider contextual differences between extractive industries and the sharing economy, the identification of appropriate communities, the application of the licence metaphor and SLO states to the sharing economy, and the key factors for inclusion in a SLO framework for application to the sharing economy. Section 5.6 proposes our Sharing Economy SLO Framework.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.2. Differences in context</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0295\"/>The contexts in which sharing economy platforms have emerged, such as urban transport, short-stay accommodation and task-sourcing, differ considerably from the contexts in which SLO has primarily been considered to date. While sharing economy activities tend to be focused on urban areas where consumers, goods and services are concentrated (<link><marker>Schor, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0295\"/></link>), SLO has mostly been explored outside major cities where mining, forestry and other resource use activities occur. For example, in a search of recent academic papers relating to \"social licence\" (or \"social licence\") through the Web of Science database in July 2018, almost half of the top forty results related to mineral or fossil fuel extraction and almost all related to non-urban activities, including biodiversity conservation, energy conversion, agriculture and fisheries/aquaculture.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0200\"/>Differences in context between rural extractive industries and urban service industries are neither absolute nor insurmountable but may require refinements to the way SLO is applied and conceived of in relation to the sharing economy. Resource extraction, such as coal-seam gas, can affect urban as well as rural communities (<link><marker>Lacey and Lamont, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0200\"/></link>) and sharing economy services can extend to non-urban areas, such as rural homes let through Airbnb. Furthermore, the social licence concept has already begun to cross over from remote extractive industries into highly-urbanised service industries such as banking (<link><marker>O'Brien et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0250\"/></link>; <link><marker>Prime Minister of Australia, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0275\"/></link>), horse and greyhound racing (<link><marker>McHugh, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0220\"/></link>; <link><marker>Thompson et al., 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0330\"/></link>) and education (<link><marker>Haynes, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0170\"/></link>). <link><marker>Vargo and Lusch (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0350\"/></link> argue that all social and economic actors are in fact \"resource integrators\", which further removes the distinction between resource extraction and service provision.</p><p>Research has begun into social licence in the context of sharing economy practices such as ride-sharing, but currently lacks a clear framework that is informed by experiences with SLO in other sectors. <link><marker>Cohen and Kietzmann (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0075\"/></link> argue that ride-sharing platforms such as Uber could enhance their SLO by collaborating with local governments and seeking to optimise citizen and environmental goals. <link><marker>Stanford (2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0315\"/></link>, p. 397) implies that at least some digital platform businesses currently hold a social licence, but argues this could be vulnerable if \"the impacts of their labour practices become the focus for public attention and concern\", including avoiding payment of entitlements, evading standards around minimum wages and safety or unfairly passing business risks onto workers or \"contractors\". This highlights that SLO factors such as distributional fairness and procedural fairness have relevance to the sharing economy, but also raises questions about who should be included in sharing economy communities and how this may differ from notions of community around extractive industries in rural or remote areas.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.3. Notions of community</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0230\"/>Many SLO definitions emphasise that the concept is strongly linked to \"local\" communities. This local dimension was central to the thinking of Jim Cooney when he first applied the term to mining in 1997 (<link><marker>Cooney, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0080\"/></link>) and is highlighted in one of the earliest academic papers on SLO by Joyce and Thomson, who state that SLO \"must begin with, and be firmly grounded in, the social acceptance of the resource development by local communities\" (<link><marker>Joyce and Thomson, 2000</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0190\"/></link> p. 52). This local dimension has since been re-emphasised in a number of subsequent SLO definitions and frameworks (e.g. <link><marker>Moffat and Zhang, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0230\"/></link>; <link><marker>Prno and Slocombe, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link>; <link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>).</p><p>Some sharing economy platforms may have a local dimension to which SLO can be applied in a similar manner to mining or forestry. For example, certain sharing economy exchanges require physical proximity (e.g. between an Uber driver and a passenger needing a ride) and a common business strategy for activities such as bike-sharing is to locate resources in the densest part of each new city (<link><marker>Cohen and Kietzmann, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0075\"/></link>). In other cases, however, sharing economy platforms may connect service providers and consumers across broad geographic areas, such as tourists connected with holiday accommodation on the other side of the world or services such as web development that can be performed remotely. In such cases, membership of an affected community may be determined less by physical proximity to other members of the community than by one's level of engagement with the online platform or the level of impact felt by the exchanges that occur there.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0305\"/><link><marker>Acquier et al. (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link> argue that, in order to fully understand the community-based dimension of the sharing economy, the term \"community\" needs to be expanded from its traditional association with strong social ties operating at the local level to recognise communities of more weakly connected individuals with shared experiences and interests. People who use online platforms to offer or purchase services are the most obvious members of a sharing economy community (i.e. a community of users). A range of other actors within the service \"ecosystem\" may also qualify as community members, including the owners and employees of the platform, the media and policy-makers (<link><marker>Breidbach and Brodie, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0045\"/></link>), as well as those who are part of sub-economies or secondary markets that support major platforms (<link><marker>Sigala, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0305\"/></link>). However, the extent to which any of these actors self-identify as community members may depend on a variety of factors, such as their level of interaction, their loyalty to a particular platform and whether they view their involvement as transactional or part of a collective social mission (<link><marker>Acquier et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link>).</p><p>Apart from those who are directly connected to a sharing economy platform, the affected community may also include a range of people who are indirectly affected by the exchanges that take place. These indirect impacts include those felt by the local urban communities highlighted in the introduction to this article, including renters affected by increased housing costs (e.g. due to short-letting services such as Airbnb), commuters with an interest in the cost, reliability and safety of transport options (including ride-sharing services such as Uber), workers affected by an erosion of labour standards (e.g. due to task-sourcing services such as Airtasker) or residents affected by the negative aesthetics of share bikes left in inappropriate locations.</p><p>The potential for internet-based platforms to create sharing economy communities that are widely dispersed and weakly linked may at first appear to preclude the use of a concept like SLO, which is rooted in direct impacts on local communities. However, SLO researchers have over time expanded the concept by applying it to affected communities defined at different scales or in a non-spatial manner. For example, <link><marker>Zhang et al. (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link> examine the social licence of mining industries at the national rather than local scale and <link><marker>Ford and Williams (2016)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0120\"/></link> argue for SLO to consider both communities of place (delineated by location) and communities of interest (delineated by shared values). <link><marker>Dare et al. (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link> also consider communities of both place and interest and argue that SLO should be conceived of as multiple overlapping licences negotiated with these different communities.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0370\"/>Aside from the questions it raises around defining \"local\" communities, the sharing economy also has a tendency to blur \"the conventional boundary between the economy and everyday life\" (<link><marker>World Economic Forum, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0370\"/></link>), including the boundary between community members and consumers. This has implications for the application of SLO, which <link><marker>Ford and Williams (2016)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0120\"/></link> argue is typically focused on relationships between companies and local communities rather than on relationships with consumers. When SLO is applied to the mining sector, the focus is generally on people who live near mines (and may even work in them), but not usually on the people who buy or sell the outputs of mining (e.g. <link><marker>Moffat and Zhang, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0230\"/></link>; <link><marker>Prno and Slocombe, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link>). In contrast, for sharing economy platforms it is arguable that the community members most directly affected by a platform are those who use it to exchange goods and services.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0375\"/>Applying the SLO concept to the sharing economy may require a more expansive conceptualisation of community that not only goes beyond the local scale but also includes users and customers as community members. There are precedents for this in the academic literature, with <link><marker>O'Brien et al. (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0250\"/></link> explicitly considering bank customers as affected stakeholders when applying SLO to the finance sector and <link><marker>Haynes (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0170\"/></link> including students as affected stakeholders in relation to the SLO of education. However, it is crucial that any sharing economy SLO framework goes beyond consumer or market acceptance to consider other affected stakeholders. Drawing on the framework of <link><marker>W\u00fcstenhagen et al. (2007)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0375\"/></link>, in which social acceptance is divided into \"community\", \"market\" and \"socio-political\" acceptance, it is arguable that SLO in the sharing economy has a stronger overlap between the community and market dimensions than is typical for SLO examples in the mining, forestry or energy sectors.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.4. The licence metaphor and system states</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0240\"/>The emergence of the social licence metaphor within the mining, forestry and energy sectors is unsurprising given the widespread requirement for regulatory approvals to be obtained before such activities may commence. In these contexts, a social licence is often framed as something that is additional to a regulatory licence (<link><marker>Hall, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>; <link><marker>Morrison, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0240\"/></link>) and failure to obtain a social licence may result in a loss of regulatory approval (<link><marker>Franks et al., 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0125\"/></link>; <link><marker>Hall et al., 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0155\"/></link>). However, for many sharing economy activities (e.g. gig work, home-sharing), a regulatory licence may not be required and in other cases, operations may commence despite being illegal, such as with ride-sharing in Japan, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia (<link><marker>Watanabe et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0365\"/></link>). Affected stakeholders have pressured governments in some instances to impose greater regulations on emerging platforms, such as has been observed in Australia around Airtasker (<link><marker>The Senate Education and Employment References Committee, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0325\"/></link>; <link><marker>UnionsNSW, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0345\"/></link>) and dockless bike-share schemes (<link><marker>ABC News, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0010\"/></link>). However, in other cases, a groundswell of community support may lead to the creation of legal opportunities for previously illegal activities, such as in Singapore, where the government's legalisation of Uber's operations was at least partly a response to a finding that \"young people enjoy using services like Uber\" (<link><marker>Watanabe et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0365\"/></link> p. 40).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0105\"/>Where sharing economy practices commence in an unregulated manner, there is an opportunity to frame SLO as an alternative to a regulatory licence rather than something that complements it, with the potential to avoid unfavourable new regulations providing an incentive for sharing economy platforms to obtain a social licence. There is also scope to consider the SLO of entire industries or practices rather than specific businesses. This has already been done for SLO around mining and forestry (<link><marker>Edwards and Trafford, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0105\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zhang et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link>) and sharing economy SLO has the potential to be evaluated at the scale of a single company (e.g. Uber) or at the scale of practice or industry (e.g. ride-sharing more broadly). This presents an opportunity for cross-platform collaboration to obtain a social licence around emerging practices that heads off the introduction of unfavourable regulation.</p><p>The complex relationships between social licence and regulatory licence in the sharing economy have implications for the notion of SLO \"states\". In <link><marker>Fig. 4</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80020\"/></link>, an \"early\" system state was identified in which social licence was yet to be decided upon. This is likely to occur when a platform or activity is new and small-scale and has not yet attracted the attention of regulators or potentially-affected communities (<link><marker>Demailly and Novel, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0095\"/></link>). It is difficult for mining activities to go \"under the radar\" in the same way due to regulatory requirements for development approval that commonly require a degree of community consultation (<link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>). As such, a crucial component of any sharing economy SLO framework is the degree of visibility around a platform's activities and the amount of information that stakeholders have available to make decisions around SLO.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.5. SLO factors, criteria and variables</emphasis></h><p>A key question for the application of SLO to the sharing economy is whether the same factors that have been applied to SLO in mining and other sectors (e.g. trust, distributional fairness, procedural fairness, governance and adaptability) are also relevant in sharing economy contexts. There are clear examples where concerns have arisen around each of these factors in relation to the sharing economy. For example, returning to the four sharing economy examples cited in the introduction to this article (Airbnb, Uber, Airtasker and sharebikes), the following factors can be observed:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Trust:</emphasis> Community concerns have been raised in Australia about how bike-share companies use and sell user data (<link><marker>ABC News, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0005\"/></link>). Similarly, a lack of trust has been identified as a potential obstacle to the growth and long-term viability of share-bike companies in China (Liu and Yang, 2018).</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Distributional fairness</emphasis>: <link><marker>Guti\u00e9rrez et al. (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0140\"/></link> argue that the costs of increased tourism in Barcelona, including from Airbnb, have been disproportionately borne by local residents in the city centre. These include rising housing costs and overcrowding, with protesters targeted the perceived unfairness of these impacts in 2017.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Procedural fairness:</emphasis> The fairness and transparency of Uber's surge pricing mechanism has been questioned by researchers and local stakeholders (<link><marker>Chen et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0070\"/></link>). In particular, the \"opaqueness\" of the surge pricing mechanism was cited by <link><marker>Chen et al. (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0070\"/></link> as a factor that decreased community confidence in the fairness of Uber's processes.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Confidence in governance:</emphasis> A failure of governments to maintain appropriate regulations covering newly-emerging contractual arrangements (or lack thereof) for gig economy workers (e.g. Uber and Airtasker) has been cited as a concern in the US, Canada and Australia (<link><marker>Stanford, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0315\"/></link>). <link><marker>The Senate Education and Employment References Committee (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0325\"/></link> in Australia highlighted this perceived lack of confidence in governance by stating that \"to its critics, the gig economy is dangerously unregulated and creates fertile ground for exploitation\" (p. 85).</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Adaptability:</emphasis> Airtasker provides an example of responsiveness to changing expectations, specifically around the pay rates they recommend for specific tasks. In 2017, Airtasker responded to union criticism in Australia by making a deal on pay rates with local unions (<link><marker>The Senate Education and Employment References Committee, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0325\"/></link>). UnionsNSW secretary Mark Morey responded that \"others should follow Airtasker's example and consider the ethical dimension of their impact\" (<link><marker>SMH, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0310\"/></link>), highlighting the potential for social licence to be enhanced or maintained through quick responses to emerging controversies.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0270\"/>While each of the factors above have relevance to SLO in the sharing economy, it is not yet known which of these are most important in the sharing economy or whether other factors should be included in a sharing economy SLO framework. Furthermore, if SLO is conceived of as multiple overlapping licences negotiated with different stakeholder groups (<link><marker>Dare et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link>), it is possible that some factors may be more relevant for some groups than others. For example, building trust is a critical consideration for emerging sharing economy platforms, especially as users need to trust one another as well as the platform as an intermediary and cannot always rely on government regulations to protect them (<link><marker>Penz et al., 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0270\"/></link>). However, discussions of trust around the sharing economy typically focus on interactions between platforms and users, or \"consumer communities\" (<link><marker>Penz et al., 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0270\"/></link>). A key unknown is the extent to which trust created within these consumer communities impacts on the level of trust amongst non-users who may be affected by a platform's activities.</p><p>A final consideration before presenting our Sharing Economy SLO Framework is the extent to which the different SLO factors influence the initial obtaining of a SLO, relative to the ongoing maintenance of one. This requires a consideration of resilience factors within the framework. <link><marker>Baumber (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link> argues that adaptability and trust are the SLO factors most relevant to SLO maintenance and resilience. Several of the \"general resilience\" factors highlighted by <link><marker>Carpenter et al. (2012)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0060\"/></link> enhance adaptability, including response diversity (having a range of options available in a crisis), modularity/self-organisation (independence within different parts of an operation) and monitoring (enabling rapid responses to changing circumstances). Also, as highlighted by <link><marker>Carpenter et al. (2012)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0060\"/></link>, trust is a general resilience factor in itself (enabling system actors to overcome incentives to cheat one another), as well as having important interactions with other general resilience factors such as buffering (reserves of trust can be built up or denuded over time) and modularity (trust is an important enabler of self-organisation).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.6. Sharing economy SLO framework</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref80025\"/><link><marker>Fig. 5</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80025\"/></link> combines the various factors discussed in Sections 5.1 to 5.5 into an overarching framework for understanding SLO in relation to the sharing economy that can be applied by a variety of stakeholders, including sharing economy platforms, industry bodies, government and researchers. It is designed to be an adaptive framework that can be refined further through future research rather than a final product.<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference80025\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref80025\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000152600401625v146sCS0040162518311041mainassetsgr5SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000152600401625v146sCS0040162518311041mainassetsgr5LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 5 - Sharing economy SLO framework.</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p>The main body of the framework (i.e. the left-hand side) focuses on how SLO is gained, maintained or lost within a discrete community (e.g. of users, interest or place). It employs the analogy of a ball in a basin from <link><marker>Fig. 4</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80020\"/></link> to highlight that activities may exist in different SLO states separated by thresholds (note that the size and shape of the basins in <link><marker>Fig. 4</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80020\"/></link> are for illustrative purposes only and may vary in practice). Some factors may play a greater role in whether SLO is obtained initially, while others may play a greater role in whether it is maintained over the longer-term. The factors at the top of the list (distributional fairness, procedural fairness, governance and trust) have been identified in past SLO frameworks as influencing whether a SLO is likely to be obtained (<link><marker>Dare et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link>; <link><marker>Hall, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zhang et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link>). The factors towards the bottom (monitoring, response diversity, modularity and reserves/buffers) have been shown to enhance resilience across a range of socio-ecological systems (<link><marker>Armitage, 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0020\"/></link>; <link><marker>Carpenter et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0060\"/></link>; <link><marker>Erol et al., 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link>) and are thus most relevant where an established SLO is subject to potential disturbances. Adaptability, cited as a key SLO factor by <link><marker>Baumber (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link>, has not been included as a specific factor in <link><marker>Fig. 4</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80020\"/></link>, but is instead represented by the factors that influence it, such as response diversity, monitoring and modularity.</p><p>The framework's focus on both obtaining and maintaining a SLO represents a key point of difference with existing SLO frameworks such as those presented by <link><marker>Zhang et al. (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link> and <link><marker>Hall (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>, which do not differentiate between the factors involved in obtaining versus maintaining SLO. This is particularly relevant to the sharing economy, given the complex relationships between social licence and regulatory approval and the differing levels of visibility that sharing economy practices may have amongst different stakeholder groups. However, this aspect of the framework is also subject to much uncertainty, with the full list of factors and the level of influence that each has on gaining or maintaining a SLO to be refined through further research.</p><p>To provide an example of how the model might operate in practice, one might imagine a new sharing economy activity that emerges in a city. This activity would initially reside in the left-hand basin of the ball-in-basin model (\"SLO not held\"). Following scholars such as <link><marker>Zhang et al. (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link>, the model indicates that higher levels of distributional fairness, procedural fairness, confidence in governance and trust would increase the chances of the activity shifting into the \"SLO held\" state. However, once a practice resides in the \"SLO held\" state, the ongoing maintenance of this SLO may be threatened by unpredictable disturbances. The model suggests that, in these circumstances, general resilience factors such as monitoring quality, modularity, response diversity and the size of reserves/buffers are likely to play a greater role than they would in the initial obtaining of a SLO. For example, a business' response time following a disturbance may be reduced by effective monitoring of trust levels amongst key stakeholders and having a diversity of response options available (e.g. new algorithms for matching suppliers to consumers or alternative business models that extract revenue from different points in the supply chain). Modularity may enable business units that have lost trust to be shed and perceptions of fairness may be enhanced by allowing users of a sharing platform to self-organise by setting their own prices or rules. Reserves of goodwill, built up through repeated trustful interactions, may enable the sharing economy activity to \"ride out\" controversies for a longer period of time.</p><p>In the top right of the framework in <link><marker>Fig. 5</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80025\"/></link>, SLO is represented as a series of overlapping licences held with different communities. This draws on the work of <link><marker>Dare et al. (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link> and <link><marker>Ford and Williams (2016)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0120\"/></link> on SLO, as well as that of <link><marker>Acquier et al. (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link> on the nature of sharing economy communities. The framework indicates that multiple community-scale SLOs may combine to form a larger broad-based SLO covering multiple communities. An overarching SLO may cover a single sharing economy platform that affects a number of different communities (e.g. communities of users, interest or place). Alternatively, an overarching SLO may cover a broader practice such as ride-sharing, where the work of multiple businesses in gaining community-scale SLOs may combine to form a broader overarching SLO for the practice in question.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6. Research agenda for SLO and the sharing economy</emphasis></h><p>To operationalise and adapt the sharing economy SLO framework presented in Section 5.6, a number of research questions need to be answered through targeted case studies on the sharing economy in different contexts. This includes research into the key stakeholders involved in determining SLO in the sharing economy (Section 6.1), the potential benefits and risks of applying SLO to the sharing economy (Section 6.2), identifying key SLO factors and measurable SLO variables (Section 6.3) and developing strategies for building and maintaining SLO (Section 6.4).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6.1. Stakeholder analysis</emphasis></h><p>Sharing economy communities are made up of a diversity of stakeholders, including platforms operators, users (including providers and consumers), supporting service providers (e.g. secondary markets that support major platforms; <link><marker>Sigala, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0305\"/></link>), disrupted stakeholders (e.g. taxi drivers disrupted by Uber), regulators and local stakeholders affected by activities such as home-sharing or bike-sharing. Understanding SLO for each of these stakeholder groups and the role that each group plays in determining an \"overarching\" SLO requires social research to identify the different stakeholder groups, understand their relationships with sharing economy platforms and practices and assess the inter-relationships between these different groups.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0100\"/>Stakeholder analysis into the sharing economy has already been undertaken by a variety of researchers, offering a number of tools and frameworks that could be used to operationalise the Sharing Economy SLO Framework. <link><marker>Dreyer et al. (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0100\"/></link> used onsite observations and semi-structured interviews to inform their multi-stakeholder value mapping of sharing economy practices in South Africa. <link><marker>Breidbach and Brodie (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0045\"/></link> present a \"service ecosystem\" framework for identifying how different actors engage with sharing economy practices. <link><marker>Acquier et al. (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link> highlight that sharing economy platforms have the potential to re-shape what we commonly think of a community, requiring us to consider weakly-connected individuals linked by digital online platforms. Stakeholder analysis of this nature may also shed further light on what constitutes the \"community-based\" dimension of the sharing economy, with SLO potentially offering a means of defining community-based through community acceptance and shared interests (<link><marker>Dare et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link>), rather than whether practices are non-hierarchical or non-monetized (<link><marker>Acquier et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link>).</p><p>Given that the SLO concept is not primarily focused on consumer relations (<link><marker>Ford and Williams, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0120\"/></link>), any stakeholder analysis into sharing economy SLO needs to go beyond platform users, where much stakeholder analysis has focused to date (e.g. <link><marker>Dreyer et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0100\"/></link>; Liu and Yang 2018; <link><marker>Penz et al., 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0270\"/></link>), However, it is also important not to exclude platform users, as they are key component of the new communities being formed around sharing economy practices (<link><marker>Acquier et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link>). Furthermore, there is a high degree of overlap amongst sharing economy communities, whereby individual stakeholders may simultaneously be providers of goods or services, as well as consumers, members of disrupted industries (e.g. taxi drivers who also drive for Uber) and local residents affected by changing practices.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6.2. Potential benefits and risks of applying SLO to the sharing economy</emphasis></h><p>Stakeholder perspectives are likely to vary by stakeholder type, the nature of the practices involved and whether they are profit-driven or based on a community-based ethic. For platform operators, SLO may have the potential to act as an \"early warning\" system to help avoid losing an existing regulatory approval, having new regulations imposed on them or encountering additional costs associated with community conflict. Managing political, financial and reputational risks was a key motivation for the introduction of SLO in mining (<link><marker>Cooney, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0080\"/></link>) and the negative consequences of failing to obtain a SLO have been observed across a range of land use activities (<link><marker>Franks et al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0130\"/></link>; <link><marker>Hall et al., 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0155\"/></link>). The examples of Uber, Airbnb, Airtasker and dockless bike-share schemes that opened this article demonstrate that such risks are also present in relation to the sharing economy.</p><p>Using SLO as an early warning system could also have benefits for governments, in terms of knowing when regulation is required and when to step back from regulation. Key research questions around this include how social licence and regulatory licence interact around the sharing economy and how SLO could be measured effectively. As discussed in Section 5.4, the relationships between SLO and regulatory licensing are likely to be different in the sharing economy than in extractive industries, with further case study research required to better understand these relationships. SLO measurement is considered in the following section.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0215\"/>The application of the Sharing Economy SLO Framework may also enable strategies to be developed for gaining and maintaining SLO (discussed further in Section 6.4). This could have a clear benefit for platforms, as well as for government agencies wishing to guide emerging platforms and avoid potential conflict. For other affected stakeholders, this may result in greater consideration being given to the benefits and costs they face and opportunities to have a greater say in how sharing economy platforms develop, due to the SLO focus on distributional and procedural fairness. However, there is also a risk that the SLO concept could be co-opted by platforms looking for endorsement of their practices by researchers or government. Advocates of community-based sharing practices may see a benefit in recognising SLO and developing strategies to build it for practices they support, but not for profit-driven practices that clash with their values (<link><marker>Martin, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0215\"/></link>). Attempts to reframe SLO as a more permanent endorsement that provides security for ongoing operations have been observed in the mining sector and resisted by SLO researchers (<link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6.3. Identifying key SLO factors and measurable variables</emphasis></h><p>The Sharing Economy SLO Framework recognises factors identified in previous SLO frameworks (distributional fairness, procedural fairness, governance, trust and adaptability), but also expands these by adding factors from resilience studies, including buffering, response diversity, modularity and monitoring. SLO methodologies developed in mining and other sectors offer a starting point for measuring these factors in the sharing economy and potentially identifying new factors to add to the framework. These measurement approaches could include large-scale citizen surveys to quantify key variables (e.g. <link><marker>Zhang et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link>), as well as qualitative approaches using semi-structured interviews with key informants (e.g. <link><marker>Prno and Slocombe, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link>). Enterprise resilience studies offer a means of integrating resilience factors into these existing methods (<link><marker>Erol et al., 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0065\"/>Aside from existing SLO methodologies, the sharing economy presents opportunities to utilise different data sources to those commonly available in sectors such as mining, including media reporting on the sharing economy, sentiment analysis using social media and online forums, and utilising the vast amounts of data captured by sharing economy platforms themselves (e.g. user ratings and feedback). For example, <link><marker>Chang and Wang (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0065\"/></link> undertook sentiment analysis on online reviews from Airbnb and Home-Away to better understand how such reviews help to build trust in sharing economy platforms. Future case study analysis in the sharing economy could analyse how such data sources provide indicators for other SLO factors, such as distributional fairness, procedural fairness, governance and information flows, and may help to identify whether additional factors need to be added to the framework.</p><p>Drawing on systems thinking approaches to SLO (<link><marker>Baumber, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link>; <link><marker>Prno and Slocombe, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link>), the Sharing Economy SLO Framework also incorporates the concepts of non-linear change and thresholds for shifting between system states. As such, a key focus for measuring SLO variables is the identification of thresholds beyond which SLO may be gained or lost. This could include case study analysis of emerging platforms that gained or failed to gain a SLO and existing platforms that have lost their SLO. The most contentious threshold of all is likely to be the threshold of community acceptance beyond which a SLO can be said to be held. While SLO in the mining, forestry and energy sectors has sometimes been defined in terms of \"majority\" acceptance (e.g. <link><marker>Hall, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>; <link><marker>Prno and Slocombe, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link>), others consider it to represent a \"consensus\" amongst stakeholders (e.g. <link><marker>Moffat et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0235\"/></link>; <link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>). Determining such thresholds for the sharing economy is likely to require multi-stakeholder discourse based around case study analysis and identification and measurement of appropriate variables.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6.4. Strategies for obtaining and maintaining SLO</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref72005\"/>Analysis of previous SLO studies may offer practical assistance for building social licence in the sharing economy, including strategies around high-quality contact with stakeholders to enhance procedural fairness (<link><marker>Moffat and Zhang, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0230\"/></link>) and building trust by keeping small promises early and responding in the community's interest when disturbances occur (<link><marker>Thomson and Boutilier, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>). While trust-building strategies for the sharing economy have been explored by <link><marker>Penz et al. (2018)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0270\"/></link>, the Sharing Economy SLO Framework presents an opportunity to expand this research beyond \"consumer communities\" into other communities affected by sharing economy practices. Aside from SLO-specific studies, there is also the potential to incorporate legitimacy frameworks developed for new entrants in business settings more broadly into SLO strategies (<link><marker>Drori and Honig, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference72005\"/></link>; <link><marker>La\u00effi and Josserand, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference72010\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0145\"/>Future research questions around building and maintaining social licence in the sharing economy include how SLO strategies could be refined to incorporate factors that have been argued to enhance the \"community-based\" dimension of the sharing economy, such as shared social mission (<link><marker>Acquier et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link>), peer-to-peer exchange (<link><marker>Habibi et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0145\"/></link>) and sustainability objectives (<link><marker>Heinrichs, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0175\"/></link>). However, the roles of these factors in building SLO are uncertain and perverse outcomes are possible that can counteract the goals of platform developers, such as greater use of underutilised resources giving way to overconsumption (<link><marker>Parguel et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0260\"/></link>). As such, hypotheses could be developed to test each of these factors using the measurement methods outlined previously. These results could in turn help to inform future strategies for building and maintaining SLO in the sharing economy.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7. Conclusion</emphasis></h><p>While the sharing economy has grown to become a core component of many regional and national economies, it remains an evolving economic sector with a high level of heterogeneity and loosely defined boundaries. Alongside the many benefits that the sharing economy can bring are emerging negative impacts for some members of the communities affected by the formation of new service practices and relationships. Other sectors such as mining and forestry have also had to contend with negative impacts of new activities and, as such, provide a potential source of both conceptual frameworks and practical knowledge that may shed light on the \"dark side\" of the sharing economy.</p><p>In this article, we have demonstrated the applicability of the SLO concept to the sharing economy by analysing how SLO has been applied in other sectors, exploring recent examples of community conflict around the sharing economy, and proposing a Sharing Economy SLO Framework that can inform future research. While the purpose of this paper was not to produce detailed case study analysis of SLO in the sharing economy, we have identified opportunities where case study research could help to refine existing knowledge about both the sharing economy and the SLO concept.</p><p>This article has highlighted similarities as well as important differences between the sharing economy and sectors such as mining where SLO has been applied previously. In particular, the overlap between market acceptance and community acceptance may be greater in relation to the sharing economy and defining \"community\" may require a greater consideration of non-spatial factors such as online interactions and shared interests. The key factors determining SLO and the relationships between these factors may also differ from SLO frameworks developed in the mining, forestry and energy sectors. The central role of the internet and other information and communication technologies in the sharing economy also raises important questions around the meaning of \"local\" and creates opportunities to use new data sources in the measurement of SLO.</p><p>The SLO concept may require adaptation for use in the sharing economy context and SLO is not the only way to shed light on the \"dark side\" of the sharing economy. However, the knowledge gained from the application of SLO to multiple industries with a history of managing contentious impacts over the past two decades represents a valuable base on which to build. Through the bringing together of social licence and the sharing economy, opportunities exist for mutual learning to simultaneously enhance our understanding of the sharing economy and refine the SLO concept by conceiving of \"community\" in new ways, identifying factors that affect SLO in different contexts and developing new approaches to measure, build and maintain social licence.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: \u204e Corresponding author.</p></bodyText></contact><graphic/><bibliography><bodyText><p><anchor id=\"reference5b0005\"/><link><marker>ABC News, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref5b0005\"/></link>ABC News; Bike Share Schemes May Seem a Waste of Space But the Economics Makes Sense.ABC News, 2017. \"Bike share schemes may seem a waste of space but the economics makes sense\". <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-19/bike-share-schemes-economics-makes-sense-the-conversation/8957404\">http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-19/bike-share-schemes-economics-makes-sense-the-conversation/8957404</url>.

I am not at all surprised, guns. Thank you very, very much for joining us, out of this world. And speaking of out of this world, Bob just back from 60 days in space, will be my special guest tomorrow. Here comes The Five now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Juan Williams, Lawrence Jones, Pete Hegseth, and Emily Compagno. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. The Second Amendment is taking center stage in the battle for the White House, President Trump in the key swing state of Ohio today where he launched a scathing attack against Joe Biden.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It comes on the heels of New York's attorney general filing a lawsuit to dissolve The National Rifle Association for alleged financial impropriety, President Trump accusing the former vice president of embracing a radical left-wing agenda against gun ownership. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He is following the radical left agenda. Take away your guns. Destroy your Second Amendment. No religion, no anything. Hurt the Bible. Hurt God. He is against God. He is against guns. He is against energy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Biden adding some fuel to the fire by supporting an assault weapons ban, and President Trump claiming on Twitter, quote, \"If Biden becomes president, your great Second Amendment doesn't stand a chance.\" All right, the Second Amendment issues, Pete, when they start to take front and center, people -- their ears perk up.</p><p>And I heard from some Democrats in Pennsylvania today that think that the New York action was actually going to backfire or Democrats because it will make people remember that the Second Amendment is on the line. What do you think?</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS HOST: It might. And it looks like a targeting of a very effective political advocacy group in the NRA. But here's the thing. I have got a guy who I buy guns from in New Jersey. And his common refrain is Barack Obama is the best gun salesman America ever had because of his threats to reduce the Second Amendment.</p><p>He said he has never seen people, first time gun owners, come out to buy personal protective firearms than he has in the last couple of months. You can't find a firearm. It's because when you have the COVID situation, when you have lawlessness in our streets, individual citizens, left, center, or right, realize ultimately if you want to protect your First Amendment, life and liberty.</p><p>You ultimately need the ability to defend yourself. And so President Trump, yes, we are in a COVID moment. Yes, the economy matters. But he understands cultural issues are king as well. God, guns, Texas gold, energy, you know, religious liberty, the ability to defend yourself, and whether or not we will allow industry to thrive is a front and center kitchen table issue for a lot of people.</p><p>And the Second Amendment, if you want to have a debate about it, Joe Biden wants to take it away. Donald Trump wants to preserve it. That's one that he believes and a lot of people believe is a winner for him.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, tell me a little bit about this lawsuit and what they are alleging in terms of financial improprieties at the NRA and suggesting that it should be dissolved?</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Right. And also, an answer to your question to Pete, Dana, a lot of it has to do with timing. Now, the New York attorney general is alleging financial impropriety, essentially that, for the last three years. The corporate leadership at the NRA has been diverting funds for personal use. She called it brazen illegality. So the question remains, why now?</p><p>Why this timing? And it seems pretty obvious that it's for strategy in an election year given their investigation has gone back years. But I do note in addition to what Pete said that it's sort of questionable strategy. Joe Biden was already leading in the polls without this being a front and center issue. And this just seeks to disturb the moderates and sort of more right Democrats comfort level with Joe Biden.</p><p>I have to point out to you. Recall on March 10th when Joe Biden was touring a Fiat-Chrysler plant, and a worker approached him and said on camera, you are actively trying to end our Second Amendment rights and take away our guns, to which Biden replied you are full of explicative. I did not, no, no, shush, shush. I'm not trying to take away your Second Amendment. I support it.</p><p>But his messaging now, where he calls to memory for American people how he, quote, \"took on the NRA\" and its policies about mandatory buybacks and registration and smart gun ownership, certainly beg to differ, and the NRA does not support those policies.</p><p>PERINO: Juan, I also noticed that the president today suggested that Joe Biden is not religious. That he wants -- he doesn't believe in the Bible. And the Biden's themselves -- you know them, I want to give you a chance to talk about this. But the Biden campaign putting out a statement today, we have shortened it a bit, but let me read most of that to you if they could put that on the screen for me I would appreciate it.</p><p>Because he basically said Joe -- this is Andrew Bates, he is the spokesperson. Joe Biden's faith is at the core of who he is. He's lived with it with dignity his entire life, and it's been a source of strength and comfort in times of extreme hardship. Donald Trump is the only president in our history to have teargassed peaceful Americans and thrown a priest out of his church just so he could profane it and a Bible for own cynical optics as he sought to tear our nation apart at a moment of crisis and pain. Let me get your reaction to that.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: You know, Dana, it's just so disappointing to me because Joe Biden really is a catholic. He is a regular worshiping catholic. And he has gone through some terrible times in his life. I think everybody knows about the loss of his son, but he lost his first wife. I mean -- and Joe Biden has regularly said that his faith in God sustained him through these very difficult, dark episodes in his life.</p><p>This is not, like, somebody who just recently said I have come to Jesus. And this is not someone who is using it as a political tool. This has been his consistent personality all the time that he has been in politics. So I just find it so harmful and disappointing. But I note to you, Dana that earlier today, Vice President Pence was out there.</p><p>He was going after Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, saying that John Roberts, the conservative Chief Justice has been a disappointment to evangelicals. And here on Fox today, there was a Trump campaign spokesperson saying Michelle Obama is complaining that the Coronavirus and the difficult economic times have her down. Maybe she should go to church.</p><p>And I have got to think to myself, wait a second. So the Trump campaign now, they're not only saying let's talk about culture wars issues. Drag in guns. And Joe Biden is not for taking anybody's Second Amendment rights away. He is about assault weapons, and I think it's clear.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Seventy percent of Americans agree with him. I'm just saying, Pete, 70 percent of Americans agree. That's not a radical position. And it's the same thing if you stop and think about something like the border wall he wants to drag in. Most Americans don't support that, but they are dragging in everything so they don't have to talk about the president's failure to deal with Coronavirus.</p><p>PERINO: Lawrence, you have been out and about. You have a chance to go -- much more than I have. I haven't really even left my porch here. But I wonder what you think about these issues. You know, when you start to talk about the cultural issues, how do you think that those play into the 2020 election in the middle of Coronavirus, the pandemic, and racial strife?</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think it's a combination of culture and policy. And I think the difficult part that the Biden campaign is going to have is a lot of these attacks, for example, immigration. He wants to support some of these policy positions. For example, when you talk about the border wall or border fencing, he supported that.</p><p>He was also against employers hiring illegals. He was also against sanctuary cities. And so the Biden campaign is going to have to figure out how they are going to pivot against Donald Trump if they are on a debate stage and he tries to call him out. And Trump says, well, you supported that, too. Or if they decide to have an oppo research team run ads about that.</p><p>Now, to pivot to what's happening in New York, and why I think that's a bad strategy, is whenever there is a case that the state brings, there has to be a victim. And if the allegations were true about the NRA's leadership, then the victim would be the 5 million members of the NRA. And so they didn't come out and say, you know what?</p><p>Let's protect those members, because those funds that they were sending every month for them to fight for their Second Amendment rights. We want to fight for those people. They decided to not only to go after the leadership, which they say allegedly mismanaged funds. But they also said you know what, we want to disband the entire organization.</p><p>And so they overplayed their hand. They had a little bit of strategy. They would have just targeted the leadership.</p><p>PERINO: It's a very interesting point, no doubt. We're going to be talking a lot about it going forward. Meantime, the Trump campaign firing back at big tech after a video of the president is taken down, that and a lot more, next.</p><p>WILLIAMS: The Trump campaign accusing giant tech companies of, quote, \"flagrant bias.\" This comes after Facebook and Twitter removed a video of the president discussing COVID-19 and schools. The company's pulling the video for being in violation of policies on sharing Coronavirus misinformation. The president had said that children were, quote, \"almost immune from the virus,\" end quote, campaign advisor Lara Trump with more reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARA TRUMP, TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER: I understand he used the word immune. But I think people understand that his whole point was that kids are highly unaffected by the Coronavirus. And anybody can see that. That is the whole point of what he was saying. And it's just a shame that we have people that are willing to leave up talking points from communist China and their misinformation on the Coronavirus. But they are going to take down this president's tweet and the tweet from our campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Pete, I just thought I would ask you. You know, you have Facebook and Twitter, in this case, coming to the same conclusion, that this was misinformation. Does the fact that both companies reached the same conclusion persuade you that what they did was right?</p><p>HEGSETH: Of course not. No, although I am more disappointed in Facebook, because Twitter is a left-wing echo chamber. They know their audience overwhelming in left of center. So they are willing to do this willy-nilly. Mark Zuckerberg was on Capitol Hill very recently, saying I don't want to be the arbiter of truth. And if you are on Facebook and on Instagram owned by Facebook, you know there has been more wide latitude for this.</p><p>Juan, I will Venmo you any amount of Bitcoin you want if you can name me a left-winger who has been banned by Facebook or Twitter or suspended or suppressed. They don't exist. This is a one way street. And to suppress the speech of, you know, where he made those comments on Fox and Friends, our program on Wednesday, the president of the United States who is charged with setting some level of standards for when kids go back to school opined about his perspective.</p><p>Which is kids are less vulnerable, to shut that down is to shut down one side of the conversation, and you see it time and time again. So I'm tired of this kind of suppression. And you know precisely where it's coming from. And shame on Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But Pete, the president said that children were immune.</p><p>HEGSETH: I mean, it was explained just fine. Children are not affected the same way vulnerable adults are by this virus. Sending them to school does not make them susceptible. You want to talk about teachers. You want to talk about the elderly. You want to talk about pre-existing conditions, fine. That's the point the president is making.</p><p>As always, the left will take him literally when they should take him figuratively and vice versa. So I don't get caught up on that. It's not about the statement. It's about the suppression of speech of the president.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK. So Dana, I know you've interviewed Mark Zuckerberg. And he has made the free speech argument to you in the past. I'm wondering now the policies seems to be that they allow politicians and even, you know, candidates running for political office to tell lies but not political action groups. And today, what we saw was a pro-Trump political action group having their video pulled.</p><p>Because they were -- it said that they used deceptive videos, in this case deceptive videos of President Obama, apparently, you know, saying critical things about Joe Biden. Where do you come out on this?</p><p>PERINO: Well, again, I'm not a spokesperson for Facebook. But I have interviewed the company. And I have tried to understand their positioning. And I think that, you know, they have tried to draw these bright lines. And I think they walk right up to the line. Sometimes, they walk on the line. Sometimes, things go over the line and they have to make decisions.</p><p>I think that when it comes to this thing with the pac being basically banned from doing ads on Facebook for the next ninety days, they use their third-party fact checkers who apparently said this is a repeat violator. And under their rules in their company, which is a private company, these are the rules. If you do this X amount of times, you are going to be kicked off for 90 days.</p><p>That's what happened to the super pac. They separate and do a distinction between a political action committee and a politician. Then, to Pete's point, they separate something that a politician has said that is political speech, versus something that is scientific and has to do with health information during a pandemic. So, they're drawing lots of lines.</p><p>They -- I think they try to make it neat, but it sure feels messy. And they're going to get a lot of heat for it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So, Emily, going to Dana's point, these are private companies. So they can make the decisions. They make the rules for themselves. I mean, we don't have anything to say about it as Americans. So, I'm wondering if you think there should be some regulation, some law about allowing lies, just falsehoods onto social media.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, certainly there is a big push to increase regulations about their terms and conditions. Now, Dana's distinctions are absolutely correct. And what's interesting about it is the fact that, as she pointed out, Facebook and Twitter are sort of toeing the line of their own, again, terms and conditions. So what remedy would the super pac have? Well, they would challenge it in court.</p><p>And that takes up time. So, no matter what, Twitter and Facebook have the benefit of this. They have the greater hand right now, because their 90-day blackout is in effect until and unless a court over-changes it or overturns it, I mean. And so, I think it would behove the Trump campaign to have another super pac put up whatever they want and let's go through that same cycle.</p><p>I have to point out, you know, Pete mentioned he is tired. Absolutely, we're all exhausted by this cycle of hypocrisy. The Washington Post headline, not from Facebook or Twitter, said white children seem to be half as affected as adults from the Coronavirus, study says. And Time Magazine said white children are not as affected. I mean, they have all said essentially the same thing.</p><p>Now, yes, the terminology was, quote, \"almost immune.\" But it's the same spirit. And my final point is that no matter what President Trump says or what platform he uses, he is the sun around which the media planets orbit. So, he can say whatever he wants, wherever he wants, and it will still make news.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Lawrence, earlier this week, Facebook refused, refused to remove a video. It was a manipulated video that made Nancy Pelosi look like she was drunk and slurring her speech, two million people saw this. Twitter and YouTube, they took it down. Facebook didn't. What do you say?</p><p>JONES: Yeah, I think it's a slippery slope. And I think my biggest issue when it comes to these companies. For example, Twitter, their mission statement is to allow people to be on a platform to share their ideas and information without barriers. Yet, they continue to put barriers for people to share their content. And so I think when it comes down to the demise of Twitter, what we are going to eventually see is that they put all these road blocks from people not to equally be able to share their ideas.</p><p>Now, it's true that it's a private company. And what we are starting to see is that there is more competition out there in the marketplace. A lot of conservatives are starting to leave. But again, I think they have got to go back to their mission statement. And right now, they are not doing that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK, Lawrence thanks. Coming up, two big cities taking major steps to crack down on COVID-19, but are they overreaching? We have got that story for you next for you on The Five.</p><p>JONES: COVID crackdowns in America's two biggest cities, New York City setting up checkpoints to monitor people coming from the state's quarantine list. Mayor Bill De Blasio defending the move, demanding travelers to quarantine for 14 days or face up to $10,000 in fines.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), NEW YORK CITY: People have to start seeing that if they don't follow, there will be penalties. So we can stay in touch with people. And I think most people just if they're reminded and they stay in touch, they do follow the rules. Really, most people do. But for those who don't, we are going to have to start showing the consequences.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: And Los Angeles is cracking down on big house parties by threatening to shut off water and power to the homes of the offenders. Pete, is this the government abusing their power?</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes. And, of course, it's completely arbitrary. You know, if you flew into LAX or LaGuardia, New York, went up to one of those checkpoints. They asked you where you are going, and you said I'm just here for a Black Lives Matter protest. I'm sure they would let you right through. The entire -- he hasn't controlled crime. He hasn't stopped riots.</p><p>He hasn't protected businesses and citizens. He runs a sanctuary city. The bail reform laws are insane. He has got taxpayers, the wealthy in New York leaving. He is trying to beg them back into the city because, you know, as much as he hates the ultra-wealthy, they are also his taxpayers. It's like a cartoon of a liberal mayor.</p><p>And now, he wants to stop people coming from out of state and text them and call them and find out where they are. Otherwise, you pay a fine. It would be the quickest fine I have ever paid with a creative note in the memo line to Mr. De Blasio. You aren't going to find out where I'm going, and what a misplace of priorities.</p><p>JONES: And Dana, in the same breath, you have the governor that is begging people, literally begging them to come back to the state. Meanwhile, it's reported that maybe a third of the businesses won't return to New York City. And the shootings are up 177 percent. And they haven't did anything to resolve that. So how can he beg people to come back, especially the rich?</p><p>PERINO: Well, look, I -- New York City is an amazing place. And we love that city. America loves that city. It's the best city in the world. And I would love to see it come back. But that means that the government is going to have to do its role, which is protecting the security of people, and also figuring out a way to help the restaurants, especially, and the other small businesses be able to stay.</p><p>They have wildly expensive leases that they have to pay that they are not able to pay right now because the government won't let them work. So they have to realize that there is a two-way street here. People do want to come back but it has to be safe and there has to be a good reason for them to come back. As to the checkpoints, it is pretty, pretty serious that New Yorkers were able to basically leave the state and the city and go anywhere they wanted in the beginning of the pandemic.</p><p>And you can actually trace to see that when New Yorkers left you can see where hotspots picked up all around the country. And so now, the governor who wanted to sue Rhode Island -- remember, he said he was going to take the governor of Rhode Island to court because she said New Yorkers couldn't be there. Now, he is saying other people can't come in. Now, I'm for keeping everybody safe.</p><p>I want caseloads to go down. It's just like there is -- you know, government comes with a healthy dose of hypocrisy, Lawrence.</p><p>JONES: Yeah. Juan, it seems like New York City and New York in general is beating their chest right now, saying that we got it all right when we have the most death in the country. But also, there was a recent development this week. The commissioner of health for New York City resigned. And one of the reasons why she said she's resigned is because the mayor -- the way he handled this pandemic. What do you think about that?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, again, I don't know the details of it. I saw that she had resigned. She sounds like she felt that she wasn't at the table. That he wasn't relying on her expertise. But I will say this in general --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JONES: She's the commissioner.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right. It sounds to me like the shoe is on the other foot right now. I remember when the pandemic, the virus was raging in New York that you had a Trump ally in Florida. The governor there, Rick DeSantis, absolutely restrict New Yorkers from flying into Florida. He put up checkpoints, if you will recall. Can't come if you are a New Yorker or from any f those north-eastern states.</p><p>Well, he only rescinded that today, today. So all these months later, and now the virus is raging in the south, in the southwest. And guess what, the New York Governor says we don't want our people to go through holy hell again with the virus.</p><p>HEGSETH: But his state isn't burning, Juan. He doesn't have streets of reckless wanton violence where businesses are being smashed.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What? Nobody -- there's no -- there is no --</p><p>HEGSETH: Look at the misplaced priorities of De Blasio. He can control his own streets.</p><p>WILLIAMS: This is such -- oh, stop. Yes, and DeSantis can control beaches? Look, this is such a farce. There's nobody who says that New York streets are all filled with anarchy and chaos. This is specific about moments and, as Lawrence can tell you, of homicides, a climbing number of homicides in poor neighborhoods, but the Trump campaign wants to put this out as fearmongering.</p><p>JONES: Well, so to correct that Emily, it's not just crime that is up, also my reports have featured that people are actually shooting up drugs in the city now. You can go to Times Square and you can see cops everywhere in the city and many people are starting to, based on my reporting, they say it's starting to look like the 80s.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's exactly right, Lawrence. And here in Seattle, I saw that well before the epidemic, which now just makes this city continued to serve as a magnet and pull factors for people who are abused drugs or homeless etcetera.</p><p>I have to point out that this checkpoint thing, it just calls to mind the beginning of the lockdown when there was a lot of checkpoints employed by certain states like North Carolina and Florida. And at those checkpoints, they would test for fevers and they would establish residency before letting people pass.</p><p>And the flurry of lawsuits that cropped up after that alleged both constitutional right infringement, which we know that test in this public health latitude that state and local leadership have is whether it's the least restrictive method of achieving that legitimate goal of public health safety, right.</p><p>But it also alleged discrimination, and many of those who are successful at the moment including the pragmatic arguments like, well, you are unduly exposing this law enforcement to the virus potentially, right. And even first nation in certain tribal lands that we're establishing checkpoints going through whether the burden essentially is outweighed by the benefits. So here, there's a lot to answer for, and I don't think it passes that legal muster.</p><p>JONES: Excellent analysis, Emily. Coming up, Portland's police chief calling out rioters after even more anarchy. We'll show you next on THE FIVE.</p><p>HEGSETH: Thunderstruck, well played. After almost 70 days of unrest in Portland, the city's top cop is finally fed up. The chief of police calling out left-wing agitators after they tried to break into a police precinct and set fire outside the building. He says the message for racial justice is being hijacked.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK LOVELL, POLICE CHIEF, PORTLAND, OREGON: Everyone from you know the person who owns a mom and pop store, to the big business owners, to faith leaders all the way up to elected officials, to really send a strong message that Enough is enough. This is not forwarding the goals of things that are going to lead to better outcomes for people of color. This movement is very powerful, and I feel like the violence has taken away from it. This is not what Portland is about and this is not what we need right now in our city.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEGSETH: And here's a stat that supports his claim. A new poll, Gallup poll, shows 81 percent of black Americans want police to maintain or increase a presence in their communities. Juan, I'll go to you. Has this movement on police reform been hijacked? We've heard a lot of Democrats deny either that Antifa is real or that there's a difference between the slogan a Black Lives Matter and the Marxist of leadership of Black Lives Matter. Has the moment been hijacked as the police chief says?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, gosh, I think it's still like 60-plus percent of Americans support the Black Lives Matter Movement. But Pete, they do not support, and I couldn't agree -- I couldn't agree more with the police chief, they don't support defund the police. That's Republican, Democrat, black, white, Asian, Latino, that's not something that people support.</p><p>What they really are focused on is police reform, so that you don't have police using brutal tactics, you know, abusing their powers, treating black people like their lesser citizens with no rights. That's what people are concerned about. In terms of, you know, the violence that you see in these pictures that keeps being repeated from the first night way back, I think people are able to separate it out and say, that's not -- that's not in keeping with the idea of people who march peacefully to say, the police behavior needs to be reined in.</p><p>JONES: But what's happening right now.</p><p>HEGSETH: Juan, that videos not from the first day. That video we're showing is from last night. It's ongoing day after day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, please.</p><p>HEGSETH: Oh, please? That's -- this is our own video from our own show out of Portland on this program, lighting fires and assaulting police. We got to move on, Juan, but --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Pete, that is not --</p><p>HEGSETH: That's not what?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Pete, my point to you is this is not typical of the protests which had been largely peaceful protest.</p><p>HEGSETH: It doesn't matter. It's still a distraction. Lawrence, it's still a distraction. And when you look at that number, 81 percent of black Americans say they want to maintain or increase, yet police reform comes down to mean minimizing the amount of police. Your reaction.</p><p>JONES: Here's the bottom line. They are using those of us that want actual reforms in policing in the community as a shield right now. In Portland, I have sources on the ground. They're telling me this is happening right now. They're sending me clips and videos of this taking place. And the biggest dead giveaway was when I saw the other night Bibles being burned in the middle of the street.</p><p>Now, do you think any black mother, Juan, seriously, any black mother is there to support their kids being in the street with the Bible's burning? That is literally the foundation of our culture. And to say that this is just, you know, the other night? No, they're hijacking what most of us want, which is a conversation on race in America and how we can move forward one country equal justice under the law. That's not what they stand for. They're using us as a shield. Those are white anarchists in the middle of their street.</p><p>HEGSETH: Dana, is this becoming counterproductive for people who have a substantive message?</p><p>PERINO: I think so. But, you know, take it from the police chief. He himself is saying so. Like, he's closest to it. And you have Chief Best in Seattle, she's had similar reactions. And I hope that that the elected leadership, the mayors and governors will support those police chiefs. But we all as voters, we should also support the election of people who are going -- that are determined to support the police chiefs.</p><p>HEGSETH: Emily, good luck. Put a bow on this one for us. What does it all mean?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Of course, this is not helping black people. This is disproportionately negatively affecting black people and people of color and minority small business owners. And this underscores the fact that these violent, agitating, riotous destructors are not there to amplify black voices or to ally for positive change, as Juan pointed out, this is totally separate.</p><p>I only take issue with one thing the chief of police in Portland said. He said it's up to Portlanders to message enough is enough. I say it's up to the local and state leadership and the elected officials to say enough is enough.</p><p>HEGSETH: Amen to that. I also say it's up to national leadership, like a presidential candidate in Joe Biden who has yet to condemn Antifa and a lot -- a lot of this violence manifests from. Well, we stuck to our time cues, so stick around, the \"FASTEST SEVEN\" is up next. I think we have all seven.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Welcome back. It's time for the \"FASTEST SEVEN.\" First up, everything must go. A 14-year-old Arizona boy forced to give away all his possessions including his bed after he took the family car for a joyride. The kid claims he was just trying to air dry the car after washing it.</p><p>You guys, I love this so much. I love this for the disciplining parents and I love this for his awesome creative defense. Pete Hegseth, what say you?</p><p>HEGSETH: Well as a father of seven or the fastest seven, I consider myself a connoisseur of punishment. And I salute this creativity. It is beautiful. Ramon Martinez, you are my hero. I love it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Lawrence, what are your thoughts?</p><p>JONES: It's something that my parents would do. I mean, things like this is going to save the country. Maybe we won't -- we won't have kids on the street burning stuff if more parents would do this.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Dana, I always had creative punishments levied my way and I think you did too, by your parents. What do you think about this?</p><p>PERINO: I never got in trouble, Emily.</p><p>HEGSETH: I actually believe that.</p><p>PERINO: I mean, come on. But I do think that these parents should run for mayor of Portland.</p><p>JONES: Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Exactly. Juan, you are a loving father and grandfather. What do you say about this?</p><p>WILLIAMS: That was an expensive car. You didn't mention Emily, but that was a Range Rover that the kid took off in. So, you know, this reminded me -- I think it was a 2013 case in Texas where the kid took off and he had an accident, some people died. But his parents and the lawyer said, it was affluenza, that he was so rich, he didn't know the difference between right and wrong.</p><p>HEGSETH: We've seen that defense before.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, so I'm glad that these parents took a stand.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Exactly. Up next, mac and cheese in the morning. Kraft is trying to rebrand the classic dinner item as a breakfast food. It may be for good reason. The company says 56 percent of families have served their picky kids macaroni and cheese for breakfast during the pandemic. Pete, I'll start with you again. Have you guys had some creative meals going on with your kids for breakfast and do you like this rebranding?</p><p>HEGSETH: Listen, all of our standards have lowered at this moment, but this is called giving up. The minute you've given mac and cheese for breakfast, you've given up. You've declared defeat. Now, I will say I'd like to try bacon or sausage than mac and cheese.</p><p>JONES: Right. Right.</p><p>HEGSETH: But it's pretty much parenting surrender.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally. Juan, we often have breakfast for dinner though, so what's wrong with dinner for breakfast?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wow, you know, I mean, you can change the advertising and try to get into a new category, but it doesn't change as the nutritional value. It doesn't change how many calories are involved and it doesn't change how you feel in the morning. I'm not sure that you know mac and cheese is exactly get up and go food.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is true. Dana, what do you think?</p><p>PERINO: Well, I have to say that I think mac and cheese is probably going to help you get going and learn more at school than a bowl of fruity pebbles, which was one of my favorites back in the day.</p><p>HEGSETH: How dare you?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Lawrence, what do you think?</p><p>JONES: I'm with Pete. Let's put some bacon or sausages in it. Like, I think that would be a good little breakfast.</p><p>HEGSETH: A little egg, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: OK. And finally, here's the latest awful trend on dating app's Worefishing. It's when people pretend to be super liberal to match with a progressive partner. I'm not sure why you would want to do that. Dana, what are your thoughts?</p><p>PERINO: I think that the easiest way to meet somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with is to get on an airplane and sit next to them for 2-1/2 hour flight, and then you'll be married for 22 years.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Nice. Lawrence, what do you think about this new trend?</p><p>JONES: I think this is miserable people. I mean, who wants to talk about politics or anything when it comes to dating? I mean, that's the last thing I want to discuss.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Juan, what would you do if you found out that someone you were dating actually wasn't a progressive liberal? How would you react?</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's fine with me. I mean, you know, I think it's good hearts, you know, smart people, people who have a sense of what's important in life, priorities and values, that's very attractive to me, so politics is down the way. But I must say, this is another sign of how polarized and crazy things are these days.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's true. And the opposite, Pete, is true as well. That there are certain apps that enable you to ascertain from the get-go if the other person is a Trump supporter, and if so, we'll remove any of them from your buffet or whatever it's called on those apps.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes. I got to believe there's like MAGAdating.com or something. So, I mean, you can -- you can go where you need to go. This is pretty standard, though. I mean, can you name me one person that's been fully honest in their dating profile? I'm just saying. So, in this case, they went into politics, otherwise they're going into looks or I have two cats or dogs. You know, it's all just making yourself look better to attract a mate. So, can you blame them? Come on?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I guess that's a really great point and creative, Pete. Like, what's the difference between this and your photoshopped 20 pounds thinner photo?</p><p>HEGSETH: Exactly.</p><p>COMPAGNO: But what I don't understand is why you would want to be matched up with someone who was so ideologically different, and why you would want that to be on the progressive side. It's sort of interesting. That was a great conversation. We made it to all topics. OK guys, \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next. Stay with us.</p><p>PERINO: All right, it's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" I want to give a shout out -- a big shout out to a little girl, Caroline Fritz. She made me this bracelet. It says Jasper on it. Oh, now you can't see it. But there she is. She's making the bracelet and she's a big fan of THE FIVE. She turns four. Here's the -- here's the bracelet. She turns four on Saturday and she has a little message for THE FIVE. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi, Dana. I hope you liked the bracelet. Good luck on THE FIVE.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Thank you, Caroline. And that's her little brother Rye-Rye. Also, tonight, if you want to check out this great thing. I did an interview with Condoleezza Rice, former Secretary of State, of course. From seven to 9:00 p.m., there's this virtual celebration of the 19th amendment which, of course, ratified the amendment that allowed women the right to vote.</p><p>So that is going to be there. If you go to my Instagram or head my Facebook page, you can check it out there. It's on tonight. All right, Juan, your next.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, Dana, thanks. A quick quiz. What are these three songs have in common? Light My Fire, Fire and Rain, and Ring of Fire? Well, the answer, of course, is fiery love. That's literally what happened in England. Take a look.</p><p>A man filled his living room with burning candles that spelled out a question, marry me. Then he left the room to pick up the young lady he wanted to wed. Well, when they got back, the candles had completely burned down the apartment. Yes, it burned down the apartment but he still got down on his knees and he popped the question and she said yes. Now, that's the lady who appreciates a fiery love.</p><p>PERINO: She said yes?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, she likes fiery love, Dana, fiery love.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>PERINO: All right. I'm not -- I'm not sure. All right --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No one was hurt. No one was hurt.</p><p>PERINO: Thank goodness. I'm glad nobody was hurt, indeed. All right, Pete.</p><p>HEGSETH: And she said yes which means there truly is a lid for every pot. You reminded me, Dana, to say a huge congrats or Happy Birthday to my middle son, Peter Boone. He's eight today. So, I love you, buddy.</p><p>And second of all, there's a great -- there's a great charity called the GI Go Fund. They help with employment and homelessness and housing for veterans. I swam across the Hudson River last year with \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS.\" There I am jumping in the nasty Hudson River with a bunch of Navy SEALs who are way better swimmers than I was. I did it live on a Saturday edition of \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS,\" barely made it, needed a little help, because I had three days' notice and didn't train.</p><p>Well, this Saturday, I'm trying it again with a larger group of Navy SEALs across the Hudson River. I've actually prepared a little bit this time. We're going to do it live on the Saturday edition. I'll be in the little box with the spotlight. I'm hoping to make it on my own like a big boy, like an Army guy, with the Navy SEALs. So check it out on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" this Saturday, for a great charity GI Go Fund, gigo.org.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's awesome.</p><p>JONES: Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Awesome, Pete.</p><p>PERINO: That's incredible, Pete. I admire you very much. It's a great organization. It's great that you're doing that. All right, Lawrence.</p><p>JONES: All right from Texas, father and daughter duo Roland and four-year- old Jaden Pollard are known for their viral cheer stunts. But however, some don't go as planned. Take a look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was kind of dangerous, so make sure you go for the right skill, OK. But daddy will always save you. I won't let you hit the ground like that, OK. Put those tears off. I got you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: Jaden, of course, got right back up and completed her amazing stunt. The two soared into social media stardom, gaining views, well over a million views with their impressive stunts. I'm so happy for them. We need our dads, especially girls and guys, we need our dads. And they're from Texas. I'm so proud of them.</p><p>HEGSETH: That's cool.</p><p>PERINO: And Emily, what do you think of that? She's got some skills.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I absolutely love it. Yes, they're an amazing duo. I just love watching cheerleaders at work. It's amazing. I wanted to draw your attention to a nonprofit that has just launched. You likely remember in 2014, when an intruder jumped the White House fence while then President Obama was home. And we all watched in horror, as the intruder punched and kicked the Secret Service K9 who ultimately took him down because K9s never fail.</p><p>Now, that canine named Hurricane was credited with saving the President's life and rightly received a ton of medals, including a Medal of Valor here and a knighthood equivalent in England. Now, his handler, former U.S. Secret Service agent Marshall Mirarchi has just launched Hurricanes Heroes, a federally recognized nonprofit dedicated to providing retired law enforcement and military dogs with subsidized veterinary care.

That's created opportunity for big tech vendors such as Hewlett-Packardand IBM, as well as smaller companies, which have launched campaigns to win over Sun's clients and distributors.</p><p>They're offering technical assistance and cash discounts to Sun's business and government customers, while highlighting   some say exaggerating   questions about whether Oracle will continue to sell and upgrade Sun's Unix servers, data storage systems and other product lines.</p><p>\"Don't settle for an uncertain future,\" urges an online marketing pitch from IBM, which is offering discounted technical consulting for customers who transfer their data processing from Sun computers to IBM systems. </p><p>Rival Hewlett-Packarddescribed its offer of technical advice and other assistance for those switching to HP products in a recent announcement headlined: \"HP to Sun Customers: We've Got Your Back.\"</p><p>The prospective deal between Oracle, known primarily for selling business software, and Sun, a storied but struggling computer maker, set tongues wagging across Silicon Valley when it was announced April 20. The two parties have said little since then, citing legal constraints while the deal is pending. They declined to comment for this report.</p><p>But many analysts believe Oracle will embark on restructuring and extensive layoffs to make Sun's operations more profitable. And despite assurances from Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, who said in May that he wants to integrate Sun's hardware with Oracle's software, industry experts say they won't be surprised if Oracle eventually divests some of Sun's hardware business.</p><p>\"Nobody knows what Oracle's plans are, but there's a feeling that they don't have much experience in this area, so they may not be committed to it,\" said James Staten, a data center infrastructure expert at Forrester Research.</p><p>Antitrust experts say the Justice Department's request for more information at the end of June means it could take until mid-autumn to review the deal. An Oracle attorney said June 26 that \"all that's left is one narrow issue\" about licensing rights to Sun's widely used Java programming language. Analysts say officials may want assurances that Oracle won't exert undue control over software that's an essential part of programs sold by rivals such as IBM.</p><p>Still, a review that includes a request for more information can typically last six months, said Ted Henneberry, a Washington antitrust attorney at Orrick Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe.</p><p>In addition, German software developer Bjorn Schotte reported on his blog this week that regulators for the European Union had contacted him to ask about MySQL, the Sun open-source database program that competes with Oracle's database software.</p><p>The EU, which will decide by Sept. 3 whether to launch a more extensive review, has historically used stricter standards than U.S. law, added antitrust expert Katherine Funk at Sonnenschein Nath &amp; Rosenthal, also based in Washington.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packardsays it persuaded more than 100 Sun customers to buy HP's servers and storage systems in the past six months. While offering them technical assistance and other incentives, HP also says companies like BT Vision, a British on-demand video service, concluded that HP systems performed better.</p><p>\"HP and IBM are milking this for everything that they can,\" said Gordon Haff at the Illuminata consulting group. \"There certainly is some nervousness out there. To go from that and suggest that every Sun customer is in total panic probably overstates things.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Larry Ellison, CEO and founder of Oracle, delivers a keynote address at the Oracle Open World conference held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco Wednesday November 14, 2007.(David M.

Facebook's profit jumped 98 percent. Even though the pandemic shuttered many of its stores, Apple increased sales of all its products in every part of the world and posted $11.25 billion in profit.

Key among these has been a 36 per cent spike in referrals for people at risk of far-right       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prevent-extremism-figures-far-right-terrorism-islamist-statistics-isis-referalls-a8681221.html\">radicalisation</url>. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In less turbulent times, this would have seen a surge in concern </p><p>-</p><p> certainly, at least, a debate. On the cusp of Brexit, amid panicky reports of empty shelves, delays at ports and possible civil unrest, it remains a very real crisis that risks being ignored. </p><p>This summer we will be three years on from the death of Labour MP Jo Cox, murdered by a man radicalised by both mainstream media and fringe sources. It seems we've learned nothing about how extremist actors use various communication channels to grow supportand influence the actions of individuals. </p><p>In 2019, a sizeable section of social media has become dominated by a number of far-right groups, large and small, that use the medium both to spread their message and gather funding. </p><p>While pro-Brexit lobby groups such as Leave.eu and Leave Means Leave were responsible for driving a staggering amount of right-wing traffic last year, it is perhaps the smaller figures that we should focus our attention on. </p><p>Read more</p><p>Why this Tommy Robinson lawsuit matters to the far right</p><p>The \"success story\" of 2018, if you can call it that, was the rise of \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prevent-extremism-figures-far-right-terrorism-islamist-statistics-isis-referalls-a8681221.html\">Tommy Robinson</url>\", aka Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. His arrest for contempt of court was artfully turned into a combination of free speech debate, political campaign and donation drive that netted him around \u00a32m in donations and a plum paid role for UKIP as a \"grooming gangs advisor\". </p><p>This surge in popularity </p><p>-</p><p> and funding </p><p>-</p><p> has emboldened Robinson, leading to a string of incidents last year in which the far-right activist turned up to the scene of incidents to \"report\", or in other words, inflame tensions. Most notably, a Syrian boy, shown in a viral video being \"waterboarded\" in Huddersfield, is still in hiding due to threats made on his life after Robinson visited his town. Another young man, in Cumbria was threatened for supposedly leaking Robinson's address. </p><p>The increased funding, and apparent invulnerability to serious prosecution, has also encouraged a number of minor far right activists such as James Goddard, \"Danny Tommo\" and \"Vinnie Sullivan\" to begin their own crowdfunded efforts, live-streaming from rallies, protests and other events. Their activities outside parliament, and subsequent arrests, have been turned into opportunities to soapbox against \"authoritarian\" government and police </p><p>-</p><p> and to ask for donations. </p><p>While each doesn't have a large viewership </p><p>-</p><p> the low thousands at most, </p><p>together</p><p> they represent another means of radicalisation, especially considering each has adopted the mantle of the \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prevent-extremism-figures-far-right-terrorism-islamist-statistics-isis-referalls-a8681221.html\">yellow vests</url>\", first seen in France. They livestream to Facebook, and upload to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prevent-extremism-figures-far-right-terrorism-islamist-statistics-isis-referalls-a8681221.html\">YouTube</url> regularly, providing the regular small hits of content that many experts believe drive the process of radicalisation. </p><p>You will likely have seen this how this ugly UK version of the yellow vests has seen increased numbers attending demonstrations, particularly in the capital. Anti-fascist activists on the Strand on Saturday caught footage of an Asian couple being harassed and jostled by protesters, having stopped their taxi, as well as a flare thrown into Charing Cross police station. </p><p>Elsewhere, more extreme groups appear to have free rein on Twitter and YouTube, An increasing number of individuals linked to groups such as Defend Europa and Generation Identity are using both platforms to circulate videos with a distinctly anti-migrant, white supremacist agenda. Buoyed by the success of figures such as Paul Joseph Watson, who has over a million subscribers, they skirt YouTube rules by broadcasting dog-whistle messages of \"not all cultures are equal\" and \"diversity is not our strength\". In my view, they try to sail as close to racist hate speech as they can without getting their accounts suspended. </p><p>All these individuals have happened on a way to bypass mainstream channels to reach people </p><p>- </p><p>particularly the young </p><p>-</p><p> where this target audience consumes most of their media. They are reached via their smartphones and tablets. Free from the regulation that controls print and broadcast media, there is only really the terms of service of various platforms stopping vile, hateful content being shared. </p><p>Read more</p><p>Tommy Robinson Australia tour postponed because visa not granted</p><p>Syrian boy's family appeal for help to fund Tommy Robinson lawsuit</p><p>Far-right Brexit rally attracts just 2,000 protesters</p><p>The problem here is that, as we have seen in the Tommy Robinson and yellow vests cases, banning groups and individuals from platforms isn't the answer </p><p>-</p><p> it only manufactures a \"free speech\" debate that is very hard to argue against, and is ultimately used a source of revenue generation.</p><p>The distraction of a chaotic and disruptive Brexit is a genuine risk to our ability to fight this strand of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prevent-extremism-figures-far-right-terrorism-islamist-statistics-isis-referalls-a8681221.html\">far right extremism</url>. What we need is a coordinated solution which pulls together government, big tech, educators, anti-racist organisations and anyone else who doesn't want far-right rhetoric to gain a foothold. </p><p>We need something cohesive at a time when cohesion is not in fashion. We need solutions that involve counter-messaging and digital literacy. We need solutions that aren't afraid to address confronting the most hateful material, and which encourage dialogue around it, rather than conflict. </p><p>And crucially, those solutions must make it more difficult to profit from dreary, bitter rhetoric that marginalises and demonises groups within British society. A large part of the resurgence of the far right in Britain is due to the ease with which they can support their activities financially. </p><p>To tame the beast we must starve it. Then we may be able to contain the influence of extremist groups at a time when they pose a greater threat than they have for decades </p><p>-</p><p> we simply cannot risk ambling nonchalantly through the months ahead, allowing them to drive a narrative that drags people into their gutter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-51465893</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VBY-19G1-F021-6498-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1016\"/><timeReceived>11:57 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 5, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Let's get Britain on the rise.</p><p>'Deficit, paid down. Tough decisions, taken. Growth, fired up. Aspiration, backed all the way.\u00a0 </p><p>'We know what it takes to win in the tough world of today, to win for all our people, to win for Britain.\u00a0 So let's get out there and do it.'</p><p>Mr Cameron told more than 2,000 people in Birmingham's Symphony Hall that he did not have a 'hard luck story'.</p><p>Stung by criticism of Tories appearing out of touch and dispassionate, Mr Cameron told party members they had to get the message across that Conservative policies are 'compassionate'.</p><p>'My mission from the day I became leader was to.. show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.</p><p>'But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.</p><p>'That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.'</p><p>He said that the coalition was formed in May 2010 at 'a grave moment in the modern history of Britain'.</p><p>He said the government had a challenge 'to make an insolvent nation solvent again, to set our country back on the path to prosperity that all can share in, to bring home our troops from danger while keeping our citizens safe from terror, to mend a broken society.'</p><p>The Prime Minister admitted he could not now say 'all is well' but he could say: 'Britain is on the right track.'</p><p>In a lengthy introduction New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg hailed Mr Cameron as a 'gold medal Prime Minister' who was 'not afraid to lead'.</p><p>He added: 'Prime Minister Cameron - together with his Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne - are creating a new course for Britain. </p><p>'It's not easy work, and I can appreciate how hard it is to step into a crisis and make the tough decisions to overcome it. </p><p>'He has governed with integrity. He has not just promised change, but he has delivered it, and he's been a Conservative in the very best sense of the word.'</p><p>And Mr Cameron made reference to the difficulties that tested his leadership when he said: 'As Prime Minister it has fallen to me to say some hard things and to help our country face some hard truths.</p><p>'Unless we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it has been in the past.</p><p>'Because the truth is this. We are in a global race today.</p><p> 'And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. Sink or swim. Do or decline.'</p><p>In an attempt to strike a more upbeat tone, Mr Cameron went on: 'Though the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. Why? Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things.'</p><p>Mr Cameron, who wore a dark suit and a purple tie, was joined by his wife Samantha for the short walk to the conference centre.</p><p>Mrs Cameron wore a navy blue knee-length dress by Joseph, with a grey belt and matching shoes from LK Bennett.</p><p>The PM, who appeared to be struggling with a cold, made repeated references to his family life and upbringing, and sought to tackle head on the criticism from opponents that his wealthy background means he is unable to understand the needs and concerns of ordinary voters.</p><p>                         FIGHTING POVERTY, HELPING THE YOUNG: PM'S SPEECH AT A GLANCE                       </p><p>HEALTH</p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down. And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs. Getting the deficit down is essential.</p><p>LABOUR</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always: Borrow more money. Now they're out of office it's: Borrow more money.</p><p>HOUSING</p><p>Young people who work hard year after year ...are still living at home. They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own. I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>WELFARE</p><p>Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.</p><p>EDUCATION</p><p>I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education. I want more free schools, more Academies, more rigorous exams in every school, more expected of every child.</p><p>TAX</p><p>Ed Miliband... Let me explain to you how it works. When people earn money, it's their money. Not the Government's money: their money. Then, the Government takes some of it away in tax. So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away. OK?</p><p>'Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going,' he said.</p><p>'We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer, by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. </p><p>'We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it.'</p><p>And in an attack on Ed Miliband's One Nation speech at the Labour conference last week he added: 'We don't preach about one nation but practise class war, we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>'The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.'</p><p>He said the Conservative party was not the 'party of the better-off. No, we are the party of the want to be better-off'.</p><p>He added: 'There is nothing complicated about me. I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country.'</p><p>Mr Cameron was introduced on stage by Lord Coe, the mastermind behind the London Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p><p>Mr Cameron was visibly moved and his voice cracked as he spoke of his disabled son Ivan who died in 2009. Mrs Cameron was also seen to be holding back tears.</p><p>'I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did,' he said.</p><p>'When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy. </p><p>'Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair and that's because of what happened here this summer.'</p><p>He said his favourite moment of the Games was presenting a gold medal to Paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds. </p><p>Mr Cameron made a swoop on the London Olympics for political gain, saying it was proof of the need to preserve the Union.</p><p>'There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom? Let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got.'</p><p>He also claimed that the popular Gamesmakers volunteers were proof of his much-ridiculed Big Society concept.</p><p>'I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society - they did it beautifully in just three weeks.'</p><p>After the conference became dominated by speculation about Boris Johnson's leadership ambitions, Mr Cameron paid tribute to the London Mayor, describing him as a the 'the man who put a smile on our face, the zinger on the zip-wire'.</p><p>And he sought to relight the debate on welfare, accusing Labour of being 'cruel' for refusing to support plans to get young people into work.</p><p>He also confirmed plans to consider ending automatic housing benefit for people under 25, saying: 'If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?'</p><p>He also promised to tackle the 'evil bureaucracy' of people signing on every fortnight. </p><p>'What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life? </p><p>'In British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless.'</p><p>He also attacked the 'appalling, snobbish' criticism of the Government's work experience programme which gives young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop or an office.</p><p>'We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance. What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them.</p><p>'Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.'</p><p>In a deeply personal section of the speech, Mr Cameron spoke of the values he had learned from his father, Ian, who died in 2010.</p><p>'I don't have a hard luck story. My dad was a stockbroker from Berkshire,' he said as his voice cracked.</p><p>'It's only when your dad's gone that you realise - not just how much you really miss them - but how much you really owe them. My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought.'</p><p>Mr Cameron added: 'He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they're meant to be. But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life.</p><p>'But Dad was the eternal optimist. To him the glass was always half full. Usually with something alcoholic in it.'</p><p>He said his father's life was 'not a hard luck story, but a hard work story'. He added: 'Work hard. Family comes first. But put back into the community too.</p><p>'And there is nothing complicated about what we need today. But it's tough. These are difficult times. We're being tested.</p><p>'How will we come through it? Again, it's not complicated. Hard work. Strong families. Taking responsibility. Serving others.'</p><p>He said the mission for the Government was 'to build an aspiration nation to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people'.</p><p>On the NHS he said the Government had cut waiting lists, mixed wards, the number of managers and hospital infections.</p><p>'And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS. </p><p>'So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay.'</p><p>Mr Cameron, who celebrated his 46th birthday last night with a curry, took on critics in his party unhappy at the decision to protect the foreign aid budget from cuts, telling delegates British money had vaccinated 130,000 children around the world.</p><p>'You, the Conservative party helped to do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.'</p><p>He urged the audience to give a standing ovation to the armed forces to 'show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do'.</p><p>He claimed that the Government was doing 'big Conservative things' but warned against it giving a 'false sense of security'. </p><p>He said the deficit reduction plan was not an alternative to a growth plan, 'it is the very foundation of our growth plan'.</p><p>'Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working. And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>'If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>'Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.'</p><p>Mr Cameron defended his overseas trips with business leaders, saying he wanted the Foreign Office to use its embassies as showrooms for UK firms.</p><p>'Don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth.'</p><p>Michael Dugher, Labour's shadow cabinet office minister, attacked the speech, saying: 'This was a defensive speech, from an out of touch, clearly rattled leader, who cannot be the One Nation Prime Minister we need.</p><p>'Rather than tackling the banks, or explaining why borrowing is going up not down, he chose to defend his millionaires' tax cut.'</p><p>                     Britain on the rise: <person><nameText>David Cameron's </nameText></person>full speech to the Tory party conference                   </p><p>In May 2010, this party stood on the threshold of power for the first time in more than a decade.</p><p>We knew then that it was not just the ordinary duties of office that we were assuming.</p><p>We were entering into Government at a grave moment in the modern history of Britain.</p><p>At a time when people felt uncertainty, even fear.</p><p>Here was the challenge: To make an insolvent nation solvent again.</p><p>To set our country back on the path to prosperity that all can share in.</p><p>To bring home our troops from danger while keeping our citizens safe from terror.</p><p>To mend a broken society.</p><p>Two and a half years later of course I can't tell you that all is well, but I can say this:</p><p>Britain is on the right track.</p><p>As Prime Minister it has fallen to me to say some hard things and to help our country face some hard truths.</p><p>All of my adult life, whatever the difficulties, the British people have at least been confident about one thing. </p><p>We have thought we can pay our way.\u00a0 That we can earn our living as a major industrial country...</p><p>...and we will always remain one.</p><p>It has fallen to us to say - we cannot assume that any longer. </p><p>Unless we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it has been in the past.</p><p>Because the truth is this.\u00a0 We are in a global race today. And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. Sink or swim. Do or decline. </p><p>To take office at such a moment is a duty and an honour...</p><p>...and we will rise to the challenge.</p><p>Today I'm going to set out a serious argument to this country about how we do that.</p><p>How we compete and thrive in this world...</p><p>...how we can make sure in this century, like the ones before, Britain is on the rise.</p><p>Nothing matters more. </p><p>Every battle we fight, every plan we make, every decision we take is to achieve that end...</p><p>...Britain on the rise.</p><p>                     BRITAIN CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>Though the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. </p><p>Why? Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things.\u00a0 We saw it this summer. </p><p>The Jubilee, the Olympics, the Paralympics...</p><p>...the best country in the world...</p><p>...and let's say it: with our Queen, the finest Head of State on earth.</p><p>I was trying to think of my favourite moment. </p><p>Was it telling President Hollande that no, we hadn't cheated at the cycling, we didn't have rounder wheels, it was just that we peddled faster than the French?</p><p>No... for me it was seeing that young woman who swam her heart out for years... </p><p>...nine training sessions a week, two hours a time.</p><p>My best moment was putting that gold medal around the neck of Ellie Simmonds.\u00a0 </p><p>And I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did. </p><p>When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy.</p><p>Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair - and that's because of what happened here this summer.</p><p>And the Olympics showed us something else. </p><p>Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland, they draped themselves in one flag. </p><p>Now, there's one person who didn't like that and he's called Alex Salmond. </p><p>I'm going to see him on Monday to sort that referendum on independence by the end of 2014. </p><p>There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got. </p><p>There are so many people to thank for this summer.</p><p>Those that won the bid, those that built the stadia, that ran the Games and of course: the man who put a smile on our faces, the zinger on the zip-wire, the Conservative Mayor of London: our Boris Johnson. </p><p>And those Games-Makers. You know, I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society they did it beautifully in just three weeks.</p><p>There is another group of people who stepped into the breach this summer - and we in this party never forget them.</p><p>Our armed forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for over ten years now.</p><p>433 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>Just last weekend there was a memorial service for one of the fallen, and the eulogy said this:</p><p>\"All that they had they gave. All that they might have had. All that they had ever been. All that they might ever have become.\"</p><p>For all those who serve, and their families, I repeat the commitment I made when this Government came to office. </p><p>By the end of 2014, all UK combat operations in Afghanistan will have come to an end. </p><p>Nearly all our troops will be home - their country proud, their duty done and let everyone in this hall stand and show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do. </p><p>                     CONSERVATIVES CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>To meet the challenges our country faces, we must have confidence in ourselves... confidence as a party.</p><p>We've been in office two and a half years now - and we've done some big, life-changing things.</p><p>Just ask Clive Stone, who you saw in a film earlier. </p><p>I met him years ago, when we were in Opposition. </p><p>He had cancer and he said to me: the drug I need - it's out there but they won't give it to me because it's too expensive please, if you get in, do something about it. </p><p>And we have. A new cancer drugs fund that has got the latest drugs to more than 21,000 people and counting. There was a reason we could do that. </p><p>It's because we made a big decision to protect the NHS from spending cuts. No other party made that commitment. </p><p>Not Labour. Not the Liberal Democrats. Just us - the Conservatives. To all those people who said we'd bring the NHS down...I say......well, yes, you've got a point.</p><p>I'll tell you what is down.</p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down.</p><p>And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay. </p><p>We made a big decision to go on saving lives abroad too. </p><p>I know some are sceptical about our aid budget. </p><p>But picture the scene - you're in a health centre in Kinshasa. </p><p>See the child with a needle in her arm, being injected with a Yellow Fever vaccine the difference between living and dying how can anyone tell me that's a waste of money. </p><p>Since we gathered here in Birmingham on Sunday, British aid money has vaccinated 130 thousand children around the world. One hundred and thirty thousand children.</p><p>You, the Conservative party helped do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.\u00a0 </p><p>Here's something else this party's done in government. </p><p>Last December I was at a European Council in Brussels. </p><p>It was three in the morning, there was a treaty on the table that was not in Britain's interests and twenty five people around that table were telling me to sign it.</p><p>But I did something that no other British leader has ever done before. </p><p>I said no - Britain comes first - and I vetoed that EU treaty.</p><p>We're doing big, Conservative things. </p><p>For years people said you'll never reform public sector pensions, the trade unions won't stand for it.</p><p>Well, we've done it, and it's going to cut the cost to the taxpayer almost in half. </p><p>For years people said benefits are out of control and there's nothing you can do about it.</p><p>Well, because of our welfare cap, no family will be getting more in benefits than the average family earns. </p><p>For years people asked why we couldn't get rid of those radical preachers who spout hatred about Britain while living off the taxpayer...</p><p>...well, Theresa May - a great Home Secretary - has done it - and she's got Abu Hamza on that plane and out of our country to face justice. </p><p>Be proud of what we've done already.</p><p>Two million of the lowest-paid workers being taken out of income tax altogether.</p><p>Over eighteen million households helped with a freeze in their council tax - and we're freezing it all over again next year too.</p><p>                     BRITAIN ON THE RISE                   </p><p>Big, Conservative things - delivered by this government; made possible by this party.</p><p>We can deliver. We can do big things. </p><p>The Olympics reminded us how great it feels to be successful.</p><p>But we mustn't let that warm glow give us a false sense of security.</p><p>All around the world, countries are on the rise.</p><p>Yes, we've been hearing about China and India for years but it's hard to believe what's happening in Brazil, in Indonesia, in Nigeria too.</p><p>Meanwhile, the old powers are on the slide.</p><p>What do the countries on the rise have in common?</p><p>They are lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future - on education, incredible infrastructure and technology.</p><p>And what do the countries on the slide have in common?</p><p>They're fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services.</p><p>I sit in those European Council meetings where we talk endlessly about Greece while on the other side of the world, China is moving so fast it's creating a new economy the size of Greece every three months.\u00a0 </p><p>I am not going to stand here as Prime Minister and allow this country to join the slide.</p><p>My job - our job - is to make sure that in this twenty first century, as in the centuries that came before, our country, Britain, is on the rise.</p><p>And we here know how that is done.</p><p>It is the collective result of individual effort and aspiration, the ideas you have, the businesses you start, the hours you put in.</p><p>Aspiration is the engine of progress.</p><p>Countries rise when they allow their people to rise.</p><p>In this world where brains matter more, where technologies shape our lives, where no-one is owed a living...</p><p>...the most powerful natural resource we have is our people. </p><p>Not just the scientists, the entrepreneurs, the engineers...</p><p>...not just the teachers, the parents, the nurses...</p><p>...but all our people: including the poorest, those who've never had a job, never had a chance, never had hope. </p><p>That's why the mission for this government is to build an aspiration nation...</p><p>...to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people. </p><p>And for us Conservatives, this is not just an economic mission - it's also a moral one.</p><p>It's not just about growth and GDP...</p><p>...it's what's always made our hearts beat faster - aspiration; people rising from the bottom to the top.</p><p>Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going. </p><p>We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer...</p><p>...by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. </p><p>We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it. </p><p>Let me put that another way.</p><p>We don't preach about one nation but practise class war...</p><p>...we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.</p><p>While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you.</p><p>They call us the party of the better-off...</p><p>...no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families - and we should never, ever be ashamed of saying so.</p><p>                     THE RIGHT IDEAS                   </p><p>This party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve.</p><p>Conservatives think: let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it. It's not our style. </p><p>But there's a problem with that. </p><p>It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are: the cartoon Conservatives who don't care. </p><p>My mission from the day I became leader was to change that.</p><p>Yes, to show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.</p><p>But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.</p><p>That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.</p><p>Because it's not enough to know our ideas are right - we've got to explain why they are compassionate too.</p><p>Because we know what we're up against. </p><p>We say we've got to get the private sector bigger and the public sector smaller...our opponents call it 'Tory cuts, slashing the state'.</p><p>No: it's the best way to create the sustainable jobs people need.</p><p>We say help people become independent from welfare...our opponents call it: 'cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves.'</p><p>No: there is only one real route out of poverty and it is work.</p><p>We say we've got to insist on a disciplined, rigorous education for our children...our opponents call it: 'elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.' </p><p>No: a decent education is the only way to give all our children a proper start in this world.</p><p>The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we're the same old Tories who want to help the rich...</p><p>...it's because we're the Tories whose ideas help everyone - the poorest the most.</p><p>A strong private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach. </p><p>These three things are essential to helping our people rise.</p><p>They are essential to our success in this world. </p><p>And you know what - Labour will fight them all the way. </p><p>So these things are not just the battle-ground for Britain's future...</p><p>...they are also the battle-lines for the next election - and it is a fight we've got to win, for our party and our country.</p><p>                     ECONOMY                   </p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs.</p><p>We need businesses, of every size, in every type of industry, in every part of the country - investing and taking people on.</p><p>There are some basic things they need to do that.</p><p>Low interest rates so they can afford to take out a loan.And confidence that it's worth investing - because the customers will be there, whether at home or abroad.</p><p>Getting the deficit down is essential for both.</p><p>That's why our deficit reduction plan is not an alternative to a growth plan: it's the very foundation of our growth plan.</p><p>It's the only way we'll get Britain on the rise. </p><p>Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working.</p><p>And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>The world economy - especially in the Eurozone - has been much weaker than expected in the past two years.</p><p>When some of our big trading partners like Ireland, Spain and Italy are suffering, they buy less from us. </p><p>That hurts our growth and makes it harder to pay off our debts. </p><p>But here is the crucial thing you need to know. </p><p>Yes it's worse than we thought, yes it's taking longer, but we are making progress.</p><p>Thanks to the grit and resolve of George Osborne, we have cut a quarter off the deficit in the past two years. 25 per cent.\u00a0 </p><p>That's helped to keep interest rates at record low levels, keeping mortgages low.\u00a0 </p><p>Leaving more money in your pockets.\u00a0 </p><p>Giving businesses more confidence to invest.</p><p>Creating more jobs.</p><p>And if you don't believe me, just look at the job creation figures.</p><p>Since this government took office, over one million new jobs have been created in the private sector.</p><p>That is more - net - in the last two years than Labour managed in ten years. </p><p>                     LABOUR                    </p><p>Now, the Labour politicians who got us into the mess say they have a different way out of it.</p><p>They call it Plan B and it goes like this: </p><p>We should stop worrying about deficit reduction, borrow more money and spend it to boost the economy. </p><p>It sounds so reasonable when you put it like that. </p><p>Let me tell you why it's not.</p><p>Right now, while we've got a deficit, the people we're borrowing money from believe that we'll pay it back - because we've set out a tough plan to cut spending and live within our means.</p><p>That's why our interest rates are among the lowest in the world, even though the deficit left to us by Labour was one of the highest in the world.</p><p>If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. </p><p>Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. </p><p>That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.</p><p>If you have a mortgage of \u00a3100,000, just a 1 per cent interest rate rise would mean an extra thousand pounds to pay each year.</p><p>Labour's plan to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and our future.</p><p>And it would squander the sacrifices we've already made.</p><p>We're here because they spent too much and borrowed too much.</p><p>How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing?</p><p>I honestly think Labour haven't learned a single thing.</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Now they're out of office it's:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it's: borrow more money.</p><p>Borrow, borrow, borrow. </p><p>Labour: the party of one notion: more borrowing.</p><p>I sometimes wonder if they know anything about the real economy at all.</p><p>Did you hear what Ed Miliband said last week about taxes?</p><p>He described a tax cut as the government writing people a cheque.</p><p>Ed... Let me explain to you how it works.</p><p>When people earn money, it's their money.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Not the government's money: their money.</p><p>Then, the government takes some of it away in tax.</p><p>So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away.\u00a0 OK?</p><p>And while we're on that - who suffers when the wealthy businessman goes off to live in Geneva? </p><p>Not him - he's paying about half the tax he would do here...</p><p>...it's those who want to work who suffer because the jobs aren't being created here.</p><p>We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden...</p><p>...and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour.</p><p>Under Labour.</p><p>We haven't forgotten, you know. </p><p>We remember who spent our golden legacy, who sold our gold...</p><p>...who busted our banks, who smothered our businesses...</p><p>... who wracked up our debts, who wrecked our economy...</p><p>...who ruined our reputation, who risked our future...</p><p>...who did this? - Labour did this - and this country should never forget it. </p><p>                     ASPIRATION ECONOMY                   </p><p>To get Britain on the rise we need a whole new economy...</p><p>...more enterprising, more aspirational...</p><p>...and it's taking shape already.</p><p>We're getting our entrepreneurial streak back: last year the rate of new business creation was faster than any other year in our history. </p><p>Let me repeat that. </p><p>The rate at which new businesses started - faster than any year on record. </p><p>We're making things again.</p><p>We had a trade surplus in cars last year for the first time in almost 40 years.</p><p>And it's not just the old industries growing, it's the new. </p><p>We're number one in the world for offshore wind.</p><p>Number one in the world for tidal power.</p><p>The world's first green investment bank. </p><p>Britain leading; Britain on the rise.\u00a0 We're showing we can do it.</p><p>Look at the new investment coming in. </p><p>In the last two years, Google, Intel, Cisco - the big tech firms - they've all set up new bases here. </p><p>And we are selling to the world again. </p><p>When I became Prime Minister I said to the Foreign Office: those embassies you've got...</p><p>...turn them into showrooms for our cars, department stores for our fashion, technology hubs for British start-ups.</p><p>Yes, you're diplomats but you need to be our country's salesforce too.</p><p>And look what's happening.</p><p>In just two years, our exports to Brazil are up 25 per cent...</p><p>...to China - 40 per cent...</p><p>...to Russia - 80 per cent. </p><p>There are so many opportunities in this world. </p><p>I want to tell you about one business that's seizing them. </p><p>It's run by a guy called Alastair Lukies. </p><p>He and his business partner saw a world with almost 6 billion mobile phones and just 2 billion bank accounts. </p><p>They saw the huge gap in the market- and they started a mobile banking firm...</p><p>...helping people in the poorest parts of the world manage their money and start new companies.</p><p>He's been with me on trade missions all over the world - and his business is booming. </p><p>Back in 2010, when we came to office, they employed about 100 people - now it's more than 700. </p><p>Then they were nowhere in Africa, nowhere in Asia, now they are the global player, with one million new users every month. </p><p>So don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth. </p><p>And to those who question whether it's right to load up a plane with businesspeople - whether we're flying to Africa, Indonesia, to the Gulf or China...</p><p>...whether we're taking people from energy, finance, technology or yes - defence ...</p><p>...I say - there is a global battle out there to win jobs, orders, contracts...</p><p>...and in that battle I believe in leading from the front. </p><p>To get our economy on the rise there's a lot more to do - and frankly a lot more fights to be had. </p><p>Because there are too many of what I'd call the \"yes-but-no\" people. </p><p>The ones who say \"yes, our businesses need to expand...</p><p>...but no we can't reform planning.\"</p><p>It's simple.</p><p>For a business to expand, it needs places to build.</p><p>If it takes too long, they'll just build elsewhere.</p><p>I visited a business the other day that wanted to open a big factory just outside Liverpool. </p><p>But the council was going to take so long to approve the decision that they're now building that factory on the continent - and taking hundreds of jobs with them. </p><p>If we're going to be a winner in this global race we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all. </p><p>And then there are those who say \"yes of course we need more housing\"...</p><p>...but \"no\" to every development - and not in my backyard.</p><p>Look - it's OK for my generation. Many of us have got on the ladder.</p><p>But you know the average age that someone buys their first home today, without any help for their parents? </p><p>33 years old. </p><p>We are the party of home ownership - we cannot let this carry on.</p><p>So yes - we're doubling the discount for buying your council house...</p><p>...we're helping first-time buyers get a 95 per cent mortgage...</p><p>...but there's something else we need to do - and that's accept we need to build more houses in Britain.</p><p>There are young people who work hard year after year but are still living at home.</p><p>They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own.</p><p>I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>                     WELFARE                   </p><p>If we want our people to rise so Britain can rise, we must tackle welfare.</p><p>Here's two facts for you. </p><p>Fact one.\u00a0 We spend \u00a390 billion a year on welfare for working-age people.</p><p>Not pensions. Just welfare for working age people - and that's one pound in every eight the government spends. </p><p>Fact two.\u00a0 More of our children live in households where nobody works than almost any other nation in Europe.</p><p>Let me put it simply.\u00a0 Welfare isn't working. And this is a tragedy. </p><p>Our reforms are just as profound as those of Beveridge 60 years ago.</p><p>He had his great evils to slay. Squalor. Ignorance. Want. Idleness.\u00a0 And Disease.</p><p>Here are mine.</p><p>First, unfairness.\u00a0 </p><p>What are hard-working people who travel long distances to get into work and pay their taxes meant to think when they see families - individual families - getting 40, 50, 60 thousand pounds of housing benefit to live in homes that these hard working people could never afford themselves?</p><p>It is an outrage. And we are ending it by capping housing benefit. </p><p>The second evil: injustice.</p><p>Here's the choice we give our young people today. </p><p>Choice one: Work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat. And as I've just said, that can feel like forever.</p><p>Or: Don't get a job. Sign on. Don't even need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit. Get a flat. And then don't ever get a job or you'll lose a load of housing benefit.</p><p>We must be crazy.</p><p>So this is what we've done.</p><p>Now you have to have to sign a contract that says: you do your bit and we'll do ours.</p><p>It requires you to have a real CV and it makes clear: you have to seek work and take work - or you will lose your benefit.</p><p>And we're going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too. </p><p>If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?</p><p>The next evil: bureaucracy. </p><p>Sign on. Sign here. Come back in a fortnight. Repeat as required.</p><p>What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life? </p><p>For people like him we're doing something new. </p><p>The Work Programme takes the money we're going to save from getting people off the dole...</p><p>...and uses it today to get them into work, with proper training.</p><p>We're spending up to \u00a314,000 on one individual to get them into work - and already almost 700,000 people have got onto the Work Programme.</p><p>So let's be clear: in British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless...</p><p>...and with Iain Duncan Smith leading this revolution let this be the party that shows there is ability and promise in everyone. </p><p>And just one more thing on welfare.</p><p>You know our work experience programme, where we give young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop, an office?</p><p>Here's what one union official said about it. </p><p>I quote: \"The scheme belongs back in the nineteenth century, along with Oliver Twist and the workhouse. It is nothing short of state sponsored slavery...\"</p><p>Honestly. What an appalling, snobbish attitude to the idea of work. </p><p>We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance. </p><p>What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them.</p><p>Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery...</p><p>...and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.</p><p>                     EDUCATION                    </p><p>To help people to rise, to help Britain rise, there's a third - crucial - thing we must do. </p><p>Educate all our children.</p><p>And I mean really educate them, not just pump up the grades each year. </p><p>In maths, in science, in reading, we've fallen behind...</p><p>...not just behind Germany and Canada but Estonia and Australia too. </p><p>This is Britain's real school report and the verdict is clear: must try harder. </p><p>You've heard of pushy parents, sharp-elbowing their way to a better education for their kids? </p><p>Well - this is a pushy government. </p><p>My approach is very simple. </p><p>I've got two children in primary school, and I want for your children what I want for mine. </p><p>To go to schools where discipline is strict, expectations are high and no excuses are accepted for failure.</p><p>I don't want great schools to just be the preserve of those that can pay the fees, or buy the nice house in the right catchment area...</p><p>...I want those schools to be open to every child - in every neighbourhood.</p><p>And the reason I know that every child can go to a school like that is because with this Government, more and more new ones are opening.</p><p>We've heard from some of them this week...</p><p>...not just the 79 new free schools - with over a hundred more to come...</p><p>...but from some of the more than 2000 academies we've helped create - state schools given all the freedoms, and carrying all the high expectations, of private schools.</p><p>Yes - that's my plan - millions of children sent to independent schools...</p><p>...independent schools, in the state sector.</p><p>That's the genuine revolution that's now underway.</p><p>The Harris Academy in Peckham has increased the number of students getting five good GCSEs - from 12 percent when it was under local authority control to almost 90 percent now. </p><p>The transformation has been astonishing - and the methods have been Conservative.</p><p>Smart uniforms, teachers in suits.</p><p>Children taught physics, chemistry and biology not soft options.</p><p>Children set by ability - with excellence applauded, extra resources for those most in need but no excuses for slacking.</p><p>When you see a school like that succeed it prompts the question:</p><p>Why can't every school be that way? Why can't every child have those chances?</p><p>It's not because parents aren't ambitious enough - most of these schools are massively over-subscribed. </p><p>It's because the old educational establishment - the left-wing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists - stood in the way.</p><p>When we saw a badly failing school in Haringey and wanted to turn it into an Academy, the Labour authority, the Labour MP and the teaching unions said no. </p><p>When inspirational teachers and parents - in Hammersmith, in Norwich, in Bristol and in Wigan - wanted to open free schools, the left-wing establishment said no.</p><p>When we proposed: More pay for good teachers...

We are in a global race today.</p><p> 'And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. Sink or swim. Do or decline.'</p><p>In an attempt to strike a more upbeat tone, Mr Cameron went on: 'Though the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. Why? Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things.'</p><p>Mr Cameron, who wore a dark suit and a purple tie, was joined by his wife Samantha for the short walk to the conference centre.</p><p>Mrs Cameron wore a navy blue knee-length dress by Joseph, with a grey belt and matching shoes from LK Bennett.</p><p>The PM, who appeared to be struggling with a cold, made repeated references to his family life and upbringing, and sought to tackle head on the criticism from opponents that his wealthy background means he is unable to understand the needs and concerns of ordinary voters.</p><p>                         FIGHTING POVERTY, HELPING THE YOUNG: PM'S SPEECH AT A GLANCE                       </p><p>HEALTH</p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down. And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs. Getting the deficit down is essential.</p><p>LABOUR</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always: Borrow more money. Now they're out of office it's: Borrow more money.</p><p>HOUSING</p><p>Young people who work hard year after year ...are still living at home. They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own. I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>WELFARE</p><p>Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.</p><p>EDUCATION</p><p>I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education. I want more free schools, more Academies, more rigorous exams in every school, more expected of every child.</p><p>TAX</p><p>Ed Miliband... Let me explain to you how it works. When people earn money, it's their money. Not the Government's money: their money. Then, the Government takes some of it away in tax. So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away. OK?</p><p>'Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going,' he said.</p><p>'We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer, by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. </p><p>'We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it.'</p><p>And in an attack on Ed Miliband's One Nation speech at the Labour conference last week he added: 'We don't preach about one nation but practise class war, we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>'The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.'</p><p>He said the Conservative party was not the 'party of the better-off. No, we are the party of the want to be better-off'.</p><p>He added: 'There is nothing complicated about me. I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country.'</p><p>Mr Cameron was introduced on stage by Lord Coe, the mastermind behind the London Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p><p>Mr Cameron was visibly moved and his voice cracked as he spoke of his disabled son Ivan who died in 2009. Mrs Cameron was also seen to be holding back tears.</p><p>'I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did,' he said.</p><p>'When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy. </p><p>'Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair and that's because of what happened here this summer.'</p><p>He said his favourite moment of the Games was presenting a gold medal to Paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds. </p><p>Mr Cameron made a swoop on the London Olympics for political gain, saying it was proof of the need to preserve the Union.</p><p>'There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom? Let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got.'</p><p>He also claimed that the popular Gamesmakers volunteers were proof of his much-ridiculed Big Society concept.</p><p>'I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society - they did it beautifully in just three weeks.'</p><p>After the conference became dominated by speculation about Boris Johnson's leadership ambitions, Mr Cameron paid tribute to the London Mayor, describing him as a the 'the man who put a smile on our face, the zinger on the zip-wire'.</p><p>And he sought to relight the debate on welfare, accusing Labour of being 'cruel' for refusing to support plans to get young people into work.</p><p>He also confirmed plans to consider ending automatic housing benefit for people under 25, saying: 'If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?'</p><p>He also promised to tackle the 'evil bureaucracy' of people signing on every fortnight. </p><p>'What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life? </p><p>'In British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless.'</p><p>He also attacked the 'appalling, snobbish' criticism of the Government's work experience programme which gives young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop or an office.</p><p>'We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance. What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them.</p><p>'Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.'</p><p>In a deeply personal section of the speech, Mr Cameron spoke of the values he had learned from his father, Ian, who died in 2010.</p><p>'I don't have a hard luck story. My dad was a stockbroker from Berkshire,' he said as his voice cracked.</p><p>'It's only when your dad's gone that you realise - not just how much you really miss them - but how much you really owe them. My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought.'</p><p>Mr Cameron added: 'He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they're meant to be. But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life.</p><p>'But Dad was the eternal optimist. To him the glass was always half full. Usually with something alcoholic in it.'</p><p>He said his father's life was 'not a hard luck story, but a hard work story'. He added: 'Work hard. Family comes first. But put back into the community too.</p><p>'And there is nothing complicated about what we need today. But it's tough. These are difficult times. We're being tested.</p><p>'How will we come through it? Again, it's not complicated. Hard work. Strong families. Taking responsibility. Serving others.'</p><p>He said the mission for the Government was 'to build an aspiration nation to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people'.</p><p>On the NHS he said the Government had cut waiting lists, mixed wards, the number of managers and hospital infections.</p><p>'And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS. </p><p>'So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay.'</p><p>Mr Cameron, who celebrated his 46th birthday last night with a curry, took on critics in his party unhappy at the decision to protect the foreign aid budget from cuts, telling delegates British money had vaccinated 130,000 children around the world.</p><p>'You, the Conservative party helped to do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.'</p><p>He urged the audience to give a standing ovation to the armed forces to 'show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do'.</p><p>He claimed that the Government was doing 'big Conservative things' but warned against it giving a 'false sense of security'. </p><p>He said the deficit reduction plan was not an alternative to a growth plan, 'it is the very foundation of our growth plan'.</p><p>'Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working. And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>'If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>'Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates.

And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. Sink or swim. Do or decline. </p><p>To take office at such a moment is a duty and an honour...</p><p>...and we will rise to the challenge.</p><p>Today I'm going to set out a serious argument to this country about how we do that.</p><p>How we compete and thrive in this world...</p><p>...how we can make sure in this century, like the ones before, Britain is on the rise.</p><p>Nothing matters more. </p><p>Every battle we fight, every plan we make, every decision we take is to achieve that end...</p><p>...Britain on the rise.</p><p>                     BRITAIN CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>Though the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. </p><p>Why? Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things.\u00a0 We saw it this summer. </p><p>The Jubilee, the Olympics, the Paralympics...</p><p>...the best country in the world...</p><p>...and let's say it: with our Queen, the finest Head of State on earth.</p><p>I was trying to think of my favourite moment. </p><p>Was it telling President Hollande that no, we hadn't cheated at the cycling, we didn't have rounder wheels, it was just that we peddled faster than the French?</p><p>No... for me it was seeing that young woman who swam her heart out for years... </p><p>...nine training sessions a week, two hours a time.</p><p>My best moment was putting that gold medal around the neck of Ellie Simmonds.\u00a0 </p><p>And I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did. </p><p>When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy.</p><p>Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair - and that's because of what happened here this summer.</p><p>And the Olympics showed us something else. </p><p>Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland, they draped themselves in one flag. </p><p>Now, there's one person who didn't like that and he's called Alex Salmond. </p><p>I'm going to see him on Monday to sort that referendum on independence by the end of 2014. </p><p>There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got. </p><p>There are so many people to thank for this summer.</p><p>Those that won the bid, those that built the stadia, that ran the Games and of course: the man who put a smile on our faces, the zinger on the zip-wire, the Conservative Mayor of London: our Boris Johnson. </p><p>And those Games-Makers. You know, I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society they did it beautifully in just three weeks.</p><p>There is another group of people who stepped into the breach this summer - and we in this party never forget them.</p><p>Our armed forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for over ten years now.</p><p>433 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>Just last weekend there was a memorial service for one of the fallen, and the eulogy said this:</p><p>\"All that they had they gave. All that they might have had. All that they had ever been. All that they might ever have become.\"</p><p>For all those who serve, and their families, I repeat the commitment I made when this Government came to office. </p><p>By the end of 2014, all UK combat operations in Afghanistan will have come to an end. </p><p>Nearly all our troops will be home - their country proud, their duty done and let everyone in this hall stand and show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do. </p><p>                     CONSERVATIVES CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>To meet the challenges our country faces, we must have confidence in ourselves... confidence as a party.</p><p>We've been in office two and a half years now - and we've done some big, life-changing things.</p><p>Just ask Clive Stone, who you saw in a film earlier. </p><p>I met him years ago, when we were in Opposition. </p><p>He had cancer and he said to me: the drug I need - it's out there but they won't give it to me because it's too expensive please, if you get in, do something about it. </p><p>And we have. A new cancer drugs fund that has got the latest drugs to more than 21,000 people and counting. There was a reason we could do that. </p><p>It's because we made a big decision to protect the NHS from spending cuts. No other party made that commitment. </p><p>Not Labour. Not the Liberal Democrats. Just us - the Conservatives. To all those people who said we'd bring the NHS down...I say......well, yes, you've got a point.</p><p>I'll tell you what is down.</p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down.</p><p>And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay. </p><p>We made a big decision to go on saving lives abroad too. </p><p>I know some are sceptical about our aid budget. </p><p>But picture the scene - you're in a health centre in Kinshasa. </p><p>See the child with a needle in her arm, being injected with a Yellow Fever vaccine the difference between living and dying how can anyone tell me that's a waste of money. </p><p>Since we gathered here in Birmingham on Sunday, British aid money has vaccinated 130 thousand children around the world. One hundred and thirty thousand children.</p><p>You, the Conservative party helped do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.\u00a0 </p><p>Here's something else this party's done in government. </p><p>Last December I was at a European Council in Brussels. </p><p>It was three in the morning, there was a treaty on the table that was not in Britain's interests and twenty five people around that table were telling me to sign it.</p><p>But I did something that no other British leader has ever done before. </p><p>I said no - Britain comes first - and I vetoed that EU treaty.</p><p>We're doing big, Conservative things. </p><p>For years people said you'll never reform public sector pensions, the trade unions won't stand for it.</p><p>Well, we've done it, and it's going to cut the cost to the taxpayer almost in half. </p><p>For years people said benefits are out of control and there's nothing you can do about it.</p><p>Well, because of our welfare cap, no family will be getting more in benefits than the average family earns. </p><p>For years people asked why we couldn't get rid of those radical preachers who spout hatred about Britain while living off the taxpayer...</p><p>...well, Theresa May - a great Home Secretary - has done it - and she's got Abu Hamza on that plane and out of our country to face justice. </p><p>Be proud of what we've done already.</p><p>Two million of the lowest-paid workers being taken out of income tax altogether.</p><p>Over eighteen million households helped with a freeze in their council tax - and we're freezing it all over again next year too.</p><p>                     BRITAIN ON THE RISE                   </p><p>Big, Conservative things - delivered by this government; made possible by this party.</p><p>We can deliver. We can do big things. </p><p>The Olympics reminded us how great it feels to be successful.</p><p>But we mustn't let that warm glow give us a false sense of security.</p><p>All around the world, countries are on the rise.</p><p>Yes, we've been hearing about China and India for years but it's hard to believe what's happening in Brazil, in Indonesia, in Nigeria too.</p><p>Meanwhile, the old powers are on the slide.</p><p>What do the countries on the rise have in common?</p><p>They are lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future - on education, incredible infrastructure and technology.</p><p>And what do the countries on the slide have in common?</p><p>They're fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services.</p><p>I sit in those European Council meetings where we talk endlessly about Greece while on the other side of the world, China is moving so fast it's creating a new economy the size of Greece every three months.\u00a0 </p><p>I am not going to stand here as Prime Minister and allow this country to join the slide.</p><p>My job - our job - is to make sure that in this twenty first century, as in the centuries that came before, our country, Britain, is on the rise.</p><p>And we here know how that is done.</p><p>It is the collective result of individual effort and aspiration, the ideas you have, the businesses you start, the hours you put in.</p><p>Aspiration is the engine of progress.</p><p>Countries rise when they allow their people to rise.</p><p>In this world where brains matter more, where technologies shape our lives, where no-one is owed a living...</p><p>...the most powerful natural resource we have is our people. </p><p>Not just the scientists, the entrepreneurs, the engineers...</p><p>...not just the teachers, the parents, the nurses...</p><p>...but all our people: including the poorest, those who've never had a job, never had a chance, never had hope. </p><p>That's why the mission for this government is to build an aspiration nation...</p><p>...to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people. </p><p>And for us Conservatives, this is not just an economic mission - it's also a moral one.</p><p>It's not just about growth and GDP...</p><p>...it's what's always made our hearts beat faster - aspiration; people rising from the bottom to the top.</p><p>Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going. </p><p>We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer...</p><p>...by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. </p><p>We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it. </p><p>Let me put that another way.</p><p>We don't preach about one nation but practise class war...</p><p>...we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.</p><p>While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you.</p><p>They call us the party of the better-off...</p><p>...no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families - and we should never, ever be ashamed of saying so.</p><p>                     THE RIGHT IDEAS                   </p><p>This party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve.</p><p>Conservatives think: let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it. It's not our style. </p><p>But there's a problem with that. </p><p>It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are: the cartoon Conservatives who don't care. </p><p>My mission from the day I became leader was to change that.</p><p>Yes, to show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.</p><p>But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.</p><p>That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.</p><p>Because it's not enough to know our ideas are right - we've got to explain why they are compassionate too.</p><p>Because we know what we're up against. </p><p>We say we've got to get the private sector bigger and the public sector smaller...our opponents call it 'Tory cuts, slashing the state'.</p><p>No: it's the best way to create the sustainable jobs people need.</p><p>We say help people become independent from welfare...our opponents call it: 'cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves.'</p><p>No: there is only one real route out of poverty and it is work.</p><p>We say we've got to insist on a disciplined, rigorous education for our children...our opponents call it: 'elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.' </p><p>No: a decent education is the only way to give all our children a proper start in this world.</p><p>The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we're the same old Tories who want to help the rich...</p><p>...it's because we're the Tories whose ideas help everyone - the poorest the most.</p><p>A strong private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach. </p><p>These three things are essential to helping our people rise.</p><p>They are essential to our success in this world. </p><p>And you know what - Labour will fight them all the way. </p><p>So these things are not just the battle-ground for Britain's future...</p><p>...they are also the battle-lines for the next election - and it is a fight we've got to win, for our party and our country.</p><p>                     ECONOMY                   </p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs.</p><p>We need businesses, of every size, in every type of industry, in every part of the country - investing and taking people on.</p><p>There are some basic things they need to do that.</p><p>Low interest rates so they can afford to take out a loan.And confidence that it's worth investing - because the customers will be there, whether at home or abroad.</p><p>Getting the deficit down is essential for both.</p><p>That's why our deficit reduction plan is not an alternative to a growth plan: it's the very foundation of our growth plan.</p><p>It's the only way we'll get Britain on the rise. </p><p>Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working.</p><p>And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>The world economy - especially in the Eurozone - has been much weaker than expected in the past two years.</p><p>When some of our big trading partners like Ireland, Spain and Italy are suffering, they buy less from us. </p><p>That hurts our growth and makes it harder to pay off our debts. </p><p>But here is the crucial thing you need to know. </p><p>Yes it's worse than we thought, yes it's taking longer, but we are making progress.</p><p>Thanks to the grit and resolve of George Osborne, we have cut a quarter off the deficit in the past two years. 25 per cent.\u00a0 </p><p>That's helped to keep interest rates at record low levels, keeping mortgages low.\u00a0 </p><p>Leaving more money in your pockets.\u00a0 </p><p>Giving businesses more confidence to invest.</p><p>Creating more jobs.</p><p>And if you don't believe me, just look at the job creation figures.</p><p>Since this government took office, over one million new jobs have been created in the private sector.</p><p>That is more - net - in the last two years than Labour managed in ten years. </p><p>                     LABOUR                    </p><p>Now, the Labour politicians who got us into the mess say they have a different way out of it.</p><p>They call it Plan B and it goes like this: </p><p>We should stop worrying about deficit reduction, borrow more money and spend it to boost the economy. </p><p>It sounds so reasonable when you put it like that. </p><p>Let me tell you why it's not.</p><p>Right now, while we've got a deficit, the people we're borrowing money from believe that we'll pay it back - because we've set out a tough plan to cut spending and live within our means.</p><p>That's why our interest rates are among the lowest in the world, even though the deficit left to us by Labour was one of the highest in the world.</p><p>If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. </p><p>Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. </p><p>That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.</p><p>If you have a mortgage of \u00a3100,000, just a 1 per cent interest rate rise would mean an extra thousand pounds to pay each year.</p><p>Labour's plan to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and our future.</p><p>And it would squander the sacrifices we've already made.</p><p>We're here because they spent too much and borrowed too much.</p><p>How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing?</p><p>I honestly think Labour haven't learned a single thing.</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Now they're out of office it's:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it's: borrow more money.</p><p>Borrow, borrow, borrow. </p><p>Labour: the party of one notion: more borrowing.</p><p>I sometimes wonder if they know anything about the real economy at all.</p><p>Did you hear what Ed Miliband said last week about taxes?</p><p>He described a tax cut as the government writing people a cheque.</p><p>Ed... Let me explain to you how it works.</p><p>When people earn money, it's their money.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Not the government's money: their money.</p><p>Then, the government takes some of it away in tax.</p><p>So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away.\u00a0 OK?</p><p>And while we're on that - who suffers when the wealthy businessman goes off to live in Geneva? </p><p>Not him - he's paying about half the tax he would do here...</p><p>...it's those who want to work who suffer because the jobs aren't being created here.</p><p>We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden...</p><p>...and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour.</p><p>Under Labour.</p><p>We haven't forgotten, you know. </p><p>We remember who spent our golden legacy, who sold our gold...</p><p>...who busted our banks, who smothered our businesses...</p><p>... who wracked up our debts, who wrecked our economy...</p><p>...who ruined our reputation, who risked our future...</p><p>...who did this? - Labour did this - and this country should never forget it. </p><p>                     ASPIRATION ECONOMY                   </p><p>To get Britain on the rise we need a whole new economy...</p><p>...more enterprising, more aspirational...</p><p>...and it's taking shape already.</p><p>We're getting our entrepreneurial streak back: last year the rate of new business creation was faster than any other year in our history. </p><p>Let me repeat that. </p><p>The rate at which new businesses started - faster than any year on record. </p><p>We're making things again.</p><p>We had a trade surplus in cars last year for the first time in almost 40 years.</p><p>And it's not just the old industries growing, it's the new. </p><p>We're number one in the world for offshore wind.</p><p>Number one in the world for tidal power.</p><p>The world's first green investment bank. </p><p>Britain leading; Britain on the rise.\u00a0 We're showing we can do it.</p><p>Look at the new investment coming in. </p><p>In the last two years, Google, Intel, Cisco - the big tech firms - they've all set up new bases here. </p><p>And we are selling to the world again. </p><p>When I became Prime Minister I said to the Foreign Office: those embassies you've got...</p><p>...turn them into showrooms for our cars, department stores for our fashion, technology hubs for British start-ups.</p><p>Yes, you're diplomats but you need to be our country's salesforce too.</p><p>And look what's happening.</p><p>In just two years, our exports to Brazil are up 25 per cent...</p><p>...to China - 40 per cent...</p><p>...to Russia - 80 per cent. </p><p>There are so many opportunities in this world. </p><p>I want to tell you about one business that's seizing them. </p><p>It's run by a guy called Alastair Lukies. </p><p>He and his business partner saw a world with almost 6 billion mobile phones and just 2 billion bank accounts. </p><p>They saw the huge gap in the market- and they started a mobile banking firm...</p><p>...helping people in the poorest parts of the world manage their money and start new companies.</p><p>He's been with me on trade missions all over the world - and his business is booming. </p><p>Back in 2010, when we came to office, they employed about 100 people - now it's more than 700. </p><p>Then they were nowhere in Africa, nowhere in Asia, now they are the global player, with one million new users every month. </p><p>So don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth. </p><p>And to those who question whether it's right to load up a plane with businesspeople - whether we're flying to Africa, Indonesia, to the Gulf or China...</p><p>...whether we're taking people from energy, finance, technology or yes - defence ...</p><p>...I say - there is a global battle out there to win jobs, orders, contracts...</p><p>...and in that battle I believe in leading from the front. </p><p>To get our economy on the rise there's a lot more to do - and frankly a lot more fights to be had. </p><p>Because there are too many of what I'd call the \"yes-but-no\" people. </p><p>The ones who say \"yes, our businesses need to expand...</p><p>...but no we can't reform planning.\"</p><p>It's simple.</p><p>For a business to expand, it needs places to build.</p><p>If it takes too long, they'll just build elsewhere.</p><p>I visited a business the other day that wanted to open a big factory just outside Liverpool. </p><p>But the council was going to take so long to approve the decision that they're now building that factory on the continent - and taking hundreds of jobs with them. </p><p>If we're going to be a winner in this global race we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all. </p><p>And then there are those who say \"yes of course we need more housing\"...</p><p>...but \"no\" to every development - and not in my backyard.</p><p>Look - it's OK for my generation. Many of us have got on the ladder.</p><p>But you know the average age that someone buys their first home today, without any help for their parents? </p><p>33 years old. </p><p>We are the party of home ownership - we cannot let this carry on.</p><p>So yes - we're doubling the discount for buying your council house...</p><p>...we're helping first-time buyers get a 95 per cent mortgage...</p><p>...but there's something else we need to do - and that's accept we need to build more houses in Britain.</p><p>There are young people who work hard year after year but are still living at home.</p><p>They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own.</p><p>I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>                     WELFARE                   </p><p>If we want our people to rise so Britain can rise, we must tackle welfare.</p><p>Here's two facts for you. </p><p>Fact one.\u00a0 We spend \u00a390 billion a year on welfare for working-age people.</p><p>Not pensions. Just welfare for working age people - and that's one pound in every eight the government spends. </p><p>Fact two.\u00a0 More of our children live in households where nobody works than almost any other nation in Europe.</p><p>Let me put it simply.\u00a0 Welfare isn't working. And this is a tragedy. </p><p>Our reforms are just as profound as those of Beveridge 60 years ago.</p><p>He had his great evils to slay. Squalor. Ignorance. Want. Idleness.\u00a0 And Disease.</p><p>Here are mine.</p><p>First, unfairness.\u00a0 </p><p>What are hard-working people who travel long distances to get into work and pay their taxes meant to think when they see families - individual families - getting 40, 50, 60 thousand pounds of housing benefit to live in homes that these hard working people could never afford themselves?</p><p>It is an outrage. And we are ending it by capping housing benefit. </p><p>The second evil: injustice.</p><p>Here's the choice we give our young people today. </p><p>Choice one: Work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat. And as I've just said, that can feel like forever.</p><p>Or: Don't get a job. Sign on. Don't even need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit. Get a flat. And then don't ever get a job or you'll lose a load of housing benefit.</p><p>We must be crazy.</p><p>So this is what we've done.</p><p>Now you have to have to sign a contract that says: you do your bit and we'll do ours.</p><p>It requires you to have a real CV and it makes clear: you have to seek work and take work - or you will lose your benefit.</p><p>And we're going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too. </p><p>If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?</p><p>The next evil: bureaucracy. </p><p>Sign on. Sign here. Come back in a fortnight.

It is nothing short of state sponsored slavery...\"</p><p>Honestly.

We can do big things.'</p><p>Mr Cameron, who wore a dark suit and a purple tie, was joined by his wife Samantha for the short walk to the conference centre.</p><p>Mrs Cameron wore a navy blue knee-length dress by Joseph, with a grey belt and matching shoes from LK Bennett.</p><p>The PM, who appeared to be struggling with a cold, made repeated references to his family life and upbringing, and sought to tackle head on the criticism from opponents that his wealthy background means he is unable to understand the needs and concerns of ordinary voters.</p><p>                         FIGHTING POVERTY, HELPING THE YOUNG: PM'S SPEECH AT A GLANCE                       </p><p>HEALTH</p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down. And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs. Getting the deficit down is essential.</p><p>LABOUR</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always: Borrow more money. Now they're out of office it's: Borrow more money.</p><p>HOUSING</p><p>Young people who work hard year after year ...are still living at home. They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own. I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>WELFARE</p><p>Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.</p><p>EDUCATION</p><p>I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education. I want more free schools, more Academies, more rigorous exams in every school, more expected of every child.</p><p>TAX</p><p>Ed Miliband... Let me explain to you how it works. When people earn money, it's their money. Not the Government's money: their money. Then, the Government takes some of it away in tax. So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away. OK?</p><p>'Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going,' he said.</p><p>'We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer, by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. </p><p>'We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it.'</p><p>And in an attack on Ed Miliband's One Nation speech at the Labour conference last week he added: 'We don't preach about one nation but practise class war, we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>'The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.'</p><p>He said the Conservative party was not the 'party of the better-off. No, we are the party of the want to be better-off'.</p><p>He added: 'There is nothing complicated about me. I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country.'</p><p>Mr Cameron was introduced on stage by Lord Coe, the mastermind behind the London Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p><p>Mr Cameron was visibly moved and his voice cracked as he spoke of his disabled son Ivan who died in 2009. Mrs Cameron was also seen to be holding back tears.</p><p>'I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did,' he said.</p><p>'When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy. </p><p>'Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair and that's because of what happened here this summer.'</p><p>He said his favourite moment of the Games was presenting a gold medal to Paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds. </p><p>Mr Cameron made a swoop on the London Olympics for political gain, saying it was proof of the need to preserve the Union.</p><p>'There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom? Let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got.'</p><p>He also claimed that the popular Gamesmakers volunteers were proof of his much-ridiculed Big Society concept.</p><p>'I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society - they did it beautifully in just three weeks.'</p><p>After the conference became dominated by speculation about Boris Johnson's leadership ambitions, Mr Cameron paid tribute to the London Mayor, describing him as a the 'the man who put a smile on our face, the zinger on the zip-wire'.</p><p>And he sought to relight the debate on welfare, accusing Labour of being 'cruel' for refusing to support plans to get young people into work.</p><p>He also confirmed plans to consider ending automatic housing benefit for people under 25, saying: 'If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?'</p><p>He also promised to tackle the 'evil bureaucracy' of people signing on every fortnight. </p><p>'What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life? </p><p>'In British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless.'</p><p>He also attacked the 'appalling, snobbish' criticism of the Government's work experience programme which gives young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop or an office.</p><p>'We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance. What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them.</p><p>'Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.'</p><p>In a deeply personal section of the speech, Mr Cameron spoke of the values he had learned from his father, Ian, who died in 2010.</p><p>'I don't have a hard luck story. My dad was a stockbroker from Berkshire,' he said as his voice cracked.</p><p>'It's only when your dad's gone that you realise - not just how much you really miss them - but how much you really owe them. My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought.'</p><p>Mr Cameron added: 'He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they're meant to be. But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life.</p><p>'But Dad was the eternal optimist. To him the glass was always half full. Usually with something alcoholic in it.'</p><p>He said his father's life was 'not a hard luck story, but a hard work story'. He added: 'Work hard. Family comes first. But put back into the community too.</p><p>'And there is nothing complicated about what we need today. But it's tough. These are difficult times. We're being tested.</p><p>'How will we come through it? Again, it's not complicated. Hard work. Strong families. Taking responsibility. Serving others.'</p><p>He said the mission for the Government was 'to build an aspiration nation to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people'.</p><p>On the NHS he said the Government had cut waiting lists, mixed wards, the number of managers and hospital infections.</p><p>'And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS. </p><p>'So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay.'</p><p>Mr Cameron, who celebrated his 46th birthday last night with a curry, took on critics in his party unhappy at the decision to protect the foreign aid budget from cuts, telling delegates British money had vaccinated 130,000 children around the world.</p><p>'You, the Conservative party helped to do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.'</p><p>He urged the audience to give a standing ovation to the armed forces to 'show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do'.</p><p>He claimed that the Government was doing 'big Conservative things' but warned against it giving a 'false sense of security'. </p><p>He said the deficit reduction plan was not an alternative to a growth plan, 'it is the very foundation of our growth plan'.</p><p>'Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working. And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>'If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>'Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.'</p><p>Mr Cameron defended his overseas trips with business leaders, saying he wanted the Foreign Office to use its embassies as showrooms for UK firms.</p><p>'Don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth.'</p><p>Michael Dugher, Labour's shadow cabinet office minister, attacked the speech, saying: 'This was a defensive speech, from an out of touch, clearly rattled leader, who cannot be the One Nation Prime Minister we need.</p><p>'Rather than tackling the banks, or explaining why borrowing is going up not down, he chose to defend his millionaires' tax cut.'</p><p>                     Britain on the rise: <person><nameText>David Cameron's </nameText></person>full speech to the Tory party conference                   </p><p>In May 2010, this party stood on the threshold of power for the first time in more than a decade.</p><p>We knew then that it was not just the ordinary duties of office that we were assuming.</p><p>We were entering into Government at a grave moment in the modern history of Britain.</p><p>At a time when people felt uncertainty, even fear.</p><p>Here was the challenge: To make an insolvent nation solvent again.</p><p>To set our country back on the path to prosperity that all can share in.</p><p>To bring home our troops from danger while keeping our citizens safe from terror.</p><p>To mend a broken society.</p><p>Two and a half years later of course I can't tell you that all is well, but I can say this:</p><p>Britain is on the right track.</p><p>As Prime Minister it has fallen to me to say some hard things and to help our country face some hard truths.</p><p>All of my adult life, whatever the difficulties, the British people have at least been confident about one thing. </p><p>We have thought we can pay our way.\u00a0 That we can earn our living as a major industrial country...</p><p>...and we will always remain one.</p><p>It has fallen to us to say - we cannot assume that any longer. </p><p>Unless we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it has been in the past.</p><p>Because the truth is this.\u00a0 We are in a global race today. And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. Sink or swim. Do or decline. </p><p>To take office at such a moment is a duty and an honour...</p><p>...and we will rise to the challenge.</p><p>Today I'm going to set out a serious argument to this country about how we do that.</p><p>How we compete and thrive in this world...</p><p>...how we can make sure in this century, like the ones before, Britain is on the rise.</p><p>Nothing matters more. </p><p>Every battle we fight, every plan we make, every decision we take is to achieve that end...</p><p>...Britain on the rise.</p><p>                     BRITAIN CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>Though the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. </p><p>Why? Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things.\u00a0 We saw it this summer. </p><p>The Jubilee, the Olympics, the Paralympics...</p><p>...the best country in the world...</p><p>...and let's say it: with our Queen, the finest Head of State on earth.</p><p>I was trying to think of my favourite moment. </p><p>Was it telling President Hollande that no, we hadn't cheated at the cycling, we didn't have rounder wheels, it was just that we peddled faster than the French?</p><p>No... for me it was seeing that young woman who swam her heart out for years... </p><p>...nine training sessions a week, two hours a time.</p><p>My best moment was putting that gold medal around the neck of Ellie Simmonds.\u00a0 </p><p>And I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did. </p><p>When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy.</p><p>Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair - and that's because of what happened here this summer.</p><p>And the Olympics showed us something else. </p><p>Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland, they draped themselves in one flag. </p><p>Now, there's one person who didn't like that and he's called Alex Salmond. </p><p>I'm going to see him on Monday to sort that referendum on independence by the end of 2014. </p><p>There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got. </p><p>There are so many people to thank for this summer.</p><p>Those that won the bid, those that built the stadia, that ran the Games and of course: the man who put a smile on our faces, the zinger on the zip-wire, the Conservative Mayor of London: our Boris Johnson. </p><p>And those Games-Makers. You know, I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society they did it beautifully in just three weeks.</p><p>There is another group of people who stepped into the breach this summer - and we in this party never forget them.</p><p>Our armed forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for over ten years now.</p><p>433 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>Just last weekend there was a memorial service for one of the fallen, and the eulogy said this:</p><p>\"All that they had they gave. All that they might have had. All that they had ever been. All that they might ever have become.\"</p><p>For all those who serve, and their families, I repeat the commitment I made when this Government came to office. </p><p>By the end of 2014, all UK combat operations in Afghanistan will have come to an end. </p><p>Nearly all our troops will be home - their country proud, their duty done and let everyone in this hall stand and show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do. </p><p>                     CONSERVATIVES CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>To meet the challenges our country faces, we must have confidence in ourselves... confidence as a party.</p><p>We've been in office two and a half years now - and we've done some big, life-changing things.</p><p>Just ask Clive Stone, who you saw in a film earlier. </p><p>I met him years ago, when we were in Opposition. </p><p>He had cancer and he said to me: the drug I need - it's out there but they won't give it to me because it's too expensive please, if you get in, do something about it. </p><p>And we have. A new cancer drugs fund that has got the latest drugs to more than 21,000 people and counting. There was a reason we could do that. </p><p>It's because we made a big decision to protect the NHS from spending cuts. No other party made that commitment. </p><p>Not Labour. Not the Liberal Democrats. Just us - the Conservatives. To all those people who said we'd bring the NHS down...I say......well, yes, you've got a point.</p><p>I'll tell you what is down.</p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down.</p><p>And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay. </p><p>We made a big decision to go on saving lives abroad too. </p><p>I know some are sceptical about our aid budget. </p><p>But picture the scene - you're in a health centre in Kinshasa. </p><p>See the child with a needle in her arm, being injected with a Yellow Fever vaccine the difference between living and dying how can anyone tell me that's a waste of money. </p><p>Since we gathered here in Birmingham on Sunday, British aid money has vaccinated 130 thousand children around the world. One hundred and thirty thousand children.</p><p>You, the Conservative party helped do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.\u00a0 </p><p>Here's something else this party's done in government. </p><p>Last December I was at a European Council in Brussels. </p><p>It was three in the morning, there was a treaty on the table that was not in Britain's interests and twenty five people around that table were telling me to sign it.</p><p>But I did something that no other British leader has ever done before. </p><p>I said no - Britain comes first - and I vetoed that EU treaty.</p><p>We're doing big, Conservative things. </p><p>For years people said you'll never reform public sector pensions, the trade unions won't stand for it.</p><p>Well, we've done it, and it's going to cut the cost to the taxpayer almost in half. </p><p>For years people said benefits are out of control and there's nothing you can do about it.</p><p>Well, because of our welfare cap, no family will be getting more in benefits than the average family earns. </p><p>For years people asked why we couldn't get rid of those radical preachers who spout hatred about Britain while living off the taxpayer...</p><p>...well, Theresa May - a great Home Secretary - has done it - and she's got Abu Hamza on that plane and out of our country to face justice. </p><p>Be proud of what we've done already.</p><p>Two million of the lowest-paid workers being taken out of income tax altogether.</p><p>Over eighteen million households helped with a freeze in their council tax - and we're freezing it all over again next year too.</p><p>                     BRITAIN ON THE RISE                   </p><p>Big, Conservative things - delivered by this government; made possible by this party.</p><p>We can deliver. We can do big things. </p><p>The Olympics reminded us how great it feels to be successful.</p><p>But we mustn't let that warm glow give us a false sense of security.</p><p>All around the world, countries are on the rise.</p><p>Yes, we've been hearing about China and India for years but it's hard to believe what's happening in Brazil, in Indonesia, in Nigeria too.</p><p>Meanwhile, the old powers are on the slide.</p><p>What do the countries on the rise have in common?</p><p>They are lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future - on education, incredible infrastructure and technology.</p><p>And what do the countries on the slide have in common?</p><p>They're fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services.</p><p>I sit in those European Council meetings where we talk endlessly about Greece while on the other side of the world, China is moving so fast it's creating a new economy the size of Greece every three months.\u00a0 </p><p>I am not going to stand here as Prime Minister and allow this country to join the slide.</p><p>My job - our job - is to make sure that in this twenty first century, as in the centuries that came before, our country, Britain, is on the rise.</p><p>And we here know how that is done.</p><p>It is the collective result of individual effort and aspiration, the ideas you have, the businesses you start, the hours you put in.</p><p>Aspiration is the engine of progress.</p><p>Countries rise when they allow their people to rise.</p><p>In this world where brains matter more, where technologies shape our lives, where no-one is owed a living...</p><p>...the most powerful natural resource we have is our people. </p><p>Not just the scientists, the entrepreneurs, the engineers...</p><p>...not just the teachers, the parents, the nurses...</p><p>...but all our people: including the poorest, those who've never had a job, never had a chance, never had hope. </p><p>That's why the mission for this government is to build an aspiration nation...</p><p>...to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people. </p><p>And for us Conservatives, this is not just an economic mission - it's also a moral one.</p><p>It's not just about growth and GDP...</p><p>...it's what's always made our hearts beat faster - aspiration; people rising from the bottom to the top.</p><p>Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going. </p><p>We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer...</p><p>...by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. </p><p>We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it. </p><p>Let me put that another way.</p><p>We don't preach about one nation but practise class war...</p><p>...we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.</p><p>While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you.</p><p>They call us the party of the better-off...</p><p>...no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families - and we should never, ever be ashamed of saying so.</p><p>                     THE RIGHT IDEAS                   </p><p>This party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve.</p><p>Conservatives think: let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it. It's not our style. </p><p>But there's a problem with that. </p><p>It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are: the cartoon Conservatives who don't care. </p><p>My mission from the day I became leader was to change that.</p><p>Yes, to show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.</p><p>But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.</p><p>That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.</p><p>Because it's not enough to know our ideas are right - we've got to explain why they are compassionate too.</p><p>Because we know what we're up against. </p><p>We say we've got to get the private sector bigger and the public sector smaller...our opponents call it 'Tory cuts, slashing the state'.</p><p>No: it's the best way to create the sustainable jobs people need.</p><p>We say help people become independent from welfare...our opponents call it: 'cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves.'</p><p>No: there is only one real route out of poverty and it is work.</p><p>We say we've got to insist on a disciplined, rigorous education for our children...our opponents call it: 'elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.' </p><p>No: a decent education is the only way to give all our children a proper start in this world.</p><p>The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we're the same old Tories who want to help the rich...</p><p>...it's because we're the Tories whose ideas help everyone - the poorest the most.</p><p>A strong private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach. </p><p>These three things are essential to helping our people rise.</p><p>They are essential to our success in this world. </p><p>And you know what - Labour will fight them all the way. </p><p>So these things are not just the battle-ground for Britain's future...</p><p>...they are also the battle-lines for the next election - and it is a fight we've got to win, for our party and our country.</p><p>                     ECONOMY                   </p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs.</p><p>We need businesses, of every size, in every type of industry, in every part of the country - investing and taking people on.</p><p>There are some basic things they need to do that.</p><p>Low interest rates so they can afford to take out a loan.And confidence that it's worth investing - because the customers will be there, whether at home or abroad.</p><p>Getting the deficit down is essential for both.</p><p>That's why our deficit reduction plan is not an alternative to a growth plan: it's the very foundation of our growth plan.</p><p>It's the only way we'll get Britain on the rise. </p><p>Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working.</p><p>And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>The world economy - especially in the Eurozone - has been much weaker than expected in the past two years.</p><p>When some of our big trading partners like Ireland, Spain and Italy are suffering, they buy less from us. </p><p>That hurts our growth and makes it harder to pay off our debts. </p><p>But here is the crucial thing you need to know. </p><p>Yes it's worse than we thought, yes it's taking longer, but we are making progress.</p><p>Thanks to the grit and resolve of George Osborne, we have cut a quarter off the deficit in the past two years. 25 per cent.\u00a0 </p><p>That's helped to keep interest rates at record low levels, keeping mortgages low.\u00a0 </p><p>Leaving more money in your pockets.\u00a0 </p><p>Giving businesses more confidence to invest.</p><p>Creating more jobs.</p><p>And if you don't believe me, just look at the job creation figures.</p><p>Since this government took office, over one million new jobs have been created in the private sector.</p><p>That is more - net - in the last two years than Labour managed in ten years. </p><p>                     LABOUR                    </p><p>Now, the Labour politicians who got us into the mess say they have a different way out of it.</p><p>They call it Plan B and it goes like this: </p><p>We should stop worrying about deficit reduction, borrow more money and spend it to boost the economy. </p><p>It sounds so reasonable when you put it like that. </p><p>Let me tell you why it's not.</p><p>Right now, while we've got a deficit, the people we're borrowing money from believe that we'll pay it back - because we've set out a tough plan to cut spending and live within our means.</p><p>That's why our interest rates are among the lowest in the world, even though the deficit left to us by Labour was one of the highest in the world.</p><p>If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. </p><p>Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. </p><p>That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.</p><p>If you have a mortgage of \u00a3100,000, just a 1 per cent interest rate rise would mean an extra thousand pounds to pay each year.</p><p>Labour's plan to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and our future.</p><p>And it would squander the sacrifices we've already made.</p><p>We're here because they spent too much and borrowed too much.</p><p>How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing?</p><p>I honestly think Labour haven't learned a single thing.</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Now they're out of office it's:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it's: borrow more money.</p><p>Borrow, borrow, borrow. </p><p>Labour: the party of one notion: more borrowing.</p><p>I sometimes wonder if they know anything about the real economy at all.</p><p>Did you hear what Ed Miliband said last week about taxes?</p><p>He described a tax cut as the government writing people a cheque.</p><p>Ed... Let me explain to you how it works.</p><p>When people earn money, it's their money.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Not the government's money: their money.</p><p>Then, the government takes some of it away in tax.</p><p>So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away.\u00a0 OK?</p><p>And while we're on that - who suffers when the wealthy businessman goes off to live in Geneva? </p><p>Not him - he's paying about half the tax he would do here...</p><p>...it's those who want to work who suffer because the jobs aren't being created here.</p><p>We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden...</p><p>...and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour.</p><p>Under Labour.</p><p>We haven't forgotten, you know. </p><p>We remember who spent our golden legacy, who sold our gold...</p><p>...who busted our banks, who smothered our businesses...</p><p>... who wracked up our debts, who wrecked our economy...</p><p>...who ruined our reputation, who risked our future...</p><p>...who did this? - Labour did this - and this country should never forget it. </p><p>                     ASPIRATION ECONOMY                   </p><p>To get Britain on the rise we need a whole new economy...</p><p>...more enterprising, more aspirational...</p><p>...and it's taking shape already.</p><p>We're getting our entrepreneurial streak back: last year the rate of new business creation was faster than any other year in our history. </p><p>Let me repeat that. </p><p>The rate at which new businesses started - faster than any year on record. </p><p>We're making things again.</p><p>We had a trade surplus in cars last year for the first time in almost 40 years.</p><p>And it's not just the old industries growing, it's the new. </p><p>We're number one in the world for offshore wind.</p><p>Number one in the world for tidal power.</p><p>The world's first green investment bank. </p><p>Britain leading; Britain on the rise.\u00a0 We're showing we can do it.</p><p>Look at the new investment coming in. </p><p>In the last two years, Google, Intel, Cisco - the big tech firms - they've all set up new bases here. </p><p>And we are selling to the world again. </p><p>When I became Prime Minister I said to the Foreign Office: those embassies you've got...</p><p>...turn them into showrooms for our cars, department stores for our fashion, technology hubs for British start-ups.</p><p>Yes, you're diplomats but you need to be our country's salesforce too.</p><p>And look what's happening.</p><p>In just two years, our exports to Brazil are up 25 per cent...</p><p>...to China - 40 per cent...</p><p>...to Russia - 80 per cent. </p><p>There are so many opportunities in this world. </p><p>I want to tell you about one business that's seizing them. </p><p>It's run by a guy called Alastair Lukies. </p><p>He and his business partner saw a world with almost 6 billion mobile phones and just 2 billion bank accounts. </p><p>They saw the huge gap in the market- and they started a mobile banking firm...</p><p>...helping people in the poorest parts of the world manage their money and start new companies.</p><p>He's been with me on trade missions all over the world - and his business is booming. </p><p>Back in 2010, when we came to office, they employed about 100 people - now it's more than 700. </p><p>Then they were nowhere in Africa, nowhere in Asia, now they are the global player, with one million new users every month. </p><p>So don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth. </p><p>And to those who question whether it's right to load up a plane with businesspeople - whether we're flying to Africa, Indonesia, to the Gulf or China...</p><p>...whether we're taking people from energy, finance, technology or yes - defence ...</p><p>...I say - there is a global battle out there to win jobs, orders, contracts...</p><p>...and in that battle I believe in leading from the front. </p><p>To get our economy on the rise there's a lot more to do - and frankly a lot more fights to be had. </p><p>Because there are too many of what I'd call the \"yes-but-no\" people. </p><p>The ones who say \"yes, our businesses need to expand...</p><p>...but no we can't reform planning.\"</p><p>It's simple.</p><p>For a business to expand, it needs places to build.</p><p>If it takes too long, they'll just build elsewhere.</p><p>I visited a business the other day that wanted to open a big factory just outside Liverpool. </p><p>But the council was going to take so long to approve the decision that they're now building that factory on the continent - and taking hundreds of jobs with them. </p><p>If we're going to be a winner in this global race we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all. </p><p>And then there are those who say \"yes of course we need more housing\"...</p><p>...but \"no\" to every development - and not in my backyard.</p><p>Look - it's OK for my generation. Many of us have got on the ladder.</p><p>But you know the average age that someone buys their first home today, without any help for their parents? </p><p>33 years old. </p><p>We are the party of home ownership - we cannot let this carry on.</p><p>So yes - we're doubling the discount for buying your council house...</p><p>...we're helping first-time buyers get a 95 per cent mortgage...</p><p>...but there's something else we need to do - and that's accept we need to build more houses in Britain.</p><p>There are young people who work hard year after year but are still living at home.</p><p>They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own.</p><p>I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>                     WELFARE                   </p><p>If we want our people to rise so Britain can rise, we must tackle welfare.</p><p>Here's two facts for you. </p><p>Fact one.\u00a0 We spend \u00a390 billion a year on welfare for working-age people.</p><p>Not pensions. Just welfare for working age people - and that's one pound in every eight the government spends. </p><p>Fact two.\u00a0 More of our children live in households where nobody works than almost any other nation in Europe.</p><p>Let me put it simply.\u00a0 Welfare isn't working. And this is a tragedy. </p><p>Our reforms are just as profound as those of Beveridge 60 years ago.</p><p>He had his great evils to slay. Squalor. Ignorance. Want. Idleness.\u00a0 And Disease.</p><p>Here are mine.</p><p>First, unfairness.\u00a0 </p><p>What are hard-working people who travel long distances to get into work and pay their taxes meant to think when they see families - individual families - getting 40, 50, 60 thousand pounds of housing benefit to live in homes that these hard working people could never afford themselves?</p><p>It is an outrage. And we are ending it by capping housing benefit. </p><p>The second evil: injustice.</p><p>Here's the choice we give our young people today. </p><p>Choice one: Work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat. And as I've just said, that can feel like forever.</p><p>Or: Don't get a job. Sign on. Don't even need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit. Get a flat. And then don't ever get a job or you'll lose a load of housing benefit.</p><p>We must be crazy.</p><p>So this is what we've done.</p><p>Now you have to have to sign a contract that says: you do your bit and we'll do ours.</p><p>It requires you to have a real CV and it makes clear: you have to seek work and take work - or you will lose your benefit.</p><p>And we're going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too. </p><p>If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?</p><p>The next evil: bureaucracy. </p><p>Sign on. Sign here. Come back in a fortnight. Repeat as required.</p><p>What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life? </p><p>For people like him we're doing something new. </p><p>The Work Programme takes the money we're going to save from getting people off the dole...</p><p>...and uses it today to get them into work, with proper training.</p><p>We're spending up to \u00a314,000 on one individual to get them into work - and already almost 700,000 people have got onto the Work Programme.</p><p>So let's be clear: in British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless...</p><p>...and with Iain Duncan Smith leading this revolution let this be the party that shows there is ability and promise in everyone. </p><p>And just one more thing on welfare.</p><p>You know our work experience programme, where we give young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop, an office?</p><p>Here's what one union official said about it. </p><p>I quote: \"The scheme belongs back in the nineteenth century, along with Oliver Twist and the workhouse. It is nothing short of state sponsored slavery...\"</p><p>Honestly. What an appalling, snobbish attitude to the idea of work. </p><p>We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance. </p><p>What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them.</p><p>Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery...</p><p>...and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.</p><p>                     EDUCATION                    </p><p>To help people to rise, to help Britain rise, there's a third - crucial - thing we must do. </p><p>Educate all our children.</p><p>And I mean really educate them, not just pump up the grades each year. </p><p>In maths, in science, in reading, we've fallen behind...</p><p>...not just behind Germany and Canada but Estonia and Australia too. </p><p>This is Britain's real school report and the verdict is clear: must try harder. </p><p>You've heard of pushy parents, sharp-elbowing their way to a better education for their kids? </p><p>Well - this is a pushy government. </p><p>My approach is very simple. </p><p>I've got two children in primary school, and I want for your children what I want for mine. </p><p>To go to schools where discipline is strict, expectations are high and no excuses are accepted for failure.</p><p>I don't want great schools to just be the preserve of those that can pay the fees, or buy the nice house in the right catchment area...</p><p>...I want those schools to be open to every child - in every neighbourhood.</p><p>And the reason I know that every child can go to a school like that is because with this Government, more and more new ones are opening.</p><p>We've heard from some of them this week...</p><p>...not just the 79 new free schools - with over a hundred more to come...</p><p>...but from some of the more than 2000 academies we've helped create - state schools given all the freedoms, and carrying all the high expectations, of private schools.</p><p>Yes - that's my plan - millions of children sent to independent schools...</p><p>...independent schools, in the state sector.</p><p>That's the genuine revolution that's now underway.</p><p>The Harris Academy in Peckham has increased the number of students getting five good GCSEs - from 12 percent when it was under local authority control to almost 90 percent now. </p><p>The transformation has been astonishing - and the methods have been Conservative.</p><p>Smart uniforms, teachers in suits.</p><p>Children taught physics, chemistry and biology not soft options.</p><p>Children set by ability - with excellence applauded, extra resources for those most in need but no excuses for slacking.</p><p>When you see a school like that succeed it prompts the question:</p><p>Why can't every school be that way? Why can't every child have those chances?</p><p>It's not because parents aren't ambitious enough - most of these schools are massively over-subscribed. </p><p>It's because the old educational establishment - the left-wing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists - stood in the way.</p><p>When we saw a badly failing school in Haringey and wanted to turn it into an Academy, the Labour authority, the Labour MP and the teaching unions said no. </p><p>When inspirational teachers and parents - in Hammersmith, in Norwich, in Bristol and in Wigan - wanted to open free schools, the left-wing establishment said no.</p><p>When we proposed: More pay for good teachers... Getting rid of bad teachers...</p><p>...Longer school days to help children learn... Flexible school hours to help parents work...</p><p>...More stretching exams for those who're really able... Less nonsense about health and safety...</p><p>...the left-wing establishment have said just one thing: No.</p><p>When you ask them: why is a school failing? Why aren't the children succeeding? </p><p>You hear the same thing over and over again.</p><p>'What can you expect with children like these?' they say.\u00a0 'These children are disadvantaged.'</p><p>Of course we want to tackle every disadvantage. </p><p>But isn't the greatest disadvantage of all being written off by those so in hock to a culture of low expectations that they have forgotten what it's like to be ambitious, to want to transcend your background, to overcome circumstance and succeed on your own terms?</p><p>It's that toxic culture of low expectations - that lack of ambition for every child - which has held this country back.</p><p>Well, Michael Gove and I are not waiting for an outbreak of sanity in the headquarters of the NUT or an embrace of aspiration in the higher reaches of Labour before we act.</p><p>Because our children can't wait.</p><p>So when people say we should slow down our education reforms - so adults can adjust to them, I say:</p><p>I want more free schools, more Academies, more rigorous exams in every school, more expected of every child.</p><p>And to all those people who say: he wants children to have the kind of education he had at his posh school... </p><p>...I say: yes - you're absolutely right. </p><p>I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education.</p><p>I'm not here to defend privilege, I'm here to spread it.</p><p>I don't have a hard luck story.</p><p>My dad was a stockbroker from Berkshire.</p><p>It's only when your dad's gone that you realise - not just how much you really miss them - but how much you really owe them.\u00a0 </p><p>My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought.</p><p>He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they're meant to be.\u00a0 But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life.</p><p>Because disability in the 1930s was such a stigma, he was an only child.\u00a0 Probably a lonely child.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>But Dad was the eternal optimist.\u00a0 To him the glass was always half full.\u00a0 Usually with something alcoholic in it.</p><p>When I was a boy I remember once going on a long walk with him in the village where we lived, passing the church he supported and the village hall where he took part in interminable parish council meetings.\u00a0 </p><p>He told me what he was most proud of.\u00a0 </p><p>It was simple - working hard from the moment he left school and providing a good start in life for his family.\u00a0 </p><p>Not just all of us, but helping his mum too, when his father ran off.</p><p>Not a hard luck story, but a hard work story.\u00a0 </p><p>Work hard.\u00a0 Family comes first.\u00a0 But put back in to the community too.</p><p>There is nothing complicated about me.</p><p>I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country.</p><p>And there is nothing complicated about what we need today.</p><p>This is still the greatest country on earth.\u00a0 We showed that again this summer.\u00a0 22nd in world population.\u00a0 3rd in the medals table.\u00a0 </p><p>But it's tough.\u00a0 These are difficult times.\u00a0 We're being tested.\u00a0 </p><p>How will we come through it?\u00a0 Again, it's not complicated.</p><p>Hard work.\u00a0 Strong families.\u00a0 Taking responsibility.\u00a0 Serving others.</p><p>As I said on the steps of No10 Downing Street before walking through that door:\u00a0 Those who can should, those who can't we will always help.</p><p>The job of this party ... of this government ... is to help to bring out the best in this country.\u00a0 Because at our best we're unbeatable.</p><p>We know Britain can deliver because we've seen it time and again. </p><p>This is the country that ... invented the computer, defeated the Nazis, started the web, saw off the slave trade, unravelled DNA and fought off every invader for a thousand years.</p><p>We even persuaded the Queen to jump out of a helicopter to make the rest of the world smile .... there is absolutely nothing we cannot do.</p><p>Can we make Britain the best place in the world to start a business, grow a business and help that business take on the world and win?\u00a0 Yes.</p><p>Can we - the people who invented the welfare state in the first place - turn it into something that rewards effort, helps keep families together and really helps the poorest with a new start in life.\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 </p><p>Can we take our schools and turn out students that will take on the brightest in the world?\u00a0 Yes.

Tough decisions, taken. Growth, fired up. Aspiration, backed all the way.\u00a0 </p><p>'We know what it takes to win in the tough world of today, to win for all our people, to win for Britain.\u00a0 So let's get out there and do it.'</p><p>Mr Cameron told more than 2,000 people in Birmingham's Symphony Hall that he did not have a 'hard luck story'.</p><p>Stung by criticism of Tories appearing out of touch and dispassionate, Mr Cameron told party members they had to explain how Conservative policies are 'compassionate'.</p><p>'My mission from the day I became leader was to.. show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.</p><p>'But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.</p><p>'That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.'</p><p>He said that the coalition was was formed in May 2010 at 'a grave moment in the modern history of Britain'.</p><p>He said the government had a challenge 'to make an insolvent nation solvent again, to set our country back on the path to prosperity that all can share in, to bring home our troops from danger while keeping our citizens safe from terror, to mend a broken society.'</p><p>The Prime Minister admitted he could not now say 'all is well' but he could say: 'Britain is on the right track.'</p><p>In a lengthy introduction New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg hailed Mr Cameron as a 'gold medal Prime Minister' who was 'not afraid to lead'.</p><p>Mr Cameron said: 'As Prime Minister it has fallen to me to say some hard things and to help our country face some hard truths.</p><p>'Unless we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it has been in the past.</p><p>'Because the truth is this. We are in a global race today.</p><p> 'And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. </p><p>'Sink or swim. Do or decline.'</p><p>In an attempt to strike a more upbeat tone, Mr Cameron went on: 'Though the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. Why? Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things.'</p><p>Mr Cameron, who wore a dark suit and a purple tie, was joined by his wife Samantha for the short walk to the conference centre.</p><p>Mrs Cameron wore a navy blue knee-length dress Joseph, with a grey belt and matching shoes from LK Bennett.</p><p>The PM, who appeared to be struggling with a cold, made repeated references to his family life and upbringing, and sought to tackle head on the criticism from opponents that his wealthy background means he is unable to understand the needs and concerns of ordinary voters.</p><p>'Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going,' he said.</p><p>We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer, by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. </p><p>'We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it.'</p><p>And in an attack on Ed Miliband's One Nation speech at the Labour conference last week he added: 'We don't preach about one nation but practise class war, we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>'The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.'</p><p>He said the Conservative party was not the 'party of the better-off. No, we are the party of the want to be better-off'.</p><p>He added: 'There is nothing complicated about me. I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country.'</p><p>Mr Cameron was introduced on stage by Lord Coe, the mastermind behind the London Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p><p>Mr Cameron was visibly moved and his voice cracked as he spoke of his disabled son Ivan who died in 2009. Mrs Cameron was also seen to be holding back tears.</p><p>'I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did,' he said.</p><p>'When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy. </p><p>'Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair and that's because of what happened here this summer.'</p><p>He said his favourite moment of the Games was presenting a gold medal to Paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds.</p><p>Mr Cameron made a swoop on the London Olympics for political gain, saying it was proof of the need to preserve the Union.</p><p>'There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom. Let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got.'</p><p>He also claimed that the popular Gamesmakers volunteers were proof of his much-ridiculed Big Society concept.</p><p>'I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society they did it beautifully in just three weeks.'</p><p>After the conference became dominated by speculation about Boris Johnson's leadership ambitions,</p><p>Mr Cameron paid tribute to the London Mayor, describing him as a the 'the man who put a smile on our face, the zinger on the zip-wire'.</p><p>Mr Cameron, who celebrated his 46th birthday last night with a curry, arrived on stage to the strains of The Killers, his favourite band.</p><p>Mr Cameron sought to recast the debate on welfare, accusing Labour of being 'cruel' for refusing to support plans to get young people into work.</p><p>He confirmed plans to consider ending automatic housing benefit for people under 25.</p><p>'If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?'</p><p>He also promised to tackle the 'evil bureaucracy' of people signing on every fortnight. </p><p>'What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life? </p><p>'In British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless.</p><p>He also attacked the 'appalling, snobbish' criticism of the government's work experience programme which gives young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop, an office.</p><p>'We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance.\u00a0 What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them.</p><p>'Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.'</p><p>In a deeply personal section of the speech, Mr Cameron spoke of the values he had learned from his father, Ian, who died in 2010.</p><p>'I don't have a hard luck story. My dad was a stockbroker from Berkshire,' he said as his voice cracked.</p><p>'It's only when your dad's gone that you realise - not just how much you really miss them - but how much you really owe them.\u00a0 My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought.'</p><p>Mr Cameron added: 'He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they're meant to be.\u00a0 But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life.</p><p>'But Dad was the eternal optimist.\u00a0 To him the glass was always half full.\u00a0 Usually with something alcoholic in it.'</p><p>He said his father's life was 'not a hard luck story, but a hard work story'. He added: 'Work hard. Family comes first. But put back into the community too.'</p><p>'And there is nothing complicated about what we need today. But it's tough. These are difficult times. We're being tested.</p><p>'How will we come through it? Again, it's not complicated. Hard work. Strong families. Taking responsibility. Serving others.'</p><p>He said the mission for the government was 'to build an aspiration nation to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people'.</p><p>On the NHS he said the government had cut waiting lists, mixed wards, the number of managers\u00a0 and hospital infections.</p><p>'And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS. </p><p>'So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay.'</p><p>Mr Cameron took on critics in his party unhappy at the decision to protect the foreign aid budget from cuts, telling delegates British money had vaccinated 130,000 children around the world.</p><p>'You, the Conservative party helped to do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.'</p><p>He urged the audience to give a standing ovation to the armed forces to 'show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do'.</p><p>He claimed that the government was doing 'big Conservative things' but warned against it giving a 'false sense of security'. He said the deficit reduction plan was not an alternative to a growth plan, 'it is the very foundation of our growth plan'.</p><p>'Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working. And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>'If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>'Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.'</p><p>Mr Cameron defended his overseas trips with business leaders, saying he wanted the Foreign Office to use its embassies as showrooms for UK firms.</p><p>'Don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth.'</p><p>Michael Dugher, Labour's shadow cabinet office minister, said: ;This was a defensive speech, from an out of touch, clearly rattled leader, who cannot be the One Nation Prime Minister we need.</p><p>'Rather than tackling the banks, or explaining why borrowing is going up not down, he chose to defend his millionaires' tax cut.'</p><p>                     VIDEO: <person><nameText>David Cameron </nameText></person>delivers his speech to the Conservative conference                   </p><p>                     Britain on the rise: <person><nameText>David Cameron's </nameText></person>full speech to the Tory party conference                   </p><p>In May 2010, this party stood on the threshold of power for the first time in more than a decade.</p><p>We knew then that it was not just the ordinary duties of office that we were assuming.</p><p>We were entering into Government at a grave moment in the modern history of Britain.</p><p>At a time when people felt uncertainty, even fear.</p><p>Here was the challenge: To make an insolvent nation solvent again.</p><p>To set our country back on the path to prosperity that all can share in.</p><p>To bring home our troops from danger while keeping our citizens safe from terror.</p><p>To mend a broken society.</p><p>Two and a half years later of course I can't tell you that all is well, but I can say this:</p><p>Britain is on the right track.</p><p>As Prime Minister it has fallen to me to say some hard things and to help our country face some hard truths.</p><p>All of my adult life, whatever the difficulties, the British people have at least been confident about one thing. </p><p>We have thought we can pay our way.\u00a0 That we can earn our living as a major industrial country...</p><p>...and we will always remain one.</p><p>It has fallen to us to say - we cannot assume that any longer. </p><p>Unless we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it has been in the past.</p><p>Because the truth is this.\u00a0 We are in a global race today. And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. Sink or swim. Do or decline. </p><p>To take office at such a moment is a duty and an honour...</p><p>...and we will rise to the challenge.</p><p>Today I'm going to set out a serious argument to this country about how we do that.</p><p>How we compete and thrive in this world...</p><p>...how we can make sure in this century, like the ones before, Britain is on the rise.</p><p>Nothing matters more. </p><p>Every battle we fight, every plan we make, every decision we take is to achieve that end...</p><p>...Britain on the rise.</p><p>                     BRITAIN CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>Though the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. </p><p>Why? Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things.\u00a0 We saw it this summer. </p><p>The Jubilee, the Olympics, the Paralympics...</p><p>...the best country in the world...</p><p>...and let's say it: with our Queen, the finest Head of State on earth.</p><p>I was trying to think of my favourite moment. </p><p>Was it telling President Hollande that no, we hadn't cheated at the cycling, we didn't have rounder wheels, it was just that we peddled faster than the French?</p><p>No... for me it was seeing that young woman who swam her heart out for years... </p><p>...nine training sessions a week, two hours a time.</p><p>My best moment was putting that gold medal around the neck of Ellie Simmonds.\u00a0 </p><p>And I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did. </p><p>When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy.</p><p>Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair - and that's because of what happened here this summer.</p><p>And the Olympics showed us something else. </p><p>Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland, they draped themselves in one flag. </p><p>Now, there's one person who didn't like that and he's called Alex Salmond. </p><p>I'm going to see him on Monday to sort that referendum on independence by the end of 2014. </p><p>There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got. </p><p>There are so many people to thank for this summer.</p><p>Those that won the bid, those that built the stadia, that ran the Games and of course: the man who put a smile on our faces, the zinger on the zip-wire, the Conservative Mayor of London: our Boris Johnson. </p><p>And those Games-Makers. You know, I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society they did it beautifully in just three weeks.</p><p>There is another group of people who stepped into the breach this summer - and we in this party never forget them.</p><p>Our armed forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for over ten years now.</p><p>433 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>Just last weekend there was a memorial service for one of the fallen, and the eulogy said this:</p><p>\"All that they had they gave. All that they might have had. All that they had ever been. All that they might ever have become.\"</p><p>For all those who serve, and their families, I repeat the commitment I made when this Government came to office. </p><p>By the end of 2014, all UK combat operations in Afghanistan will have come to an end. </p><p>Nearly all our troops will be home - their country proud, their duty done and let everyone in this hall stand and show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do. </p><p>                     CONSERVATIVES CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>To meet the challenges our country faces, we must have confidence in ourselves... confidence as a party.</p><p>We've been in office two and a half years now - and we've done some big, life-changing things.</p><p>Just ask Clive Stone, who you saw in a film earlier. </p><p>I met him years ago, when we were in Opposition. </p><p>He had cancer and he said to me: the drug I need - it's out there but they won't give it to me because it's too expensive please, if you get in, do something about it. </p><p>And we have. A new cancer drugs fund that has got the latest drugs to more than 21,000 people and counting. There was a reason we could do that. </p><p>It's because we made a big decision to protect the NHS from spending cuts. No other party made that commitment. </p><p>Not Labour. Not the Liberal Democrats. Just us - the Conservatives. To all those people who said we'd bring the NHS down...I say......well, yes, you've got a point.</p><p>I'll tell you what is down.</p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down.</p><p>And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay. </p><p>We made a big decision to go on saving lives abroad too. </p><p>I know some are sceptical about our aid budget. </p><p>But picture the scene - you're in a health centre in Kinshasa. </p><p>See the child with a needle in her arm, being injected with a Yellow Fever vaccine the difference between living and dying how can anyone tell me that's a waste of money. </p><p>Since we gathered here in Birmingham on Sunday, British aid money has vaccinated 130 thousand children around the world. One hundred and thirty thousand children.</p><p>You, the Conservative party helped do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.\u00a0 </p><p>Here's something else this party's done in government. </p><p>Last December I was at a European Council in Brussels. </p><p>It was three in the morning, there was a treaty on the table that was not in Britain's interests and twenty five people around that table were telling me to sign it.</p><p>But I did something that no other British leader has ever done before. </p><p>I said no - Britain comes first - and I vetoed that EU treaty.</p><p>We're doing big, Conservative things. </p><p>For years people said you'll never reform public sector pensions, the trade unions won't stand for it.</p><p>Well, we've done it, and it's going to cut the cost to the taxpayer almost in half. </p><p>For years people said benefits are out of control and there's nothing you can do about it.</p><p>Well, because of our welfare cap, no family will be getting more in benefits than the average family earns. </p><p>For years people asked why we couldn't get rid of those radical preachers who spout hatred about Britain while living off the taxpayer...</p><p>...well, Theresa May - a great Home Secretary - has done it - and she's got Abu Hamza on that plane and out of our country to face justice. </p><p>Be proud of what we've done already.</p><p>Two million of the lowest-paid workers being taken out of income tax altogether.</p><p>Over eighteen million households helped with a freeze in their council tax - and we're freezing it all over again next year too.</p><p>                     BRITAIN ON THE RISE                   </p><p>Big, Conservative things - delivered by this government; made possible by this party.</p><p>We can deliver. We can do big things. </p><p>The Olympics reminded us how great it feels to be successful.</p><p>But we mustn't let that warm glow give us a false sense of security.</p><p>All around the world, countries are on the rise.</p><p>Yes, we've been hearing about China and India for years but it's hard to believe what's happening in Brazil, in Indonesia, in Nigeria too.</p><p>Meanwhile, the old powers are on the slide.</p><p>What do the countries on the rise have in common?</p><p>They are lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future - on education, incredible infrastructure and technology.</p><p>And what do the countries on the slide have in common?</p><p>They're fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services.</p><p>I sit in those European Council meetings where we talk endlessly about Greece while on the other side of the world, China is moving so fast it's creating a new economy the size of Greece every three months.\u00a0 </p><p>I am not going to stand here as Prime Minister and allow this country to join the slide.</p><p>My job - our job - is to make sure that in this twenty first century, as in the centuries that came before, our country, Britain, is on the rise.</p><p>And we here know how that is done.</p><p>It is the collective result of individual effort and aspiration, the ideas you have, the businesses you start, the hours you put in.</p><p>Aspiration is the engine of progress.</p><p>Countries rise when they allow their people to rise.</p><p>In this world where brains matter more, where technologies shape our lives, where no-one is owed a living...</p><p>...the most powerful natural resource we have is our people. </p><p>Not just the scientists, the entrepreneurs, the engineers...</p><p>...not just the teachers, the parents, the nurses...</p><p>...but all our people: including the poorest, those who've never had a job, never had a chance, never had hope. </p><p>That's why the mission for this government is to build an aspiration nation...</p><p>...to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people. </p><p>And for us Conservatives, this is not just an economic mission - it's also a moral one.</p><p>It's not just about growth and GDP...</p><p>...it's what's always made our hearts beat faster - aspiration; people rising from the bottom to the top.</p><p>Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going. </p><p>We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer...</p><p>...by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. </p><p>We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it. </p><p>Let me put that another way.</p><p>We don't preach about one nation but practise class war...</p><p>...we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.</p><p>While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you.</p><p>They call us the party of the better-off...</p><p>...no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families - and we should never, ever be ashamed of saying so.</p><p>                     THE RIGHT IDEAS                   </p><p>This party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve.</p><p>Conservatives think: let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it. It's not our style. </p><p>But there's a problem with that. </p><p>It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are: the cartoon Conservatives who don't care. </p><p>My mission from the day I became leader was to change that.</p><p>Yes, to show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.</p><p>But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.</p><p>That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.</p><p>Because it's not enough to know our ideas are right - we've got to explain why they are compassionate too.</p><p>Because we know what we're up against. </p><p>We say we've got to get the private sector bigger and the public sector smaller...our opponents call it 'Tory cuts, slashing the state'.</p><p>No: it's the best way to create the sustainable jobs people need.</p><p>We say help people become independent from welfare...our opponents call it: 'cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves.'</p><p>No: there is only one real route out of poverty and it is work.</p><p>We say we've got to insist on a disciplined, rigorous education for our children...our opponents call it: 'elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.' </p><p>No: a decent education is the only way to give all our children a proper start in this world.</p><p>The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we're the same old Tories who want to help the rich...</p><p>...it's because we're the Tories whose ideas help everyone - the poorest the most.</p><p>A strong private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach. </p><p>These three things are essential to helping our people rise.</p><p>They are essential to our success in this world. </p><p>And you know what - Labour will fight them all the way. </p><p>So these things are not just the battle-ground for Britain's future...</p><p>...they are also the battle-lines for the next election - and it is a fight we've got to win, for our party and our country.</p><p>                     ECONOMY                   </p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs.</p><p>We need businesses, of every size, in every type of industry, in every part of the country - investing and taking people on.</p><p>There are some basic things they need to do that.</p><p>Low interest rates so they can afford to take out a loan.And confidence that it's worth investing - because the customers will be there, whether at home or abroad.</p><p>Getting the deficit down is essential for both.</p><p>That's why our deficit reduction plan is not an alternative to a growth plan: it's the very foundation of our growth plan.</p><p>It's the only way we'll get Britain on the rise. </p><p>Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working.</p><p>And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>The world economy - especially in the Eurozone - has been much weaker than expected in the past two years.</p><p>When some of our big trading partners like Ireland, Spain and Italy are suffering, they buy less from us. </p><p>That hurts our growth and makes it harder to pay off our debts. </p><p>But here is the crucial thing you need to know. </p><p>Yes it's worse than we thought, yes it's taking longer, but we are making progress.</p><p>Thanks to the grit and resolve of George Osborne, we have cut a quarter off the deficit in the past two years. 25 per cent.\u00a0 </p><p>That's helped to keep interest rates at record low levels, keeping mortgages low.\u00a0 </p><p>Leaving more money in your pockets.\u00a0 </p><p>Giving businesses more confidence to invest.</p><p>Creating more jobs.</p><p>And if you don't believe me, just look at the job creation figures.</p><p>Since this government took office, over one million new jobs have been created in the private sector.</p><p>That is more - net - in the last two years than Labour managed in ten years. </p><p>                     LABOUR                    </p><p>Now, the Labour politicians who got us into the mess say they have a different way out of it.</p><p>They call it Plan B and it goes like this: </p><p>We should stop worrying about deficit reduction, borrow more money and spend it to boost the economy. </p><p>It sounds so reasonable when you put it like that. </p><p>Let me tell you why it's not.</p><p>Right now, while we've got a deficit, the people we're borrowing money from believe that we'll pay it back - because we've set out a tough plan to cut spending and live within our means.</p><p>That's why our interest rates are among the lowest in the world, even though the deficit left to us by Labour was one of the highest in the world.</p><p>If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. </p><p>Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. </p><p>That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.</p><p>If you have a mortgage of \u00a3100,000, just a 1 per cent interest rate rise would mean an extra thousand pounds to pay each year.</p><p>Labour's plan to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and our future.</p><p>And it would squander the sacrifices we've already made.</p><p>We're here because they spent too much and borrowed too much.</p><p>How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing?</p><p>I honestly think Labour haven't learned a single thing.</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Now they're out of office it's:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it's: borrow more money.</p><p>Borrow, borrow, borrow. </p><p>Labour: the party of one notion: more borrowing.</p><p>I sometimes wonder if they know anything about the real economy at all.</p><p>Did you hear what Ed Miliband said last week about taxes?</p><p>He described a tax cut as the government writing people a cheque.</p><p>Ed... Let me explain to you how it works.</p><p>When people earn money, it's their money.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Not the government's money: their money.</p><p>Then, the government takes some of it away in tax.</p><p>So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away.\u00a0 OK?</p><p>And while we're on that - who suffers when the wealthy businessman goes off to live in Geneva? </p><p>Not him - he's paying about half the tax he would do here...</p><p>...it's those who want to work who suffer because the jobs aren't being created here.</p><p>We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden...</p><p>...and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour.</p><p>Under Labour.</p><p>We haven't forgotten, you know. </p><p>We remember who spent our golden legacy, who sold our gold...</p><p>...who busted our banks, who smothered our businesses...</p><p>... who wracked up our debts, who wrecked our economy...</p><p>...who ruined our reputation, who risked our future...</p><p>...who did this? - Labour did this - and this country should never forget it. </p><p>                     ASPIRATION ECONOMY                   </p><p>To get Britain on the rise we need a whole new economy...</p><p>...more enterprising, more aspirational...</p><p>...and it's taking shape already.</p><p>We're getting our entrepreneurial streak back: last year the rate of new business creation was faster than any other year in our history. </p><p>Let me repeat that. </p><p>The rate at which new businesses started - faster than any year on record. </p><p>We're making things again.</p><p>We had a trade surplus in cars last year for the first time in almost 40 years.</p><p>And it's not just the old industries growing, it's the new. </p><p>We're number one in the world for offshore wind.</p><p>Number one in the world for tidal power.</p><p>The world's first green investment bank. </p><p>Britain leading; Britain on the rise.\u00a0 We're showing we can do it.</p><p>Look at the new investment coming in. </p><p>In the last two years, Google, Intel, Cisco - the big tech firms - they've all set up new bases here. </p><p>And we are selling to the world again. </p><p>When I became Prime Minister I said to the Foreign Office: those embassies you've got...</p><p>...turn them into showrooms for our cars, department stores for our fashion, technology hubs for British start-ups.</p><p>Yes, you're diplomats but you need to be our country's salesforce too.</p><p>And look what's happening.</p><p>In just two years, our exports to Brazil are up 25 per cent...</p><p>...to China - 40 per cent...</p><p>...to Russia - 80 per cent. </p><p>There are so many opportunities in this world. </p><p>I want to tell you about one business that's seizing them. </p><p>It's run by a guy called Alastair Lukies. </p><p>He and his business partner saw a world with almost 6 billion mobile phones and just 2 billion bank accounts. </p><p>They saw the huge gap in the market- and they started a mobile banking firm...</p><p>...helping people in the poorest parts of the world manage their money and start new companies.</p><p>He's been with me on trade missions all over the world - and his business is booming. </p><p>Back in 2010, when we came to office, they employed about 100 people - now it's more than 700. </p><p>Then they were nowhere in Africa, nowhere in Asia, now they are the global player, with one million new users every month. </p><p>So don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth. </p><p>And to those who question whether it's right to load up a plane with businesspeople - whether we're flying to Africa, Indonesia, to the Gulf or China...</p><p>...whether we're taking people from energy, finance, technology or yes - defence ...</p><p>...I say - there is a global battle out there to win jobs, orders, contracts...</p><p>...and in that battle I believe in leading from the front. </p><p>To get our economy on the rise there's a lot more to do - and frankly a lot more fights to be had. </p><p>Because there are too many of what I'd call the \"yes-but-no\" people. </p><p>The ones who say \"yes, our businesses need to expand...</p><p>...but no we can't reform planning.\"</p><p>It's simple.</p><p>For a business to expand, it needs places to build.</p><p>If it takes too long, they'll just build elsewhere.</p><p>I visited a business the other day that wanted to open a big factory just outside Liverpool. </p><p>But the council was going to take so long to approve the decision that they're now building that factory on the continent - and taking hundreds of jobs with them. </p><p>If we're going to be a winner in this global race we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all. </p><p>And then there are those who say \"yes of course we need more housing\"...</p><p>...but \"no\" to every development - and not in my backyard.</p><p>Look - it's OK for my generation. Many of us have got on the ladder.</p><p>But you know the average age that someone buys their first home today, without any help for their parents? </p><p>33 years old. </p><p>We are the party of home ownership - we cannot let this carry on.</p><p>So yes - we're doubling the discount for buying your council house...</p><p>...we're helping first-time buyers get a 95 per cent mortgage...</p><p>...but there's something else we need to do - and that's accept we need to build more houses in Britain.</p><p>There are young people who work hard year after year but are still living at home.</p><p>They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own.</p><p>I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>                     WELFARE                   </p><p>If we want our people to rise so Britain can rise, we must tackle welfare.</p><p>Here's two facts for you. </p><p>Fact one.\u00a0 We spend \u00a390 billion a year on welfare for working-age people.</p><p>Not pensions. Just welfare for working age people - and that's one pound in every eight the government spends. </p><p>Fact two.\u00a0 More of our children live in households where nobody works than almost any other nation in Europe.</p><p>Let me put it simply.\u00a0 Welfare isn't working. And this is a tragedy. </p><p>Our reforms are just as profound as those of Beveridge 60 years ago.</p><p>He had his great evils to slay. Squalor. Ignorance. Want. Idleness.\u00a0 And Disease.</p><p>Here are mine.</p><p>First, unfairness.\u00a0 </p><p>What are hard-working people who travel long distances to get into work and pay their taxes meant to think when they see families - individual families - getting 40, 50, 60 thousand pounds of housing benefit to live in homes that these hard working people could never afford themselves?</p><p>It is an outrage. And we are ending it by capping housing benefit. </p><p>The second evil: injustice.</p><p>Here's the choice we give our young people today. </p><p>Choice one: Work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat. And as I've just said, that can feel like forever.</p><p>Or: Don't get a job. Sign on. Don't even need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit. Get a flat. And then don't ever get a job or you'll lose a load of housing benefit.</p><p>We must be crazy.</p><p>So this is what we've done.</p><p>Now you have to have to sign a contract that says: you do your bit and we'll do ours.</p><p>It requires you to have a real CV and it makes clear: you have to seek work and take work - or you will lose your benefit.</p><p>And we're going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too. </p><p>If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?</p><p>The next evil: bureaucracy. </p><p>Sign on. Sign here. Come back in a fortnight. Repeat as required.</p><p>What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life? </p><p>For people like him we're doing something new. </p><p>The Work Programme takes the money we're going to save from getting people off the dole...</p><p>...and uses it today to get them into work, with proper training.</p><p>We're spending up to \u00a314,000 on one individual to get them into work - and already almost 700,000 people have got onto the Work Programme.</p><p>So let's be clear: in British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless...</p><p>...and with Iain Duncan Smith leading this revolution let this be the party that shows there is ability and promise in everyone. </p><p>And just one more thing on welfare.</p><p>You know our work experience programme, where we give young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop, an office?</p><p>Here's what one union official said about it. </p><p>I quote: \"The scheme belongs back in the nineteenth century, along with Oliver Twist and the workhouse. It is nothing short of state sponsored slavery...\"</p><p>Honestly. What an appalling, snobbish attitude to the idea of work. </p><p>We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance. </p><p>What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them.</p><p>Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery...</p><p>...and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.</p><p>                     EDUCATION                    </p><p>To help people to rise, to help Britain rise, there's a third - crucial - thing we must do. </p><p>Educate all our children.</p><p>And I mean really educate them, not just pump up the grades each year. </p><p>In maths, in science, in reading, we've fallen behind...</p><p>...not just behind Germany and Canada but Estonia and Australia too. </p><p>This is Britain's real school report and the verdict is clear: must try harder. </p><p>You've heard of pushy parents, sharp-elbowing their way to a better education for their kids? </p><p>Well - this is a pushy government. </p><p>My approach is very simple. </p><p>I've got two children in primary school, and I want for your children what I want for mine. </p><p>To go to schools where discipline is strict, expectations are high and no excuses are accepted for failure.</p><p>I don't want great schools to just be the preserve of those that can pay the fees, or buy the nice house in the right catchment area...</p><p>...I want those schools to be open to every child - in every neighbourhood.</p><p>And the reason I know that every child can go to a school like that is because with this Government, more and more new ones are opening.</p><p>We've heard from some of them this week...</p><p>...not just the 79 new free schools - with over a hundred more to come...</p><p>...but from some of the more than 2000 academies we've helped create - state schools given all the freedoms, and carrying all the high expectations, of private schools.</p><p>Yes - that's my plan - millions of children sent to independent schools...</p><p>...independent schools, in the state sector.</p><p>That's the genuine revolution that's now underway.</p><p>The Harris Academy in Peckham has increased the number of students getting five good GCSEs - from 12 percent when it was under local authority control to almost 90 percent now. </p><p>The transformation has been astonishing - and the methods have been Conservative.</p><p>Smart uniforms, teachers in suits.</p><p>Children taught physics, chemistry and biology not soft options.</p><p>Children set by ability - with excellence applauded, extra resources for those most in need but no excuses for slacking.</p><p>When you see a school like that succeed it prompts the question:</p><p>Why can't every school be that way? Why can't every child have those chances?</p><p>It's not because parents aren't ambitious enough - most of these schools are massively over-subscribed. </p><p>It's because the old educational establishment - the left-wing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists - stood in the way.</p><p>When we saw a badly failing school in Haringey and wanted to turn it into an Academy, the Labour authority, the Labour MP and the teaching unions said no. </p><p>When inspirational teachers and parents - in Hammersmith, in Norwich, in Bristol and in Wigan - wanted to open free schools, the left-wing establishment said no.</p><p>When we proposed: More pay for good teachers... Getting rid of bad teachers...</p><p>...Longer school days to help children learn... Flexible school hours to help parents work...</p><p>...More stretching exams for those who're really able... Less nonsense about health and safety...</p><p>...the left-wing establishment have said just one thing: No.</p><p>When you ask them: why is a school failing? Why aren't the children succeeding? </p><p>You hear the same thing over and over again.</p><p>'What can you expect with children like these?' they say.\u00a0 'These children are disadvantaged.'</p><p>Of course we want to tackle every disadvantage. </p><p>But isn't the greatest disadvantage of all being written off by those so in hock to a culture of low expectations that they have forgotten what it's like to be ambitious, to want to transcend your background, to overcome circumstance and succeed on your own terms?</p><p>It's that toxic culture of low expectations - that lack of ambition for every child - which has held this country back.</p><p>Well, Michael Gove and I are not waiting for an outbreak of sanity in the headquarters of the NUT or an embrace of aspiration in the higher reaches of Labour before we act.</p><p>Because our children can't wait.</p><p>So when people say we should slow down our education reforms - so adults can adjust to them, I say:</p><p>I want more free schools, more Academies, more rigorous exams in every school, more expected of every child.</p><p>And to all those people who say: he wants children to have the kind of education he had at his posh school... </p><p>...I say: yes - you're absolutely right. </p><p>I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education.</p><p>I'm not here to defend privilege, I'm here to spread it.</p><p>I don't have a hard luck story.</p><p>My dad was a stockbroker from Berkshire.</p><p>It's only when your dad's gone that you realise - not just how much you really miss them - but how much you really owe them.\u00a0 </p><p>My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought.</p><p>He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they're meant to be.\u00a0 But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life.</p><p>Because disability in the 1930s was such a stigma, he was an only child.\u00a0 Probably a lonely child.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>But Dad was the eternal optimist.\u00a0 To him the glass was always half full.\u00a0 Usually with something alcoholic in it.</p><p>When I was a boy I remember once going on a long walk with him in the village where we lived, passing the church he supported and the village hall where he took part in interminable parish council meetings.\u00a0 </p><p>He told me what he was most proud of.\u00a0 </p><p>It was simple - working hard from the moment he left school and providing a good start in life for his family.\u00a0 </p><p>Not just all of us, but helping his mum too, when his father ran off.</p><p>Not a hard luck story, but a hard work story.\u00a0 </p><p>Work hard.\u00a0 Family comes first.\u00a0 But put back in to the community too.</p><p>There is nothing complicated about me.</p><p>I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country.</p><p>And there is nothing complicated about what we need today.</p><p>This is still the greatest country on earth.\u00a0 We showed that again this summer.\u00a0 22nd in world population.\u00a0 3rd in the medals table.\u00a0 </p><p>But it's tough.\u00a0 These are difficult times.\u00a0 We're being tested.\u00a0 </p><p>How will we come through it?\u00a0 Again, it's not complicated.</p><p>Hard work.\u00a0 Strong families.\u00a0 Taking responsibility.\u00a0 Serving others.</p><p>As I said on the steps of No10 Downing Street before walking through that door:\u00a0 Those who can should, those who can't we will always help.</p><p>The job of this party ... of this government ... is to help to bring out the best in this country.\u00a0 Because at our best we're unbeatable.</p><p>We know Britain can deliver because we've seen it time and again. </p><p>This is the country that ... invented the computer, defeated the Nazis, started the web, saw off the slave trade, unravelled DNA and fought off every invader for a thousand years.</p><p>We even persuaded the Queen to jump out of a helicopter to make the rest of the world smile .... there is absolutely nothing we cannot do.</p><p>Can we make Britain the best place in the world to start a business, grow a business and help that business take on the world and win?\u00a0 Yes.</p><p>Can we - the people who invented the welfare state in the first place - turn it into something that rewards effort, helps keep families together and really helps the poorest with a new start in life.\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 </p><p>Can we take our schools and turn out students that will take on the brightest in the world?\u00a0 Yes.

The company claims its customers include agencies in all U.S. state governments, top U.S. universities and consumer goods, pharmaceutical and market-research companies. </p><p> \"With this acquisition, we are extending our capabilities around a new level of analytics that not only provides clients with greater insight - but true foresight,\" Ambuj Goyal, general manager of IBM's Information Management group, said in a statement. </p><p> The deal is expected to close later this year, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. SPSS has more than 1,200 employees in 60 countries. The company had $303-million in sales last year and $36-million in profit. </p><p> The acquisition fits with IBM's strategy of strengthening its software and services divisions as a critical part of a makeover over the past decade. </p><p>IBM chief executive officer Sam Palmisano pledged this year to \"go on offence\" in the global recession, making acquisitions and investing in research. </p><p>IBM has spent more than $20-billion since 2003 on more than 80 acquisitions. Fifty of those acquisitions have been software companies. </p><p> One result of the transformation is that IBM, a company known for its mainframes and other computers that have powered back offices for decades, is less reliant now on hardware. Having sold off its personal computer and printing businesses, IBM makes most of its money off services and software. </p><p> In the latest quarter - the three months ended June 30 - IBM's software division contributed 43 per cent of IBM's overall pretax profit. Expanding its reliance on software is one reason the Armonk, N.Y.-based company is able to keep improving profits even as sales fall because of the economy. IBM recently raised its latest 2009 profit forecast to $9.70 per share, from $9.20 per share. </p><p> Separately, IBM also has acquired Ounce Labs Inc., a privately held software company in Waltham, Mass., for an undisclosed amount. IBM said the company makes software that helps businesses reduce the risk and costs associated with security and compliance concerns. </p><p> Beefing up the software division was a key reason IBM explored buying Sun Microsystems Inc., a superstar of the dot-com era that struggled with inconsistent financial results for nearly a decade. </p><p> The Java technology that Sun invented is a key ingredient of the Internet, and IBM's $7-billion offer for Sun was fuelled in part by a desire to have more control over the software's development. The deal collapsed in a dispute over price and other terms. </p><p>Oracle Corp. ultimately agreed to buy Sun for $7.4-billion in cash in a surprise twist in the takeover saga. The bidding was one of the first signs that cash-rich tech companies were willing to open their wallets again despite the recession. </p><p> Another big tech deal recently was data-storage specialist EMC Corp.'s $2.1-billion pickup of a company called Data Domain Inc., whose technology helps companies cut the amount of information that gets stored multiple times. EMC had been in a fierce bidding contest with rival NetApp Inc. for control of Data Domain. </p><p>IBM Corp.</p><p> Close: $117.98, down 35\u00a2 </p><p>SPSS Inc.</p><p> Close: $49.45, up $14.36 </p><p> *** </p><p> International buying machine </p><p>IBM has spent $20-billion (U.S.) purchasing more than 80 companies since 2003, paying prices that range from as little as $50-million to as much as $5-billion. </p><p> Rivals on the hunt </p><p> The proposed acquisition comes after a spate of deals in recent years in the business intelligence sector, such as Oracle's purchase of Hyperion, SAP's acquisition of Business Objects and IBM's own deal for Ottawa-based Cognos for $4.5-billion in late 2007. </p><p>SPSS's technology </p><p> The company's software is used to comb through stockpiles of data to predict things. SPSS, founded in 1968, employs some 1,200 people and has more than 250,000 clients around the world. Its revenue grew 4 per cent in 2008 to $303-million. </p><p> How it works </p><p>Credit Suisse, for example, uses SPSS software to analyze information about its customers, then gives leads to its sales force. Police use these systems to mine data from incident reports and crime tips to predict patterns of criminal behaviour. </p><p> Second deal of the day </p><p>IBM also said yesterday it has acquired Ounce Labs Inc., a privately held software company in Waltham, Mass., that makes software that helps businesses reduce the risk and costs associated with security and compliance concerns. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Reuters, AP, AFP</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20090729IBIBM29ART1939</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W88-BYV1-2RKY-701G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"880\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

They need to be transparent and accountable with regards to their own actions in the service of the public that elected them. Yet, in practice, we see governments in collusion with powerful corporations, spying on their citizens and users while willfully hiding much of their own conduct from the public. Instead, they create fake news to justify this conduct, persecuting those who dare to lift the veil of secrecy.</p><p>As demonstrated by Assange's WikiLeaks, the clandestine nature of the bulk of 'official' information that was protected as 'state security', actually concerns matters that are hard to justify to the public, or those that are frankly illegal. Obvious examples, revealed by WikiLeaks, include details of war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, evidence of security forces overstepping their spying prerogatives, the content of secret negotiations of trade agreements, and finally proof of corruption.</p><p>The WikiLeaks and Assange episodes have revealed that, by putting information in the hands of citizens, data also works in favour of greater transparency and democratic governance.</p><p>The corporate model of the internet</p><p>Meanwhile, the massive violations of private data and digital security loopholes on the part of major internet platforms have come to light in recent months. These are clearly not simply cases of accidents or negligence. Rather, they are part of the essence of the corporate model of the internet, or 'surveillance capitalism', as it has been termed.</p><p>In exchange for 'free' internet services, as users we are practically obliged - with or without our consent - to hand over far more data than most of us even realize we are generating. This data is not only monetized by big tech corporations, but also contributes to increasing their power because of network effects.</p><p>The more data they absorb, the more effective are the algorithms that generate digital intelligence, giving them a competitive edge. Their clients, including advertisers, security agencies, public and private services, political groups, among others, also gain strategic advantages. As we have seen in the case of the recent Brazilian elections, this can seriously distort democratic process.</p><p>Legislators are belatedly struggling to find ways to control these corporate behemoths, restrict or penalize the abuse of private data, control the spread of 'fake news' or apply antitrust laws to break up their monopoly power .</p><p>There is no doubt that this is necessary, but it runs the risk of being too little, too late. And if adequate legislation is complex to formulate in the major developed countries, it is much harder for countries of the global South that have almost no power over how the internet works.</p><p>Instead, there is a tendency to focus solely on regulation concerning hate speech, fake news, or information leaks. This often results in new forms of censorship affecting freedom of expression. Moreover, in many instances, digital platforms have been asked to 'self-regulate' and develop their own censorship policies, something they are simply not qualified to do.</p><p>It is one thing to remove hate speech, in-citation to violence or racism from public media platforms. In most countries, this is already covered under existing laws. But when Google unilaterally downgrades web pages from its search engine algorithms, treating them as 'fake news' because they are associated with protest against war or state criticism (as has happened with a number of alternative websites in the US)- that's an attack on free speech.</p><p>Again, this is not simply an unplanned consequence of over-zealous regulatory efforts. The right wing think tank, Atlantic Council, which works closely with defence and security services of the major powers, criticized the internet, as it 'democratized the ability for sub-state groups and individuals to broadcast a narrative with limited resources and virtually unlimited scope', thus quickly spreading political dissent and creating 'conflict and disruption'. Censorship and the suppression of dissent is viewed as a necessity, requiring the collaboration of internet corporations.</p><p>In this context, in stark contrast to the corporate model of digital platforms, initiatives to build a people's internet are an expression of one of the major social disputes of this century. These efforts involve retrieving control over data, creating secure platforms with open software, defending rights including privacy and freedom of expression, developing artificial intelligence under community control, promoting antitrust legislation, among many other aspects.</p><p>Defending the WikiLeaks movement and Julian Assange against persecution is a vital part of this endeavor, as freedom of expression and the very struggle for democracy is threatened. Assange's extradition to the US implies that the American justice system could demand any journalist in the world to appear before them: a legal aberration.</p><p>The only 'crime' for which Assange was initially indicted is trying to hack a password in order to protect his source (Chelsea Manning). But protecting a source is a basic journalistic right, for which he should not be liable to extradition. More recently, 17 new charges, including espionage, have been brought against him. This could mean a prison sentence of up to 175 years for Assange, essentially for exercising the right to free speech.</p><p>Assange, then, is a symbol of the fight for the peoples' right to information, freedom of expression and the democratization of technology.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRENZA-PRESZA0907201900002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRENZA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHY-G2X1-F00C-63XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1065\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Good morning, ladies. Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Thursday, it is Thursday, April 11th, your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have breaking news right now, Julian Assange has been arrested this morning, U.K. police say that his asylum has been withdrawn. He -- we will have the very latest this morning on this developing story. A red flag for Uber's upcoming IPO, the valuation is an eye-popping number, but actually below expectations. \"Spying did occur. We know that.\" These are the words from Attorney General William Barr. The fallout from the Mueller and that FBI investigation into Donald Trump. KFC's Colonel goes virtual, he is now an Instagram influencer, but there's a catch. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have breaking news right now, Julian Assange under arrest this morning, U.K. police say that he is in custody right now in Central London. He was arrested at the Ecuadorian embassy in London after Ecuador withdrew its asylum status. Joining me right now is The Washington Examiner Editor in Chief, Hugo Gurdon. And, Hugo, it is always pleasure to see you.</p><p>HUGO GURDON, EDITOR IN CHIEF, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Great to be here. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Your reaction to this.</p><p>GURDON: Well, it's been a long-time coming, he's been in the Ecuadorian embassy for -- since 2012. And the Ecuadorians say he's been -- he's broken the conditions of his asylum for -- in several times. You know, he claimed that he was -- you know, he's under arrest or -- and he's going to face extradition to Sweden on child molestation assault charges. But he claims to fear that he will then be arrested by the United States in the whole Clinton e-mails leak.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GURDON: That's actually some -- there's some possibility that's true, because back in -- I think it was November last year, he was named accidentally in a -- in a charge where it talked about somewhat a defendant called Assange who would be facing trial in -- or would be facing charges in the United States. So, you know, now he's out of the Ecuadorian embassy, he'll probably get extradited to Sweden. He'll face charges there, but the United States may have charges against him, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's all connected, because when those e-mails of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Hillary Clinton's campaign were released back in July of 2016, that was something of a catalyst for the Democrats to insert Donald Trump into the Russia meddling story. We know that Russia meddled in the west activities, not just the U.S., Europe as well. We've known that for a long time, we've know that actually that they've been doing that for decades, but the Democrats were very sly in inserting Donald Trump in the Russia meddling story back in 2016, the FBI launched an investigation and they spied on the Trump campaign, that's what we heard from William Barr yesterday. Let's talk about that. What did you make of William Barr's comments yesterday?</p><p>GURDON: Well, look, we knew that he was -- that there was a surveillance. We knew very well that there was going to be -- that, you know, the FBI went to the FISA court, they got permission to snoop on the Russian campaign, Carter -- I'm sorry, the -- on the campaign, Carter Page in particular. So, we knew that they were snooping anyway. The word spying is what got the Democrats freaking out yesterday. The thing is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know what the freak out is though. Please explain the freak out to me since we've known this for two years.</p><p>GURDON: Yes. The freak out is that they are seeing the whole Russia collusion narrative turning against them. They thought that this was their passage back to power, they've been playing this narrative as hard as they can for two years. And now the attention is turning to who made this up. There's an old saying, Maria, that truth exist and only falsehood has to be invented. Now, what's happening is Congress and the Attorney General are going to start looking at who invented this story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GURDON: Now, someone made it up because we know it isn't true. Maybe it was lots of people. Maybe the FBI believed it because of just incompetence, but maybe there was some people there who wanted to believe there was some malfeasance. That's what they (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Or, maybe they didn't believe it at all but they were looking for something to get on Donald Trump. And we know this because we've seen months and months of investigation by myself as well as lawmakers, who have said over the last two years, again and again, what they did was wrong, one political campaign spying on another. Here's just a couple of those sound bites from the last year.</p><p>GURDON: Right.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: I think there's a spying did occur, yes, I think spying did occur.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, let me --</p><p>BARR: But the question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated. And I'm not suggesting it wasn't adequately predicated but I need to explore that. I think it's my obligation.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): They got the information from Bruce Ohr. Did they disclose this to the FBI? Because remember, the major point, none of this was disclosed to the FISA court when they went and spied on the Trump campaign using these very sophisticated tools that we have in our arsenal that are supposed to target terrorists and other bad guys, they used to target a political campaign operative.</p><p>REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE (R-TX): Remember, Maria, how bad it was when we all found out there was this unverified dossier that was used as a basis to gain a warrant to surveil someone associated with the Trump campaign, Carter Page. And it got worse when we found out that that dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just extraordinary. So, the bottom line here is they spied on Carter Page and there was no predicate, but that's what William Barr is looking at.</p><p>GURDON: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is -- what was the predicate? You need a reason to launch a federal investigation into somebody.</p><p>GURDON: Right. There needs to be a reason, they need to be looking into an actual crime. We know that the application to the FISA court would not have been made had it not been for the dodgy dossier, the thing put together by Christopher Steele, the former British spy. Now, he wouldn't stand up for the truth of what was in the -- in that dossier. He was sued in Britain and he admitted that it was an unverified document. So, we know that that was not, A, not verified and now we find out from Robert Mueller that it wasn't true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GURDON: So, it had to have been made up. Let's find out who did that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So, the Democrats do not want to face the truth.</p><p>GURDON: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The President, of course, has said this for a long time, and he weighed in again this week. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It was an illegal investigation. It was started illegally. Everything about it was crooked. Every single thing about it. There were dirty cops, these were bad people. You look at McCabe and Comey and you look at Lisa and Peter Strzok, these were bad people, and this was a -- an attempted coup.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but the coup failed. What now? They're trying to rip William Barr's reputation now.</p><p>GURDON: Yes, that's right. They -- I mean, you saw Chuck Schumer, the Minority Leader in the Senate, demanding that he withdraw the suggestion that there was spying. Pelosi said he went off the rails. You know, it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's ridiculous.</p><p>GURDON: We know -- we know that there was surveillance. We know that it was based on falsehood, and all he's doing is saying, we have to now look because this is his duty, why this went ahead, was there malfeasance, was there just incompetence?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think there will be accountability here? Will we see somebody go to jail? Will we see prosecutions?</p><p>GURDON: I -- well, Devin Nunes is obviously sending criminal referrals, I think it's eight criminal referrals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, he told me that Sunday, yes.</p><p>GURDON: You know, there may well be. I mean, I don't think that the Attorney General will bulk if there's real evidence of malfeasance. I wouldn't want to predict that he's going to find malfeasance. It may just to be a massive screw up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, what we need to know is what the predicate was, we knew that they were spying because we know that there was a warrant to oversee Carter Page's phone calls. And by the way, when you have a warrant to spy on somebody with the intel agencies, you're getting all the phone calls, all the emails, all correspondence going in and out of that person's -- that person, period. And so, they basically had a window into the Trump campaign.</p><p>GURDON: Right. It's an extraordinary intrusion, and it's particularly worrying when it was a -- it was a political campaign, you know, as everybody knows but it's worth repeating. The document was put together really at the behest of the Hillary Clinton campaign. This was Donald Trump's opponent in the election. If there was any -- if there's any suggestion, if there's any evidence that this investigation went ahead because the intelligence services or the FBI were actively trying to help one candidate win the election and to prevent the other candidate, and make sure that the other candidate lost, that's an extraordinary scandal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Extraordinary. The biggest of our time, I would say.</p><p>GURDON: It's just huge.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hugo, good to see you, thank you so much.</p><p>GURDON: Great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hugo Gurdon joining us there. Meanwhile, there's this in business, Uber closer to going public. Its valuation, though, is reportedly lower than we all thought. Dagen is on that this morning. Dagen, good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Still up to $100 billion. So, that's as my father would say, some walking-around money. Uber is expected to make its IPO filing public Thursday, and with the stock's plan debut for May. And here's what we know because of the great reporting in The Wall Street Journal, it's aiming for a valuation in the IPO of up to $100 million, $90 billion to $100 billion, but that's still lower than original expectations. According to a document sent to convertible note holders, the potential price range is $48.00 to $55.00 a share.</p><p>So, the current expectations up to this $100-billion mark, fall below the valuation of up to $120 billion, that's $20 billion less that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the lead underwriters, had pitched as a possible offering price tag. This was last year. Why is Uber -- why are the bankers being so conservative? Look no further than how the stock of Lyft has performed. Lyft priced at a very high end of its range, it even upped its range, it went public at $72.00 a share. And look at what the stock has done. It is now trading at close to 60 bucks a share.</p><p>This stock fell 11 percent, Maria, yesterday. Why? Because, again, Uber not worth quite as much money as people originally expected, and that makes Lyft worth less money, the valuation got crunched yesterday. But they're just trying to set up the bankers for Uber, or trying to set up a stock that trades well in the first day, that attracts long-term holders, and stays elevated rather than collapsing the way Lyft shares did. By the way, Lyft only has 30 percent of the U.S. market. So, the valuation is directly related to whatever Uber is worth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Probably a good idea to stay a little more prudent if you call a 100 billion prudent, of course.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you. Thank you. See you in a bit.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, a scary night for passengers aboard an American Airlines flight. Cheryl Casone on that story and headlines now. Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Oh, good, Maria. Yes, the plane heading to L.A. from New York had to make an emergency landing in JFK shortly after takeoff. The pilot reported the plane may have collided with an object before it left the runway. Workers later discovered damage to the left wing possibly caused be striking a runway sign, maybe an airport, light, luckily nobody was hurt.</p><p>Well, the wife of former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn questioned in closed- door hearing at a Tokyo district court about her husband's alleged financial misconduct. The Japanese newspaper says Carole Ghosn is being viewed as a key figure in the case surrounding her husband who was in detention. Now he denies any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Wall Street Journal is reporting the latest search and the case exposes Japan's feeble attorney-client privilege where prosecutors can look at communication with Ghosn's lawyers likely without any consequence.</p><p>Yes, OK. Well, more breathing room for Theresa May. E.U. leaders giving the British prime minister until October 31st to getting Parliament support for her plan for Britain to leave the block. Britain will see the exit tomorrow even without any deal. And Twitter wasting no time, poking fun at the Halloween deadline, which is kind of funny. Check out some of the memes that we've seen. One calls the Brexit existence a Halloween nightmare, another says dress up as your favorite Brexit character for Halloween. Yes, there's the nightmare one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CASONE: Look at the face. There we go. Who wants to be Theresa May at Halloween, Maria? Take your pick.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, God, that's funny.</p><p>CASONE: Pretty good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we can't wait to see those costumes, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, thank you. Coming up, the big business of streaming, YouTube partners with Discovery, offering a bundle of channels. We're taking a look at the growing digital market plus a whole new colonel, KFC unveils the Silver Fox Sanders. Why some are yelling foul. Back in a minute. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Big show this morning. Coming up, Louisiana Congressman and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise is here. Arizona Congresswoman, member of the House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees Debbie Lesko is with us, along with former FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair joining us this morning, after that bank CEO testimony yesterday. Former U.S. ambassador to Germany and former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Robert Kimmitt joining us as well. Big 3 hours, don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>We want to kick it off here with the big business of streaming. YouTube T.V. raising its monthly price tag to $50.00, adding Discovery's line-up of networks to its line-up. That includes the Discovery Channel, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, and more. Yesterday here in the studio, I spoke with Discovery CEO, David Zaslav, in a \"FIRST ON FOX BUSINESS INTERVIEW\", about the digital market taking away from traditional television.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID ZASLAV, CEO, DISCOVERY: The market feels pretty good. We're always worried about the digital market taking so much of the volume out of T.V.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>ZASLAV: But T.V. still seems to be the place that has the biggest impact with consumers, and it's a safe place. And we're like at the top of the pyramid on safety. It's a race to get -- to reach consumers directly, and everybody is lined up in this race, in the race for scripted and movies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining the conversation this morning, Forbes Media Chairman, former Republican Presidential Candidate Steve Forbes is here. And the cofounder and President of RealClearPolitics, Tom Bevan, joining us once again. Tom, it's great to see you.</p><p>TOM BEVAN, COFOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Good to be here. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you for joining us, Steve, always a pleasure.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning. Great to have you both. Streaming is an interesting business, it's a growth story, certainly, and it's interesting what David Zaslav is doing, Dagen, because he's doing streaming but not scripted, like a Netflix. You know, not scripted like, you know, entertainment.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Which is cheaper.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Rather than -- right. Rather than getting into the creative content wars that now that even Apple is entering, only spending a billion dollars so far on content. This is -- but this is his wheelhouse. And I just think the possibilities are limitless particularly when you look at the Chip and Joanna Gaines network -- it's a full network, but the offshoots that you will be able to do in terms of social media connection and online. Like, I've said this before, I use YouTube T.V. which is essentially, it's like cable but it's a streaming service, it's an app. And the algorithm that they have to predict what you will want to watch is really incredible. It's not that expensive and the interface is brilliant. So, a lot of things go into whether a streaming service is successful or not. It's not just the content, but it's also how easy is it to use.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yesterday Jon Steinberg from Cheddar was here. And he said, oh, they're at home and they just said to their Siri, put on Fox Business, MORNINGS WITH MARIA right now, and it went from YouTube T.V. just knew exactly, you know, how to get to this program, so that his kids can watch him live on the show.</p><p>BEVAN: Yes. You know, it's amazing what the fragmentation of the media marketplace, right? And I'm not sure if safety is not -- I mean, it's fine to be prudent, right? But at this time, you look at like what ESPN, what's going on with their subscriber base and the way people are cutting the cord now from cable television.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Good point, yes.</p><p>BEVAN: It is an existential business threat to a lot of media companies if they don't get their heads wrapped around this pretty quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And it's a big day for Disney today. You mentioned ESPN. The company expected to announce details about its upcoming streaming service, Disney+, that's during its annual investor meeting. Disney CEO Bob Iger spoke last night, warning about the dangers of social media. He said Hitler would have loved social media, noting it as, quote, constantly validating our convictions and amplifying our deepest fears. Steve Forbes, what do you say about that?</p><p>FORBES: A little over the edge, a little over the top, as they say. And the reason is, you have counter to that. Now, somebody puts somebody up there, something up there, you immediately can hit it back. And so, you don't have to write a letter to the editor, you don't have to file a liable lawsuit, you just go after the perpetrators. And so, yes, you can put up a big lie, you can put up a big truth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: The key thing is consistency, and this is where conservatives are still politically, still behind the eight ball, they haven't caught up to the left yet in terms of knowing how to use social media.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they're censoring conservative speech as well on social media.</p><p>FORBES: They certainly are.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They certainly -- the social media companies have something to answer to in terms of how they've walled off groups of people, and really made us more divided. Because you --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You don't -- and it's not necessarily censorship, it's just that they push at you what they think you want to see and you have to actively go out there and find differing opinions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think there is some censorship, though.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There is, but I'm saying broadly speaking.</p><p>FORBES: Oh, yes, the so-called algorithm. I love that word, algorithm. It looked like it's scientific, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, as if a human didn't put the algorithm --</p><p>MCDOWELL: They always blame the -- blame the machine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quick break. One person is dead this morning, more than a dozen injured after a massive gas explosion in North Carolina. We've got that in an investigation, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, yes, it may be spring but millions of Americans are slammed with wild weather this morning. The Midwest hit with a blizzard, snow, and blizzard conditions. And then, out west in Oregon, massive flooding, a speedboat was seen driving down a highway. Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean live at the weather center with more details. Janice, good morning to you. Wow.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST: Crazy. Yes, it does snow and it does flood unfortunately in portions of the Central U.S. and up towards the northwest. Look at the temperature difference, you can tell it's springtime because we have 73 in Kansas City. But behind that, that's where we have our blizzard. Not only heavy snow, six, 12, even 24-inches of snow, this is happening in Minnesota. You see on our split screen here, blizzard conditions from Colorado up towards Minnesota. And that means the criteria of quite a bit of snow and blowing snow with wind gusts in excess of 35 miles per hour.</p><p>And we could see the potential for ice on the roadways, on the power lines. I'm getting reports of thousands of people without power because of the storm system. It eventually moves up in towards Canada, north and east, over the next 12 to 24 hours. But we still have wind gusts in excess of 35 miles per hour across the Plain States. It doesn't take a lot of snow to cause blizzard conditions, so that's going to be a big concern. And then, on top of the snow that we've already received, in some cases, over 20- inches for parts of South Dakota, Nebraska, up towards Minnesota, so this is going to be quite a blockbuster storm for several states.</p><p>Then, on the warm side of this, where we're seeing the temperature 60-70 degrees, the potential for severe storms, large hale, damaging winds, and isolated tornadoes, so this is going to be a system we're going to be watching throughout the day today in towards Friday. And the remainder of this storm system is going to move across the southeast, and maybe give us travel delays for the big gulf tournament in Augusta, Georgia, the Masters. So, we'll be tracking the weather there as well. Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Janice, thanks so much. We'll be back to you, Janice Dean. Coming up, recall alert, Ford Motor recalling trucks that were previously serviced, what you need to know about that, coming up. And then, talking about hot wings, KFC shows off its brand-new younger colonel, why people are scratching their heads this morning on that. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Thursday morning. Welcome back, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, April 11th, your top stories right now just before 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets are higher this morning. Take a look at Futures, Dow Futures up 20 points, the S&amp;P Futures up two points, and the NASDAQ up 4-1/4 right now.</p><p>Stocks inching higher yesterday, as well, take a look. We are right on the doorstep of first-quarter earnings, markets are waiting on that. Yesterday's close, the Dow was up 6, S&amp;P was up 10, and the NASDAQ up 55, of course, those earnings kick off tomorrow with the major banks reporting their first quarter.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the indices looked like this, higher across the board, fractional moves, though, FT-100 up 3 points, CAC Quarante in Paris, up 32, that's two-thirds of a percent, DAX Index in Germany, up 23, a quarter of a percent. Asian markets, overnight, mostly lower, worst performer, China, Shanghai Composite down 1.6 percent.</p><p>Well, the search for survivors is on, one day after a deadly gas explosion in busy Brightleaf Square, the blast felt across the city, the latest on the investigation, coming up.</p><p>Check your driveway, why Ford is recalling more than 300,000 trucks, again, we will tell you why what the issue is.</p><p>And KFC's newest colonel, setting hearts aflutter, why some say the brand's latest influencer is just too darn hot. The rise of the robot, a concern for many that Artificial Intelligence will spark mass unemployment, a new report says, not so fast. We are on it, this morning.</p><p>But first, the top story this half an hour, focus on earnings, big banks expected to report their first quarter tomorrow, including Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan and PNC. This coming after big banks CEOs testified yesterday, before the House Financial Services Committee.</p><p>Joining us right now is Mahoney Asset Management CEO, Ken Mahoney. And Ken, it is good to see you this morning.</p><p>KEN MAHONEY, CEO, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT: Good to see you as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you expecting from the banks for the first quarter?</p><p>MAHONEY: I think we'll be OK. I mean, look, we have lower expectations. And with that, that sets up pretty well. But, it's really going to be the guidance going forward, right? Can they get loan growth? You know, we have this flat yield curve, and we always kept on saying about banks. It's difficult to make money in a flat yield curve.</p><p>So, we would like to see what the guidance is, and I think that guidance probably kind of muted, at this point, they'll only going to go too far ahead. I think a lot of CFOs do that also, kind of, lower the bar a little bit, so then they can leap over when it comes --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, the 2-year and the 10-year inverted, what, Dagen, for like a week.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>MAHONEY: Not even.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAHONEY: Recession, recession. You know what? The way I look at it, it's a leading economic indicator that turns negative. Hey, maybe we have recession in the horizon. But, you know, inversion for a day or two, and everybody ring the bell, it's a recession. All the headlines, finally, have been negative, right?</p><p>But it's like Teflon (INAUDIBLE) stick to it for too long anyway. It's the price action. Look at the price action here. The market is telling you something.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Rick Rider told you this, and I want to reiterate it, one of the reasons that he thought that you've got that inversion is because all of the supply coming out of the Treasury Department has been on the very short end.</p><p>MAHONEY: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, there was a deluge of supply, which elevate -- the demand wasn't there to absorb it, and so you had elevated short-term rates over longer-term rates. Listen, I'd worry about it. I'm a hand-wringer. I'm a total geek. This is something that I certainly watch because the last time a recession --</p><p>BARTIROMO: One of your favorite subjects.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAHONEY: -- see the same thing. It's not that obvious. It, you know, happens after the fact, when you're in a recession, you don't know when quarters later, oh, that was a recession back there. So, the reason I try to pick this thing out, if everybody sees the same thing, that's not the recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but a recession is two quarters of negative growth.</p><p>MAHONEY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Last time I checked, we were at, what, three percent --</p><p>MAHONEY: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- in terms of economic growth.</p><p>FORBES: You know, those original projections from Atlanta, you know, whether it was going to be 0.2 or 0.4, sort of, been gone in the dustbin of history. How are regulators treating the banks these days? Are they starting to say we want to look over your shoulder again on loans?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's show yesterday's drama, in Washington, because the bank CEOs took the Hill. The heads of the country's largest financial institutions testified on Capitol Hill, before the House financial Services Committee. Some exchanges got a little heated. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): I'm concerned that several of these institutions are simply too big to manage their own operations, too big to serve our communities, and too big to care about the harm they have caused.</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CEO, J.P. MORGAN CHASE: We never lose sight, or you'll never lose sight the lessons learned. Post crisis reforms have addressed key concerns. During the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. government took extraordinary and unprecedented actions to stabilize the system. And we owe our gratitude to the policymakers who stepped in, on behalf of Americans.</p><p>Since the crisis reforms have made banks much safer and sounder in three important areas, capital, liquidity, and resolution recovery.</p><p>WATERS: Last year, 1 million student loan bar is defaulted, which is on top of the 1 million bars who defaulted the year before. What are you guys doing to help us with the student loan debt? Who would like to answer first? Mr. Monahan, big bank.</p><p>BRIAN MONAHAN, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, BANK OF AMERICA: We stopped making student loans in 2007 or so.</p><p>WATERS: Oh, so you don't do it anymore. Mr. Corbat?</p><p>MICHAEL CORBAT, CEO, CITIGROUP: We exited student lending in 2009.</p><p>WATERS: Mr. Dimon?</p><p>DIMON: When the government took over student lending in 2010 or so, we stopped doing all student lending.</p><p>WATERS: Thank you.</p><p>DIMON: The American government reduced tax rates on businesses to make America competitive. We have been sending trillions of dollars of capital overseas.</p><p>REP. NYDIA VELAZQUEZ (D-NY): How can we make America -- how can we make America competitive, when there is large number of young people that are graduating and they see no future?</p><p>DIMON: This group pays all their employees quite well, including medical, retirement, minimum wage is usually $18.00, $37,000 a year, something like that. Competitive business will drive wages and jobs over time.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Steve, your reaction?</p><p>FORBES: Well, this is the reason why you don't want Maxine Waters running the bank. She didn't do a good job with her own bank. We'll leave that aside, for a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't think she knew that the government took over student loans.</p><p>FORBES: Well, she didn't, clearly, and her staff. What does that say about all these taxpayers? They can't even give a good briefing to their boss. And what that shows is, one, in terms of this whole thing, in CEO pay, you want quality to pay for it, whether it's in businesses or sports or anything else.</p><p>And the other thing is, if you keep bashing these banks, what are they going to do? They're going to hunker down, go with what's safe, and that's going to hurt the economy. And in terms of how the banks got bigger, well, it was the government reaction to the 2008 crisis that led to these banks getting bigger and small banks went by the board, especially community banks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I love how these Democratic Congress people can't help but show us, time and again, that government is the problem. It's not the solution. These are not -- these bank CEOs aren't the Frankenstein monsters taking down the economy. It is the government behind some of the biggest problems that we face in the United States.</p><p>FORBES: Let's get to the basics. Why do we have this crisis? The Federal Reserve messed up. The Treasury Department messed up.</p><p>MAHONEY: They almost messed up again.</p><p>FORBES: Undermining the value of the dollar, if that hadn't happened, you wouldn't have 2008. So, governments make mistakes. They blame free markets.</p><p>MAHONEY: Right.</p><p>FORBES: Bankers can't hit back too hard. They all could've said, you idiot, don't you know you --</p><p>MAHONEY: I see the solution too big to fail. It's got bigger, because they said they started gobbling up the, you know, the FDIC (INAUDIBLE) at the time, you know, close on a Friday, open on Monday, with a new branch, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sheila Bair is going to be on the show today.</p><p>MAHONEY: OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MAHONEY: Yes. But it just kind of shows too big to fail was the problem, and what happened, they are getting bigger, because they started consolidating some of these regional banks and so forth, you know, very interesting.</p><p>BEVAN: It is amazing that the head of the banking committee does not know that the government got out or the government got --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Student loans.</p><p>BEVAN: Student loans --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BEVAN: -- eight years ago. That's not a staffing issue. That's something that members of Congress should know on their own, but welcome to -- welcome to the Democrats running the House of Representatives.</p><p>They're going to continue to do, in addition to investigating Trump, bash big banks, this is part of narrative. This is setting up their legislative agenda for 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. This was just a show yesterday, come on.</p><p>BEVAN: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She wanted to show that she's in charge.</p><p>FORBES: And there's also the new kind of socialism, you don't take over nationalized industries anymore. You just crush them with regulation where they know if they're to survive, they have to do what you want them to do.</p><p>MAHONEY: Right, and to Steve's point --</p><p>FORBES: You have industries that you are not supposed to lend to, stuff like that.</p><p>MAHONEY: Right.</p><p>FORBES: That stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.</p><p>MAHONEY: You really want the banks to be healthy. You want them blending. And you keep suppressing them, pushing them down, more and more regulation. They get like this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Elizabeth Warren was there.</p><p>FORBES: In 2008, how many new bankers were hired to make loans versus compliance officers?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point, definitely good. Meanwhile, let's talk tariffs, for a second, Dagen, President Trump is slamming the E.U. on trade.</p><p>He tweeted this yesterday, too bad that the European Union is being so tough on United Kingdom and Brexit. The E.U. is likewise a brutal trading partner with the United States, which will change. Sometimes in life, you have let people breathe before it all comes back to bite you.</p><p>The President has said many times, by the way, that the E.U. is worse than the U.S., than China. Ken.</p><p>MAHONEY: Well, look, I mean, for investors, they like to check the box, and say, OK, China trade is done, check that box, and let's jump into the ring with Europe. That's not going to happen. We're going to have kind of like a couple of rounds back and forth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the President makes no secret that --</p><p>MAHONEY: Yes. Well, again, he's not liking what they do in Airbus, it's coming out, the World Trade Organization said, you know, they are favoring Airbus in Europe. And our retaliation said, if that's not fair again, we'll do it this way.</p><p>So, again, I understand what the President is doing, and look, he has a lot of leverage here because Europe, and the number we keep on seeing, they're in declines, especially in Germany, right? So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: There are dangers here, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So he doesn't need to do anything then, like, if Europe is struggling and falling on its back because of its socialist policies, he's going to need to worry, first and foremost, about the health of the United States economy.</p><p>And you have to avoid between now and the 2020 election if wants to get re- elected for a second term to make sure that the U.S. is healthy and stable. And I don't think picking a trade fight with tariffs. We already have 25 percent tariffs on any light trucks coming to the U.S.</p><p>FORBES: Tariff is a word -- tariff is a word for sales tax, sales taxes on American consumers and American business community, not a good thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Having said that, I think his approval rating is up, going to 2020 right now.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BEVAN: It's not Trump's style to let someone hang themselves with their own rope. He's going to punch and, you know, that's the way he's always operated, so he's going to continue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, he can air box with Europe all he wants, but if he starts to try and punch them, it's going to end up swinging back and hitting American consumers in the face.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: --and business --</p><p>MAHONEY: It's a slippery slope and so far, the President has done a pretty good job and, again, I think investors really like to know that China trade deal is finished, before it (INAUDIBLE) but that's the way it came up. It came up in the middle of all of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MAHONEY: And by nothing, the numbers were $11 billion, I mean, what's $11 billion amongst friends? It's not a big number at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we're talking about -- we think there's going to be a meeting between President Xi and President Trump in Mar-a-Lago, in early May, so we'll see about that. Very quickly before you go, we are at the start of earnings season, you want to buy stocks here or not?</p><p>MAHONEY: Yes, yes. And this is the Energizer bunny market. It keeps going, keeps going, why, because the Feds said they're not going to raise rates and with that, we can actually have multiple expansions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will leave it there, Ken, great to have you.</p><p>MAHONEY: Great, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ken Mahoney joining us there. Meanwhile, rescue cues -- crews, rather, are searching for survivors this morning, after that deadly explosion in North Carolina, Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Well, Maria, one man is dead, after a leaking gas line exploded in the shopping district in downtown Durham, 17 others injured, 6 are listed in critical condition, this morning.</p><p>This powerful blast destroyed a building and it could be heard and felt throughout the city. Police say that construction work nearby, caused that explosion.</p><p>Well, deja vu for owners of Ford's F-150 pickup, the automaker recalling the truck for a second time to fix engine block heaters. Ford called back nearly a million trucks back in December because a fire risk associated with the same problem. Ford says the first fix could lead to a fire risk. The first fix (INAUDIBLE) hopefully, the second time's the charm.</p><p>And finally there's this, maybe he's a little charming, check out KFC's hot new Colonel Sanders, the company creating a virtual Instagram influencer colonel. So, he's not real, everybody, and he has a #SecretRecipeForSuccess, which is also tattooed on his abs, and he even comes, as you just saw a moment ago, with a fake girlfriend.</p><p>What is (INAUDIBLE) about this on social media is that a lot of people are, you know, they tease it on Twitter and Facebook. A lot of people are actually making fun of the fact that people in brands are looking on Instagram for -- you know, to have that influencer, so they came up with a fake one.</p><p>Look, this is the -- and the reactions also has been, Maria, with this guy that, it's not a guy, it's a computer. But yes, he's still hot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: So people (INAUDIBLE) with the fact they think a computer is hot, is that weird? I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We better get used it.</p><p>FORBES: Fake models.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know it. Wow, OK. This is --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just really quickly, my favorite Instagram account that I started following is called Diet Prada, and it basically calls out all these influencers who ink these deals with retailers like Nordstrom. They steal the fashions of, like, famous fashion designs, and then peddle them as their own --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me guess, it's a Chinese site?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. I don't -- no. It's -- but it's like -- no, it's women, like, influencers in the United States who launched these clothing lines and they're basically just completely ripping off famous designers and they call them out on it and it's hilarious.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Speaking of computers and the rise of the robots, there is concern that Artificial Intelligence is sparking mass unemployment, or will, at some point. A new report says not so fast, we are going to take a look at that.</p><p>Then, get back, cool cat, a strange-looking feline spotted roaming around the neighborhood. Wait until you hear this one. That's next. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. The Arizona Republic this morning writes this: \"On Tucson campus, University of Arizona, students see different sides to free-speech debate.\" Demonstrators are urging the U.A. president to drop charges against three students for protesting against Border Patrol agents. They also want Robins to pay immigration -- to ban immigration enforcement from coming on campus at all.</p><p>The News and Observer this morning, writes this: \"Hybrid owners would pay new annual fees under North Carolina bill and electric cars owners would pay more.\" A new bill has owners of hybrid cars in North Carolina digging deeper to pay for an annual registration fee, and to offset gas taxes, they're saving, by using battery power.</p><p>And have you seen the cool cat? The Virginian-Pilot reports: \"Animal control looking for exotic cat spotted near shore drive.\" The rouge feline last seen around Virginia Beach, weighs about 25 pounds, stands 25-inches tall, and likes to dine on small rodents and birds. The unique collar could be tracking device. Interesting. Wow! I didn't see that walking around.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You see a lot of crazy things in Southern Virginia, not just family members of mine.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it could be it escaped from a zoo, maybe, you see bobcats --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That would scare.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bobcats are very -- are vicious.</p><p>FORBES: But that big, 25 pounds?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bobcat, will get up to -- I have to check that, Steve --</p><p>FORBES: Frankenstein cat.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, bobcats are scary, though, agree with you on that. All right, quick break and then the rise of artificial intelligence. We're taking a look why people are so concerned about a robot apocalypse as technology companies make huge advances. That's next. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was the MIT's new robot sorting recyclables. Meanwhile, Deloitte is out with its annual global human capital trench report. Many are worried about a potential robot apocalypse coming for their jobs. But this report says not so fast. Joining us right now and a \"FIRST ON FOX BUSINESS INTERVIEW\" is Deloitte Consulting U.S. Human Capital Leader, Erica Volini, great to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>ERICA VOLINI, U.S. HUMAN CAPITAL LEADER, DELOITTE CONSULTING: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, tell us what you see, Erica Volina --</p><p>VOLINI: Got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Apologies, Erica. Let us know what you see in terms of technology and how pervasive will it be in terms of replacing jobs?</p><p>VOLINI: There is no denying that technology is here and it's here to stay. A.I. and automation are growing exponentially. But our survey response said only 13 percent of organizations believe that automation is going to significantly eliminate jobs over the next three years. I mean, we have a sense of optimism about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Over the near term?</p><p>VOLINI: Over the near term, exactly.</p><p>FORBES: The fact is, we don't even know what's going to come in the future. I mean, if he said 20 years ago that you're going to be app writer, people are (INAUDIBLE) helping people apply for jobs by writing their applications, whole new job categories come up. A friend of mine, Mark Mills says that we don't call airplanes, artificial birds; we don't call cars artificial horses. There's a lot of scare out there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, because there's artificial intelligence, which is what we're dealing with right now. But then, there's artificial general intelligence, AGI, and that's coming. But I mean, you're right, it's not over the near term, but 20 to 50 years. You could imagine that computers will be able to do human tasks in terms of intellectual human tasks.</p><p>VOLINI: And that's why we need to prepare now. That's why we believe organizations need to start reinventing with a human focus. Because organizations have a chance right now to invest in the day-to-day worker, to make sure they have the skills that are coming for the future; to start to use the power of that technology to predict what are those skills going to be because with data, and A.I., and analytics, we now have the ability to look ahead and start to prepare for how jobs are going to evolve. And organizations, they play a huge role with that working with government and society to make that happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But in terms of automation not necessarily being a bad thing, we reported this week about Wal-Mart is installing robots in its stores to basically free up time for its employees to do tasks that they enjoy, that are more beneficial to them. And the store, and its robots cleaning the stores or helping, reducing the number of people it takes to unload a truck. And again, that ultimately helps the business, it helps every worker who is employed there.</p><p>VOLINI: I couldn't agree more. I mean, we're seeing a decline in productivity gains in the fourth industrial revolution, and we have to ask ourselves why. And organizations who say, yes, we need to use technology but we also have to then use that freed up capacity to do higher value work, to motivate workers, to get them to be more productive. That's the secret equation that we have to find, that's what we're trying to help organizations do.</p><p>BEVAN: What's -- what would be the single most important thing if you could wave your magic wand to make that happen?</p><p>VOLINI: Yes. Number one trend is our human capital report was learning, and it's not learning in the traditional sense of let me throw a bunch of content at you. It's how do we embed learning into the day-to-day flow of work and lives of the everyday worker because everything you do has an opportunity for learning, to learn new skills, technical skills and essential human skills that are going to be needed to help them thrive in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I totally agree. It's all about education. In China, they are teaching their students in grammar school, in secondary school about A.I. And in the U.S., we're not. We're just not.</p><p>VOLINI: We have to start early and we're starting to see some high schools get out there and change the way they're creating their curriculums, to be able to address this problem. And I think that's what we need to see.

They're not going to have a shield.\"</p><p>While the move is being billed by the White House as a fullthroated defence of America's precious constitutional right to free expression, and dismissed by others as posturing, experts say changes to the law would encourage companies such as Twitter, Google and Facebook to simply hit delete rather than defend the rights of those who post contentious statements online.</p><p>\"Countries that do not have these kinds of provisions find that platforms will often err on the side of removing content,\" said Michael Geist, a law professor at the University of Ottawa who specializes in online and e-commerce issues.</p><p>\"That would probably be, at the end of the day, the crucial takeaway here: This is framed as being measures designed to help safeguard free speech, and yet limiting some of these kinds of protections would have the effect of doing the opposite.\"</p><p>Section 230, credited by many as the foundation on which Big Tech is built, has been the subject of heated debate on Capitol Hill in recent years as the 20-year-old vision of the internet as a selfpolicing free-speech utopia has been sullied by the seedier corners of cyberspace, where hate speech, misogyny and disinformation campaigns flourish.</p><p>But congressional concerns about the law depend on which side of the aisle they're coming from: while Democrats take issue with content that foments hatred and falsehoods, Republicans complain about efforts to moderate content that they say end up suppressing conservative viewpoints.</p><p>That's what Trump contends Twitter was doing when a pair of tweets he sent Tuesday claiming mail-in ballots are vulnerable to election fraud were tagged with links urging followers to \"get the facts about mail-in ballots.\"</p><p>The links led readers to a brief note that called the claims \"unsubstantiated,\" citing reports by CNN and the Washington Post - two of the president's most loathed media outlets.</p><p>The Communications Decency Act isn't the only place where the text of Section 230 appears. It also happens to be part of the digital chapter of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, where it was included to ensure that the protection it provides technology companies in the U.S. is applicable right across North America.</p><p>\"The extent to which the United States decided that it was going to create new levels of liability for these platforms, counter to or in conflict with what's found in Section 230 - that might run afoul of their new obligations under the USMCA,\" Geist said.</p><p>Dan Ujczo, a lawyer who specializes in Canada-U.S. trade, said while that's true on paper, the agreement is designed to be a \"living document\" that its myriad committees, interagency groups and enforcement bodies will be policing carefully during the early stages to ensure any conflicts or contradictions can be navigated.</p><p>And as always, it's an open question whether Trump will make good on his threat in the first place, he said. \"These are warning shots and teeing up some kind of negotiation that will happen,\" Ujczo said. \"I don't see this as anything that will have a practical effect in the short term.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Evan Vucci, The Canadian Press;

But he adds that a sizeable team will still be necessary given there are thousands of products which clients can choose from. \u201cThere are hundreds of funds out there, how do you differentiate yourself?\u201d</p><p>Lower value distribution jobs, such as roles in digital marketing, are most at risk, says Christian Edelmann at consultant Oliver Wyman.\u00a0\u201cUltimately distribution will have to become much more efficient,\u201d he says, but adds:\u00a0 \u201cStrong salespeople you will always need.\u201d</p><p>Relationship managers are already used to working with client service platforms that can perform parts of their old jobs such as providing asset allocation models.\u00a0</p><p>Mr Packman says sales staff can help themselves by focusing on their creativity and communication skills, elements of their job which are harder to automate.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Future-proof score: 7/10</emphasis></p><p>ESG and stewardship </p><p>Interest in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/ftfm/responsible-investing\"> responsible investing</url> has created a basket of new roles \u2014 such as head of responsible capitalism and head of sustainable credit \u2014 focused on the provision of environmental, social and governance expertise. </p><p>\u201cA big area of investment is anywhere around stewardship,\u201d says Mr Edelmann.\u00a0</p><p>Such roles, which are\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0695124e-6eec-11e8-852d-d8b934ff5ffa\"> fiercely competitive</url>, offer an alternative route into the investment industry for those from a natural sciences or policymaking background.</p><p>Helen Pradas-Page at consultant Acre, which helps employers recruit for ESG roles, expects growth in the number of new roles in Europe to continue but to a lesser degree\u00a0given progress already made. There will be \u201cincremental growth\u201d in new roles in Asia and the US, she adds.</p><p>Ed O\u2019Bree, head of funds and markets at Bovill, the regulatory consultancy, says the biggest firms have hired the people they need but smaller groups are catching up: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it has plateaued at the medium to smaller end.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Future-proof score: 9/10</emphasis></p><p>Compliance and regulatory</p><p>New regulations, including the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb6224b4-7c35-11e7-ab01-a13271d1ee9c\"> sweeping Mifid II </url>package and the forthcoming senior managers and\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d783323b-af13-3109-b55e-80d417d8f882\"> certification regime</url>\u00a0in the UK, have\u00a0 created demand for compliance expertise.</p><p> Mr O\u2019Bree says many of these roles have been created at consultancies such as Bovill or Duff &amp; Phelps, rather than in-house at asset managers. <br/><br/>Demand has levelled off but he adds there has been an uptick in advertisements for liquidity and risk management roles over the summer, believed to be in response to the crisis at\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f077ae2-f19e-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901\"> Neil Woodford\u2019s investment empire</url>.</p><p>The collapse of the former star stockpicker\u2019s eponymous group was sparked by his level of illiquid holdings, an issue which has prompted greater scrutiny by the Financial Conduct Authority.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think people want to be seen to be proactive,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are trying to stay a step ahead of the FCA in the fund management world.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Future-proof rating: 6/10</emphasis></p><p>Analysts and data scientists</p><p>Those with the skills to chew through a large data set and devise an investment strategy are in luck. \u201cEveryone is trying to hire data scientists,\u201d says Mr Edelmann.</p><p>Quantitative hedge funds in particular have focused on recruiting mathematicians and scientists, sometimes establishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74869fc2-6021-11e8-ad91-e01af256df68\"> direct links</url> with elite university campuses to tap pools of talent, though they compete with\u00a0Big Tech in attracting graduates.\u00a0</p><p>But ordinary asset managers can also benefit.\u00a0In one instance Mr Packman came across a firm where technology was helping portfolio managers identify which stocks out of about 500 they and their analysts should focus their attention on at a specific moment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe roles that are going to be the most useful are the people who write those algorithms,\u201d he says.</p><p>The picture is bleaker for classic research analysts. Although the upheaval caused by the Mifid II rules meant some asset managers curbed their reliance on external research, Mr O\u2019Bree believes there has been a slight drop in the number of internal roles in recent years as managers look to cut costs. Analysts are \u201ca luxurious cost in this day and age\u201d, he argues.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Future-proof score: 6/10</emphasis></p><p>Back office and administration\u00a0</p><p>One word: automation. Roles in areas such as settling trades, sending out factsheets, accounting and other forms of generic administration are highly at risk.</p><p>When Atlanta-based fund house Invesco recently cut 1,300 jobs after absorbing rival OppenheimerFunds, this included 850 losses from a single office in Denver that had performed administrative functions. Only\u00a0about a dozen investing staff were dismissed.</p><p>\u201cMid-level support, they have got squeezed and they are going to get squeezed more,\u201d says Mr Johnson. \u201cThe lower and mid-level tech people and support people are probably most at risk.\u201d</p><p>There is one bright spot: some jobs may not be not \u201clost\u201d but the employers offering them will change. For example, large groups may look to outsource roles, particularly in areas such as custodianship.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Future-proof score: 3/10</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-f2e2ff290f484a8784afdfd5380b7e95</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XG1-05P1-JB77-K0CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1507\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 9, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000D7A3</classCode><className>KPMG LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001YM8</classCode><className>INVESCO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6282 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>IVZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

But now, thanks in part to the growth of streaming, the moves &amp; nbsp;are &amp; nbsp;increasingly happening in the other direction as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Aside from the aforementioned names, dozens of other senior music execs have transitioned to &amp; nbsp;VC and finance over the past few decades, including but not limited to Jon Vanhala (former head of digital &amp; new business at Island Def Jam Group and Republic Records, now managing partner at Crossfade Partners), Nick Gatfield (former chairman &amp; CEO of Sony Music U.K., now head of angel investment fund Twin Music) and Jay Samit (former president of digital distribution at EMI, now vice chairman at Deloitte).</p><p>Company-specific issues aside, there were arguably several reasons to exit the music business at the turn of the century: persistent fears of losing even more money to tech disruption, liquidity concerns around a complex, bureaucratic rights landscape &amp; nbsp;and a tendency to prize &amp; nbsp;cult-of-personality dynamics over more data-driven, agile, customer-centric thinking. Yet ever since, the rise of streaming services like Spotify -- which <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">debuted</url>above expectations on the public markets this week, ending day one with a valuation of $27 billion -- has fostered a new, interdisciplinary ecosystem of tech-forward music companies &amp; nbsp;and has slowly begun to change investors \u2019 minds.</p><p>In fact, some of these investors are now taking charge at the upper echelons of said music companies. In Jan. 2018, longtime Google Ventures partner Avid Duggan &amp; nbsp;<url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">joined Kobalt</url>(a GV portfolio company) as executive vp and chief strategy &amp; business officer. Downtown Music Publishing CFO Alan Goodstadt previously served as a partner at several VC firms and as a managing director at Merrill Lynch. Several execs at Cutting Edge Group, a film music and financing firm that recently       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">brokered a sale</url>worth up to $25 million to Concord Music Group, also previously worked in vp roles &amp; nbsp;at Merrill Lynch.</p><p>On one hand, interest from VC and finance in music is nothing new. As early as 2007, boutique investment banks were experimenting with music as an alternative asset class. Perhaps the most notorious example was Ingenious Capital, which financed comeback albums for the likes of <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">UB40</url>and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Peter Gabriel</url>and acted as the financial advisor for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Robbie Williams</url>' \ufffd80 million contract with EMI in 2002, the largest such deal in the history of U.K.'s music industry at the time (Ingenious has since sold most of its music assets). A handful of other financial firms like       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">AGI Partners</url>and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">BlackRock</url>have also established their own funds for independent artists, but have not made much of a splash.</p><p>On the other hand, the fact that more and more VC and finance execs are transitioning directly to internal roles within music companies, instead of solely providing outside funds, represents a renewed sense of confidence in the future of the industry &amp; nbsp;-- not to mention a steep learning curve for navigating a landscape that has not gotten any simpler since the early Napster days.</p><p>\"Having been on Kobalt \u2019s board at GV, I knew the music industry was complex, but I didn \u2019t realize the actual level of complexity until I joined the company,\" Duggan tells Billboard. \"You think you \u2019re about to get an answer that resolves your understanding of the topic, but then that leads to another question, and then another. It \u2019s an endless pit of complexity, with just how many different types of rights and regulations there are, how that varies across regions -- and then all of that is compounded by the number of middlemen, from collection societies to agents, labels, publishers and sub-publishers. I \u2019ve been trying to educate myself &amp; nbsp;and am having meetings with all sorts of people at the company to try to understand not just Kobalt \u2019s offering &amp; nbsp;in this landscape, but also the customers we \u2019re serving.\"</p><p>Streaming has also ushered in a more positive form of complexity, in the form of expanding the potential for growth beyond recorded music alone. In the same way that the presence of a few successful startups has turned Silicon Valley into the hottest destination for tech entrepreneurs, Spotify &amp; amp;#39;s enduring success has encouraged founders to build a wider ecosystem of tech solutions for music -- whether in building secondary experiences atop Spotify \u2019s API itself (<url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Stationhead</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Pacemaker</url>), in making music more visual and social (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Musical.ly</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Dubsmash</url>) or in serving the business needs of artists and their teams (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Auddly</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Sodatone</url>).</p><p>A prime example of such an ecosystem in more institutional form is Techstars Music, whose entire portfolio is built on the assumption that much of music \u2019s future growth lies in markets traditionally overlooked by the industry, such as biometrics (<url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Blink Identity</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Endel</url>) and creative AI (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Secondbrain</url>).</p><p>\"The music industry \u2019s customer is no longer just professional artists and producers,\" Kalam Ali, who works on venture partnerships at Native Instruments and co-founded &amp; nbsp;the London-based music tech startup accelerator Marathon Artists Labs, tells Billboard. \"The demand for music offerings extends into advertising, gaming, even fine art exhibitions. The landscape is necessarily interdisciplinary in nature.\"</p><p>Not surprisingly, investors are comparing the growth of this wider ecosystem to the impact of big-tech corporations like Google, Apple, Amazon and eBay (all of which have their own vested interests in music, through either streaming or ticketing). Duggan, who previously worked as a product manager at eBay, compares the value proposition of Spotify, Kobalt and similar companies to what eBay contributed to brick-and-mortar retail at large.</p><p>\"eBay created a new layer of middle class,\" she says. \"So many mom-and-pop shops were unable to survive financially, but eBay gave them a new global platform to distribute their goods &amp; nbsp;and you saw some of these shops making &amp; nbsp;a couple hundred thousand dollars a year, just off of eBay. To me, there are a lot of similarities with what \u2019s happening in music: a platform comes in, allows for global distribution at much lower cost and enables creators to actually live from their art.\"</p><p>Other music companies like <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Royalty Exchange</url>have benefited from the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">\"eBay for music \" metaphor</url>, in terms of opening up a new marketplace for investors who previously did not have access to certain types of music assets. Ali tells Billboard that Native Instruments has ambitions to build a creator ecosystem in a similar manner to what Apple has accomplished with its App Store. Even Spotify &amp; nbsp;itself has analogous goals: in its       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">SEC filing</url>, the streaming service outlines a vision to \"build a two-sided marketplace \" that delivers value to both &amp; nbsp;artists and fans.</p><p>Duggan sees a clear path to profitability for Spotify, if it can pull off that marketplace concept. \"There \u2019s still very little fragmentation today, in terms of the big majors holding a lot of the power and creating a tough dynamic for Spotify,\" she says. \"Once you lower costs through more data and transparency and enable new entrants to come in, you create more fragmentation in the market, which I think will change the dynamics of who the most powerful players really are and will help Spotify reach that profitability. The Spotify we know today is going to be very different from the Spotify we see in five or 10 years \u2019 time.\"</p><p>Nonetheless, Spotify &amp; nbsp;still faces &amp; nbsp;<url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">tough challenges</url>ahead, including &amp; nbsp;but not limited to competition from international streaming players &amp; nbsp;and from big tech &amp; amp;#39;s deep pockets that can afford to leverage music as a marketing loss leader. As a result, some investors and &amp; nbsp;financial firms are putting their money into live events as a more predictable, robust revenue source &amp; nbsp;than recorded music alone. For instance,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Edition Capital</url>, a U.K.-based investment and advisory group focused on experiential content in media &amp; entertainment, has invested in several niche event properties including       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Snowboxx</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Incipio</url>and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">Hotpod Yoga</url>, with few IP- and platform-driven investments in sight.</p><p>\"Our focus is largely upon the ability to drive a profit &amp; nbsp;and investors very much like the fact that the cash flows for these businesses tend to be both positive and largely predictable,\" Lisa Boden, partner at Edition Capital, tells Billboard. \"The amount of money you need to initially invest into platform-based businesses such as streaming services before you can fully prove the business concept can be eye-watering -- but the returns can also be equally spectacular, if you are able to pick the winners. It \u2019s a high-risk strategy, though, and we see our job as keeping investors on the right side of the risk curve. We also have a great belief in the independent sector and the ability of smaller, more niche investment opportunities to deliver incredibly impressive returns on investment.\"</p><p>Indeed, in addition to the ecosystem developing directly around Spotify and other streaming services, music &amp; nbsp;also serves as a fruitful guinea pig for the frontiers of tech innovation. From &amp; nbsp;<url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">smart speakers</url>to &amp; nbsp;      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/1559093/how-guy-oseary-scooter-braun-and-troy-carter-are\">virtual reality</url>and &amp;

amp;#39; funds and attention.</p><p>\"Music plays such an important role in our lives and in everything that we do,\" says Duggan. \"As technologies evolve, music will naturally be a part of that growth.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BILLBD-8287427</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BILLBD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7V-MRY1-JC8J-40XB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">5545</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1642\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>billboard.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18997\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 4, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

For a startup in the B2B market, that means there's a reasonably steep hill to climb right from the beginning. Here is a startup guide to creating an ideal customer profile.There's no way that a startup can acquire the same volume of data that more established competitors already have collected.Instead, they must prioritize which kinds of data will be the most valuable to them as they begin operating, so they can take the most significant advantage of what they do initially collect. In almost every case, the data that's most useful to a startup in its early days is the information needed to build complete customer profiles. </p><p>Building the data collection[2] methodologies to do that requires some careful forethought and planning, though, and isn't a job to be taken lightly. As a guide for early-stage startups, here's an overview of how to create an ideal customer profile to use as a data collection roadmap, and how to collect the needed information to do it by using your earliest customers[3] as a guide.What is a Customer Profile? To begin the process of building an ideal customer profile for your startup, it's first necessary to understand what the term means.This is critical because the concept of an ideal customer profile is often confused with that of a customer persona[4]. In reality, the two things are quite different. An ideal customer profile is a thorough outline of who your startup plans to sell its products to, and not how you intend to do so. A customer persona, by contrast, contains the rich marketing data that's used to craft messages that members of your target market will be receptive to. A customer persona is used to direct customer relationship efforts, like the kind that you might use for deepening patient connections in healthcare practice. In that example, an ideal customer profile instead defines who you want to come through the door in the first place. While the difference seems subtle at first glance, it's easiest to understand it thusly: an ideal customer profile represents who you want your customers to be, while a customer persona is a representation of who they are. The reason that's important to understand is that it's critical to know what data you need to collect on new customers so you can standardize that process throughout your organization. Without doing this, your sales, marketing, and product development teams might end up directing their efforts toward serving different constituencies - and in the process, they'll satisfy none of them.Setting the Right StandardsWhen you begin the discussions with your team to develop an ideal customer profile, you must first understand that the different parts of your organization may have competing visions of who you should be targeting. What's most important is to reach common ground and arrive at a customer definition everyone can agree on. To that end, the ideal customer profile you end up with should meet the following conditions: Clarity and Specificity - Your ideal customer profile must be precise and easy for anyone to understand with no room for deviation. Data Connected - Since defining an ideal customer is an exercise in the hypothetical, it's necessary to make sure that the profile you create can be connected to actual customer data you are capable of collecting. Universal Application - When your ideal customer profile is put to use[5], it will need to involve data points that are common to all parts of your business. That means it should be broadly compatible will all relevant business systems, from your CRM platform to your marketing automation systems[6] and everything in between.Gathering Initial Data To create an ideal customer profile, it's useful to use whatever customers you already have to guide you.Begin by identifying which existing customers are spending the most money on your products[7], and then refine the list by selecting those that you've had positive feedback from. That should give you some clarity about who is getting the most value from your products and leave you with a list of customers that will be willing to help you with the next steps in the process. With your initial list prepared, the next step is to document some meaningful information[8] about them. For each customer, make a note of: Location. Industry. Company size. Number of individual contacts within the company. Annual operating budget. If you're having any difficulty finding out the information you need, contact your customer[9] and explain to them that you're using them as an example of your ideal customer. If they're happy with your products, they should be glad to help you, knowing that any information they share will help you to serve their needs even better in the future. In the conversations that you have, you should also try to find out as much as possible about why each customer is doing business with your firm. Find out: Who brought your company to their attention? What comments they have, if any, about their dealings with your company? Who within their company has the final say on purchases? What they're using your products for? How well your products meet their needs? What related business needs they have that your company doesn't satisfy? With all of the relevant questions answered, the next step is to compile all of the data and look for commonalities between your best customers. In almost every case, you should find some overlap in the data, but what you're really looking for is the least common denominator for each data point. Once you've worked that out, you're ready to create a picture of your ideal customer.Creating Your Ideal Customer Profile When you reach this point, creating an ideal customer profile is a simple matter of listing your conclusions on one, easy-to-understand document.In general, it should spell out in very specific terms: The industry your startup is targeting The geographic region where they're located Their average budget The average business size The top three reasons customers use your product What specific needs your products meet The most common way potential customers find your firm The average size of the decision-making chain (how many people are involved in each purchase) Why your ideal customer would choose you over the competitionHow to Use Your Ideal Customer ProfileFrom this point on, your startup should orient its sales, marketing, and product development efforts to satisfy the ideal customer you have defined. From a data collection standpoint[10], it should also be used as a template as to what information to collect from every potential customer as you make contact with them. It can also guide your marketing research as you try to identify new leads. Doing this should help you to target the exact types of customers[11] that are likely to establish long-term relationships with your company. It should also set you on the path toward collecting usable customer data that can then grow into a powerful customer analytics operation. That can, in turn, help you to build the aforementioned customer personas and feed your efforts at personalization[12]. It's important to remember, however, that your ideal customer profile[13] isn't a static document. In fact, as your business grows, the profile of your ideal customer will change with it. That means you're going to have to revisit this process at regular intervals to make sure that you're still serving your most valuable customers' needs. If it turns out that you're not - make the changes that the data suggests, and it's sure to pay off. Andrej Kovacevic[14] Andrej is a dedicated writer, digital evangelist and editor at Tech Loot[15].

Clearview subscribers could give the company a photo of someone they had just taken and get links to other photos of the same person, often revealing information like who they are and where they live. A little tweaking and the service might simply identify people over any live feed aimed at any street, hallway or classroom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Though it has been marketed as a one-stop warrantless law enforcement tool, Clearview's client list is also reported to include casinos, gyms, supermarkets, sporting leagues and wealthy parents curious about their kids' dates. The upshot? The fundamental comfort - and liberty - of being able to walk down a street or enter a supermarket or stadium without the authorities, or fellow strangers, immediately knowing who you are is about to evaporate without any public debate about whether that's okay. It's as if someone invented glasses that could see through walls, sold them to a select few, and everyone else inexplicably shrugged.</p><p>Now, the Wall Street Journal reports that Clearview AI is \"in discussions with state agencies about using its technology to track patients infected by the coronavirus, according to people familiar with the matter.\" It's a savvy move, aimed at turning a rogue actor into a hero. This is a delicate time for privacy advocacy, which can feel less important during a public health crisis. Amid the upheaval, we must treat the company's behavior as an opportunity to think about the responsibility of the online platforms from which it took its images. We should be doing that now, in the heat of this crisis, rather than waiting until another privacy-intruding start-up or two have completed their ravages. If we fail to act, today's intrusions will cement themselves as tomorrow's status quo.</p><p>The company's services don't represent a technological breakthrough as much as norm-shattering daring. Clearview simply added water to a recipe that no one else thought advisable to make, using existing ingredients. For example, Google has long offered a free \"reverse image\" search, making it easy to determine if a given photo is already online somewhere. State driver's license databases could provide ample fodder for facial recognition tools - but they are protected by law from casual use. If online images were gathered indiscriminately, there would be a replication (and then some) of the usefulness of a driver's license database. Then, with facial recognition in play, photo search need not be looking for identical photos to a sample, but rather identical people to a sample, however different other photos of them may be. As platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn have grown, they have offered a vast buffet of user-provided images - most associated with names and personal information, particularly in the case of sites like Facebook that ban pseudonymity - to anyone with the technical know-how needed to scrape them.</p><p>And that's exactly what Clearview AI did, harvesting more than 3 billion images from a wide range of sources. Collecting photos and identifying data in bulk from around the web, especially from the largest organized troves of them, is against most platforms' terms of service. Were any big company to do it, it would likely result in years of litigation. The norms against such collection are so strong that many researchers wanting to scrape data from websites only for their own analyses and in the public interest are chary of doing it.</p><p>Clearview took a chance anyway. It's selling what it took online to whoever can pay, including those who already wield the power of the state, except here unconstrained even by such guardrails as warrants and subpoenas. The platforms must shoulder some of the blame. Without the likes of Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, there could be no Clearview AI: They appear to have been eminently scrapable, asleep at the switch as the looters returned again and again. Indeed, the more apt analogy might be to a toxic waste site whose guard looked bemusedly on while an \"entrepreneur\" made repeated trips to haul away thousands of barrels.</p><p>Now that the shoestring caper has been executed, it's reported to have been later funded by venture capitalists - including a member of Facebook's board of directors.</p><p>Clearview AI is exploiting a long-standing vulnerability in the architecture of the platform economy: Data that we might comfortably make public individually can, in aggregate, lead to the equivalent of a police state. The world is better when people can, say, look you up by name if you like, but not look you up by face after simply glimpsing you somewhere, whether in person or by happenstance, in a photo or video. And privacy is increasingly collective: Once available data reaches a critical mass, the emergence of services like those offered by Clearview AI becomes almost inevitable.</p><p>Given their apparent, if accidental, involvement in these developments, it's stunning that the platforms haven't reacted strongly to the Clearview AI revelations. Many apparent sources for Clearview AI's scraping campaign, including Facebook, Google and Twitter, have, billions of horses out of the barn later, sent the start-up standard cease-and-desist letters over violations of their terms of service. But they have been notably muted in their public responses. In the days following the disclosure of the scrape, for example, Facebook released a wan statement: \"Scraping people's information violates our policies, which is why we've demanded that Clearview stop accessing or using information from Facebook or Instagram.\" The public has heard little else of substance from the company or its peers about it since, including any accounting of just how much information might have been exfiltrated. That lack of information has severely limited the specificity of what might otherwise have been productive public discussions.</p><p>(When asked for any further comment, a Facebook spokesperson replied with a stronger statement: \"Clearview AI's actions invade people's privacy which is why we banned their founder from our services and sent them a legal demand to stop accessing any data, photos, or videos from our services.\" Google and Twitter did not offer further comments on the record.)</p><p>Perhaps more surprisingly, the platforms have caught little flak for their casual reactions. Why should the public trust social media platforms with personal data when they seemingly can't protect it from wholesale abuse by one or two people? To be sure, legal action on the part of Silicon Valley behemoths may not be a slam dunk: The Ninth Circuit's holding in the 2019 case hiQ v. LinkedIn, on very different facts, might cast some doubt on some of the most obvious arguments that would be made in litigation against those people and entities that scrape publicly available data. But the lack of a swift and forceful legal response - or even meaningful public utterances - whether from private companies or most public authorities, is unforgivable, given the level of trust that today's social media platforms demand by their very design.</p><p>The platforms have been more than willing to deploy armies of lawyers to other ends - from grappling with the FTC to massive IP litigation. So why not when the interests of users are on the line? It wouldn't be at all unreasonable to ask why the platforms won't fight for us like they fight for reduced fines, or control over patents. If ever there was a time to be litigious, it's now.</p><p>The largely unimpeded success of Clearview AI isn't just a civil liberties disaster of seismic proportions - it vindicates a strategy of devastating hit-and-run attacks on our personal liberties by start-ups, underwritten by the silence of some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful companies. Our best chance now might be aggressive litigation or broader regulation, whether inspired by Silicon Valley, forward-looking government agencies and state attorneys general (Vermont is currently leading the charge), or private citizens. Perhaps the typically more assertive European data privacy enforcers, largely silent to this point, will intercede, particularly if Clearview AI moves into the E.U. in earnest. Indeed, Clearview has already offered up opt-out forms only for California and E.U. residents, in response to the more plentiful privacy protections offered to citizens of those jurisdictions.</p><p>Looking forward, we are long overdue for a reckoning with what good custodianship of public data entails. Part of that conversation should revolve around new and better data privacy laws, and part of it should revolve around platform practices. To start, the platforms need to be clearer with users around when and how their data becomes scrapable, and therefore usable by other entities - even when that scraping is against a terms of service, given that such terms clearly aren't preventive. They'll also need to flex their technical muscles alongside their legal ones, exploring new safeguards for what users offer publicly in the expectation of practical obscurity, to prevent tomorrow's Clearview AIs from pulling off the same stunt.</p><p>In the case of Clearview AI, the time to implement these protective measures would have been months or years ago. But, should platforms and policymakers fail to take the fissures exposed by this round of scandal seriously, what we're seeing will only be the start. We may soon find ourselves on the brink of a dark period of innovation in digital technology, one in which the missteps and carelessness of the platforms will pale in comparison to those of the ever-more-exploitative dot-coms they feed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-172b29b6ebe441c38934b0bb43962029</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YNM-B211-JB4M-V2DF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1612\"/><timeReceived>7:59 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

KEY FACTS     72% of U.S. adults believe big tech companies have too much \u201cpower and influence\u201d in politics, per a Pew Research survey conducted in June, while an Accountable Tech/GQR Research poll in July found 85% of respondents believe they have too much power in general.      A Morning Consult poll released in January found that 65% believe tech companies\u2019 benefits to users aren\u2019t worth \u201cthe industry\u2019s becoming more powerful at the expense of smaller companies\u201d\u2014but a majority of those respondents still enjoy big tech products, using major social media and search tools and predominantly shopping online.       Americans who distrust big tech don\u2019t necessarily support government action: 69.8% of respondents to a July poll by the Center for Growth and Opportunity/YouGov said they \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201ccompletely agree\u201d that tech companies are too big, but only 44.4% agree the government should break them up.      A Knight Foundation/Gallup poll conducted in December and released in March found 50% support government intervention to break up tech companies, while 49% oppose, and the Pew survey found only 47% support more government tech regulation\u2014down from 51% in 2018.      88% of Knight/Gallup respondents said they do not trust social media platforms to \u201cmake the right decisions\u201d about what users can post, but 55% still said the companies should be making those decisions anyway, rather than the government.      A July Morning Consult poll found only 46% of Americans trust Congress to best regulate big tech companies, as compared with 57% who trust the courts, 53% trusting federal agencies and 34% who trust the president.      A national survey by The Verge released in March found that 51% believe Google and YouTube should be broken up into two different companies\u2014but 66% don\u2019t have a problem with Facebook owning Instagram and WhatsApp.     Chief Critic   CEOs of world\u2019s most powerful tech companies on Wednesday defended themselves against lawmaker accusations that their companies have too much power and stifle smaller businesses, claiming that their practices are instead part of a thriving competitive economy and that their size is essential to their value. \u201cJust like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones,\u201d Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos argued in his opening statement to the House antitrust subcommittee, while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook\u2019s large size is an \u201casset\u201d to its work \u201cto keep people safe on our platform, and to make sure we\u2019re investing to fix our issues and get ahead of new risks.\u201d   Key Background   Zuckerberg and Bezos, along with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook, appeared before the House antitrust subcommittee Wednesday, amid widespread scrutiny into the tech giants\u2019 alleged anticompetitive practices. The companies are also facing antitrust investigations from the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and the European Union. The antitrust struggles come amid broader distrust of big tech companies and their role in the coronavirus pandemic, racial justice protests and impending November election, as companies have struggled to respond to growing misinformation and address hate speech and extremist groups on their platforms.   Tangent   Though Americans are increasingly suspicious of big tech companies, polls show that the coronavirus pandemic may be improving their standing in the eyes of Americans. A Harris poll released in April found that 38% of respondents\u2019 view of the tech industry had become \u201cmore positive\u201d over the course of the pandemic, while an April report by the National Research Group found a full 88% of Americans say the pandemic has given them a greater appreciation for technology\u2019s positive impact.

At the same time, the products and services offered by the tech giants remain incredibly popular. They have become crucial parts of our economy and increasingly integrated into all aspects of our daily lives.As jurisdictions such as European Union pull ahead with cutting edge, if sometimes controversial, legislation to regulate the companies and protect citizens, Canada hasn't completely caught up. </p><p>Countries around the world are grappling with how to reign in the tech giants, particularly the so-called \"Big Five\" of Apple, Googleparent company Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft. Here's a look at what they're doing, and how Canada stacks up. &lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt; For Ann Cavoukian, former Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, privacy comes down to control.\"Personal control over the use of your data, when it's disclosed, how it's used. You should be the one in control,\" says the distinguished expert-in-residence at Ryerson, who leads the school's Privacy by Design Centre of ExcellencePractically it's about tech giants collecting and selling our data to third parties without our consent, she adds. This has been exposed in a slate of recent scandals, from the discovery of a microphone built into &lt;a href=\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-nest/google-fails-to-disclose-microphone-in-nest-secure-idUSKCN1Q92F8\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-nest/google-fails-to-disclose-microphone-in-nest-secure-idUSKCN1Q92F8</url>\"&gt;Google's Nest Secure home security system,&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/business/technology/2018/08/13/google-tracks-your-movements-like-it-or-not.html\">https://www.thestar.com/business/technology/2018/08/13/google-tracks-your-movements-like-it-or-not.html</url>\"&gt;tracking by Google services&lt;/a&gt; on Android devices and iPhones even when privacy settings are turned on. She singles out Facebook and Google as particularly being a concern.\"They have created a state of surveillance,\" she says. Amazon is not as bad but there are still concerns, she adds, like with their controversial facial recognition technology, Amazon Rekognition. The company's own shareholders urged Amazon&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aclu.org/letter/letter-shareholders-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-regarding-rekognition\">https://www.aclu.org/letter/letter-shareholders-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-regarding-rekognition</url>\"&gt; not to sell it to governments&lt;/a&gt;, fearing potential human rights abuses.Microsoft and Apple deserve more credit, she says, and their CEOs have both made public commitments to privacy.That's because companies like Apple are selling a physical product, unlike Facebook and Google, says Avner Levin, a professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management, Law and Business Department.\"The people that are using the service are the product that is actually being sold to advertisers,\" he says, referring to Facebook and Google.\"We are the product that they are selling.\"Privacy is linked to wider issues like fake news, and the weakening of democratic institutions, he adds. This was illustrated in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, when Russians deployed targeted information to manipulate social media users.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing: &lt;/strong&gt;In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, is currently investigating to see if Facebook violated a 2011 \"consent decree,\" that said they would address concerns about the tracking and sharing of user data, Cavoukian says. Facebook could face a hefty fine if found to be in breach of this order. But the \"gold standard\" for privacy legislation is the EU, says Levin. The EU passed the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation, in 2016.The legislation includes hefty fines (up to 4 per cent of a company's global revenue or (EURO)20 million, whichever is greater). It also has strict language on consent, the concept of privacy by design, and the right to be forgotten, under which individuals can apply to have negative search results deleted.Similar laws have been passed in Japan, Brazil and California, Cavoukian says, and there's discussion in the U.S. about national legislation.&lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Canada is in \"a significantly weaker situation than the EU,\" says Andrew Clement, professor emeritus in the Faculty of Information, at the University of Toronto.The &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/02_05_d_15/\">https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/02_05_d_15/</url>\"&gt;federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) &lt;/a&gt;was developed in 2000, before Facebook and smartphones, and lacks the \"fining powers\" of the EU law. \"There appears to be more willingness in the EU to use existing powers for bringing the tech giants to account,\" he says. Levin says there's been an \"absolute lack of will,\" on the part of both the Trudeau and Harper governments to do anything about privacy.In 2012 in response to complaints, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2012/nr-c_120404/\">https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2012/nr-c_120404/</url>\"&gt;the federal privacy commissioner did an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Facebook. But the office doesn't have the \"power to force Facebook to do anything,\" he says. The EU, influenced heavily by the Germans, is more attuned to the dangers of a loss of privacy, given their history of totalitarian governments.\"They're a lot more willing to regulate the companies, they're a lot more worried about the consequences,\" he says. But Cavoukian is optimistic that Canada can catch up. In 2018, the federal Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics issued a report entitled &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2018/parl/xc73-1/XC73-1-1-421-12-eng.pdf\">http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2018/parl/xc73-1/XC73-1-1-421-12-eng.pdf</url>\"&gt;\"Towards Privacy By Design,\"&lt;/a&gt; which she believes shows a \"clear intent\" to enhance the law.&lt;em&gt;May Warren&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disinformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt;In recent years, the world has rudely awakened to the proliferation of hate speech and \"fake news\" on social media - especially during election cycles, when online content can be used to disrupt democratic processes. Regulators and social media companies have come under pressure to stem the flow of online hate speech and malicious \"disinformation.\" But these are complicated problems with no easy fixes; the sheer volume of harmful content online is overwhelming and the notion of regulating speech will always provoke free speech concerns while drawing fierce opposition. And while some countries have legal definitions for hate speech, defining \"fake news\" is a tricky proposition; it can also be a dangerous one, especially in the hands of authoritarian regimes that want to censor information or crack down on the free press. Regulators have struggled to find workable solutions. \"No one's figured it out,\" says &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.history.ubc.ca/people/heidi-j-s-tworek\">http://www.history.ubc.ca/people/heidi-j-s-tworek</url>\"&gt;Heidi Tworek&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of history at the University of British Columbia who studies media, democracy and the digital economy. \"We continue to have to really evaluate many of these different schemes that are being proposed. These are such large and complex questions.\"&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing: &lt;/strong&gt;Several European countries are now moving toward regulating social media platforms, deploying strategies that have drawn both criticism and praise. In France, the government passed a law in November that empowers judges to order the removal of \"fake news\" during elections; violators face a penalty of one year in prison or a (EURO)75,000 fine.In the United Kingdom, a new parliamentary report - released this week following an 18-month investigation - is also calling for platforms like Facebook to be brought under regulatory control. The report proposes several new regulations, including a mandatory code of ethics and independent regulator who can bring legal proceedings against social media companies.Germany has taken a particularly bold approach to regulating hate speech on social media. In January 2018, the country passed its Net Enforcement Act - sometimes dubbed the NetzDG or \"Facebook law\" - which forces tech companies to remove hate speech within 24 hours of illegal content being reported. (When it's unclear whether content is actually illegal under German law, tech companies have seven days to consult and decide.) The penalty for breaking this law? Up to (EURO)50 million in fines. \"This is probably the furthest anyone has gone in trying to get large social media companies to adopt their policies to local laws,\" Tworek says. &lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;\"Canadians, and the Canadian government, are alive and alert to the issues,\" says &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://carleton.ca/sjc/profile/winseck-dwayne/\">https://carleton.ca/sjc/profile/winseck-dwayne/</url>\"&gt;Dwayne Winseck&lt;/a&gt;, a journalism professor at Carleton University and director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project. He points to Canada's recently-passed electoral reform bill, C-76, as a positive step. Online platforms like Facebook and Google must now create a registry of digital advertisements placed by political or third parties during elections and ensure they remain visible for two years. The law also bans the use of foreign money by \"third party\" advocacy groups during campaign periods - meaning social media companies can't knowingly accept advertisements paid for with foreign funds.Another provision prohibits making false statements about a candidate to influence an election. This only applies narrowly to certain types of statements, however (for example, statements about whether a candidate has broken the law or their place of birth).In January, the federal government &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/news/2019/01/government-of-canada-unveils-plan-to-safeguard-canadas-election.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/news/2019/01/government-of-canada-unveils-plan-to-safeguard-canadas-election.html</url>\"&gt;unveiled plans&lt;/a&gt; for safeguarding the upcoming election, including a $7 million initiative to improve the public's ability to detect \"online deceptive practices\" and a team of five bureaucrats who will alert the public whenever they find evidence of election interference.But where Canada could be innovating more is with social media regulation more generally, says journalist &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://tenove.com/about\">https://tenove.com/about</url>/\"&gt;Chris Tenove&lt;/a&gt;, a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia who studies global governance and digital politics. He would like to see Canada follow the lead of jurisdictions like the European Union, which worked together with social media companies to develop a code of conduct. As a result, platforms have voluntarily committed to \"quickly and efficiently\" addressing hate speech and early reports have shown good results, he says.One promising spot is Canada's involvement with an international effort called the Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News. Comprising parliamentarians from nine countries, the committee is scheduled to meet in Ottawa this May and has called for social media executives - including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai - to appear so they can explain what they're doing to stop the spread of disinformation.&lt;em&gt;Jennifer Yang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taxation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt;In the mid 1980s, when Canada's GST was still a twinkle in then prime minister Brian Mulroney's eye, the World Wide Web had not yet been invented and Google's founders were still pre-teen boys. Since then, digital technologies have advanced at breakneck speeds and companies like Google - not to mention Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon - have become essential to how Canadians spend their time and money. They have also been reaping billions in profits. Tax codes, meanwhile, have evolved more slowly and governments are now grappling with how to bring their taxation systems into the digital age.\"There is a missed opportunity for taxing these companies,\" says &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cdhowe.org/our-people/rosalie-wyonch\">https://www.cdhowe.org/our-people/rosalie-wyonch</url>\"&gt;Rosalie Wyonch&lt;/a&gt;, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute. \"Digital technology has been outpacing our ability to regulate (and) tax.\"Traditionally, tax systems were dependent on the idea of \"permanent establishment,\" Wyonch explains - this assumes a company has a physical presence within a country, or relates to physical goods crossing borders. But \"our tax code hasn't been updated to deal with intangibles,\" she says.Yet as digital services become more popular, the potential losses in sales tax revenue grow bigger, says University of Ottawa law professor &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.michaelgeist.ca\">http://www.michaelgeist.ca</url>/\"&gt;Michael Geist&lt;/a&gt;, the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law. (In 2017, Wyonch &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/10/23/canada-needs-to-follow-quebec-lead-on-taxing-netflix.html\">https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/10/23/canada-needs-to-follow-quebec-lead-on-taxing-netflix.html</url>\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that if Netflix alone were to collect and remit GST/HST, this would inject $50 million per year into Canada's tax coffers).Meanwhile, domestic companies - which do have to collect and remit sales taxes - argue they are left at a competitive disadvantage, Geist adds.When it comes to taxing corporate income, global discussions are now underway to figure out how this should be handled when it comes to big tech. \"That is a very complex international system, that we're waiting for consensus on,\" according to Wyonch.There are major challenges when it comes to simply defining the income of digital companies, she says. Say a foreign company does a digital marketing campaign for a Canadian company. \"Did they earn that income where they're located, or did they earn that income in Canada, if they never entered Canada (or) hosted any of its content on Canadian servers?\" Wyonch asks. \"We don't have a clear way to define, in a black and white way, what would - and would not - be considered Canadian income.\"&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;The G20 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have set a 2020 deadline for fighting tax avoidance (which tech giants are frequently accused of) and developing international standards for taxing big tech. But several countries - like the U.K., France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand - are already considering interim measures, raising concerns of creating a hodgepodge of different approaches around the world. The European Union has also unveiled plans for a digital tax of three per cent of revenues, an idea that has received blowback, including from some member states.&lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters last October that Ottawa is studying whether a new regulatory landscape is needed for the digital economy and he is pushing the G20 to speed up its timeline for establishing new rules. But Morneau says Canada's goal is to wait for an international consensus before taking action. Quebec and Saskatchewan, however, have forged ahead on the sales tax issue and this year, both started applying provincial sales taxes to foreign digital companies. In Quebec, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/businesses/consumption-taxes/gsthst-and-qst/special-cases-gsthst-and-qst/suppliers-outside-quebec/qst-registrant-suppliers-outside-quebec/\">https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/businesses/consumption-taxes/gsthst-and-qst/special-cases-gsthst-and-qst/suppliers-outside-quebec/qst-registrant-suppliers-outside-quebec/</url>\"&gt;more than 80 international companies&lt;/a&gt; - including Amazon, Apple, Googleand Netflix - were registered as of Feb. 18 to collect and remit provincial sales tax in that province.&lt;em&gt;Jennifer Yang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt; The rise of a short list of dominant tech companies has put reform of traditional notions of competition law at the top of the agenda for policy-makers around the globe.Modern competition law holds that when companies control large market shares, the result is higher prices and lower quality. It does not, however, make a monopoly illegal, prohibiting only the abuse of the power that a monopoly makes possible through exclusionary practices.Experts say practices such as a company giving its own products top ranking in its online search engine have been given a boost by so called big data - the corporate accumulation of massive data sets that are automatically processed through computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. Big data could pose competitive threats by allowing exclusive licensing deals for critical data sets, for example, says Ariane Le Strat, a U.K.-based associate with international law firm Bird &amp;amp; Bird, or companies could agree to price-discriminate - charge more to certain people based on their perceived ability to pay - as a result of customer data they have obtained.The public outcry over the misuse of personal data after the Cambridge Analytica scandal early last year when it was revealed that Facebook had harvested personal information for political purposes without consent ratcheted up the pressure on regulators, Le Strat says, with the U.S. among others vowing vigorous antitrust enforcement in the area.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;The European Union has taken the lead in enforcing stricter laws aimed at tech companies suspected of wilfully abusing their market dominance. Its competition directorate, for example, has imposed heavy sanctions in cases where it has alleged market abuse by technology giants, including the (EURO)2.4 billion fine levied against Google in 2017 for privileging its own products in search results. The European Union has also taken dramatic steps against Microsoft, now requiring its ubiquitous Windows operating system to enable a variety of web browsers.Germany's competition watchdog has ordered Facebook to curb its data collection excesses and is investigating Amazon after complaints from third-party sellers that their business was being hurt by the company's dual role as both a retailer on its Amazon Marketplace and the platform's owner/operator. The European Commission's competition watchdog is probing whether Amazon gains unfair advantage from the data it collects via transactions on the an e-commerce platform.Against this backdrop some consumer advocacy groups have called for a breakup of the big U.S. tech companies similar to the tearing asunder of the U.S. Bell system in the 1980s - or at the very least an overhaul of competition statutes to address the new threats from the tech giants' market dominance. &lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Canada has maintained that while the emergence of firms that control and exploit data can raise new challenges for competition law enforcement, \"this is not in and of itself cause for concern,\" according to the Competition Bureau.In a February 2018 report, the bureau concluded that while \"big data may require specific methods and tools, the bureau's traditional enforcement framework will continue to apply.\"The report says data tools that analyze and adjust to changes in the conduct of consumers and competitors may \"soften competition\" but this is really just an extension of practices that companies used before information technology was developed.Moreover, it says conscious parallelism (where firms in an oligopoly are aware that their pricing and output decisions have a significant impact upon rivals and without an explicit agreement co-ordinate their behaviour as if they were engaged in collusive behaviour) is not by itself prohibited under Canadian competition law.\"For competition law enforcement in Canada,\" according to Sandy Walker, a competition law partner at Dentons in Toronto, \"it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for now.\"&lt;em&gt;Michael Lewis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a newer area, and there's no scientifically established condition of social media or smartphone addiction.There are however \"problematic behaviours\" associated with the technologies that are similar to the ones found in recognized addictions to drugs, alcohol or gambling, such as not being able to cut back on use, says Centre for Addiction and Mental Health senior scientist Dr. Robert Mann.Mann says a&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.camh.ca/en/camh-news-and-stories/ontario-adults-reporting-increases-in-mental-health-problems\">https://www.camh.ca/en/camh-news-and-stories/ontario-adults-reporting-increases-in-mental-health-problems</url>\"&gt; 2016 CAMH survey of adults &lt;/a&gt;found 40 per cent said yes to at least one of a number of questions such as whether screen habits had ever caused the respondent to miss school, work, or important social activities, or whether a family member had ever expressed concern.Eight per cent of respondents said yes to three or more of the questions.Matthew Johnson, director of education at digital literacy non-profit, MediaSmarts, wouldn't call it an addiction either. But he has heard of serious problematic behaviours especially among young people using apps or social media sites that seem designed to keep them coming back. Snapchat streaks, where kids keep sending Snapchats to their friends every day to keep their streak and earn a flame icon, even if it means missing sleep, are one example.Benjamin Wong, a registered clinical counsellor in behavioural addictions in B.C., says he's seen about a five-per-cent increase over the last five years in people with screen or tech issues. He believes \"hooking\" customers with colourful, engaging social media sites or apps is a \"cornerstone\" of the tech business.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Other jurisdictions haven't gone as far as they have on issues such as data collection, or fake news.&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/02/france-gives-employees-right-to-disconnect-from-work-emails.html\">https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/02/france-gives-employees-right-to-disconnect-from-work-emails.html</url>\"&gt;France recently passed a law&lt;/a&gt; that companies with more than 50 employees can't email employees after business hours, giving individuals \"the right to disconnect.\"The goal, said officials in that country at the time, was to prevent burnout and reduce work-related stress. But Mann says such an idea might also help with addictive behaviour. \"I think it's interesting to consider that that kind of a law might reduce the need or the urge to continually access your devices,\" he says. &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/immersive-technologies-inquiry-launch-17-19/\">https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/immersive-technologies-inquiry-launch-17-19/</url>\"&gt;In the U.K., the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport parliamentary &lt;/a&gt;committee launched an inquiry into the growth of \"immersive and addictive technologies\" in December 2018, looking into the \"addictive nature of some technologies,\" and how they can impact behaviour. &lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;\"Not a whole lot has been done,\" in this country, says Wong, adding even much of the advocacy around regulating tech giants has been around privacy and data.Mann says it's a rich area for researchers, who might start by developing guidelines for healthy use.&lt;em&gt;May Warren&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copyright&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt;Copyright protections are evolving in the digital age as countries ramp up efforts to combat piracy and online infringement. The need for new measures has come to the forefront amid a torrent of illegal downloads of online content from providers including Netflix and YouTube and the pirating of material for commercial and personal use.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Protections are being updated in jurisdictions including the U.S. and especially the European Union, which is set to vote this spring in the European Parliament on an overhaul that would block copyright-protected material, including software, films, music and books, from being uploaded or electronically shared without permission from creators.A provision of the proposed policy would effectively mandate that companies including Facebook and Google develop and fund technology to automatically filter out infringed content on their sites and search engines on a mass scale.In the U.S., meanwhile, momentum is building around proposals in Congress that could formalize and increase royalty payments for music creators whose work is played on digital services.In many developing jurisdictions, the push to reform intellectual property protections has become part of a plan to boost economic competitiveness, with China for example proposing to make websites liable for promoting unlicensed works as part of a broader reform of property rights.Australia, which was described by the country's attorney general in 2014 as the \"worst offender\" of pirated content, has proposed new laws that would make if far easier for copyright owners to achieve court orders that would force search engines and internet service providers to block or delete pirated content.&lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;In Canada, part of the response is contained in the Copyright Modernization Act which requires that providers give notice to customers suspected of pirating content. It is left to the injured party to sue with awards capped at $5,000 for non-commercial infringement.Provisions in Canada's legislation also prohibit demands for payment in the infringement notices, as well as links to any other sites where payments can be made to content creators.The notice provision has been criticized by groups including the International Intellectual Property Alliance of content creators since if \"fails to provide meaningful incentives for network service providers to co-operate with copyright owners to deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital network environment.\"Another possible impediment to the notice provision stems from the new trade agreement among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico that limits internet platforms' liability for users' content, while the deal also stipulates that Canada eventually extend its copyright term. The liability provision could prevent Canada from adopting European-style digital copyright rules, experts note.&lt;em&gt;Michael Lewis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=\"endnote_contrib\"&gt;Michael Lewis is a Toronto-based reporter covering business.

At the same time, the products and services offered by the tech giants remain incredibly popular. They have become crucial parts of our economy and increasingly integrated into all aspects of our daily lives.As jurisdictions such as European Union pull ahead with cutting edge, if sometimes controversial, legislation to regulate the companies and protect citizens, Canada hasn't completely caught up. </p><p>Countries around the world are grappling with how to reign in the tech giants, particularly the so-called \"Big Five\" of Apple, Googleparent company Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft. Here's a look at what they're doing, and how Canada stacks up. &lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt; For Ann Cavoukian, former Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, privacy comes down to control.\"Personal control over the use of your data, when it's disclosed, how it's used. You should be the one in control,\" says the distinguished expert-in-residence at Ryerson, who leads the school's Privacy by Design Centre of ExcellencePractically it's about tech giants collecting and selling our data to third parties without our consent, she adds. This has been exposed in a slate of recent scandals, from the discovery of a microphone built into &lt;a href=\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-nest/google-fails-to-disclose-microphone-in-nest-secure-idUSKCN1Q92F8\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-nest/google-fails-to-disclose-microphone-in-nest-secure-idUSKCN1Q92F8</url>\"&gt;Google's Nest Secure home security system,&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/business/technology/2018/08/13/google-tracks-your-movements-like-it-or-not.html\">https://www.thestar.com/business/technology/2018/08/13/google-tracks-your-movements-like-it-or-not.html</url>\"&gt;tracking by Google services&lt;/a&gt; on Android devices and iPhones even when privacy settings are turned on. She singles out Facebook and Google as particularly being a concern.\"They have created a state of surveillance,\" she says. Amazon is not as bad but there are still concerns, she adds, like with their controversial facial recognition technology, Amazon Rekognition. The company's own shareholders urged Amazon&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aclu.org/letter/letter-shareholders-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-regarding-rekognition\">https://www.aclu.org/letter/letter-shareholders-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-regarding-rekognition</url>\"&gt; not to sell it to governments&lt;/a&gt;, fearing potential human rights abuses.Microsoft and Apple deserve more credit, she says, and their CEOs have both made public commitments to privacy.That's because companies like Apple are selling a physical product, unlike Facebook and Google, says Avner Levin, a professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management, Law and Business Department.\"The people that are using the service are the product that is actually being sold to advertisers,\" he says, referring to Facebook and Google.\"We are the product that they are selling.\"Privacy is linked to wider issues like fake news, and the weakening of democratic institutions, he adds. This was illustrated in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, when Russians deployed targeted information to manipulate social media users.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing: &lt;/strong&gt;In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, is currently investigating to see if Facebook violated a 2011 \"consent decree,\" that said they would address concerns about the tracking and sharing of user data, Cavoukian says. Facebook could face a hefty fine if found to be in breach of this order. But the \"gold standard\" for privacy legislation is the EU, says Levin. The EU passed the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation, in 2016.The legislation includes hefty fines (up to 4 per cent of a company's global revenue or (EURO)20 million, whichever is greater). It also has strict language on consent, the concept of privacy by design, and the right to be forgotten, under which individuals can apply to have negative search results deleted.Similar laws have been passed in Japan, Brazil and California, Cavoukian says, and there's discussion in the U.S. about national legislation.&lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Canada is in \"a significantly weaker situation than the EU,\" says Andrew Clement, professor emeritus in the Faculty of Information, at the University of Toronto.The &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/02_05_d_15/\">https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/02_05_d_15/</url>\"&gt;federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) &lt;/a&gt;was developed in 2000, before Facebook and smartphones, and lacks the \"fining powers\" of the EU law. \"There appears to be more willingness in the EU to use existing powers for bringing the tech giants to account,\" he says. Levin says there's been an \"absolute lack of will,\" on the part of both the Trudeau and Harper governments to do anything about privacy.In 2012 in response to complaints, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2012/nr-c_120404/\">https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2012/nr-c_120404/</url>\"&gt;the federal privacy commissioner did an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Facebook. But the office doesn't have the \"power to force Facebook to do anything,\" he says. The EU, influenced heavily by the Germans, is more attuned to the dangers of a loss of privacy, given their history of totalitarian governments.\"They're a lot more willing to regulate the companies, they're a lot more worried about the consequences,\" he says. But Cavoukian is optimistic that Canada can catch up. In 2018, the federal Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics issued a report entitled &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2018/parl/xc73-1/XC73-1-1-421-12-eng.pdf\">http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2018/parl/xc73-1/XC73-1-1-421-12-eng.pdf</url>\"&gt;\"Towards Privacy By Design,\"&lt;/a&gt; which she believes shows a \"clear intent\" to enhance the law.&lt;em&gt;May Warren&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disinformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt;In recent years, the world has rudely awakened to the proliferation of hate speech and \"fake news\" on social media - especially during election cycles, when online content can be used to disrupt democratic processes. Regulators and social media companies have come under pressure to stem the flow of online hate speech and malicious \"disinformation.\" But these are complicated problems with no easy fixes; the sheer volume of harmful content online is overwhelming and the notion of regulating speech will always provoke free speech concerns while drawing fierce opposition. And while some countries have legal definitions for hate speech, defining \"fake news\" is a tricky proposition; it can also be a dangerous one, especially in the hands of authoritarian regimes that want to censor information or crack down on the free press. Regulators have struggled to find workable solutions. \"No one's figured it out,\" says &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.history.ubc.ca/people/heidi-j-s-tworek\">http://www.history.ubc.ca/people/heidi-j-s-tworek</url>\"&gt;Heidi Tworek&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of history at the University of British Columbia who studies media, democracy and the digital economy. \"We continue to have to really evaluate many of these different schemes that are being proposed. These are such large and complex questions.\"&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing: &lt;/strong&gt;Several European countries are now moving toward regulating social media platforms, deploying strategies that have drawn both criticism and praise. In France, the government passed a law in November that empowers judges to order the removal of \"fake news\" during elections; violators face a penalty of one year in prison or a (EURO)75,000 fine.In the United Kingdom, a new parliamentary report - released this week following an 18-month investigation - is also calling for platforms like Facebook to be brought under regulatory control. The report proposes several new regulations, including a mandatory code of ethics and independent regulator who can bring legal proceedings against social media companies.Germany has taken a particularly bold approach to regulating hate speech on social media. In January 2018, the country passed its Net Enforcement Act - sometimes dubbed the NetzDG or \"Facebook law\" - which forces tech companies to remove hate speech within 24 hours of illegal content being reported. (When it's unclear whether content is actually illegal under German law, tech companies have seven days to consult and decide.) The penalty for breaking this law? Up to (EURO)50 million in fines. \"This is probably the furthest anyone has gone in trying to get large social media companies to adopt their policies to local laws,\" Tworek says. &lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;\"Canadians, and the Canadian government, are alive and alert to the issues,\" says &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://carleton.ca/sjc/profile/winseck-dwayne/\">https://carleton.ca/sjc/profile/winseck-dwayne/</url>\"&gt;Dwayne Winseck&lt;/a&gt;, a journalism professor at Carleton University and director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project. He points to Canada's recently-passed electoral reform bill, C-76, as a positive step. Online platforms like Facebook and Google must now create a registry of digital advertisements placed by political or third parties during elections and ensure they remain visible for two years. The law also bans the use of foreign money by \"third party\" advocacy groups during campaign periods - meaning social media companies can't knowingly accept advertisements paid for with foreign funds.Another provision prohibits making false statements about a candidate to influence an election. This only applies narrowly to certain types of statements, however (for example, statements about whether a candidate has broken the law or their place of birth).In January, the federal government &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/news/2019/01/government-of-canada-unveils-plan-to-safeguard-canadas-election.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/news/2019/01/government-of-canada-unveils-plan-to-safeguard-canadas-election.html</url>\"&gt;unveiled plans&lt;/a&gt; for safeguarding the upcoming election, including a $7 million initiative to improve the public's ability to detect \"online deceptive practices\" and a team of five bureaucrats who will alert the public whenever they find evidence of election interference.But where Canada could be innovating more is with social media regulation more generally, says journalist &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://tenove.com/about\">https://tenove.com/about</url>/\"&gt;Chris Tenove&lt;/a&gt;, a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia who studies global governance and digital politics. He would like to see Canada follow the lead of jurisdictions like the European Union, which worked together with social media companies to develop a code of conduct. As a result, platforms have voluntarily committed to \"quickly and efficiently\" addressing hate speech and early reports have shown good results, he says.One promising spot is Canada's involvement with an international effort called the Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News. Comprising parliamentarians from nine countries, the committee is scheduled to meet in Ottawa this May and has called for social media executives - including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai - to appear so they can explain what they're doing to stop the spread of disinformation.&lt;em&gt;Jennifer Yang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taxation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt;In the mid 1980s, when Canada's GST was still a twinkle in then prime minister Brian Mulroney's eye, the World Wide Web had not yet been invented and Google's founders were still pre-teen boys. Since then, digital technologies have advanced at breakneck speeds and companies like Google - not to mention Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon - have become essential to how Canadians spend their time and money. They have also been reaping billions in profits. Tax codes, meanwhile, have evolved more slowly and governments are now grappling with how to bring their taxation systems into the digital age.\"There is a missed opportunity for taxing these companies,\" says &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cdhowe.org/our-people/rosalie-wyonch\">https://www.cdhowe.org/our-people/rosalie-wyonch</url>\"&gt;Rosalie Wyonch&lt;/a&gt;, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute. \"Digital technology has been outpacing our ability to regulate (and) tax.\"Traditionally, tax systems were dependent on the idea of \"permanent establishment,\" Wyonch explains - this assumes a company has a physical presence within a country, or relates to physical goods crossing borders. But \"our tax code hasn't been updated to deal with intangibles,\" she says.Yet as digital services become more popular, the potential losses in sales tax revenue grow bigger, says University of Ottawa law professor &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.michaelgeist.ca\">http://www.michaelgeist.ca</url>/\"&gt;Michael Geist&lt;/a&gt;, the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law. (In 2017, Wyonch &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/10/23/canada-needs-to-follow-quebec-lead-on-taxing-netflix.html\">https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/10/23/canada-needs-to-follow-quebec-lead-on-taxing-netflix.html</url>\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that if Netflix alone were to collect and remit GST/HST, this would inject $50 million per year into Canada's tax coffers).Meanwhile, domestic companies - which do have to collect and remit sales taxes - argue they are left at a competitive disadvantage, Geist adds.When it comes to taxing corporate income, global discussions are now underway to figure out how this should be handled when it comes to big tech. \"That is a very complex international system, that we're waiting for consensus on,\" according to Wyonch.There are major challenges when it comes to simply defining the income of digital companies, she says. Say a foreign company does a digital marketing campaign for a Canadian company. \"Did they earn that income where they're located, or did they earn that income in Canada, if they never entered Canada (or) hosted any of its content on Canadian servers?\" Wyonch asks. \"We don't have a clear way to define, in a black and white way, what would - and would not - be considered Canadian income.\"&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;The G20 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have set a 2020 deadline for fighting tax avoidance (which tech giants are frequently accused of) and developing international standards for taxing big tech. But several countries - like the U.K., France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand - are already considering interim measures, raising concerns of creating a hodgepodge of different approaches around the world. The European Union has also unveiled plans for a digital tax of three per cent of revenues, an idea that has received blowback, including from some member states.&lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters last October that Ottawa is studying whether a new regulatory landscape is needed for the digital economy and he is pushing the G20 to speed up its timeline for establishing new rules. But Morneau says Canada's goal is to wait for an international consensus before taking action. Quebec and Saskatchewan, however, have forged ahead on the sales tax issue and this year, both started applying provincial sales taxes to foreign digital companies. In Quebec, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/businesses/consumption-taxes/gsthst-and-qst/special-cases-gsthst-and-qst/suppliers-outside-quebec/qst-registrant-suppliers-outside-quebec/\">https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/businesses/consumption-taxes/gsthst-and-qst/special-cases-gsthst-and-qst/suppliers-outside-quebec/qst-registrant-suppliers-outside-quebec/</url>\"&gt;more than 80 international companies&lt;/a&gt; - including Amazon, Apple, Googleand Netflix - were registered as of Feb. 18 to collect and remit provincial sales tax in that province.&lt;em&gt;Jennifer Yang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt; The rise of a short list of dominant tech companies has put reform of traditional notions of competition law at the top of the agenda for policy-makers around the globe.Modern competition law holds that when companies control large market shares, the result is higher prices and lower quality. It does not, however, make a monopoly illegal, prohibiting only the abuse of the power that a monopoly makes possible through exclusionary practices.Experts say practices such as a company giving its own products top ranking in its online search engine have been given a boost by so called big data - the corporate accumulation of massive data sets that are automatically processed through computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. Big data could pose competitive threats by allowing exclusive licensing deals for critical data sets, for example, says Ariane Le Strat, a U.K.-based associate with international law firm Bird &amp;amp; Bird, or companies could agree to price-discriminate - charge more to certain people based on their perceived ability to pay - as a result of customer data they have obtained.The public outcry over the misuse of personal data after the Cambridge Analytica scandal early last year when it was revealed that Facebook had harvested personal information for political purposes without consent ratcheted up the pressure on regulators, Le Strat says, with the U.S. among others vowing vigorous antitrust enforcement in the area.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;The European Union has taken the lead in enforcing stricter laws aimed at tech companies suspected of wilfully abusing their market dominance. Its competition directorate, for example, has imposed heavy sanctions in cases where it has alleged market abuse by technology giants, including the (EURO)2.4 billion fine levied against Google in 2017 for privileging its own products in search results. The European Union has also taken dramatic steps against Microsoft, now requiring its ubiquitous Windows operating system to enable a variety of web browsers.Germany's competition watchdog has ordered Facebook to curb its data collection excesses and is investigating Amazon after complaints from third-party sellers that their business was being hurt by the company's dual role as both a retailer on its Amazon Marketplace and the platform's owner/operator. The European Commission's competition watchdog is probing whether Amazon gains unfair advantage from the data it collects via transactions on the an e-commerce platform.Against this backdrop some consumer advocacy groups have called for a breakup of the big U.S. tech companies similar to the tearing asunder of the U.S. Bell system in the 1980s - or at the very least an overhaul of competition statutes to address the new threats from the tech giants' market dominance. &lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Canada has maintained that while the emergence of firms that control and exploit data can raise new challenges for competition law enforcement, \"this is not in and of itself cause for concern,\" according to the Competition Bureau.In a February 2018 report, the bureau concluded that while \"big data may require specific methods and tools, the bureau's traditional enforcement framework will continue to apply.\"The report says data tools that analyze and adjust to changes in the conduct of consumers and competitors may \"soften competition\" but this is really just an extension of practices that companies used before information technology was developed.Moreover, it says conscious parallelism (where firms in an oligopoly are aware that their pricing and output decisions have a significant impact upon rivals and without an explicit agreement co-ordinate their behaviour as if they were engaged in collusive behaviour) is not by itself prohibited under Canadian competition law.\"For competition law enforcement in Canada,\" according to Sandy Walker, a competition law partner at Dentons in Toronto, \"it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for now.\"&lt;em&gt;Michael Lewis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a newer area, and there's no scientifically established condition of social media or smartphone addiction.There are however \"problematic behaviours\" associated with the technologies that are similar to the ones found in recognized addictions to drugs, alcohol or gambling, such as not being able to cut back on use, says Centre for Addiction and Mental Health senior scientist Dr. Robert Mann.Mann says a&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.camh.ca/en/camh-news-and-stories/ontario-adults-reporting-increases-in-mental-health-problems\">https://www.camh.ca/en/camh-news-and-stories/ontario-adults-reporting-increases-in-mental-health-problems</url>\"&gt; 2016 CAMH survey of adults &lt;/a&gt;found 40 per cent said yes to at least one of a number of questions such as whether screen habits had ever caused the respondent to miss school, work, or important social activities, or whether a family member had ever expressed concern.Eight per cent of respondents said yes to three or more of the questions.Matthew Johnson, director of education at digital literacy non-profit, MediaSmarts, wouldn't call it an addiction either. But he has heard of serious problematic behaviours especially among young people using apps or social media sites that seem designed to keep them coming back. Snapchat streaks, where kids keep sending Snapchats to their friends every day to keep their streak and earn a flame icon, even if it means missing sleep, are one example.Benjamin Wong, a registered clinical counsellor in behavioural addictions in B.C., says he's seen about a five-per-cent increase over the last five years in people with screen or tech issues. He believes \"hooking\" customers with colourful, engaging social media sites or apps is a \"cornerstone\" of the tech business.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Other jurisdictions haven't gone as far as they have on issues such as data collection, or fake news.&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/02/france-gives-employees-right-to-disconnect-from-work-emails.html\">https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/02/france-gives-employees-right-to-disconnect-from-work-emails.html</url>\"&gt;France recently passed a law&lt;/a&gt; that companies with more than 50 employees can't email employees after business hours, giving individuals \"the right to disconnect.\"The goal, said officials in that country at the time, was to prevent burnout and reduce work-related stress. But Mann says such an idea might also help with addictive behaviour. \"I think it's interesting to consider that that kind of a law might reduce the need or the urge to continually access your devices,\" he says. &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/immersive-technologies-inquiry-launch-17-19/\">https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/immersive-technologies-inquiry-launch-17-19/</url>\"&gt;In the U.K., the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport parliamentary &lt;/a&gt;committee launched an inquiry into the growth of \"immersive and addictive technologies\" in December 2018, looking into the \"addictive nature of some technologies,\" and how they can impact behaviour. &lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;\"Not a whole lot has been done,\" in this country, says Wong, adding even much of the advocacy around regulating tech giants has been around privacy and data.Mann says it's a rich area for researchers, who might start by developing guidelines for healthy use.&lt;em&gt;May Warren&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copyright&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt;Copyright protections are evolving in the digital age as countries ramp up efforts to combat piracy and online infringement. The need for new measures has come to the forefront amid a torrent of illegal downloads of online content from providers including Netflix and YouTube and the pirating of material for commercial and personal use.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Protections are being updated in jurisdictions including the U.S. and especially the European Union, which is set to vote this spring in the European Parliament on an overhaul that would block copyright-protected material, including software, films, music and books, from being uploaded or electronically shared without permission from creators.A provision of the proposed policy would effectively mandate that companies including Facebook and Google develop and fund technology to automatically filter out infringed content on their sites and search engines on a mass scale.In the U.S., meanwhile, momentum is building around proposals in Congress that could formalize and increase royalty payments for music creators whose work is played on digital services.In many developing jurisdictions, the push to reform intellectual property protections has become part of a plan to boost economic competitiveness, with China for example proposing to make websites liable for promoting unlicensed works as part of a broader reform of property rights.Australia, which was described by the country's attorney general in 2014 as the \"worst offender\" of pirated content, has proposed new laws that would make if far easier for copyright owners to achieve court orders that would force search engines and internet service providers to block or delete pirated content.&lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;In Canada, part of the response is contained in the Copyright Modernization Act which requires that providers give notice to customers suspected of pirating content. It is left to the injured party to sue with awards capped at $5,000 for non-commercial infringement.Provisions in Canada's legislation also prohibit demands for payment in the infringement notices, as well as links to any other sites where payments can be made to content creators.The notice provision has been criticized by groups including the International Intellectual Property Alliance of content creators since if \"fails to provide meaningful incentives for network service providers to co-operate with copyright owners to deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital network environment.\"Another possible impediment to the notice provision stems from the new trade agreement among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico that limits internet platforms' liability for users' content, while the deal also stipulates that Canada eventually extend its copyright term.

At the same time, the products and services offered by the tech giants remain incredibly popular. They have become crucial parts of our economy and increasingly integrated into all aspects of our daily lives.As jurisdictions such as European Union pull ahead with cutting edge, if sometimes controversial, legislation to regulate the companies and protect citizens, Canada hasn't completely caught up. </p><p>Countries around the world are grappling with how to rein in the tech giants, particularly the so-called \"Big Five\" of Apple, Googleparent company Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft. Here's a look at what they're doing, and how Canada stacks up. &lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt; For Ann Cavoukian, former Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, privacy comes down to control.\"Personal control over the use of your data, when it's disclosed, how it's used. You should be the one in control,\" says the distinguished expert-in-residence at Ryerson, who leads the school's Privacy by Design Centre of ExcellencePractically it's about tech giants collecting and selling our data to third parties without our consent, she adds. This has been exposed in a slate of recent scandals, from the discovery of a microphone built into &lt;a href=\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-nest/google-fails-to-disclose-microphone-in-nest-secure-idUSKCN1Q92F8\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-nest/google-fails-to-disclose-microphone-in-nest-secure-idUSKCN1Q92F8</url>\"&gt;Google's Nest Secure home security system,&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/business/technology/2018/08/13/google-tracks-your-movements-like-it-or-not.html\">https://www.thestar.com/business/technology/2018/08/13/google-tracks-your-movements-like-it-or-not.html</url>\"&gt;tracking by Google services&lt;/a&gt; on Android devices and iPhones even when privacy settings are turned on. She singles out Facebook and Google as particularly being a concern.\"They have created a state of surveillance,\" she says. Amazon is not as bad but there are still concerns, she adds, like with their controversial facial recognition technology, Amazon Rekognition. The company's own shareholders urged Amazon&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aclu.org/letter/letter-shareholders-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-regarding-rekognition\">https://www.aclu.org/letter/letter-shareholders-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-regarding-rekognition</url>\"&gt; not to sell it to governments&lt;/a&gt;, fearing potential human rights abuses.Microsoft and Apple deserve more credit, she says, and their CEOs have both made public commitments to privacy.That's because companies like Apple are selling a physical product, unlike Facebook and Google, says Avner Levin, a professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management, Law and Business Department.\"The people that are using the service are the product that is actually being sold to advertisers,\" he says, referring to Facebook and Google.\"We are the product that they are selling.\"Privacy is linked to wider issues like fake news, and the weakening of democratic institutions, he adds. This was illustrated in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, when Russians deployed targeted information to manipulate social media users.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing: &lt;/strong&gt;In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, is currently investigating to see if Facebook violated a 2011 \"consent decree,\" that said they would address concerns about the tracking and sharing of user data, Cavoukian says. Facebook could face a hefty fine if found to be in breach of this order. But the \"gold standard\" for privacy legislation is the EU, says Levin. The EU passed the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation, in 2016.The legislation includes hefty fines (up to 4 per cent of a company's global revenue or (EURO)20 million, whichever is greater). It also has strict language on consent, the concept of privacy by design, and the right to be forgotten, under which individuals can apply to have negative search results deleted.Similar laws have been passed in Japan, Brazil and California, Cavoukian says, and there's discussion in the U.S. about national legislation.&lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Canada is in \"a significantly weaker situation than the EU,\" says Andrew Clement, professor emeritus in the Faculty of Information, at the University of Toronto.The &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/02_05_d_15/\">https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/02_05_d_15/</url>\"&gt;federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) &lt;/a&gt;was developed in 2000, before Facebook and smartphones, and lacks the \"fining powers\" of the EU law. \"There appears to be more willingness in the EU to use existing powers for bringing the tech giants to account,\" he says. Levin says there's been an \"absolute lack of will,\" on the part of both the Trudeau and Harper governments to do anything about privacy.In 2012 in response to complaints, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2012/nr-c_120404/\">https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2012/nr-c_120404/</url>\"&gt;the federal privacy commissioner did an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Facebook. But the office doesn't have the \"power to force Facebook to do anything,\" he says. The EU, influenced heavily by the Germans, is more attuned to the dangers of a loss of privacy, given their history of totalitarian governments.\"They're a lot more willing to regulate the companies, they're a lot more worried about the consequences,\" he says. But Cavoukian is optimistic that Canada can catch up. In 2018, the federal Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics issued a report entitled &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2018/parl/xc73-1/XC73-1-1-421-12-eng.pdf\">http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2018/parl/xc73-1/XC73-1-1-421-12-eng.pdf</url>\"&gt;\"Towards Privacy By Design,\"&lt;/a&gt; which she believes shows a \"clear intent\" to enhance the law.&lt;em&gt;May Warren&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disinformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt;In recent years, the world has rudely awakened to the proliferation of hate speech and \"fake news\" on social media - especially during election cycles, when online content can be used to disrupt democratic processes. Regulators and social media companies have come under pressure to stem the flow of online hate speech and malicious \"disinformation.\" But these are complicated problems with no easy fixes; the sheer volume of harmful content online is overwhelming and the notion of regulating speech will always provoke free speech concerns while drawing fierce opposition. And while some countries have legal definitions for hate speech, defining \"fake news\" is a tricky proposition; it can also be a dangerous one, especially in the hands of authoritarian regimes that want to censor information or crack down on the free press. Regulators have struggled to find workable solutions. \"No one's figured it out,\" says &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.history.ubc.ca/people/heidi-j-s-tworek\">http://www.history.ubc.ca/people/heidi-j-s-tworek</url>\"&gt;Heidi Tworek&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of history at the University of British Columbia who studies media, democracy and the digital economy. \"We continue to have to really evaluate many of these different schemes that are being proposed. These are such large and complex questions.\"&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing: &lt;/strong&gt;Several European countries are now moving toward regulating social media platforms, deploying strategies that have drawn both criticism and praise. In France, the government passed a law in November that empowers judges to order the removal of \"fake news\" during elections; violators face a penalty of one year in prison or a (EURO)75,000 fine.In the United Kingdom, a new parliamentary report - released this week following an 18-month investigation - is also calling for platforms like Facebook to be brought under regulatory control. The report proposes several new regulations, including a mandatory code of ethics and independent regulator who can bring legal proceedings against social media companies.Germany has taken a particularly bold approach to regulating hate speech on social media. In January 2018, the country passed its Net Enforcement Act - sometimes dubbed the NetzDG or \"Facebook law\" - which forces tech companies to remove hate speech within 24 hours of illegal content being reported. (When it's unclear whether content is actually illegal under German law, tech companies have seven days to consult and decide.) The penalty for breaking this law? Up to (EURO)50 million in fines. \"This is probably the furthest anyone has gone in trying to get large social media companies to adopt their policies to local laws,\" Tworek says. &lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;\"Canadians, and the Canadian government, are alive and alert to the issues,\" says &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://carleton.ca/sjc/profile/winseck-dwayne/\">https://carleton.ca/sjc/profile/winseck-dwayne/</url>\"&gt;Dwayne Winseck&lt;/a&gt;, a journalism professor at Carleton University and director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project. He points to Canada's recently-passed electoral reform bill, C-76, as a positive step. Online platforms like Facebook and Google must now create a registry of digital advertisements placed by political or third parties during elections and ensure they remain visible for two years. The law also bans the use of foreign money by \"third party\" advocacy groups during campaign periods - meaning social media companies can't knowingly accept advertisements paid for with foreign funds.Another provision prohibits making false statements about a candidate to influence an election. This only applies narrowly to certain types of statements, however (for example, statements about whether a candidate has broken the law or their place of birth).In January, the federal government &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/news/2019/01/government-of-canada-unveils-plan-to-safeguard-canadas-election.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/news/2019/01/government-of-canada-unveils-plan-to-safeguard-canadas-election.html</url>\"&gt;unveiled plans&lt;/a&gt; for safeguarding the upcoming election, including a $7 million initiative to improve the public's ability to detect \"online deceptive practices\" and a team of five bureaucrats who will alert the public whenever they find evidence of election interference.But where Canada could be innovating more is with social media regulation more generally, says journalist &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://tenove.com/about\">https://tenove.com/about</url>/\"&gt;Chris Tenove&lt;/a&gt;, a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia who studies global governance and digital politics. He would like to see Canada follow the lead of jurisdictions like the European Union, which worked together with social media companies to develop a code of conduct. As a result, platforms have voluntarily committed to \"quickly and efficiently\" addressing hate speech and early reports have shown good results, he says.One promising spot is Canada's involvement with an international effort called the Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News. Comprising parliamentarians from nine countries, the committee is scheduled to meet in Ottawa this May and has called for social media executives - including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai - to appear so they can explain what they're doing to stop the spread of disinformation.&lt;em&gt;Jennifer Yang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taxation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt;In the mid 1980s, when Canada's GST was still a twinkle in then prime minister Brian Mulroney's eye, the World Wide Web had not yet been invented and Google's founders were still pre-teen boys. Since then, digital technologies have advanced at breakneck speeds and companies like Google - not to mention Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon - have become essential to how Canadians spend their time and money. They have also been reaping billions in profits. Tax codes, meanwhile, have evolved more slowly and governments are now grappling with how to bring their taxation systems into the digital age.\"There is a missed opportunity for taxing these companies,\" says &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cdhowe.org/our-people/rosalie-wyonch\">https://www.cdhowe.org/our-people/rosalie-wyonch</url>\"&gt;Rosalie Wyonch&lt;/a&gt;, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute. \"Digital technology has been outpacing our ability to regulate (and) tax.\"Traditionally, tax systems were dependent on the idea of \"permanent establishment,\" Wyonch explains - this assumes a company has a physical presence within a country, or relates to physical goods crossing borders. But \"our tax code hasn't been updated to deal with intangibles,\" she says.Yet as digital services become more popular, the potential losses in sales tax revenue grow bigger, says University of Ottawa law professor &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.michaelgeist.ca\">http://www.michaelgeist.ca</url>/\"&gt;Michael Geist&lt;/a&gt;, the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law. (In 2017, Wyonch &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/10/23/canada-needs-to-follow-quebec-lead-on-taxing-netflix.html\">https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/10/23/canada-needs-to-follow-quebec-lead-on-taxing-netflix.html</url>\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that if Netflix alone were to collect and remit GST/HST, this would inject $50 million per year into Canada's tax coffers).Meanwhile, domestic companies - which do have to collect and remit sales taxes - argue they are left at a competitive disadvantage, Geist adds.When it comes to taxing corporate income, global discussions are now underway to figure out how this should be handled when it comes to big tech. \"That is a very complex international system, that we're waiting for consensus on,\" according to Wyonch.There are major challenges when it comes to simply defining the income of digital companies, she says. Say a foreign company does a digital marketing campaign for a Canadian company. \"Did they earn that income where they're located, or did they earn that income in Canada, if they never entered Canada (or) hosted any of its content on Canadian servers?\" Wyonch asks. \"We don't have a clear way to define, in a black and white way, what would - and would not - be considered Canadian income.\"&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;The G20 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have set a 2020 deadline for fighting tax avoidance (which tech giants are frequently accused of) and developing international standards for taxing big tech. But several countries - like the U.K., France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand - are already considering interim measures, raising concerns of creating a hodgepodge of different approaches around the world. The European Union has also unveiled plans for a digital tax of three per cent of revenues, an idea that has received blowback, including from some member states.&lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters last October that Ottawa is studying whether a new regulatory landscape is needed for the digital economy and he is pushing the G20 to speed up its timeline for establishing new rules. But Morneau says Canada's goal is to wait for an international consensus before taking action. Quebec and Saskatchewan, however, have forged ahead on the sales tax issue and this year, both started applying provincial sales taxes to foreign digital companies. In Quebec, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/businesses/consumption-taxes/gsthst-and-qst/special-cases-gsthst-and-qst/suppliers-outside-quebec/qst-registrant-suppliers-outside-quebec/\">https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/businesses/consumption-taxes/gsthst-and-qst/special-cases-gsthst-and-qst/suppliers-outside-quebec/qst-registrant-suppliers-outside-quebec/</url>\"&gt;more than 80 international companies&lt;/a&gt; - including Amazon, Apple, Googleand Netflix - were registered as of Feb. 18 to collect and remit provincial sales tax in that province.&lt;em&gt;Jennifer Yang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt; The rise of a short list of dominant tech companies has put reform of traditional notions of competition law at the top of the agenda for policy-makers around the globe.Modern competition law holds that when companies control large market shares, the result is higher prices and lower quality. It does not, however, make a monopoly illegal, prohibiting only the abuse of the power that a monopoly makes possible through exclusionary practices.Experts say practices such as a company giving its own products top ranking in its online search engine have been given a boost by so called big data - the corporate accumulation of massive data sets that are automatically processed through computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. Big data could pose competitive threats by allowing exclusive licensing deals for critical data sets, for example, says Ariane Le Strat, a U.K.-based associate with international law firm Bird &amp;amp; Bird, or companies could agree to price-discriminate - charge more to certain people based on their perceived ability to pay - as a result of customer data they have obtained.The public outcry over the misuse of personal data after the Cambridge Analytica scandal early last year when it was revealed that Facebook had harvested personal information for political purposes without consent ratcheted up the pressure on regulators, Le Strat says, with the U.S. among others vowing vigorous antitrust enforcement in the area.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;The European Union has taken the lead in enforcing stricter laws aimed at tech companies suspected of wilfully abusing their market dominance. Its competition directorate, for example, has imposed heavy sanctions in cases where it has alleged market abuse by technology giants, including the (EURO)2.4 billion fine levied against Google in 2017 for privileging its own products in search results. The European Union has also taken dramatic steps against Microsoft, now requiring its ubiquitous Windows operating system to enable a variety of web browsers.Germany's competition watchdog has ordered Facebook to curb its data collection excesses and is investigating Amazon after complaints from third-party sellers that their business was being hurt by the company's dual role as both a retailer on its Amazon Marketplace and the platform's owner/operator. The European Commission's competition watchdog is probing whether Amazon gains unfair advantage from the data it collects via transactions on the an e-commerce platform.Against this backdrop some consumer advocacy groups have called for a breakup of the big U.S. tech companies similar to the tearing asunder of the U.S. Bell system in the 1980s - or at the very least an overhaul of competition statutes to address the new threats from the tech giants' market dominance. &lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Canada has maintained that while the emergence of firms that control and exploit data can raise new challenges for competition law enforcement, \"this is not in and of itself cause for concern,\" according to the Competition Bureau.In a February 2018 report, the bureau concluded that while \"big data may require specific methods and tools, the bureau's traditional enforcement framework will continue to apply.\"The report says data tools that analyze and adjust to changes in the conduct of consumers and competitors may \"soften competition\" but this is really just an extension of practices that companies used before information technology was developed.Moreover, it says conscious parallelism (where firms in an oligopoly are aware that their pricing and output decisions have a significant impact upon rivals and without an explicit agreement co-ordinate their behaviour as if they were engaged in collusive behaviour) is not by itself prohibited under Canadian competition law.\"For competition law enforcement in Canada,\" according to Sandy Walker, a competition law partner at Dentons in Toronto, \"it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for now.\"&lt;em&gt;Michael Lewis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a newer area, and there's no scientifically established condition of social media or smartphone addiction.There are however \"problematic behaviours\" associated with the technologies that are similar to the ones found in recognized addictions to drugs, alcohol or gambling, such as not being able to cut back on use, says Centre for Addiction and Mental Health senior scientist Dr. Robert Mann.Mann says a&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.camh.ca/en/camh-news-and-stories/ontario-adults-reporting-increases-in-mental-health-problems\">https://www.camh.ca/en/camh-news-and-stories/ontario-adults-reporting-increases-in-mental-health-problems</url>\"&gt; 2016 CAMH survey of adults &lt;/a&gt;found 40 per cent said yes to at least one of a number of questions such as whether screen habits had ever caused the respondent to miss school, work, or important social activities, or whether a family member had ever expressed concern.Eight per cent of respondents said yes to three or more of the questions.Matthew Johnson, director of education at digital literacy non-profit, MediaSmarts, wouldn't call it an addiction either. But he has heard of serious problematic behaviours especially among young people using apps or social media sites that seem designed to keep them coming back. Snapchat streaks, where kids keep sending Snapchats to their friends every day to keep their streak and earn a flame icon, even if it means missing sleep, are one example.Benjamin Wong, a registered clinical counsellor in behavioural addictions in B.C., says he's seen about a five-per-cent increase over the last five years in people with screen or tech issues. He believes \"hooking\" customers with colourful, engaging social media sites or apps is a \"cornerstone\" of the tech business.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Other jurisdictions haven't gone as far as they have on issues such as data collection, or fake news.&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/02/france-gives-employees-right-to-disconnect-from-work-emails.html\">https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/02/france-gives-employees-right-to-disconnect-from-work-emails.html</url>\"&gt;France recently passed a law&lt;/a&gt; that companies with more than 50 employees can't email employees after business hours, giving individuals \"the right to disconnect.\"The goal, said officials in that country at the time, was to prevent burnout and reduce work-related stress. But Mann says such an idea might also help with addictive behaviour. \"I think it's interesting to consider that that kind of a law might reduce the need or the urge to continually access your devices,\" he says. &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/immersive-technologies-inquiry-launch-17-19/\">https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/immersive-technologies-inquiry-launch-17-19/</url>\"&gt;In the U.K., the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport parliamentary &lt;/a&gt;committee launched an inquiry into the growth of \"immersive and addictive technologies\" in December 2018, looking into the \"addictive nature of some technologies,\" and how they can impact behaviour. &lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;\"Not a whole lot has been done,\" in this country, says Wong, adding even much of the advocacy around regulating tech giants has been around privacy and data.Mann says it's a rich area for researchers, who might start by developing guidelines for healthy use.&lt;em&gt;May Warren&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copyright&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt;Copyright protections are evolving in the digital age as countries ramp up efforts to combat piracy and online infringement. The need for new measures has come to the forefront amid a torrent of illegal downloads of online content from providers including Netflix and YouTube and the pirating of material for commercial and personal use.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Protections are being updated in jurisdictions including the U.S. and especially the European Union, which is set to vote this spring in the European Parliament on an overhaul that would block copyright-protected material, including software, films, music and books, from being uploaded or electronically shared without permission from creators.A provision of the proposed policy would effectively mandate that companies including Facebook and Google develop and fund technology to automatically filter out infringed content on their sites and search engines on a mass scale.In the U.S., meanwhile, momentum is building around proposals in Congress that could formalize and increase royalty payments for music creators whose work is played on digital services.In many developing jurisdictions, the push to reform intellectual property protections has become part of a plan to boost economic competitiveness, with China for example proposing to make websites liable for promoting unlicensed works as part of a broader reform of property rights.Australia, which was described by the country's attorney general in 2014 as the \"worst offender\" of pirated content, has proposed new laws that would make if far easier for copyright owners to achieve court orders that would force search engines and internet service providers to block or delete pirated content.&lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;In Canada, part of the response is contained in the Copyright Modernization Act which requires that providers give notice to customers suspected of pirating content. It is left to the injured party to sue with awards capped at $5,000 for non-commercial infringement.Provisions in Canada's legislation also prohibit demands for payment in the infringement notices, as well as links to any other sites where payments can be made to content creators.The notice provision has been criticized by groups including the International Intellectual Property Alliance of content creators since if \"fails to provide meaningful incentives for network service providers to co-operate with copyright owners to deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital network environment.\"Another possible impediment to the notice provision stems from the new trade agreement among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico that limits internet platforms' liability for users' content, while the deal also stipulates that Canada eventually extend its copyright term. The liability provision could prevent Canada from adopting European-style digital copyright rules, experts note.&lt;em&gt;Michael Lewis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=\"endnote_contrib\"&gt;Michael Lewis is a Toronto-based reporter covering business.

At the same time, the products and services offered by the tech giants remain incredibly popular. They have become crucial parts of our economy and increasingly integrated into all aspects of our daily lives.As jurisdictions such as European Union pull ahead with cutting edge, if sometimes controversial, legislation to regulate the companies and protect citizens, Canada hasn't completely caught up. </p><p>Countries around the world are grappling with how to rein in the tech giants, particularly the so-called \"Big Five\" of Apple, Googleparent company Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft. Here's a look at what they're doing, and how Canada stacks up. &lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt; For Ann Cavoukian, former Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, privacy comes down to control.\"Personal control over the use of your data, when it's disclosed, how it's used. You should be the one in control,\" says the distinguished expert-in-residence at Ryerson, who leads the school's Privacy by Design Centre of ExcellencePractically it's about tech giants collecting and selling our data to third parties without our consent, she adds. This has been exposed in a slate of recent scandals, from the discovery of a microphone built into &lt;a href=\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-nest/google-fails-to-disclose-microphone-in-nest-secure-idUSKCN1Q92F8\">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-nest/google-fails-to-disclose-microphone-in-nest-secure-idUSKCN1Q92F8</url>\"&gt;Google's Nest Secure home security system,&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/business/technology/2018/08/13/google-tracks-your-movements-like-it-or-not.html\">https://www.thestar.com/business/technology/2018/08/13/google-tracks-your-movements-like-it-or-not.html</url>\"&gt;tracking by Google services&lt;/a&gt; on Android devices and iPhones even when privacy settings are turned on. She singles out Facebook and Google as particularly being a concern.\"They have created a state of surveillance,\" she says. Amazon is not as bad but there are still concerns, she adds, like with their controversial facial recognition technology, Amazon Rekognition. The company's own shareholders urged Amazon&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aclu.org/letter/letter-shareholders-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-regarding-rekognition\">https://www.aclu.org/letter/letter-shareholders-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-regarding-rekognition</url>\"&gt; not to sell it to governments&lt;/a&gt;, fearing potential human rights abuses.Microsoft and Apple deserve more credit, she says, and their CEOs have both made public commitments to privacy.That's because companies like Apple are selling a physical product, unlike Facebook and Google, says Avner Levin, a professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management, Law and Business Department.\"The people that are using the service are the product that is actually being sold to advertisers,\" he says, referring to Facebook and Google.\"We are the product that they are selling.\"Privacy is linked to wider issues like fake news, and the weakening of democratic institutions, he adds. This was illustrated in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, when Russians deployed targeted information to manipulate social media users.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing: &lt;/strong&gt;In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, is currently investigating to see if Facebook violated a 2011 \"consent decree,\" that said they would address concerns about the tracking and sharing of user data, Cavoukian says. Facebook could face a hefty fine if found to be in breach of this order. But the \"gold standard\" for privacy legislation is the EU, says Levin. The EU passed the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation, in 2016.The legislation includes hefty fines (up to 4 per cent of a company's global revenue or (EURO)20 million, whichever is greater). It also has strict language on consent, the concept of privacy by design, and the right to be forgotten, under which individuals can apply to have negative search results deleted.Similar laws have been passed in Japan, Brazil and California, Cavoukian says, and there's discussion in the U.S. about national legislation.&lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Canada is in \"a significantly weaker situation than the EU,\" says Andrew Clement, professor emeritus in the Faculty of Information, at the University of Toronto.The &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/02_05_d_15/\">https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/02_05_d_15/</url>\"&gt;federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) &lt;/a&gt;was developed in 2000, before Facebook and smartphones, and lacks the \"fining powers\" of the EU law. \"There appears to be more willingness in the EU to use existing powers for bringing the tech giants to account,\" he says. Levin says there's been an \"absolute lack of will,\" on the part of both the Trudeau and Harper governments to do anything about privacy.In 2012 in response to complaints, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2012/nr-c_120404/\">https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2012/nr-c_120404/</url>\"&gt;the federal privacy commissioner did an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Facebook. But the office doesn't have the \"power to force Facebook to do anything,\" he says. The EU, influenced heavily by the Germans, is more attuned to the dangers of a loss of privacy, given their history of totalitarian governments.\"They're a lot more willing to regulate the companies, they're a lot more worried about the consequences,\" he says. But Cavoukian is optimistic that Canada can catch up. In 2018, the federal Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics issued a report entitled &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2018/parl/xc73-1/XC73-1-1-421-12-eng.pdf\">http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2018/parl/xc73-1/XC73-1-1-421-12-eng.pdf</url>\"&gt;\"Towards Privacy By Design,\"&lt;/a&gt; which she believes shows a \"clear intent\" to enhance the law.&lt;em&gt;May Warren&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disinformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt;In recent years, the world has rudely awakened to the proliferation of hate speech and \"fake news\" on social media - especially during election cycles, when online content can be used to disrupt democratic processes. Regulators and social media companies have come under pressure to stem the flow of online hate speech and malicious \"disinformation.\" But these are complicated problems with no easy fixes; the sheer volume of harmful content online is overwhelming and the notion of regulating speech will always provoke free speech concerns while drawing fierce opposition. And while some countries have legal definitions for hate speech, defining \"fake news\" is a tricky proposition; it can also be a dangerous one, especially in the hands of authoritarian regimes that want to censor information or crack down on the free press. Regulators have struggled to find workable solutions. \"No one's figured it out,\" says &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.history.ubc.ca/people/heidi-j-s-tworek\">http://www.history.ubc.ca/people/heidi-j-s-tworek</url>\"&gt;Heidi Tworek&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of history at the University of British Columbia who studies media, democracy and the digital economy. \"We continue to have to really evaluate many of these different schemes that are being proposed. These are such large and complex questions.\"&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing: &lt;/strong&gt;Several European countries are now moving toward regulating social media platforms, deploying strategies that have drawn both criticism and praise. In France, the government passed a law in November that empowers judges to order the removal of \"fake news\" during elections; violators face a penalty of one year in prison or a (EURO)75,000 fine.In the United Kingdom, a new parliamentary report - released this week following an 18-month investigation - is also calling for platforms like Facebook to be brought under regulatory control. The report proposes several new regulations, including a mandatory code of ethics and independent regulator who can bring legal proceedings against social media companies.Germany has taken a particularly bold approach to regulating hate speech on social media. In January 2018, the country passed its Net Enforcement Act - sometimes dubbed the NetzDG or \"Facebook law\" - which forces tech companies to remove hate speech within 24 hours of illegal content being reported. (When it's unclear whether content is actually illegal under German law, tech companies have seven days to consult and decide.) The penalty for breaking this law? Up to (EURO)50 million in fines. \"This is probably the furthest anyone has gone in trying to get large social media companies to adopt their policies to local laws,\" Tworek says. &lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;\"Canadians, and the Canadian government, are alive and alert to the issues,\" says &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://carleton.ca/sjc/profile/winseck-dwayne/\">https://carleton.ca/sjc/profile/winseck-dwayne/</url>\"&gt;Dwayne Winseck&lt;/a&gt;, a journalism professor at Carleton University and director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project. He points to Canada's recently-passed electoral reform bill, C-76, as a positive step. Online platforms like Facebook and Google must now create a registry of digital advertisements placed by political or third parties during elections and ensure they remain visible for two years. The law also bans the use of foreign money by \"third party\" advocacy groups during campaign periods - meaning social media companies can't knowingly accept advertisements paid for with foreign funds.Another provision prohibits making false statements about a candidate to influence an election. This only applies narrowly to certain types of statements, however (for example, statements about whether a candidate has broken the law or their place of birth).In January, the federal government &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/news/2019/01/government-of-canada-unveils-plan-to-safeguard-canadas-election.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/news/2019/01/government-of-canada-unveils-plan-to-safeguard-canadas-election.html</url>\"&gt;unveiled plans&lt;/a&gt; for safeguarding the upcoming election, including a $7 million initiative to improve the public's ability to detect \"online deceptive practices\" and a team of five bureaucrats who will alert the public whenever they find evidence of election interference.But where Canada could be innovating more is with social media regulation more generally, says journalist &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://tenove.com/about\">https://tenove.com/about</url>/\"&gt;Chris Tenove&lt;/a&gt;, a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia who studies global governance and digital politics. He would like to see Canada follow the lead of jurisdictions like the European Union, which worked together with social media companies to develop a code of conduct. As a result, platforms have voluntarily committed to \"quickly and efficiently\" addressing hate speech and early reports have shown good results, he says.One promising spot is Canada's involvement with an international effort called the Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News. Comprising parliamentarians from nine countries, the committee is scheduled to meet in Ottawa this May and has called for social media executives - including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai - to appear so they can explain what they're doing to stop the spread of disinformation.&lt;em&gt;Jennifer Yang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taxation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt;In the mid 1980s, when Canada's GST was still a twinkle in then prime minister Brian Mulroney's eye, the World Wide Web had not yet been invented and Google's founders were still pre-teen boys. Since then, digital technologies have advanced at breakneck speeds and companies like Google - not to mention Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon - have become essential to how Canadians spend their time and money. They have also been reaping billions in profits. Tax codes, meanwhile, have evolved more slowly and governments are now grappling with how to bring their taxation systems into the digital age.\"There is a missed opportunity for taxing these companies,\" says &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cdhowe.org/our-people/rosalie-wyonch\">https://www.cdhowe.org/our-people/rosalie-wyonch</url>\"&gt;Rosalie Wyonch&lt;/a&gt;, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute. \"Digital technology has been outpacing our ability to regulate (and) tax.\"Traditionally, tax systems were dependent on the idea of \"permanent establishment,\" Wyonch explains - this assumes a company has a physical presence within a country, or relates to physical goods crossing borders. But \"our tax code hasn't been updated to deal with intangibles,\" she says.Yet as digital services become more popular, the potential losses in sales tax revenue grow bigger, says University of Ottawa law professor &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.michaelgeist.ca\">http://www.michaelgeist.ca</url>/\"&gt;Michael Geist&lt;/a&gt;, the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law. (In 2017, Wyonch &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/10/23/canada-needs-to-follow-quebec-lead-on-taxing-netflix.html\">https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/10/23/canada-needs-to-follow-quebec-lead-on-taxing-netflix.html</url>\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that if Netflix alone were to collect and remit GST/HST, this would inject $50 million per year into Canada's tax coffers).Meanwhile, domestic companies - which do have to collect and remit sales taxes - argue they are left at a competitive disadvantage, Geist adds.When it comes to taxing corporate income, global discussions are now underway to figure out how this should be handled when it comes to big tech. \"That is a very complex international system, that we're waiting for consensus on,\" according to Wyonch.There are major challenges when it comes to simply defining the income of digital companies, she says. Say a foreign company does a digital marketing campaign for a Canadian company. \"Did they earn that income where they're located, or did they earn that income in Canada, if they never entered Canada (or) hosted any of its content on Canadian servers?\" Wyonch asks. \"We don't have a clear way to define, in a black and white way, what would - and would not - be considered Canadian income.\"&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;The G20 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have set a 2020 deadline for fighting tax avoidance (which tech giants are frequently accused of) and developing international standards for taxing big tech. But several countries - like the U.K., France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand - are already considering interim measures, raising concerns of creating a hodgepodge of different approaches around the world. The European Union has also unveiled plans for a digital tax of three per cent of revenues, an idea that has received blowback, including from some member states.&lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters last October that Ottawa is studying whether a new regulatory landscape is needed for the digital economy and he is pushing the G20 to speed up its timeline for establishing new rules. But Morneau says Canada's goal is to wait for an international consensus before taking action. Quebec and Saskatchewan, however, have forged ahead on the sales tax issue and this year, both started applying provincial sales taxes to foreign digital companies. In Quebec, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/businesses/consumption-taxes/gsthst-and-qst/special-cases-gsthst-and-qst/suppliers-outside-quebec/qst-registrant-suppliers-outside-quebec/\">https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/businesses/consumption-taxes/gsthst-and-qst/special-cases-gsthst-and-qst/suppliers-outside-quebec/qst-registrant-suppliers-outside-quebec/</url>\"&gt;more than 80 international companies&lt;/a&gt; - including Amazon, Apple, Googleand Netflix - were registered as of Feb. 18 to collect and remit provincial sales tax in that province.&lt;em&gt;Jennifer Yang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt; The rise of a short list of dominant tech companies has put reform of traditional notions of competition law at the top of the agenda for policy-makers around the globe.Modern competition law holds that when companies control large market shares, the result is higher prices and lower quality. It does not, however, make a monopoly illegal, prohibiting only the abuse of the power that a monopoly makes possible through exclusionary practices.Experts say practices such as a company giving its own products top ranking in its online search engine have been given a boost by so called big data - the corporate accumulation of massive data sets that are automatically processed through computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. Big data could pose competitive threats by allowing exclusive licensing deals for critical data sets, for example, says Ariane Le Strat, a U.K.-based associate with international law firm Bird &amp;amp; Bird, or companies could agree to price-discriminate - charge more to certain people based on their perceived ability to pay - as a result of customer data they have obtained.The public outcry over the misuse of personal data after the Cambridge Analytica scandal early last year when it was revealed that Facebook had harvested personal information for political purposes without consent ratcheted up the pressure on regulators, Le Strat says, with the U.S. among others vowing vigorous antitrust enforcement in the area.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;The European Union has taken the lead in enforcing stricter laws aimed at tech companies suspected of wilfully abusing their market dominance. Its competition directorate, for example, has imposed heavy sanctions in cases where it has alleged market abuse by technology giants, including the (EURO)2.4 billion fine levied against Google in 2017 for privileging its own products in search results. The European Union has also taken dramatic steps against Microsoft, now requiring its ubiquitous Windows operating system to enable a variety of web browsers.Germany's competition watchdog has ordered Facebook to curb its data collection excesses and is investigating Amazon after complaints from third-party sellers that their business was being hurt by the company's dual role as both a retailer on its Amazon Marketplace and the platform's owner/operator. The European Commission's competition watchdog is probing whether Amazon gains unfair advantage from the data it collects via transactions on the an e-commerce platform.Against this backdrop some consumer advocacy groups have called for a breakup of the big U.S. tech companies similar to the tearing asunder of the U.S. Bell system in the 1980s - or at the very least an overhaul of competition statutes to address the new threats from the tech giants' market dominance. &lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Canada has maintained that while the emergence of firms that control and exploit data can raise new challenges for competition law enforcement, \"this is not in and of itself cause for concern,\" according to the Competition Bureau.In a February 2018 report, the bureau concluded that while \"big data may require specific methods and tools, the bureau's traditional enforcement framework will continue to apply.\"The report says data tools that analyze and adjust to changes in the conduct of consumers and competitors may \"soften competition\" but this is really just an extension of practices that companies used before information technology was developed.Moreover, it says conscious parallelism (where firms in an oligopoly are aware that their pricing and output decisions have a significant impact upon rivals and without an explicit agreement co-ordinate their behaviour as if they were engaged in collusive behaviour) is not by itself prohibited under Canadian competition law.\"For competition law enforcement in Canada,\" according to Sandy Walker, a competition law partner at Dentons in Toronto, \"it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for now.\"&lt;em&gt;Michael Lewis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a newer area, and there's no scientifically established condition of social media or smartphone addiction.There are however \"problematic behaviours\" associated with the technologies that are similar to the ones found in recognized addictions to drugs, alcohol or gambling, such as not being able to cut back on use, says Centre for Addiction and Mental Health senior scientist Dr. Robert Mann.Mann says a&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.camh.ca/en/camh-news-and-stories/ontario-adults-reporting-increases-in-mental-health-problems\">https://www.camh.ca/en/camh-news-and-stories/ontario-adults-reporting-increases-in-mental-health-problems</url>\"&gt; 2016 CAMH survey of adults &lt;/a&gt;found 40 per cent said yes to at least one of a number of questions such as whether screen habits had ever caused the respondent to miss school, work, or important social activities, or whether a family member had ever expressed concern.Eight per cent of respondents said yes to three or more of the questions.Matthew Johnson, director of education at digital literacy non-profit, MediaSmarts, wouldn't call it an addiction either. But he has heard of serious problematic behaviours especially among young people using apps or social media sites that seem designed to keep them coming back. Snapchat streaks, where kids keep sending Snapchats to their friends every day to keep their streak and earn a flame icon, even if it means missing sleep, are one example.Benjamin Wong, a registered clinical counsellor in behavioural addictions in B.C., says he's seen about a five-per-cent increase over the last five years in people with screen or tech issues. He believes \"hooking\" customers with colourful, engaging social media sites or apps is a \"cornerstone\" of the tech business.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Other jurisdictions haven't gone as far as they have on issues such as data collection, or fake news.&lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/02/france-gives-employees-right-to-disconnect-from-work-emails.html\">https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/01/02/france-gives-employees-right-to-disconnect-from-work-emails.html</url>\"&gt;France recently passed a law&lt;/a&gt; that companies with more than 50 employees can't email employees after business hours, giving individuals \"the right to disconnect.\"The goal, said officials in that country at the time, was to prevent burnout and reduce work-related stress. But Mann says such an idea might also help with addictive behaviour. \"I think it's interesting to consider that that kind of a law might reduce the need or the urge to continually access your devices,\" he says. &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/immersive-technologies-inquiry-launch-17-19/\">https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/immersive-technologies-inquiry-launch-17-19/</url>\"&gt;In the U.K., the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport parliamentary &lt;/a&gt;committee launched an inquiry into the growth of \"immersive and addictive technologies\" in December 2018, looking into the \"addictive nature of some technologies,\" and how they can impact behaviour. &lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;\"Not a whole lot has been done,\" in this country, says Wong, adding even much of the advocacy around regulating tech giants has been around privacy and data.Mann says it's a rich area for researchers, who might start by developing guidelines for healthy use.&lt;em&gt;May Warren&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copyright&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue:&lt;/strong&gt;Copyright protections are evolving in the digital age as countries ramp up efforts to combat piracy and online infringement. The need for new measures has come to the forefront amid a torrent of illegal downloads of online content from providers including Netflix and YouTube and the pirating of material for commercial and personal use.&lt;strong&gt;What others are doing:&lt;/strong&gt;Protections are being updated in jurisdictions including the U.S. and especially the European Union, which is set to vote this spring in the European Parliament on an overhaul that would block copyright-protected material, including software, films, music and books, from being uploaded or electronically shared without permission from creators.A provision of the proposed policy would effectively mandate that companies including Facebook and Google develop and fund technology to automatically filter out infringed content on their sites and search engines on a mass scale.In the U.S., meanwhile, momentum is building around proposals in Congress that could formalize and increase royalty payments for music creators whose work is played on digital services.In many developing jurisdictions, the push to reform intellectual property protections has become part of a plan to boost economic competitiveness, with China for example proposing to make websites liable for promoting unlicensed works as part of a broader reform of property rights.Australia, which was described by the country's attorney general in 2014 as the \"worst offender\" of pirated content, has proposed new laws that would make if far easier for copyright owners to achieve court orders that would force search engines and internet service providers to block or delete pirated content.&lt;strong&gt;What Canada is doing:&lt;/strong&gt;In Canada, part of the response is contained in the Copyright Modernization Act which requires that providers give notice to customers suspected of pirating content. It is left to the injured party to sue with awards capped at $5,000 for non-commercial infringement.Provisions in Canada's legislation also prohibit demands for payment in the infringement notices, as well as links to any other sites where payments can be made to content creators.The notice provision has been criticized by groups including the International Intellectual Property Alliance of content creators since if \"fails to provide meaningful incentives for network service providers to co-operate with copyright owners to deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital network environment.\"Another possible impediment to the notice provision stems from the new trade agreement among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico that limits internet platforms' liability for users' content, while the deal also stipulates that Canada eventually extend its copyright term. The liability provision could prevent Canada from adopting European-style digital copyright rules, experts note.&lt;em&gt;Michael Lewis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=\"endnote_contrib\"&gt;Michael Lewis is a Toronto-based reporter covering business.

At the same time, the products and services offered by the tech giants remain incredibly popular. They have become crucial parts of our economy and increasingly integrated into all aspects of our daily lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As jurisdictions such as European Union pull ahead with cutting edge, if sometimes controversial, legislation to regulate the companies and protect citizens, Canada hasn't completely caught up.</p><p>Countries around the world are grappling with how to rein in the tech giants, particularly the so-called \"Big Five\" of Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft. Here's a look at what they're doing, and how Canada stacks up.</p><p>Privacy</p><p>The issue:</p><p>For Ann Cavoukian, former Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, privacy comes down to control.</p><p>\"Personal control over the use of your data, when it's disclosed, how it's used. You should be the one in control,\" says the distinguished expert-in-residence at Ryerson, who leads the school's Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence</p><p>Practically it's about tech giants collecting and selling our data to third parties without our consent, she adds. This has been exposed in a slate of recent scandals, from the discovery of a microphone built into Google's Nest Secure home security system, to tracking by Google services on Android devices and iPhones even when privacy settings are turned on.</p><p>She singles out Facebook and Google as particularly being a concern.</p><p>\"They have created a state of surveillance,\" she says.</p><p>Amazon is not as bad but there are still concerns, she adds, like with their controversial facial recognition technology, Amazon Rekognition. The company's own shareholders urged Amazon not to sell it to governments, fearing potential human rights abuses.</p><p>Microsoft and Apple deserve more credit, she says, and their CEOs have both made public commitments to privacy.</p><p>That's because companies like Apple are selling a physical product, unlike Facebook and Google, says Avner Levin, a professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management, Law and Business Department.</p><p>\"The people that are using the service are the product that is actually being sold to advertisers,\" he says, referring to Facebook and Google.</p><p>\"We are the product that they are selling.\"</p><p>Privacy is linked to wider issues like fake news, and the weakening of democratic institutions, he adds. This was illustrated in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, when Russians deployed targeted information to manipulate social media users.</p><p>What others are doing:</p><p>In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, is currently investigating to see if Facebook violated a 2011 \"consent decree,\" that said they would address concerns about the tracking and sharing of user data, Cavoukian says. Facebook could face a hefty fine if found to be in breach of this order.</p><p>But the \"gold standard\" for privacy legislation is the EU, says Levin. The EU passed the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation, in 2016.</p><p>The legislation includes hefty fines (up to 4 per cent of a company's global revenue or \\x8020 million, whichever is greater). It also has strict language on consent, the concept of privacy by design, and the right to be forgotten, under which individuals can apply to have negative search results deleted.</p><p>Similar laws have been passed in Japan, Brazil and California, Cavoukian says, and there's discussion in the U.S. about national legislation.</p><p>What Canada is doing:</p><p>Canada is in \"a significantly weaker situation than the EU,\" says Andrew Clement, professor emeritus in the Faculty of Information, at the University of Toronto.</p><p>The federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) was developed in 2000, before Facebook and smartphones, and lacks the \"fining powers\" of the EU law.</p><p>\"There appears to be more willingness in the EU to use existing powers for bringing the tech giants to account,\" he says.</p><p>Levin says there's been an \"absolute lack of will,\" on the part of both the Trudeau and Harper governments to do anything about privacy.</p><p>In 2012 in response to complaints, the federal privacy commissioner did an investigation into Facebook. But the office doesn't have the \"power to force Facebook to do anything,\" he says.</p><p>The EU, influenced heavily by the Germans, is more attuned to the dangers of a loss of privacy, given their history of totalitarian governments.</p><p>\"They're a lot more willing to regulate the companies, they're a lot more worried about the consequences,\" he says.</p><p>But Cavoukian is optimistic that Canada can catch up.</p><p>In 2018, the federal Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics issued a report entitled \"Towards Privacy By Design,\" which she believes shows a \"clear intent\" to enhance the law.</p><p>May Warren</p><p>Disinformation</p><p>The issue:</p><p>In recent years, the world has rudely awakened to the proliferation of hate speech and \"fake news\" on social media - especially during election cycles, when online content can be used to disrupt democratic processes.</p><p>Regulators and social media companies have come under pressure to stem the flow of online hate speech and malicious \"disinformation.\" But these are complicated problems with no easy fixes; the sheer volume of harmful content online is overwhelming and the notion of regulating speech will always provoke free speech concerns while drawing fierce opposition.</p><p>And while some countries have legal definitions for hate speech, defining \"fake news\" is a tricky proposition; it can also be a dangerous one, especially in the hands of authoritarian regimes that want to censor information or crack down on the free press.</p><p>Regulators have struggled to find workable solutions. \"No one's figured it out,\" says Heidi Tworek, an assistant professor of history at the University of British Columbia who studies media, democracy and the digital economy. \"We continue to have to really evaluate many of these different schemes that are being proposed. These are such large and complex questions.\"</p><p>What others are doing:</p><p>Several European countries are now moving toward regulating social media platforms, deploying strategies that have drawn both criticism and praise. In France, the government passed a law in November that empowers judges to order the removal of \"fake news\" during elections; violators face a penalty of one year in prison or a \\x8075,000 fine.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, a new parliamentary report - released this week following an 18-month investigation - is also calling for platforms like Facebook to be brought under regulatory control. The report proposes several new regulations, including a mandatory code of ethics and independent regulator who can bring legal proceedings against social media companies.</p><p>Germany has taken a particularly bold approach to regulating hate speech on social media. In January 2018, the country passed its Net Enforcement Act - sometimes dubbed the NetzDG or \"Facebook law\" - which forces tech companies to remove hate speech within 24 hours of illegal content being reported. (When it's unclear whether content is actually illegal under German law, tech companies have seven days to consult and decide.)</p><p>The penalty for breaking this law? Up to \\x8050 million in fines. \"This is probably the furthest anyone has gone in trying to get large social media companies to adopt their policies to local laws,\" Tworek says.</p><p>What Canada is doing:</p><p>\"Canadians, and the Canadian government, are alive and alert to the issues,\" says Dwayne Winseck, a journalism professor at Carleton University and director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project.</p><p>He points to Canada's recently-passed electoral reform bill, C-76, as a positive step. Online platforms like Facebook and Google must now create a registry of digital advertisements placed by political or third parties during elections and ensure they remain visible for two years. The law also bans the use of foreign money by \"third party\" advocacy groups during campaign periods - meaning social media companies can't knowingly accept advertisements paid for with foreign funds.</p><p>Another provision prohibits making false statements about a candidate to influence an election. This only applies narrowly to certain types of statements, however (for example, statements about whether a candidate has broken the law or their place of birth).</p><p>In January, the federal government unveiled plans for safeguarding the upcoming election, including a $7 million initiative to improve the public's ability to detect \"online deceptive practices\" and a team of five bureaucrats who will alert the public whenever they find evidence of election interference.</p><p>But where Canada could be innovating more is with social media regulation more generally, says journalist Chris Tenove, a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia who studies global governance and digital politics.</p><p>He would like to see Canada follow the lead of jurisdictions like the European Union, which worked together with social media companies to develop a code of conduct. As a result, platforms have voluntarily committed to \"quickly and efficiently\" addressing hate speech and early reports have shown good results, he says.</p><p>One promising spot is Canada's involvement with an international effort called the Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News. Comprising parliamentarians from nine countries, the committee is scheduled to meet in Ottawa this May and has called for social media executives - including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai - to appear so they can explain what they're doing to stop the spread of disinformation.</p><p>Jennifer Yang</p><p>Taxation</p><p>The issue:</p><p>In the mid 1980s, when Canada's GST was still a twinkle in then prime minister Brian Mulroney's eye, the World Wide Web had not yet been invented and Google's founders were still pre-teen boys. Since then, digital technologies have advanced at breakneck speeds and companies like Google - not to mention Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon - have become essential to how Canadians spend their time and money.</p><p>They have also been reaping billions in profits. Tax codes, meanwhile, have evolved more slowly and governments are now grappling with how to bring their taxation systems into the digital age.</p><p>\"There is a missed opportunity for taxing these companies,\" says Rosalie Wyonch, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute. \"Digital technology has been outpacing our ability to regulate (and) tax.\"</p><p>Traditionally, tax systems were dependent on the idea of \"permanent establishment,\" Wyonch explains - this assumes a company has a physical presence within a country, or relates to physical goods crossing borders. But \"our tax code hasn't been updated to deal with intangibles,\" she says.</p><p>Yet as digital services become more popular, the potential losses in sales tax revenue grow bigger, says University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law. (In 2017, Wyonch wrote that if Netflix alone were to collect and remit GST/HST, this would inject $50 million per year into Canada's tax coffers).</p><p>Meanwhile, domestic companies - which do have to collect and remit sales taxes - argue they are left at a competitive disadvantage, Geist adds.</p><p>When it comes to taxing corporate income, global discussions are now underway to figure out how this should be handled when it comes to big tech. \"That is a very complex international system, that we're waiting for consensus on,\" according to Wyonch.</p><p>There are major challenges when it comes to simply defining the income of digital companies, she says. Say a foreign company does a digital marketing campaign for a Canadian company. \"Did they earn that income where they're located, or did they earn that income in Canada, if they never entered Canada (or) hosted any of its content on Canadian servers?\" Wyonch asks. \"We don't have a clear way to define, in a black and white way, what would - and would not - be considered Canadian income.\"</p><p>What others are doing:</p><p>The G20 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have set a 2020 deadline for fighting tax avoidance (which tech giants are frequently accused of) and developing international standards for taxing big tech. But several countries - like the U.K., France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand - are already considering interim measures, raising concerns of creating a hodgepodge of different approaches around the world. The European Union has also unveiled plans for a digital tax of three per cent of revenues, an idea that has received blowback, including from some member states.</p><p>What Canada is doing:</p><p>Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters last October that Ottawa is studying whether a new regulatory landscape is needed for the digital economy and he is pushing the G20 to speed up its timeline for establishing new rules. But Morneau says Canada's goal is to wait for an international consensus before taking action.</p><p>Quebec and Saskatchewan, however, have forged ahead on the sales tax issue and this year, both started applying provincial sales taxes to foreign digital companies. In Quebec, more than 80 international companies - including Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix - were registered as of Feb. 18 to collect and remit provincial sales tax in that province.</p><p>Jennifer Yang</p><p>Competition</p><p>The issue:</p><p>The rise of a short list of dominant tech companies has put reform of traditional notions of competition law at the top of the agenda for policy-makers around the globe.</p><p>Modern competition law holds that when companies control large market shares, the result is higher prices and lower quality. It does not, however, make a monopoly illegal, prohibiting only the abuse of the power that a monopoly makes possible through exclusionary practices.</p><p>Experts say practices such as a company giving its own products top ranking in its online search engine have been given a boost by so called big data - the corporate accumulation of massive data sets that are automatically processed through computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. Big data could pose competitive threats by allowing exclusive licensing deals for critical data sets, for example, says Ariane Le Strat, a U.K.-based associate with international law firm Bird &amp; Bird, or companies could agree to price-discriminate - charge more to certain people based on their perceived ability to pay - as a result of customer data they have obtained.</p><p>The public outcry over the misuse of personal data after the Cambridge Analytica scandal early last year when it was revealed that Facebook had harvested personal information for political purposes without consent ratcheted up the pressure on regulators, Le Strat says, with the U.S. among others vowing vigorous antitrust enforcement in the area.</p><p>What others are doing:</p><p>The European Union has taken the lead in enforcing stricter laws aimed at tech companies suspected of wilfully abusing their market dominance.</p><p>Its competition directorate, for example, has imposed heavy sanctions in cases where it has alleged market abuse by technology giants, including the \\x802.4 billion fine levied against Google in 2017 for privileging its own products in search results. The European Union has also taken dramatic steps against Microsoft, now requiring its ubiquitous Windows operating system to enable a variety of web browsers.</p><p>Germany's competition watchdog has ordered Facebook to curb its data collection excesses and is investigating Amazon after complaints from third-party sellers that their business was being hurt by the company's dual role as both a retailer on its Amazon Marketplace and the platform's owner/operator. The European Commission's competition watchdog is probing whether Amazon gains unfair advantage from the data it collects via transactions on the an e-commerce platform.</p><p>Against this backdrop some consumer advocacy groups have called for a breakup of the big U.S. tech companies similar to the tearing asunder of the U.S. Bell system in the 1980s - or at the very least an overhaul of competition statutes to address the new threats from the tech giants' market dominance.</p><p>What Canada is doing:</p><p>Canada has maintained that while the emergence of firms that control and exploit data can raise new challenges for competition law enforcement, \"this is not in and of itself cause for concern,\" according to the Competition Bureau.</p><p>In a February 2018 report, the bureau concluded that while \"big data may require specific methods and tools, the bureau's traditional enforcement framework will continue to apply.\"</p><p>The report says data tools that analyze and adjust to changes in the conduct of consumers and competitors may \"soften competition\" but this is really just an extension of practices that companies used before information technology was developed.</p><p>Moreover, it says conscious parallelism (where firms in an oligopoly are aware that their pricing and output decisions have a significant impact upon rivals and without an explicit agreement co-ordinate their behaviour as if they were engaged in collusive behaviour) is not by itself prohibited under Canadian competition law.</p><p>\"For competition law enforcement in Canada,\" according to Sandy Walker, a competition law partner at Dentons in Toronto, \"it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for now.\"</p><p>Michael Lewis</p><p>Addiction</p><p>The issue: This is a newer area, and there's no scientifically established condition of social media or smartphone addiction.</p><p>There are however \"problematic behaviours\" associated with the technologies that are similar to the ones found in recognized addictions to drugs, alcohol or gambling, such as not being able to cut back on use, says Centre for Addiction and Mental Health senior scientist Dr. Robert Mann.</p><p>Mann says a 2016 CAMH survey of adults found 40 per cent said yes to at least one of a number of questions such as whether screen habits had ever caused the respondent to miss school, work, or important social activities, or whether a family member had ever expressed concern.</p><p>Eight per cent of respondents said yes to three or more of the questions.</p><p>Matthew Johnson, director of education at digital literacy non-profit, MediaSmarts, wouldn't call it an addiction either. But he has heard of serious problematic behaviours especially among young people using apps or social media sites that seem designed to keep them coming back.</p><p>Snapchat streaks, where kids keep sending Snapchats to their friends every day to keep their streak and earn a flame icon, even if it means missing sleep, are one example.</p><p>Benjamin Wong, a registered clinical counsellor in behavioural addictions in B.C., says he's seen about a five-per-cent increase over the last five years in people with screen or tech issues. He believes \"hooking\" customers with colourful, engaging social media sites or apps is a \"cornerstone\" of the tech business.</p><p>What others are doing:</p><p>Other jurisdictions haven't gone as far as they have on issues such as data collection, or fake news.</p><p>France recently passed a law that companies with more than 50 employees can't email employees after business hours, giving individuals \"the right to disconnect.\"</p><p>The goal, said officials in that country at the time, was to prevent burnout and reduce work-related stress. But Mann says such an idea might also help with addictive behaviour.</p><p>\"I think it's interesting to consider that that kind of a law might reduce the need or the urge to continually access your devices,\" he says.</p><p>In the U.K., the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport parliamentary committee launched an inquiry into the growth of \"immersive and addictive technologies\" in December 2018, looking into the \"addictive nature of some technologies,\" and how they can impact behaviour.</p><p>What Canada is doing:</p><p>\"Not a whole lot has been done,\" in this country, says Wong, adding even much of the advocacy around regulating tech giants has been around privacy and data.</p><p>Mann says it's a rich area for researchers, who might start by developing guidelines for healthy use.</p><p>May Warren</p><p>Copyright</p><p>The issue:</p><p>Copyright protections are evolving in the digital age as countries ramp up efforts to combat piracy and online infringement. The need for new measures has come to the forefront amid a torrent of illegal downloads of online content from providers including Netflix and YouTube and the pirating of material for commercial and personal use.</p><p>What others are doing:</p><p>Protections are being updated in jurisdictions including the U.S. and especially the European Union, which is set to vote this spring in the European Parliament on an overhaul that would block copyright-protected material, including software, films, music and books, from being uploaded or electronically shared without permission from creators.</p><p>A provision of the proposed policy would effectively mandate that companies including Facebook and Google develop and fund technology to automatically filter out infringed content on their sites and search engines on a mass scale.</p><p>In the U.S., meanwhile, momentum is building around proposals in Congress that could formalize and increase royalty payments for music creators whose work is played on digital services.</p><p>In many developing jurisdictions, the push to reform intellectual property protections has become part of a plan to boost economic competitiveness, with China for example proposing to make websites liable for promoting unlicensed works as part of a broader reform of property rights.</p><p>Australia, which was described by the country's attorney general in 2014 as the \"worst offender\" of pirated content, has proposed new laws that would make if far easier for copyright owners to achieve court orders that would force search engines and internet service providers to block or delete pirated content.</p><p>What Canada is doing:</p><p>In Canada, part of the response is contained in the Copyright Modernization Act which requires that providers give notice to customers suspected of pirating content. It is left to the injured party to sue with awards capped at $5,000 for non-commercial infringement.</p><p>Provisions in Canada's legislation also prohibit demands for payment in the infringement notices, as well as links to any other sites where payments can be made to content creators.</p><p>The notice provision has been criticized by groups including the International Intellectual Property Alliance of content creators since if \"fails to provide meaningful incentives for network service providers to co-operate with copyright owners to deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital network environment.\"</p><p>Another possible impediment to the notice provision stems from the new trade agreement among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico that limits internet platforms' liability for users' content, while the deal also stipulates that Canada eventually extend its copyright term. The liability provision could prevent Canada from adopting European-style digital copyright rules, experts note.</p><p>Michael Lewis</p><p>Michael Lewis is a Toronto-based reporter covering business.

In the form of development grants and loans, the funding will be split between low-income and middle-income housing programs, with the rest dedicated to mitigating homelessness in the region. Along with Amazon  , Microsoft is among the largest employers in the region. </p><p>\"Ultimately, a healthy business needs to be part of a healthy community. And a healthy community must have housing that is within the economic reach of every part of the community, including the many dedicated people that provide the vital services on which we all rely,\" wrote Microsoft's CFO Amy Hood  .</p><p>Microsoft's funding commitment resonated well beyond the Seattle area. The Bay Area, home to Facebook  , Alphabet  , Apple  and many other fast-growing firms, is another microcosm of how successful -- and how divisive -- the tech industry has become. New development of homes and transportation hasn't remotely kept pace with the industry's dramatic expansion in recent years, driving an affordability crisis, profound levels of inequality, and no small measure of antipathy towards Big Tech. In New York, the forthcoming arrival of Amazon's second headquarters in Long Island City, Queens brought similar tensions to the surface, with Amazon's HQ2 announcement  .</p><p>\"It's a double edged sword,\" said Al Nagy, mayor of Newark, Calif., a city about 10 miles away from Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters and nearby by many other tech campuses. While skyrocketing property values can help pay for better services, he said, \"the effect has been less affordability. The tech companies are doing more than ever to address the issue, but it's still just a drop in the bucket.\"</p><p>Facebook and Alphabet, for instance, each plan to build employee housing near their respective headquarters, having proposed multi million-dollar developments that mix units earmarked for employees with a percentage of affordable rentals as required by law. But the regional housing crisis is so widespread that it's unknown how much they will do to make local housing costs more affordable. </p><p>\"In the big picture, they aren't doing much to offset the housing crisis because the need is so great,\" Nagy added.</p><p>To be sure, the Bay Area's affordability crisis is a complex problem that no single corporation, policy proposal or monetary pledge can resolve. In other areas, tech companies are trying to boost their reputations through social impact investments of a kind: Facebook, for instance, aims to mend fences with the news industry -- which it's been accused of handicapping -- by recently pledging $300 million to small, local newsrooms across the country. As part of its New York expansion, Amazon promised to deliver certain community benefits like new greenery, infrastructure investments and donated space for tech and arts incubators.</p><p>Such investments are more than just PR initiatives, however. According to Andre Shepley of Truvalue Labs, they're also in the interests of shareholders who increasingly view good corporate citizenship as a competitive advantage, too.</p><p>Truvalue Labs tracks the ESG performance (shorthand for environmental, social, governance) of public companies, and Shepley noted that over time, strong ESG performance correlates with strong financial performance.

They're now once again walking a minefield of regulatory investigations, public criticism and legislative threats over antitrust concerns, content moderation and privacy concerns.Be smart: Decrying tech giants' power is an increasingly winning message among Americans on both the populist right and progressive left. It can also present competitive and political benefits for those voicing it. The biggest power player is President Donald Trump himself, who recently escalated his feud [2]with social media companies with an executive order taking aim at their liability protections after Twitter took action against his incendiary messages. </p><p>Here are the firms, faces and groups to watch as the techlash heats back up.Industry: Companies that compete with or rely on major tech companies are increasingly outspoken in their criticisms \u2014 and in some cases, have taken those concerns to lawmakers and antitrust enforcers. Oracle, locked in a long-running copyright battle with Google, has lobbied against the company on privacy issues and supported changes to online platforms' legal immunity for user-posted content. Oracle executive vice president Ken Glueck has argued[3] there isn't a broad techlash, but a narrower bristling against companies whose business model relies on consumer data collection.Yelp has been outspoken in its calls for antitrust action against Google, accusing the company of unfairly favoring[4] its own products in search results. It hosted an event last year entitled the \"Vanguard of the Techlash.[5]\"News Corp is at the forefront of criticism[6] from the news industry that tech giants unfairly scoop up ad revenue from publishers. Republican lawmakers: Much of the tech criticism on the right centers on claims of anti-conservative bias and Silicon Valley firms' dealings in China. Freshman Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) quickly made a name for himself as one of tech's biggest foils on the right. He has called for antitrust investigations, reforms to children's online privacy[7] law, and introduced a bill[8] that would create a government audit process to ensure platforms moderate content in a politically neutral manner.Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) has been outspoken against tech on privacy issues \u2014 suggesting there should be uniform federal policy that holds tech and telecom firms to the same privacy standards \u2014 and urged[9] the FTC to take action against Facebook and Google last year over potential privacy, data security, and antitrust violations.Sen. Lindsay Graham (R- S.C.), as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, introduced bipartisan legislation[10] that would require online platforms to \"earn\" the legal immunity they currently have for user-posted content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Democratic lawmakers: The techlash discourse on the left has touched on privacy, misinformation and ways tech companies may exacerbate social inequities. But antitrust enforcement has been perhaps the most key theme. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a former state attorney general who was involved in the Microsoft antitrust case, supported a change in the Section 230 law[11] related to sex trafficking, co-sponsored Graham's bill and joined Hawley on a letter to the Justice Department urging a broad review of Google's practices in its antitrust investigation.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) made breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google a major part of her campaign for president, and has called Facebook a \"disinformation-for-profit machine\" in criticizing[12] its political ads policy.Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chairman of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, is leading a bipartisan probe into the market power of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Advocacy groups: Organizations pushing for antitrust action or legislative changes have stayed on message during the pandemic. Two newer groups have quickly developed profiles as techlash agitators. The American Economic Liberties Project launched this year[13] with funding from eBay founder Pierre Omidyar's the Omidyar Network, and is led by Sarah Miller, who also co-chairs the Freedom From Facebook and Google coalition[14]. The project published a paper outlining antitrust and regulatory remedies for curbing the power of Facebook and Google.The Internet Accountability Project[15]<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theiap.org/\">https://www.theiap.org/</url>, a conservative advocacy group that has received funding from Oracle, has focused its efforts on anti-conservative bias, privacy violations, anticompetitive practices and other issues. Our thought bubble: As the criticism ramps up again, tech leaders are already getting nostalgic for the good old days of the fight to limit coronavirus infections. \"It felt to me that over the last couple of months there was this brief moment of unity with our response on COVID, where it felt like we were all in this together,' Zuckerberg said on a call with employees Tuesday.

He is also vice president of Febraban, the Brazilian banking association. Cano sat down with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence during the banking associations' recent Ciab banking and technology conference in S\u00e3o Paulo, to discuss the competitive environment between banks and financial technology companies in Brazil.</p><p>What follows is an edited transcript of that discussion.</p><p>Andr\u00e9 Rodrigues Cano, Banco Bradesco executive and vice president of Febraban.</p><p>As big techs step into the financial services offer, how do you see Brazilian banks' readiness to face unprecedented competition?</p><p>Andr\u00e9 Cano: It is not clear yet how this competition will unfold in the market. Of course, the big techs have a lot of information about their customers, but not necessarily financial information. We think that there is something that counts, which is the trust that people have in banks, especially in Brazil. It depends of course on how the competition plays out, there are a lot of regulatory aspects that we have to consider   They have to play on the same field of regulation as the national banks and foreign banks.</p><p>Are regulatory grounds uneven at present?</p><p>We can't say there is competition exactly just yet. But of course, we (would) need an even one. What we do not need is asymmetry. Certainly, regulators in Brazil are looking into this.</p><p>Where do you think are Brazilian banks most heavily targeting their IT investments?</p><p>Brazilian banks are still made under legacy (systems), so there are still a lot of investments in [that regard]. Of course, banks have to have those systems, otherwise, they could not process billions of transactions every day, as they do. So I would say part still goes toward legacy, and a lot of significant innovation on technologies such as AI. Customer relationship management is another area in which banks are investing a lot, trying to get the view of big techs. And big data and analytics in general, which are not only being used for credit analysis. Today, we have data that could be applied not just on the historical information of customers, which is the old model for credit analysis, but in fact, you can capture information on social media, and other areas that combined with AI or other systems, like machine learning, can produce a much better credit quality analysis. All things are possible today due to these new technologies.</p><p>How is the banking sector planning to attract human capital, and win them over a tech environment that might appear more attractive to young generations?</p><p>I think that the best way to do that is trying to make agreements with Brazilian universities to provide opportunities for students. We have a lot of programs with Brazilian universities, such as Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Carlos. We have an agreement to provide data science internships in the bank. So they start as interns and then, if they prove worthy, they become employees.</p><p>What changes, if any, are being made to make banking culture more appealing to talent?</p><p>It's a more informal environment inside the bank we are going for   that's the main change. After 75 years since the founding of Bradesco, people can now work without a tie ... Probably more important than that is the vision of diversity. If banks want to connect with their customers, they need to have diversity, and accept it internally. This is a big cultural change. And then, of course, there are things that do not have to change ... At Bradesco, we have a strong ethical culture that does not change with age.</p><p>AI services and blockchain have been some of the most talked-about technologies during the Ciab event. Are Brazilians ready for digitalization and this kind of new tech?</p><p>We [at Bradesco] have 16 million fully digital users, more than 50% of our 29 million customers with current accounts. I think most Brazilians are prepared for the digitalization process. I remember in the past, when we started banking automation in Brazil and the first ATMs arrived, there was a big concern about retired people. How are they going to use them? And it surprisingly worked. People learn fast. When you look at the numbers of digital access in the bank, we have higher transactions from mobile than from internet (banking), which was unthinkable years ago. New technology can always appear and change the situation.</p><p>There are still roughly 55 million non-banked individuals in Brazil. Who would you think is going to serve them in the future?</p><p>I think we have done good work so far in Brazil with unbanked people. Bradesco started in 2002 with an agreement with a postal company in Brazil, Empresa Brasileira de Correos y Telegrafos. We started Banco Postal, which was an enormous success in providing financial services to unbanked people all over the country in places where there were no banks at that time. Since then, you now have a lot of new services and technologies that can provide financial services. We have the creation of \"payments institutions\" now, [which] are working on services that can satisfy some of the needs of unbanked people.</p><p>[Editor's Note: \"Instituc\u00f5es de pagamento,\" or payments institutions, are companies that offer payment services that can be carried out independently from banks through pre-paid cards, mobile phones and other methods, according to Banco Central do Brasil.]</p><p>Will the next wave of inclusion in Brazil be driven by payment institutions and fintechs rather than traditional institutions?</p><p>Payments, probably, but also from traditional institutions. I would say that we have more possibilities today to serve the unbanked. We have the correspondents, payment institutions and credit card; we have free digital accounts. Multiple ways of serving people and if you have a low cost of service, it is certainly profitable. But it always depends on your cost structure. Traditional services are probably not the best way to address (the segment) because of the costs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLLFD-52447497</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLLFD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCW-Y7Y1-F19Y-C215-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">427793</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1076\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Latin America Financials Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 19, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002IC8</classCode><className>BANCO BRADESCO SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BBDC3 (BOVESPA)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BBD (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Industry News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000165</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

Specifically, the\u00a0Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) alleges that when users set up their accounts, Google did not disclose that location data would be collected, kept and used when the 'web and app activity' setting was switched on. The watchdog claims users would have assumed that switching off the 'location history' setting would stop Google from collecting location data.  \"Many consumers make a conscious decision to turn off settings to stop the collection of their location data, but we allege that Google's conduct may have prevented consumers from making that choice,\" ACCC chair Rod Sims said in a statement on Tuesday.  It's a landmark case, and the first serious swing at the global tech conglomerates following the ACCC's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/industries/information-technology/digital-platforms-inquiry-accc/\">Digital Platforms Enquiry</url>.  But, while some in the Aussie tech space will simply enjoy watching Google squirm, the case may well mark a change in the tide. Anything that affects big tech companies is likely to trickle down to small tech companies, too.  Speaking to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">StartupSmart</emphasis>, M8 Ventures founder Alan Jones says as far as he's aware the startup community isn't following this case particularly closely, \"except with a little gravitorial combat spectator, ghoulish interest in the outcome.\"  \"A lot of us work in parts of the startup industry where Google, Facebook and all of the tech giants have significant influence on how we acquire our customers and how much it costs us to acquire a customer,\" he explains.  At the same time, many startups are either competing with some of the services those tech giants provide, or worrying the day will come that they are. There's always a risk that the gargantuas could move into their space and \"crush us\", Jones notes.  So, for now at least, startups are largely observing with interest and \"looking to see Google shed some blood over this\", he adds.  \"They're hoping there will be a spectacle to watch.\"  That said, there are folks in the startup space who may well be keeping a closer eye on developments, including legal counsel and chief operating officers, for example, at scale-ups.  These are companies that already have a strong customer base, and which are making money.  \"Google has a lot of customers in Australia and is making a lot of money selling ads that are further targeted according to the data they've been capturing,\" Jones says.  If you're a scale-up that also has a significant Australian customer base, \"maybe it's time to start paying closer attention to what your startup is doing with user data\".

Source: supplied.</emphasis>[/caption] Google as a utility When it comes to responsible data protection,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/analysis/jacinda-ardern-lunch-benjamin-chong/\">Benjamin Chong</url>, partner at Right Click Capital, tells <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">StartupSmart</emphasis> he sees the need for a \"three-pronged approach\".  First of all, \"there needs to be a base level of education\", he says.  It's important for users to understand what data is theirs, and what it could potentially be used for.  Then, there's an onus on the platform or service itself to help users \"make informed choices\" when they're using it, and a responsibility for the regulator to enforce this. Service providers such as Google are becoming \"like utilities\", Chong explains.  \"You have to make use of them, you've got no choice. It's crazy not using a Google Maps or equivalent to be able to find where something is, or not using a search engine to be able to locate information.\"  This case could be a turning point in the conversation, he suggests. It's feasible that in the future, clarity around data use will be front of mind for consumers, and therefore it should be for startups, too.  \"I think the best practice is to have clarity with your users,\" Chong says.  \"We've heard for a long time that data is the new oil,\" he adds.  But, just as oil companies face regulation around pollution and protecting the environment, mining of data needs to be controlled, too.  \"Users need to have an education so that they're able to make informed decisions, and then they need to have access to tools in order to know what people are storing, and have the right to delete such things,\" Chong argues.  For startups, data privacy should be high-priority from the offset, Jones says.  \"I think it should definitely influence how they plan to gain user consent to do this and how they inform the user of what they intend to do with the data,\" he says.  Privacy policies - and sometimes terms and conditions in general - can be an afterthought for tech founders.  \"It needs to come further to the fore,\" Jones says.  Even though, no matter how simple they are to understand, many users still won't read such policies, \"we need to show that we've made them easy to understand, and specific, and current and up to date\", Jones explains.  \"It's really not good enough to start with an MVP when it comes to a privacy policy,\" he adds.  Every user you acquire is subject to those terms. And while you can update them later, it's often tricky to get users to consent to something new.  \"Better to start at the beginning with a good set,\" Jones says.  That said, this is by no means an insurmountable hurdle. Of all the things founders should be thinking about right off the bat, getting your terms and conditions straight could, potentially, be an easy one to cross of the list.  All the industry needs, Jones says, is a plain-English, straightforward, open-sourced templates for terms-and-conditions documents, that can be easily customised.  \"We can solve a lot of the problems here by publishing open source templates for others to follow,\" he says. A Faustian bargain This ACCC-Google debacle arrives at a time when data and privacy is particularly topical.  It comes in the same week that Peter Dutton's Department of Home Affairs suggested using facial recognition artificial intelligence technology to verify the age of those viewing pornography online - a measure that was quickly shot down and widely criticised.  There's a shift in sentiment here, Chong says.  \"There's been a real 'aha' moment that we do not want a situation in Australia like what is happening in Hong Kong, where to protect our privacy we need to walk on the streets with face masks,\" he says.  There are many Aussie expats in Hong Kong, he explains, and a dawning realisation that \"we don't want all our faces in these databases that people without a proper court warrant are able to search\".  Tech companies have a role to play in developing technology responsibly. And, if they want to grow into a trusted brand, they may have to.  \"With education we can give autonomy to the user. And then, the more transparent an organisation is the greater the level of trust,\" Chong says.  Jones also expresses concern about the direction in which facial recognition technology is going.  \"I personally am greatly, deeply concerned about the way facial recognition data capture is being rolled out, how it's being shared among multiple agencies, how it's very likely to be also shared with private enterprise, and how it's very likely not to have any safety controls to prevent stalking and privacy invasion,\" he says.  But, as far as he's concerned, he's still in the minority.  \"I think there's a general uptick in people's level of concern about it, but I think we're still a long way away from the average Australian deciding to take action,\" he explains.  \"They're broadly aware of the terms of the Faustian bargain they've made.\"  So far, the general population is not quite outraged enough to reach a tipping point and to take real action, he suggests.  \"There's a tremendously frustrating aspect of Australian culture, which is resignation,\" he adds.  \"We're not a great nation when it comes to acting on things.\"  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/news/melbourne-startup-blackai-1-2-million-raise-robots-21st-century-stop-stealing-tomatoes/\">NOW READ:\u00a0Melbourne startup Black.ai secures $1.2 million raise to bring robots into 21st century, and to stop you stealing tomatoes</url></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/news/wholesome-robot-friends/\">NOW READ:\u00a0Four wholesome robot friends that wouldn't dream of taking your job - plus one that tried and failed</url></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCX-K4R1-JD6R-T0H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1393\"/><timeReceived>3:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 30, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Housing is 'affordable' but runs against the headwinds of median household income that is well below the national average. They rank last among larger metros in the Milken Institute's new Best Performing Cities report[1]. Anchorage was trailing, too, at No. 197.Most Read Business StoriesThe Seattle-Bellevue-Everett metropolitan division came in at No. 8, but you probably suspected something like that. Just as Washington was among the top performers[2] in Milken's recent State Technology and Science Index, we're used to being among the nation's economic elite. (This reality coexists with the discontents I enumerated above, but it is very difficult to find the Goldilocks location, with moderate growth and relatively low inequality; Minneapolis-St. Paul comes closest among major metros). I'm less a fan of the Best Performing Cities list than of the state tech and science rankings[3]. The latter is based on a wider set of metrics, while the former is heavily weighted to job and wage growth.The Best Performing list sweeps in disparate places. </p><p>For example, No. 1 Provo-Orem, Utah, had a population of 603,000 in 2016 compared with about 3 million for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett area and 3.8 million for the wider Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan statistical area (MSA). The rankings also uses a mixed bag of units: metropolitan divisions for some large metros and broader MSAs for other areas.,The result is comparing Red Delicious to Honeycrisp apples, if not apples to oranges. Elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest, the Tacoma-Lakewood metro division ranked No. 75, while the Boise MSA was No. 12 and Portland No. 33. Still, the Best Performing Cities report is influential for corporate site selectors, academics and others. Its publication gives us a chance to take stock at this knife's-edge moment, when the national economy is growing strong but facing serious stress[4]. Rigorous studies are more valuable now with the federal government not updating many data sets because of the shutdown.The report's Seattle snapshot contains some things that we know \u2014 high wages driven by tech giants and a strong research university \u2014 and some assertions that are open to debate, 'Shortage of residential and commercial real estate makes it difficult for new companies to move in and for existing companies to expand.'In fact, residential real-estate prices are cooling and the recent go-go years of apartment construction are producing enough supply to lower rents somewhat[5]. Metro Seattle's cost advantage over the Bay Area continues to attract high-end jobs and tech outposts, on top of homegrown research institutions. Amazon and Microsoft are still expanding here.But the deeper story is the continued diversity of the metropolitan economy. Tech is the sexy story. But the region remains a major manufacturing center with Boeing and the aerospace cluster, and also shipbuilding. With two major deep-water ports, short sailing times to Asia, and extensive railroad and warehouse sectors, we're a big player in trade and logistics. Corporate headquarters such as Starbucks, Paccar and Costco \u2014 plus Microsoft and Amazon \u2014 mean decisions get made here, and in some cases corporate stewardship is forthcoming. In this sense, metro Seattle is a smaller version of No. 5 Dallas-Plano-Irving. Big D has a lot of nearly everything, with a heavy emphasis on the wellspring of corporate, research and cultural assets.I'm not sure these reports can be translated into universal lessons. For example, astronomical costs and regulation have yet to sink the Bay Area economy (San Jose was No. 2 and San Francisco was No. 4).And the 'business friendly tax and regulatory climate' of Provo-Orem also includes the benefit of the civic cohesiveness of the region's Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints majority, which embraces education (Brigham Young University is in Provo) and hard work. Both cities are on the successful FrontRunner commuter rail system[6]. Don't forget: When it came time for Amazon to choose its HQ2, it selected two high-cost, high regulation locales. To me, 'business friendly' means more than tax rates or regulation. It requires an educated workforce, civic and cultural assets, investment in infrastructure and livability, and an environmental and social-justice ethos that attracts the most talented younger workers. Ideology is a very limited compass. The quickly repealed jobs tax in Seattle would have been as destructive coming from the left as are cuts to education and infrastructure in red states.Best practices can help cities improve their game. 'By targeting local sectors with a robust competitive advantage, communities can seek to reduce the impact future dips in the business cycle have on local employment and economic activity,' the Milken authors write.'Regions that better link education and training programs to the workforce needs of employers will attract businesses and create more opportunities ,' they continue. 'Developing new industries and companies will require fostering entrepreneurship and innovation through research institutions, incubators, and funding programs.' All true. But I'm skeptical that Big Tech is spreading its high-end assets beyond the usual suspects, or that one-trick-pony metros (dependent on tourism or retirees) can substantially change their games.Just as we went through a Come as You Are Recession \u2014 strong places came out strong, weak ones were hurt worst \u2014 the same dynamic applies to this expansion. No new Detroits are being created, as happened with the Motown manufacturing titan in the early 20th century. You can blame a lack of big-employment economic breakthroughs, Wall Street'stightfistedness and greed, a globalized economy, lack of public infrastructure investment and uneven American educational outcomes. And this is likely as good as it gets, for bothSeattle and Youngstown, as this aging expansion can't last forever.

I told the staffers that I was worried about whether antitrust, which can address certain anti-competitive conduct by the platforms, could be counted on to police the misappropriation of data from third-party content providers, or the 'self-preferencing' of their own brands or applications to their hundreds of millions of users. I recommended sector-specific regulation to address this conduct, as have other important voices, from Public Knowledge[2] to the Stigler Center[3].I also presented[4] my ideas at the Federal Trade Commission's platform competition hearings in October 2018. Both there and at the Antitrust Subcommittee, I was called back for private briefings with staffers.Nothing ever came of my ideas. I figured getting legislation passed would be a long shot, but I also thought my ideas were good and necessary, given the way the platforms exploit gaps[5] in our consumer-oriented and price-fixated antitrust laws.Flash forward to the summer of 2020. Through a LinkedIn email, I learned that a recent staffer on the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee was recruited by Amazon's public-policy arm this month. </p><p>I took to Twitter to express my dismay, and quickly learned that another staffer on the Senate Judiciary Committee was recruited by Facebook's competition policy arm in May 2020.These two staffers are now working for the tech platforms, and presumably against my ideas, after having heard my ideas in a private setting.It is important to note right here that I have no beef with these fine folks. Indeed, given the substantial time I invested twisting their arms in support of platform regulation, I have no reason to think they were acting in bad faith or that their actions (or lack thereof) were affected by these offers. My beef is with the process, and the way the platforms\u2014by offering jobs to government officials tasked with regulating the platforms\u2014are interfering with democracy.To understand how, let's start with a clear-cut hypothetical: Would we ever allow a defendant to make a job offer to a member of the jury? If the juror believed that she could curry favor with the defendant by voting to acquit, the job offer\u2014or even the prospect of an offer\u2014could create a conflict. For the same reason, we wouldn't allow a defendant to threaten a juror, for fear that the threat could taint the outcome of a trial. (The same logic applies to a plaintiff.)Let's try another thought experiment: Should a target of an ongoing antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or Department of Justice's Antitrust Division (ATR) be permitted to hire away key staffers on the investigation team? Or should the target be permitted to fund a position at an academic center that recruits the staffer? These also seem problematic, as the prospect of an offer by the target could induce the staffer to modify his investigation or recommendations in favor of not pursuing an antitrust complaint.

Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[6]One final experiment: Would we permit the target of a congressional inquiry on monopoly (and monopsony) abuses by dominant platforms to hire away key staffers on congressional committees tasked with investigating the platforms? This is also problematic, as the prospect of a job offer could induce a staffer to refrain from recommending to her representative or senator that the platform should be subjected to new regulations.The optimal policies here are complicated by the fact that policy staffers have developed specialized skills, about both the industry and antitrust generally as well as the lobbying process, that could be valuable to the platforms under investigation. Denying such mobility into the private sector with a complete ban on recruitment would deprive the staffer of reaping the fruits of his or her labor.But there's a strong public-interest motive to deny this free exercise of movement from government to the corporate sector if it conflicts with proper corporate regulation. And that appears to be what's happening.NOTWITHSTANDING ITS dull content, LinkedIn has a nifty tool that allows searches for people who currently work in one place and previously worked somewhere else. For example, type in 'Department of Justice Antitrust Division Amazon,' and you get back 65-odd results. (Results may vary slightly based on who conducts the search and where the search is performed.) Click the 'all filters' drop-down, and choose Amazon as the current company. The results are narrowed to eight employees. A similar search reveals 10 and 11 current employees at Google and Facebook, respectively. The table below reports the number of people currently employed at Amazon, Google, or Facebook based on these queries.In several instances, the same worker can be represented multiple times in the table\u2014for example, if she worked at two (or more) government agencies before moving to the platform. It is possible that LinkedIn is generating 'matches' that are close but not equal to the search terms. It bears noting that in many of these cases, the worker held a stint at a different employer before moving on to the platform. The table is meant to be illustrative and hopefully replicable.When the keyword 'antitrust,' or in the case of DOJ, the keywords 'antitrust division' are removed from the initial query, the results are unsurprisingly larger. To restrict the results for DOJ and FTC, I impose a second filter for prior employer.According to LinkedIn, 41 current Amazon employees previously worked at DOJ; 54 current Google employees previously worked at DOJ; and 48 current Facebook employees previously worked at DOJ. Without some benchmark or standard, it is hard to judge whether these numbers are intolerably high. But there is no doubt that the two recent episodes of poaching mentioned above are not outliers. Instead, they appear to be part of a larger pattern by the platforms of poaching government officials in the agencies and congressional committees that have jurisdiction over them.That this stealthy form of influence peddling happens all over government\u2014read Jessie Eisinger's The Chickenshit Club[7] to learn about the corruption in financial services\u2014doesn't mean it is not insidious here.

Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[8]The platforms are in the crosshairs of multiple investigations, including by DOJ, state attorneys general, and the House Judiciary Committee. Amazon, Facebook, and Google picking off staffers charged with overseeing them erodes public trust in these institutions, and potentially undermines the investigations, to the extent it influences the conduct of the staff.Other costs of permitting such poaching are less obvious. For example, knowing that she could be courted by a platform with deep pockets might encourage a staffer to develop certain skills or seek out positions that maximize the chances of being courted. She's taking the job in the hopes of getting scooped up to take another job, in other words. Poaching a government official is similar to a 'killer acquisition[9]': Staffers are acquired precisely to undermine potential oversight.The revolving door could also affect government procurement, to the detriment of smaller rivals and to the benefit of Big Tech. In November 2016, Amazon hired the former chief acquisition offer of the General Services Administration (GSA) in the Obama administration. During 2017, Amazon reportedly[10] privately advised the GSA on the launch of a new digital portal for government purchasing of commercial items and office supplies. Some rivals complained[11] that as written, the bid would favor Amazon. After maintaining that the project was on hold because of the pandemic, in June GSA abruptly announced[12] that Amazon, alongside Overstock and Fisher Scientific, won the bid. All three winners have their own private labels, which could disadvantage independent sellers.IN FAIRNESS, the House Subcommittee on Antitrust is holding a hearing[13] on July 27 to examine the dominance of tech platforms, and it plans to issue recommendations soon. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has outlined several policy ideas, including breaking up[14] Big Tech. But nothing today prevents Amazon or Google or Facebook from buying off entire antitrust agencies and congressional committees. I don't begrudge any individual staffer who jumps at the offer. The point is that if we allow such offers without any guardrails, some people will end up taking them. That it happens so frequently is an indicator that we must reform the poaching process\u2014but how?There's a strong public-interest motive to deny this free exercise of movement from government to the corporate sector if it conflicts with proper corporate regulation. Let's begin by paying government officials more, to narrow the income difference between keeping your government job and jumping ship. Additionally, we could offer government officials job security and suitable pensions, so making a career out of public service is not seen as an inferior alternative to the private sector. In The Chickenshit Club, Eisinger explains that SEC officials are reluctant to bring cases because of a challenging legal environment; the same can be said for antitrust. A more radical idea would be to offer bonuses to agency officials (or maybe just division heads) based on judgments or jury awards against a platform, as a means to incentivize them to bring riskier cases.Sen. Warren has a policy piece on point[15]\u2014of course she does\u2014titled 'End Washington Corruption,' which calls for longer 'cooling off' periods for former government officials. Current law mandates a period of one year before former senior government officials work on projects that they worked on in government. Warren's plan would restrict the ability of corporate lobbyists to enter government jobs for six years, and would ban companies from hiring former senior government officials for at least four years.What's not clear is whether the four-year ban pertains only to full-time hires\u2014that is, whether companies may hire former senior government officials indirectly (by the hour) via law firms or lobbying firms. If that's the case, then an agency head could still deliver huge benefits to former or would-be clients via nonenforcement (or other means) and then be rewarded via future payments as billable hours. And we're right back to the underenforcement problem.Every day that passes in which Congress fails to deliver protections for independent merchants and content creators is a victory for the platforms. Regardless of its potential gaps, Sen. Warren's anti-corruption plan is a good start. We might not get platform regulation until we address the revolving door in Washington. The views expressed here are those of the author, and do not represent the views of his employers. Singer does not currently work for or against Amazon, Google, or Facebook in any pending litigation or consulting matter.

This verdict put these services in an unfavorable situation. If they comply with the law, it could potentially cost them millions of dollars. They could also halt operations in California all together, but that would also be costly. The law requiring gig workers be reclassified as employees, AB5, surely sought to improve the livelihoods of rideshare drivers. However, good intentions don\u2019t make good policy. </p><p><br/>As these companies prepare to make difficult decisions, it will ultimately come at the expense of the very people this law sought to protect. Lyft decided that it would halt operations in the state, arguing they can\u2019t make everyone an employee overnight to meet the deadline. A judge granted companies such as Uber and Lyft an emergency extension on Thursday afternoon, August 20th, but that\u2019s only to give them time to outline a plan to comply with the law. <br/>Some are already accusing the company of corporate greed. They\u2019re suggesting that they would rather stop operations altogether than pay their workers fairly. This claim doesn\u2019t hold much water when closely examined. <br/>California has the biggest state economy in the United States, and it\u2019s the most populous. This would seem like a disastrous business move to make if it were truly about greed, especially during a pandemic. Unless, that is, the long term cost of AB5 is far greater and more damaging than ceasing operations in the state all together. If Lyft and Uber do eventually shut down operations, even temporarily, only time will tell if it\u2019s the right decision. But it is a decision that wouldn\u2019t have to be made without California\u2019s intrusive law. <br/>The gig economy isn\u2019t meant to be a full time position. Sure, one can drive for Uber or Lyft for the equivalent of a full time job, but that\u2019s on the individual to decide. Many drivers aren\u2019t relying on it for their primary source of income. It is a way to earn some extra cash on the side. That isn\u2019t a defect of the system, it\u2019s part of the appeal. <br/>The ability to work with few strings attached while pursuing other ventures on your own helps the little guy. The more roadblocks the state pushes on these positions, the further it alienates young people. Those down on their luck have less opportunity to pick themselves up. <br/>The worker is the primary victim of this type of government overreach.<br/>Of course, there are those who benefit from California\u2019s economic intervention. If Lyft and Uber decide to flee, it\u2019s the taxi industry that receives a huge helping hand from the state. The sharing economy has been one of the greatest disruptors of old industry titans in the 21st century. Taxi companies would have a stronghold on any city they reside in, being able to charge high fares for, at best, mediocre services. No true competition existed in this market until rideshare services began to appear. These companies have not only brought more competitive prices to consumers, but also convenience, as a multitude of options are only an app away. <br/>Uber and Lyft aren\u2019t the only ones to radically decentralize the market space they exist in. Airbnb has had a similar effect on the hotel industry. Food delivery services have never been more abundant. The gig economy has done more to take power out of the hands of the rich elite than any regulatory politician ever has. Yet, these old industries are exactly who benefit the most from California\u2019s regulations. <br/>As the House met a few weeks ago for a hearing on Big Tech, many on Capitol Hill took their time to accuse tech CEOs of being monopolists. While companies like Amazon and Facebook are very large and powerful, they don\u2019t control a single industry and abuse their power by raising prices on the consumer. The monopolist boogie men that House representatives are looking for resemble less the Jeff Bezos\u2019 of the world and more the faceless taxi industry. <br/>These players can only acquire so much power if the government uses force to drive out the competition, and that\u2019s exactly what is happening now in California. Many on the left tout these policy proposals as helping the working class. In reality, it just helps the industries they believe they are fighting against. In believing they know what\u2019s best for the workers who voluntarily agree to drive for these companies, California has destroyed millions of livelihoods during a pandemic. The workers and the consumers, not the company, are the ones most affected by this law.<br/>The post As They Push Out Uber and Lyft, California Empowers Big Taxi appeared first on Free the People.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-111280</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60ND-65B1-JBJN-M3V7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"780\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 22, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>california</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>covid-19</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>economic freedom</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>gig economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>lyft</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>monopoly</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rideshare</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>uber</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001925</classCode><className>BUSINESS OPERATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN59</classCode><className>GIG ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X84</classCode><className>US STATE GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>State &amp;

It would seem not. Andrew Harrison, who chairs the remuneration committee, brazened it out in the annual report, urging shareholders to look at a different number - the 265% increase in the company's share price over the past two years (and certainly not the \u00a3214m loss it delivered in 2019).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tim Steiner, the chief executive, got \u00a354m of the pot, receiving a tidy \u00a358.7m once his salary and other bonuses are taken into account. He's hit the jackpot twice because the surge in the share price has boosted the value of his personal stake to nearly \u00a3300m.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bonus, even measured by the yardstick of City excesses, is obscene. It's one of the biggest bonus payouts made by a listed UK company, only bettered by the likes of Jeff Fairburn, the disgraced former chief executive of the housebuilder <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">Persimmon</url>, who pocketed \u00a375m, and Sir       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">Martin Sorrell,</url> who       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">banked \u00a370m from WPP in 2015</url>.</p><p>Yet we are supposed to see Ocado differently these days. Think Tesla, not Tesco - well, Elon Musk's potential <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">$50bn pay deal</url> provides a flattering comparison, at least. Today Ocado has successfully reinvented itself as a tech stock selling armies of grocery-picking robots to supermarkets - and says it should have Silicon Valley-style pay deals to keep its indispensable executives \"motivated\".</p><p>But for many people Ocado is still the company that pulls up at their front door with bags full of Waitrose groceries. That will end this autumn when the company will attempt to switch horses to Marks &amp; Spencer - which is paying \u00a3750m for half its UK grocery business - without falling from the saddle. So you would think the company would be more concerned about its image.</p><p>Once beloved of the middle classes, Ocado is facing incoming fire from parents and teachers opposed to its plan to open a distribution hub - complete with diesel fuel pumps - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">yards from their north London primary school</url>. The company, which has been trialling electric vans in high-density areas, has said it will replace all the diesel vans if it can get a power upgrade at the site. Maybe the best part of the \u00a3100m that executives have pocketed would have been better spent on greening its fleet?</p><p>The annual report shows that Steiner's pay was more than 2,600 times that of the median employee, who all-in gets \u00a322,500. As part of the preamble, the company highlights that executive pay is \"more at risk than wider employee pay due to the use of variable pay\" and without the mega bonus the multiple would only have been about 200 times. The icing on the cake was the decision to raise the basic salaries of the four executives who shared the \u00a388m jackpot; this year Steiner will have to drag himself out of bed for a guaranteed \u00a3720,000 salary.</p><p>Which brings us back to Waitrose, part of the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership, where staff in good years are paid the same rate of bonus as top executives. Once Ocado shifts over to M&amp;S, shoppers will have to make a conscious decision to move away from their familiar service to Waitrose's own website. As a shopper, all you can do is vote with your feet.</p><p>                     BP promises action on climate, but we've heard it before                   </p><p>The US environmentalist and author Bill McKibben famously warned that in the race to tackle the climate crisis, winning slowly is the same as losing. Last week BP only barely found its feet in the starting blocks - again.</p><p>Almost 23 years ago, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">BP's chief executive at the time, John Browne</url>, became the first oil boss to publicly accept responsibility for the looming climate crisis. In a landmark address at Stanford University he promised \"substantial, real and measurable\" action from the UK oil giant. On the top of his list was a pledge to control BP's own emissions. But almost a quarter of a century later, the world is still waiting.</p><p>Browne was in the audience in London on 12 February at a London hotel conference room as his former protege and BP's new chief executive, Bernard Looney, set out a new target for the oil industry's climate ambitions. He one-upped Browne's vow to cut carbon emissions by setting an ambition to reduce and \"neutralise\" enough greenhouse gases to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">turn BP into a carbon-neutral company</url>.</p><p>The 21st-century version of BP's green turn may have relied more heavily on slick video production and branded graphics, but the pledges share a worrying parallel: neither set out how BP would achieve the grand goals set for the middle of this century.</p><p>And so, the world has been asked to wait a little longer. Investors must wait until September to learn how Looney plans to make his green vision a reality. The net-zero revolution itself is a 2050 target, meaning another quarter of a century will pass before the company intends to meet it.</p><p>Looney's address acknowledged that people would be impatient for detail, and many others would never be satisfied that BP is going far enough, fast enough. On this point, at least, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">he is wholly correct</url>. He is already on borrowed time.</p><p>                     All bets are off as the government cracks down on gambling again                   </p><p>For anyone looking to invest their life savings, the gambling industry is hardly a tantalising prospect. Public unease about the industry, following <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">criticism over its failings in dealing with problem gamblers</url>, has reached boiling point.</p><p>The Gambling Commission, the UK regulator, has begun flexing its muscles. It has already <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">banned bets on credit cards</url>, and promised to review a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">proposal by MPs</url> that would see online casino stakes cut to \u00a32, bringing web-based casino games       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">into line with fixed-odds betting terminals</url>. Betting shares duly tanked as investors digested the prospect of decreased revenues.</p><p>Bookmakers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">fought tooth and nail to save FOBTs</url>, only to emerge utterly defeated by a ragtag coalition of ex-addicts, MPs and rivals in the casino and amusement arcade business. With that defeat fresh in the mind, betting firms now fear the same treatment will be meted out to their lucrative online operations. The stakes have never been higher.</p><p>Where once the industry dismissed concerns about problem gambling and sought to discredit its opponents, the newly formed Betting and Gaming Council has preferred the tactic of deflection.</p><p>What about unauthorised overseas gambling sites, they ask. What about the role that banks and big tech companies can play in reducing harm? Most of all, the BGC points to the voluntary steps taken by the industry to address public problem gambling, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">reining in advertising</url>. Such olive branches, of course, were offered only after the industry found itself staring down the barrel of a gun.</p><p>Now the government is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ocado&#34; title=&#34;\">reviewing the Gambling Act</url> and has a once-in-a-generation chance to introduce precise, well-informed legislation.</p><p>Cutting stakes to \u00a32 would not be a cure-all. Limits may have a role in addressing gambling disorders but so do things like curbing the speed of play and robust affordability checks. Whatever the outcome, the odds are short on the sector emerging smaller and less profitable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-60329720</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y75-H621-F021-633F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1197\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CMHK</classCode><className>OCADO GROUP PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>CC0001WLY</classCode><className>MARKS &amp;

But European stock markets recovered, including Britain's. Investors came to see that the European Union was not going to break up, and Britain was not going to erect tall walls around its economy. Looking back, the panicky early reaction to Brexit seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system. Investors took a deep breath and gained some perspective.</p><p>  Movements in the United States stock market suggests the same thing is happening in response to President Trump's trade policies. China on Tuesday evening announced the tariffs it plans in retaliation against those President Trump is threatening. Reacting to China's announcement, the S.&amp;P. 500 index plunged early on Wednesday but recovered strongly to close up 1.2 percent.</p><p>  Investors may believe China's move will lead to drawn-out negotiations. Here, Brexit is again illustrative. As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on, investors have gained more clarity and confidence. If talks between the U.S. and China gain steam, the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear.</p><p>  But the standoff between the U.S. and China differs in important ways from the Brexit tensions. The U.S., for instance, is in a much stronger position than Britain. China exports far more to the U.S. than the U.S. does to China. Limiting access to the U.S. economy could hurt China's growth at a time when it is trying to overhaul important economic sectors. If investors believe that the U.S. can successfully exploit its advantages to make China more friendly to foreign businesses, they may even see the trade skirmish as positive for the global economy.</p><p>  But Brexit also flashes a warning to those expecting a big win for Mr. Trump. One of the reasons that the European Union has presented a united front is that it sees Brexit as a threat to its values and goals. Similarly, China may believe that Mr. Trump's trade attack puts some of its most deeply held aspirations under threat -- and will fight back hard.</p><p>  - Peter Eavis</p><p>  Another bank takes steps toward gun safety.</p><p>  After Citigroup announced plans to limit firearms sales by business customers, the question was which lenders would be the next to make a move on guns. The latest: Amalgamated Bank, the union-owned bank known for its socially minded policies.</p><p>  The firm said on Wednesday that it would adopt guidelines for lenders laid out by Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group backed by Mike Bloomberg.</p><p>  Among those recommendations:</p><p>   Require gun dealers to protect merchandise from burglary and theft and refuse sales to people who appear in distress or intoxicated</p><p>   Require retailers to stop selling high-capacity magazines and bump stocks</p><p>   Require gun makers to ''commit to developing innovations in firearms that will allow law enforcement to more easily solve gun crimes''</p><p>Amalgamated said that it would not only require all business customers to adhere to those guidelines but added that it won't invest any of its own money in gun manufacturers or distributors.</p><p>  Here's what Amalgamated's C.E.O. Keith Mestrich, said in a news release:</p><p>  ''Collectively, banks and lenders have the power to promote responsible business practices from gun manufacturers and distributors, and ultimately contribute to a safer society for all. Amalgamated will do whatever we can to achieve that goal and we hope other banks and financial institutions will agree and act.''</p><p>  -- Michael J. de la Merced</p><p>  Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 87 million Facebook users, not 50 million.</p><p>Facebook on Wednesday said the personal information of up to 87 million people, most of them Americans, may have been improperly shared during the 2016 election with Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm connected to President Trump.</p><p>  The new figure sharply increased the company's previous estimate of how many users' information was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. The number had been put at more than 50 million users.</p><p>  The sharing of the user data has unleashed a torrent of criticism at Facebook, the world's largest social network. The company's stock is down sharply since The New York Times and The Observer of London reported on how Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired users' data.</p><p>  The company released the revised estimate of affected users in an extended statement on Wednesday about its plans for handling personal data. The company said it will start alerting users on April 9 about whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>  In related Facebook news</p><p>   Earlier on Wednesday, lawmakers in Washington had said Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, would testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11 about the company's handling of sensitive user data.</p><p>  Next steps in the tariffs tit-for-tat.</p><p>  Beijing moved quickly to escalate its fight with the U.S., responding to the White House's latest move with $50 billion worth of tariffs on soybeans, cars, chemicals and more. U.S. market futures predictably dropped, as did other markets.</p><p>  Both sides could suffer. Chinese companies are scrambling to react, especially as the U.S. looks to be taking aim at technology (like that central to Made in China 2025). And the squeeze could extend to American companies in unexpected industries, like wine.</p><p>  The big question: Is a full-blown trade war coming? Nathaniel Taplin of Heard on the Street writes, ''If ongoing negotiations fail and these tariffs become a reality, the long-term impact will likely be far more damaging.''</p><p>Boeing is down 4 percent.</p><p>  And is dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average. The blue-chip index is off nearly 350 points, or 1.4 percent. That slide is worse than the declines of the S.&amp;P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, which are both down less than 1 percent.</p><p>Boeing's 4 percent fall has shaved 87 points off the Dow Wednesday. Boeing is the highest priced stock in the price-weighted index, which means Boeing has an outsized impact on the index's moves.</p><p>Boeing's shares have served as a proxy for investor concern about a possible trade war with China since the Trump administration announced tariffs on aluminum and steel.</p><p>  Over that period, the stock has fallen 12 percent.</p><p>Spotify continues to slide.</p><p>  The streaming-music company's shares opened at $165.90, but they steadily decline throughout their first day of trading, closing at $149.01.</p><p>  The stock is down 4.1 percent to $142.91 in early trading Wednesday.</p><p>  Because Spotify eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing, there is no I.P.O. price off which to base the performance of its shares. But the company's current shares price remains well above the $132.50 its private shares changed hands at earlier this year.</p><p>Spotify's public. Now what?</p><p>Spotify finished Tuesday valued at $26.5 billion. Does that count as a success? Shira Ovide of Gadfly argues no, since only a tiny fraction of Spotify's shares are available to trade.</p><p>  And will it lead to a wave of direct listings, leaving depressed, workless I.P.O. bankers in its wake? Maybe not, though the Big Board acknowledged signs of more informal interest in direct listings.</p><p>  One big winner from Spotify's trading debut?</p><p>Sony.</p><p>  Its subsidiary, Sony Music Entertainment, owned 5.7 percent of Spotify ahead of its listing. Sony said it sold 17.2 percent of that stake Tuesday. Sony expects to book a non-operating profit of $986 million this quarter from the increased valuation of the Spotify shares it continues holds and from the share sale.</p><p>  At Tuesday's close, Sony's 5.7 percent stake was worth $1.5 billion.</p><p>Sony isn't only Asian tech company benefitting from Spotify's smooth debut. Tencent, the Chinese social media company, holds a 7.5 percent stake. That was worth about $2 billion as of Tuesday's close.</p><p>  What we don't know about the YouTube shooter</p><p>  The video site and its parent company, Alphabet, are still grappling with the shooting at YouTube's headquarters in the Bay Area yesterday. What we know: Police identified the shooter as Nasim Najafi Aghdam, who was in her late 30s and killed herself at the scene. Three people were hurt, one critically.</p><p>  What we don't know: the motive. Ms. Aghdam, who posted to YouTube and other social media, criticized the video site's policies on Facebook in February. But authorities haven't highlighted any specific grievance, and said they had yet to find evidence that specific individuals were targeted.</p><p>  What may change: security in Silicon Valley. YouTube, like many other big tech companies, doesn't have visible metal detectors or armed guards.</p><p>  The political flyaround</p><p>   Robert Mueller reportedly told President Trump's lawyers that he's a subject of interest, but not yet an investigation target. A former Skadden lawyer who admitted deceiving Mr. Mueller's investigators, Alex van der Zwaan, was sentenced to 30 days in prison and fined $20,000.</p><p>   The Treasury Department and the Office of Management and Budget are fighting over how to implement the tax overhaul, as businesses go to great lengths to lower their tax bills.</p><p>   Senator Elizabeth Warren's suggested method for measuring misconduct at financial institutions probably wouldn't lead to more prosecutions. (White Collar Watch)</p><p>   John Williams is the next president of the New York Fed, despite calls for diversity. (NYT)</p><p>   Articles about Scott Pruitt are now focusing on ethical improprieties, not regulatory rollbacks. (NYT)</p><p>  WPP's C.E.O., a giant in the ad world, is under investigation</p><p>  At issue in WPP's inquiry into its C.E.O., Martin Sorrell, are allegations of misuse of company assets and of personal misconduct, according to the WSJ. Mr. Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>  The investigation comes at a tough time: WPP's revenue is down, and competition from Google and Facebook is up. One of the FT's unnamed sources couldn't see how Mr. Sorrell would survive.</p><p>  In other misconduct news: Morgan Stanley fired Douglas Greenberg, a star financial adviser accused of physical abuse and stalking by multiple women, following an NYT investigation.</p><p>  Can venture capital become less male?</p><p>  Forbes profiled All Raise, a group of 36 women trying to double the percentage of women in V.C. partner roles and to increase funding to female founders to 25 percent from 15 percent. It has commitments of $2 million from supporters like Silicon Valley Bank and is in talks with Melinda Gates's investment firm.</p><p>  Diversity, they argue, will help investors spot future successes like Stitch Fix.</p><p>  What to expect from the CBS-Viacom talks</p><p>  It'll be a joust, over money and management. CBS has reportedly submitted a takeover bid for its corporate sibling, Viacom -- but one below Viacom's market value of $12.5 billion, and without a No. 2 slot at the combined company for the target's C.E.O., Bob Bakish.</p><p>  That isn't going to sit well with either Mr. Bakish or his patron, Shari Redstone. Tara Lachapelle of Gadfly argues that ego shouldn't hold up a deal.</p><p>  The deals flyaround</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble is reportedly talking to Pfizer about buying its consumer health business, but far from agreeing on a price. GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt Benckiser both walked away. (CNBC)</p><p>   The Justice Department is relying on a skewed study of the Time Warner deal, lawyers for AT&amp;T argued in court. (Bloomberg)</p><p>Elliott Management has purchased a $1 billion stake in various affiliates of Hyundai Motors, another venture into Korean chaebols. (Elliott)</p><p>   The high-end coffee brand La Colombe, reportedly hired Moelis &amp; Company to explore the sale of a stake that could value the company at $1 billion. (Bloomberg)</p><p>   The Chinese digital conglomerate Meituan has bought Mobike, a bike-sharing company, for $2.7 billion. (CNBC)</p><p>SoftBank finds limits to its friendship with Trump</p><p>  The Japanese conglomerate has reportedly given up day-to-day control over the Fortress Investment Group to help its deal pass the powerful U.S. security watchdog known as Cfius, according to the FT. That could make the investment firm a less useful support for SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund.</p><p>  The takeaways: The efforts by SoftBank's Masa Son to court President Trump don't always translate into favorable treatment by the White House, and national security concerns will weigh heavily on foreign investment in the U.S. post-Broadcom.</p><p>  Will Trump act against Amazon?</p><p>  The president has pressed his claim that Amazon is ''costing the United States Postal Service massive amounts of money,'' (It isn't.)</p><p>  Vanity Fair reports that some specific anti-Amazon ideas have been kicked around, including rethinking Amazon's contract with the U.S.P.S., canceling its cloud services contract with the Pentagon (more below) and encouraging state investigations.</p><p>  But Bloomberg can find no active discussions about such actions, and Wall Street analysts say investors should ignore the noise, which puts Amazon in good company.</p><p>  More on Amazon and the cloud: Mr. Trump was scheduled to dine last night with Safra Catz of Oracle. Why is that important?</p><p>  The tech flyaround</p><p>Tesla's first-quarter production still fell short of an already lowered target, but shares in the embattled carmaker rose anyway. Investors might want to be wary of Elon Musk's promises.</p><p>Facebook removed over 270 accounts and pages tied to Russia's Internet Research Agency, widely regarded as a troll factory. Mark Zuckerberg won't globalize Europe's stricter privacy regulations. Tim Wu of Columbia Law School argues that Facebook needs replacing, not fixing.</p><p>India's government is eager to collect personal data, but bad at protecting it, an NYT Op-Ed contributor argues. (NYT)</p><p>  Revolving door</p><p>Apple has hired John Giannandrea from Google to run its machine learning and A.I. strategy. (NYT)</p><p>Deutsche Bank formally named John Thain, Mayree Clark and Michele Trogni to its supervisory board. (Deutsche Bank)</p><p>Goldman Sachs has reportedly hired Hari Moorthy, an engineer at JPMorgan Chase, to build tools to help big companies manage cash. (WSJ)</p><p>  The speed read</p><p>   Companies' charitable spending is more self-serving than they would have us believe. (NYT)</p><p>   An Indian government crackdown on fake news lasted less than a day. (NYT)</p><p>   The Chinese conglomerate Anbang will receive $9.7 billion from an industry rescue fund. (WSJ)</p><p>Longfin, a fintech company that went public under small-company rules in December, lost 85 percent of value in six trading days and is now under investigation by the S.E.C. (WSJ)</p><p>   After one of its worst quarters ever, David Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight Capital is sticking to its strategy.

But European stock markets recovered, including Britain\u2019s. Investors came to see that the European Union was not going to break up, and Britain was not going to erect tall walls around its economy. Looking back, the panicky early reaction to Brexit seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system. Investors took a deep breath and gained some perspective.</p><p>Movements in the United States stock market suggests the same thing is happening in response to President Trump\u2019s trade policies. China on Tuesday evening announced the tariffs it plans in retaliation against those President Trump is threatening. Reacting to China\u2019s announcement, the S.&amp;P. 500 index plunged early on Wednesday but recovered strongly to close up 1.2 percent.</p><p>Investors may believe China\u2019s move will lead to drawn-out negotiations. Here, Brexit is again illustrative. As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on, investors have gained more clarity and confidence. If talks between the U.S. and China gain steam, the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear.</p><p>But the standoff between the U.S. and China differs in important ways from the Brexit tensions. The U.S., for instance, is in a much stronger position than Britain. China exports far more to the U.S. than the U.S. does to China. Limiting access to the U.S. economy could hurt China\u2019s growth at a time when it is trying to overhaul important economic sectors. If investors believe that the U.S. can successfully exploit its advantages to make China more friendly to foreign businesses, they may even see the trade skirmish as positive for the global economy.</p><p>But Brexit also flashes a warning to those expecting a big win for Mr. Trump. One of the reasons that the European Union has presented a united front is that it sees Brexit as a threat to its values and goals. Similarly, China may believe that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade attack puts some of its most deeply held aspirations under threat \u2013 and will fight back hard.</p><p>- Peter Eavis</p><p>Another bank takes steps toward gun safety.</p><p>After Citigroup announced plans to limit firearms sales by business customers, the question was which lenders would be the next to make a move on guns. The latest: Amalgamated Bank, the union-owned bank known for its socially minded policies.</p><p>The firm said on Wednesday that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amalgamatedbank.com/news/amalgamated-bank-adopts-additional-policies-promote-gun-safety\">it would adopt guidelines for lenders</url> laid out by Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group backed by Mike Bloomberg.</p><p>Among <url normalizedValue=\"https://everytown.org/press/everytown-for-gun-safety-releases-guidelines-on-how-financial-institutions-can-help-reduce-violence-by-requiring-gun-industry-business-customers-to-follow-responsible-business-practices/\">those recommendations</url>:</p><p> Require gun dealers to protect merchandise from burglary and theft and refuse sales to people who appear in distress or intoxicated</p><p> Require retailers to stop selling high-capacity magazines and bump stocks</p><p> Require gun makers to \u201ccommit to developing innovations in firearms that will allow law enforcement to more easily solve gun crimes\u201d</p><p>Amalgamated said that it would not only require all business customers to adhere to those guidelines but added that it won\u2019t invest any of its own money in gun manufacturers or distributors.</p><p>Here\u2019s what Amalgamated\u2019s C.E.O. Keith Mestrich, said in a news release:</p><p>\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced</p><p>Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 87 million Facebook users, not 50 million.</p><p>Facebook on Wednesday <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/mark-zuckerberg-testify-congress.html\">said the personal information of up to 87 million people</url>, most of them Americans, may have been improperly shared during the 2016 election with Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm connected to President Trump.</p><p>The new figure sharply increased the company\u2019s previous estimate of how many users\u2019 information was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. The number had been put at more than 50 million users.</p><p>The sharing of the user data has unleashed a torrent of criticism at Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network. The company\u2019s stock is down sharply since The New York Times and The Observer of London reported on how Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired users\u2019 data.</p><p>The company released the revised estimate of affected users in an extended statement on Wednesday about its plans for handling personal data. The company said it will start alerting users on April 9 about whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>In related Facebook news</p><p> Earlier on Wednesday, lawmakers in Washington had said Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, would testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11 about the company\u2019s handling of sensitive user data.</p><p>Next steps in the tariffs tit-for-tat.</p><p>Beijing moved quickly to escalate its fight with the U.S., responding to the White House\u2019s latest move with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/business/china-us-tariffs.html?dlbk\">$50 billion worth of tariffs</url> on soybeans, cars, chemicals and more.

That slide is worse than the declines of the S.&amp;P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, which are both down less than 1 percent.</p><p>Boeing\u2019s 4 percent fall has shaved 87 points off the Dow Wednesday. Boeing is the highest priced stock in the price-weighted index, which means Boeing has an outsized impact on the index\u2019s moves.</p><p>Boeing\u2019s shares have served as a proxy for investor concern about a possible trade war with China since the Trump administration announced tariffs on aluminum and steel.</p><p>Over that period, the stock has fallen 12 percent.</p><p>Spotify continues to slide.</p><p>The streaming-music company\u2019s shares opened at $165.90, but they steadily decline throughout their first day of trading, closing at $149.01.</p><p>The stock is down 4.1 percent to $142.91 in early trading Wednesday.</p><p>Because Spotify eschewed a typical initial public offering in favor of a direct listing, there is no I.P.O. price off which to base the performance of its shares. But the company\u2019s current shares price remains well above the $132.50 its private shares changed hands at earlier this year.</p><p>Spotify\u2019s public.

Sony said it sold 17.2 percent of that stake Tuesday. Sony expects to book a non-operating profit of $986 million this quarter from the increased valuation of the Spotify shares it continues holds and from the share sale.</p><p>At Tuesday\u2019s close, Sony\u2019s 5.7 percent stake was worth $1.5 billion.</p><p>Sony isn\u2019t only Asian tech company benefitting from Spotify\u2019s smooth debut. Tencent, the Chinese social media company, <url normalizedValue=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/04/technology/spotify-ipo-tencent-sony-stake/index.html\">holds a 7.5 percent stake</url>.

We have had big swings on the Dow every single day this week. Today is no exception. The Dow is up 300 points or so, boosted by tech shares especially. But we are still on track for four straight weeks of losses. Those are the markets.

I will speak to the co-chair of its new oversight board.</p><p>Coming to you live from New York, it is Friday, September 25th. I'm Zain Asher and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Tonight, as Donald Trump tries to undermine confidence in the U.S. election, investors prepare for a Joe Biden presidency. There are now just 39 days until Election Day and President Trump is once again casting doubt on whether or not he is going to be accepting the results. He says the only way he will lose is if the contest is rigged.</p><p>Meantime, a new survey shows Wall Street expects Joe Biden will take the White House. Those same investors say that if Democrats also manage to take full control of Congress, higher taxes and more regulation could wreck their bottom line. And yet, the finance industry is funneling five times more cash to Biden's campaign than to Trump's.</p><p>Certainly, a pivotal week is ahead for American politics. On Saturday, we expect Donald Trump will unveil his nomination to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. Next Tuesday is the first debate between the President and Joe Biden. And after Wednesday, bailout measures preventing layoffs will expire for several sectors including aviation.</p><p>Lots to talk about here. Peter Spiegel is in New York for us. He is the U.S. Managing Editor at \"The Financial Times.\" Peter, thank you so much for being with us. So much hangs in the balance right now for the U.S. economy. Obviously, you've got coronavirus cases, 200,000 deaths here in the U.S. You also have got uncertainty around the election, and a whole host of other issues, including stimulus.</p><p>If, come November 3rd, there is no stimulus deal, there is uncertainty as to who the winner is when it comes to the U.S. President and the coronavirus is still raging on, as it appears it will be, what happens to the U.S. economy then?</p><p>PETER SPIEGEL, U.S. MANAGING EDITOR, \"THE FINANCIAL TIMES\": Well, let's unpack some of this stuff because there are three things as you said that could impact the markets and are impacting the markets. So, in terms of election turmoil, I think that's the one thing the markets are not prepared for.</p><p>As you said, most investors are anticipating a rather smooth transition to power to Biden. And again, as you said in your intro there, there is concern about higher taxes and more regulation.</p><p>But to be honest with you, what the markets always want is certainty. And what we have seen frankly in the Trump administration, particularly when we talk to some of sources in the M&amp;A world is mergers and the regulatory environment have been so chaotic that they actually don't know even though Trump tends to be more pro-business what the Trump White House will decide on any business regulations.</p><p>So, frankly a lot of investors are looking forward to a Biden presidency even if it may be a little bit more anti-business because at least there is some certainty and coherence in there. So, if there is turmoil in the election itself, I think that could spook the markets.</p><p>The other issues you pointed at, I think, you know, in terms of in the sense that fiscal stimulus is running out, as you said, some of the measures are beginning to fall off a cliff, this is what has kept the markets on an upswing. We have seen the tech stocks go up because of it, because they feel that the economy is basically kept frozen, for a lack of a better word, throughout the pandemic.</p><p>If Congress cannot agree on a new fiscal stimulus, we are going to be hearing from a lot of people in banks and other financial institution. They are very worried that there would be a crack in the system either through commercial real estate because people stop paying rents or through the airlines as you said, suddenly they are going to start having to file for bankruptcy.</p><p>So there is a lot of concern, restaurants, the leisure industry, the hotel industry. There is concern if there is no fiscal stimulus somewhere in the next six to eight weeks, we could see things begin to collapse.</p><p>So I would say those are the two things that are most nerve wracking. Yes, people are still worried about the pandemic, but there is a lot of optimism that someone, be it Moderna or be it AstraZeneca, there is going to be some form of a vaccine in the next six months to 12 months.</p><p>So, you hear less concern about that than the other two issues you're talking about, you know, fiscal stimulus and election chaos.</p><p>ASHER: OK, you've given me a lot to digest there. I just want to touch on the first thing you talked about which is, investors basically anticipating a Joe Biden presidency. The fact that you have Donald Trump intimating that you know, there might not be a peaceful transition, that he might not accept the results if he doesn't win -- are markets at least beginning to price in that factor, that we may not get a smooth transition of power in this country?</p><p>[15:05:02]</p><p>SPIEGEL: Not yet. Not yet. I think it is too early. I mean, political risk is always something that's out there regardless. Usually it is not the U.S. Usually these are developing countries, when investors look at developing in Sub Saharan Africa or Latin America or some of the developing economies in Asia.</p><p>Political risk is something that weighs in on their investment decision. It usually does not have to happen in the U.S. So, I don't think you're seeing that. As you said, this has been a pretty bad month for tech stocks. Today, I think, the Dow is up, but tech stocks in general have been taking a beating.</p><p>I think that is more to do with this issue of the real economy and whether there is going to -- we are starting to see cracks in the real economy and whether frankly Wall Street has gotten ahead of Main Street.</p><p>I don't think you are seeing decisions being made just yet on political instability. I still think there is a confidence in the system and in the institutions of government that even if there is an interregnum like there was with Bush/Gore and the Florida recount, even if there is legal challenge that last into December, that there will be uncertainties. But think, at this point at least, despite the President's rhetoric, we haven't seen those kinds of things priced into the market just yet.</p><p>ASHER: OK, and in terms of stimulus, assuming that there is no stimulus bill passed before November 3rd what happens to consumer confidence? What happens to consumer spending especially just given that you have so many people, millions of Americans who have come to depend on the extra $600.00 a week in terms of unemployment insurance.</p><p>SPIEGEL: So we have our own poll we have done this week. It is called the FT/Peterson poll where we actually asked this very question and we saw that 90 percent of Americans said they need some kind of fiscal stimulus for exactly the reasons you said.</p><p>What we are seeing is that after the summer when we saw all these spikes in coronavirus cases in Arizona, in Texas, in Florida, the concerns about health and the virus itself are beginning to abate. We are seeing people more optimistic about their local communities getting better and where the concerns are rising is in this area of their own personal finances and the economy in general.</p><p>About a third of the people we polled said they think the economy is going to get better in the next year, and that's the worst number we have seen since we started polling on coronavirus about six months ago.</p><p>So there is a shifting of concern, and I guess, in terms of dynamic of the election, to some extent that's good news for Trump. Right? If people are less worried about the pandemic in general, they are less likely to go to the polls and blame him for doing it badly.</p><p>On the other hand, if they are worried about the economy -- and this is the thing that Trump thought he would run on, right -- if they are more concerned about the economy and his handling of the economy, that's good for Biden.</p><p>And so I think it is a bit of a mixed bag for the President and a mixed being for Biden right now if the economy continues to really look bad, if the fiscal stimulus doesn't happen, if people start getting really nervous, they are going to take it out on the President and I think that ultimately will help Joe Biden.</p><p>ASHER: Yes, and one of the other points in your survey was that basically of Americans think that Trump has done a great job on the economy, the other half don't. So split down the middle and just really clear that this is a divided country. Peter Spiegel, live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>All right, we are closing out a volatile week on Wall Street. After starting the session in the red, the Dow is now marching higher. It is up about one percent. The index is likely to close down more than two percent for the week. However, the fourth down week in a row.</p><p>Cristina Alesci follows politics and business. She is joining us live now from New York. So, Cristina, we have seen a choppy week in terms of U.S. markets here. I am assuming it is only going get more volatile as we head towards the election.</p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, CNN BUSINESS POLITICS AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Zain. The S&amp;P 500 right now is on track for its fourth weekly decline, and this is essentially reality and uncertainty setting in at the same time. Reality because we have seen such a euphoria around these indices and these Big Tech stocks.</p><p>And essentially, what has happened is, reality is sinking in to investors because they see Washington not focused on stimulus negotiation, getting cash in the hands of Americans that is to support consumer spending. That is the backbone of the U.S. economy. It is what is driving the recovery right now.</p><p>And uncertainty because there is much talk from the President himself about this question over the peaceful transfer of power. And the chaos -- look, all investors, all of my sources I have been speaking to have told me that they are concerned that there won't be a clear winner on Election Night. They were kind of wrapping their heads around that possibility.</p><p>But now, if we have a contested election or the results are drawn out for weeks and there are litigation and legal fights in the weeks to come, then that's a completely different thing. And I think your guest alluded to this in the answer before. You know, they haven't even begun to really price that in yet.</p><p>So that's what's coming forward, and then you know, you have to look at what the Fed has been doing to really support the economy not just in terms of keeping interest rates low, but also in buying government bonds and really supporting the credit markets and keeping the wheels of finance well-greased.</p><p>On that front, investors really wanted to see the Fed amp up its asset purchases and that's the one thing that Chairman Powell really didn't answer in his press conferences and in the Hill testimony over these last couple of weeks when he has made those public appearances.</p><p>And that's because the Fed is worried about this K-shaped recovery that everybody is talking about where you have, you know, the upper middle class and the wealthiest Americans doing much better in this economic recovery than the lower middle income classes. And that has been a concern for the Fed and that's why they have held off on the amount of asset purchases that investors would really like to see them do -- Zain.</p><p>[15:10:42]</p><p>ASHER: Yes, income inequality has been a massive problem during this pandemic. Cristina Alesci live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>Even with the coronavirus vaccine, a full economic recovery could be a long way off. That's according to economist, Joseph Stiglitz. He is a Nobel Prize winning author of \"People, Power, and Profits.\" I spoke with him earlier about what it will take to restore business activity and consumer confidence.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSEPH STIGLITZ, FORMER CHAIRMAN, U.S. COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: Even when we have a vaccine, we don't know how effective it's going to be. We don't know how long it's going to last. You know, we get a flu shot every year and that flu shot is only about 70 to 80 percent effective. So there are a lot of unknowns.</p><p>You know, the President oversimplifies when he says there is going to be a vaccine as if every vaccine is a hundred percent effective and lasts a lifetime. Clearly, he doesn't know much about vaccines. So that's the first thing. Unless we have an answer to those questions, we don't know whether the pandemic is totally under control.</p><p>The second thing is that there has been an enormous amount of misinformation and of course, Trump is one of the strongest propagators of this kind of misinformation.</p><p>Misinformation has led to a large fraction of Americans feeling reluctant to take the vaccine. They don't trust the President, and the President is a mendacious person, and the number of lies make it clear -- why should we trust him? For better or for worse, that's the reality we have to deal with.</p><p>The third point is that there is a lot of damage to the economy that has already been done. And the failure of the Republicans to give the necessary life support to the system, to provide unemployment insurance, to help the state and local governments, to help our educational institutions means that in the best of circumstances, it is going to be a weak recovery.</p><p>But that means that people are going to be very nervous how long it will take for the economy to fully recover. And because they will be nervous, they will be acting, as you suggested, in a precautionary way. And that's a vicious circle because they are acting in a more precautionary way, they won't be consuming as much, they won't be investing as much and the economic weaknesses as a result will persist longer than otherwise would have been the case.</p><p>ASHER: The U.K. is bordering on a second wave. There has been a significant number of cases that have increased in recent days. Every country has to ask themselves how on Earth do they balance the financial pain of a lockdown with the prolonged economic pain of a dramatic spike in cases? How do you sort of deal with that as a national economy?</p><p>STIGLITZ: Well, looking across the economies all over the world, there is a very, very clear pattern, maybe one or two exceptions. The countries that have brought the disease under control, have managed to resuscitate the economy. The countries that have not brought the pandemic under control have not been able to resuscitate the economy, and the economies just get weaker and weaker.</p><p>So New Zealand, South Korea, even China have done a very good job of controlling the disease and their economies are doing reasonably well.</p><p>The United States and the U.K. have not done a good job in controlling the disease. So I would like to make it very clear. It's not the lockdown that is causing the slowdown in the economy. It's fear.</p><p>You know, in the Great Depression, FDR said, \"We have nothing to fear but fear itself,\" but the reality is in the middle of a pandemic, we fear for our life and we have fear about the future of the economy because we know that if people are afraid, the economy can't be strong.</p><p>So that's, to me, the first priority should be our lives and is protection of -- control of disease that will be the mechanism by which we get our economy going.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: All right. Still to come here, the head of Africa's C.D.C. tells CNN the continent has made huge strides when it comes to COVID.</p><p>And a new effort to stop panic buying in Britain as coronavirus cases surge. We are live in London with you next.</p><p>ASHER: The World Health Organization is warning of a worrying increase in coronavirus cases in Europe, saying a lot must be done get the surge under control.</p><p>Countries across the European Union are seeing the number of new cases rise. Today, France eased off its daily record high just a bit, but it also recorded a total of more than 500,000 cases for the first time.</p><p>In the U.K., two major supermarket chains are now limiting the sale of some essential items in an effort to prevent a new round of panic buying.</p><p>Cyril Vanier is in London for us. So Cyril, when you look at the number of cases in Europe, several countries are reporting new record daily highs, in the U.K. it is about 7,000 cases a day or just under. In France, it is twice that amount. What is at stake, particularly for the U.K. economy, that has already been through so much as this new round of restrictions take place?</p><p>CYRIL VANIER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, look, the U.K. and certainly, the British government and the British people were hoping that the economy would pick up. Stores are open now, but they are not seeing as many customers and as much in terms of volumes of purchases as they were pre- pandemic. And they were hoping these would keep picking up as they had been over the summer.</p><p>Now, what they are seeing with restrictions being tightened is, well, the fear of a very hard winter to come. That's what the Chancellor here called it, Rishi Sunak. He in fact announced a new set of financial measures just as the old furlough scheme was set to expire.</p><p>He is announcing new measures whereby people who will see their hours reduced will see their loss in pay partly compensated by the government and by their employers, which tells you that, you know, the British government did not want to be here. They hoped they would be over the hump by now, but they are not and they are anticipating a very tough six months ahead.</p><p>They really want to avoid having a second national lockdown, but they have not ruled it out. And they know that they are going to have to help their economy. They had to deliver some bad news to pubs, restaurants, and the hospitality sector in general earlier this week by imposing a 10:00 p.m. curfew.</p><p>They know that there are going to be job losses, Zain, they are just trying to mitigate the pain at this stage.</p><p>[15:20:26]</p><p>ASHER: And so just in terms of, as they try to medicate the pain, just in terms of when the U.K. economy will end up turning a corner, when the restrictions can be lifted, is there a target they are waiting for? Is there a number of daily cases they are looking for in order to actually ease off some of the restrictions?</p><p>VANIER: I am afraid not. Or certainly, if that target exists, then we, the general public are not privy to it and neither are the media. But really, my hunch, Zain, is that they don't have a specific target.</p><p>Look, there hasn't been -- the British government hasn't been a model of organization over the last two weeks. It was only a couple of week ago that they were telling people to go back to work, that they were telling stores to reopen fully. They were telling people to buy.</p><p>And now they are telling people, well, the exact opposite. They are telling people who can to stay away from their offices. They are shutting down pubs and restaurants. So they are -- improvising is not the word, but they are treading water and they are imposing new measures as they see fit to try and manage this rise in cases.</p><p>But you know, Zain, what is interesting to me is that I just spent six months in France covering COVID over there. France is a month ahead of the U.K. It was a month ahead of the U.K. when cases were falling and it is a month ahead of the U.K. now that cases are rising.</p><p>I just looked at French numbers a month ago, they were almost exactly what the U.K. numbers are. So I think, we can learn from the French lesson which is if stricter measures are not imposed fast in the U.K., then you are going the see these numbers keep rising. The 6,000 case that we saw today could very well be the 16,000 plus cases that we saw in France yesterday in a month from now.</p><p>ASHER: That is a scary possibility. Cyril Vanier live for us there in London. Thank you so much.</p><p>In Africa, it is a different story from most of the other parts of the world. The Director of the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the case count and death toll are much less than anticipated.</p><p>The World Health Organization is hailing the African response and says new coronavirus cases in Africa are actually on a downward trend right now in fact when compared with the European Union. The continent has seen only about half the total number of cases.</p><p>David McKenzie, our correspondent based in South Africa sat down with the head of the African Centers for disease control. He says up to 80 percent of cases in Africa are asymptomatic. He also says, progress is being made across Africa while warning against complacency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. JOHN NKENGASONG, DIRECTOR, AFRICA CENTRES FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: I think there is a lesson to be learned from the continent that those predictions were not based on any solid assumption, they were based on historical standing of the continent, which is flawed as we have seen in this current pandemic.</p><p>We have seen more in that -- it indicated that by this time, about 40 million people would be infected in Africa with 200,000 deaths. We haven't seen that. But the reasons are just obvious.</p><p>One was the early leadership that the continent took to coordinate the efforts and really at the level of each individuals to take drastic measures. If you recall, many countries in Africa are still on a lockdown. We are beginning to see the curves are bending nicely. We have seen a sustained to 10 to 12 percent decrease over all in the continent over the last couple of weeks. I think that is good.</p><p>We are not yet at a point to celebrate. We are not complacent at all. But we need to acknowledge that progress -- a remarkable progress that has been achieved.</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There is still a lack of testing on the continent and the perception of a lack of data to really understand how this disease is affecting various countries.</p><p>Is there just a hidden pandemic that is not seen? Are there people dying that we don't know about across the African continent on a large scale?</p><p>NKENGASONG: Absolutely not. What is critical, actually, David, is that the level of asymptomatic, the proportion of individuals that have been infected and they have not fallen sick in the content is very high, it is about 80 percent. And I think that is very, very important.</p><p>So that means we are not seeing people dying off in mass numbers as it was predicted. I think that is the very good news, and this is informed based on data.</p><p>MCKENZIE: Why do you think some people find that hard to believe, even if the data backs it up?</p><p>NKENGASONG: I can understand that because of the massiveness of what we are seeing in the west, in Europe and the United States. We should also remember that our population structure is very different from what you see in the U.S. and also Europe.</p><p>More than 70 percent of our population is less than 30 years. Median age is actually around 17 to 18 years and I think that is really an important factor to put into the equation in our understanding of the levels of deaths in the United States or Europe versus Africa. I think that is -- my assumption is that many more people will be infected in Africa, but the deaths will continue to be relatively low.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[15:25:47]</p><p>ASHER: All right, still to come, Facebook's Supreme Court for Content Moderation is set to hear its first case next month.

CNN's Donie O'Sullivan reports from Minnesota on the impact of misinformation on some Trump supporters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: So, you come to a Trump rally in Bemidji, Minnesota today to ask Trump supporters what they see when they open their Facebook feeds.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No one has been more wrong more often than Biden.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In the November 3rd election result may never be accurately determined.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: On that post. Is there any label or fact check or anything?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, they have a little thing at the bottom that says voting by mail has a long history of trustworthiness in the U.S.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Are you a Facebook user?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I use Facebook, yes.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: What sort of pages do you follow on there?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Anybody that agrees with me.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Only people that agree with you? You don't want to hear --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- be a Republican and anti-abortion guy and pro-gun and pro-beer.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Did you not think it would be good to follow some pages of people who disagree with, see their opinion?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, because they call me stupid, ignorant. You know, why would I follow people that throw rocks at me constantly because they don't agree with me? I got tens of thousands of people that do.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: So, Trump, his campaign, a lot of senior Republicans over the past few weeks have been sharing doctored and manipulated videos on social media.</p><p>Now, the Trump campaign and Trump supporters will often say, these videos are clearly jokes, they are memes, people know their memes. People know they're fake.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When they say, well, this is fact checked. It's wrong because it's taken out of context. Like when Joe Biden fell asleep during a live interview on television.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Claimed that he fell asleep. I think that was an edited one, right? That was --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I didn't think it was. It looked pretty live to me with no cuts in it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Joining us live this morning from New York. Hi, good morning.</p><p>Wake up. Wake up, wake up. OK, this is your wake up call.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Is this the video that you're talking about?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could be, yes. Can I watch it really quick?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Sure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Washington Post? Yes.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: So an article there is saying that it was faked, but it looked real, right? I mean, it looked real.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I mean, I definitely wouldn't doubt that it would happen.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Even if it is fake. Does it change your opinion of Biden?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: God, no. You got to sift through it. I missed that one. But it was a good laugh. It was a really good laugh. And like I said, I wouldn't doubt it.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: A lot of people we spoke to today are sharing posts on Facebook. That later get fact checked by Facebook's third-party fact checkers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Anything I put on there about our president is generally only on for a few minutes and then all of a sudden, they're fact checking me saying this that the other thing which I know is not true. The fact checks are -- there fact checkers wrong.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They'll right away go to the conservative sites say that's wrong, then they pull it and they're not going to the liberal sites. And them are the real lies. They're the real liars out there.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Also circulating online more insidious forms of misinformation, including baseless claims about Vice President Joe Biden being a pedophile.</p><p>Do you guys seriously think that Joe Biden's a pedophile?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I do. But that's my opinion.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel he is, I feel he's part of the game.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: That baseless, fabricated claim about Biden is circulating among supporters of QAnon. The conspiracy theory that the FBI says is a potential domestic terrorism threat. Some of these false claims have been amplified by the president himself.</p><p>The FBI is saying QAnon is a dangerous conspiracy theory. Does that make you think for a second hang on? Should I be following this thing?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, because if the QAnon is bringing up the bad things about the FBI, that's why they're saying it. That's why they're afraid of it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: Facebook has called for an independent Oversight Board around content moderation. The group has taken nearly two years to form the plans to start hearing cases next month.</p><p>[15:35:09]</p><p>ASHER: Jamal Greene is co-chair of the Facebook Oversight Board. He joins us live now from New York via Skype.</p><p>So, your advisory board plans to start hearing cases next month. But do you think at this point, it is too late just based on that report from Donie O'Sullivan here? Do you think it's too late at this point to stop misinformation from scarring this election?</p><p>JAMAL GREENE, CO-CHAIR, FACEBOOK OVERSIGHT BOARD: Well, thanks for having me. We're going to start next month, at least that's the plan right now. And we're going to start as soon as we're ready to start. There are a number of steps we've taken to try to get ready to get to that point.</p><p>Misinformation in the election context is certainly a problem. It's a big problem. It's one that Facebook itself has some responsibility for addressing and it has been attempting to do so. Whether or not the Oversight Board is going to deal with election related issues or misinformation, will have to do with the cases that the Oversight Board ends up actually hearing once we get started.</p><p>So, it's hard to say exactly what our role is going to be. But once we're up and running, we'll be ready to handle any significant or controversial content that's within our purview.</p><p>ASHER: You know, only this week, we've seen so many examples of cases of misinformation that Facebook has failed to address. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr. in a Facebook video said that the radical left is laying the groundwork to steal the selection from my father. Then he went on to say that he was calling for abled bodied people to join an army, an army for election security.</p><p>Facebook says that doesn't breach its policies. I mean, what are your thoughts on that? A lot of people would find that quite surprising.</p><p>GREENE: I'm sure there'd be lots of different views about what to do with content like that. That's part of the purpose of the board. And when we're up and running, if there are controversial issues like that, they can be appealed to the board to make those kinds of determinations.</p><p>It's really hard to balance, freedom of speech with things like voter suppression, or misinformation or incitement or lots of other harmful things that people can say, and that's part of the reason the Oversight Board was created.</p><p>ASHER: I mean, I agree with you, it certainly is really difficult to balance, as you say, freedom of speech with voter suppression, misinformation. But just peel back the curtain for us. I mean, how hard is it to really identify cases of misinformation? What are some of the blind spots do you think that your group will actually come across?</p><p>GREENE: So, there are -- there are a lot of different issues relating to content that are within the jurisdiction of the Oversight Board. Those include incitement, they include hate speech, they include various forms of bullying, public nudity, whether a particular post should be fact checked by Facebook or not, is also within the purview of the board.</p><p>And so, we're going to be dealing with a very wide range of issues. It's hard to say in the abstract, what is going to be difficult and what isn't going to be difficult. It depends on the specific case.</p><p>And one of the things that I'm really excited about with the board, is that we're going to be a deliberative body that actually takes some time with these issues that talks to stakeholders that looks at the impact that particular decisions might have. And issue is a transparent reason decision about these things, rather than a quick fire decision just based on one's impressions.</p><p>ASHER: Despite the fact that -- you know, that is your intention to be careful and deliberate, which is, of course, admirable. I just want to get your reaction to the fact that there's been another group of Facebook critics, which have now created a real, real Facebook Oversight Board, which just sort of shows that there is some concern that either your group is too late, either it's taken too long to form or there's a feeling that it can't be trusted to do what is needed. Can I get your reaction to that?</p><p>GREENE: Well, I welcome efforts by critics of Facebook, including there are lots of critics to Facebook on the -- on the Oversight Board itself. I welcome efforts by critics to offer additional criticism, to air their views. There are a lot of thoughtful people who are associated with the real Oversight Board.</p><p>And so, I certainly welcome additional information. I think what the Oversight Board does is different because what we're doing is making decisions on content that are binding on Facebook, and so we have a different purview.</p><p>But certainly, the -- you know, the more the merrier from my perspective.</p><p>[15:40:01]</p><p>ASHER: The U.K.'s former deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg actually spoke with our Brian Stelter. He said some interesting things about Facebook. I want to play you what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK CLEGG, VICE PRESIDENT, GLOBAL AFFAIRS AND COMMUNICATIONS, FACEBOOK: There's a consistent drumbeat of criticism from the right who feel that Facebook takes down and moderates too much content and consistent drumbeat of criticism from the left saying that we don't do it enough.</p><p>Of course, we understand (INAUDIBLE) that is right and proper. It is right and proper that a company like Facebook, where in a sense, we have to as a private company try and hold the ring on the way in which a lot of these public, these highly important and highly charged debates take place.</p><p>We have to take decisions which are not there to favor one side or the other. We are not there to try and make our side more happy than the other.</p><p>And in a sense, we accept that we might make both of them unhappy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Right. So, a lot of people on the right are saying that Facebook is over policing, people on the left are saying that they're not doing enough. Facebook wants to be a neutral arbiter, they want to go straight down the middle, but you have a lot of misinformation that is actually to be fair, coming from one side of the political spectrum. Will they end up taking a stand on this do you think?</p><p>GREENE: So, I can't speak for Facebook, and what stand it takes about its own neutrality from the perspective of the board. What we're going to be looking at are Facebook's particular community standards, but also at international human rights law.</p><p>So, what we care about in deciding whether something should come up or come down depends both on whether it violates the community standards, but also on whether it causes -- what causes harm in a way that is recognized by international human rights law.</p><p>And so, we're the Oversight Board is also not going to be particularly focused on one side or the other. It's going to be a focus on harm and wherever that lies, it lies. We're not interested in political -- being politically down the middle. We're interested in conforming the community standards to international human rights law.</p><p>ASHER: All right. Jamal Greene, thank you so much for being on the show.</p><p>GREENE: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: Of course. Rio Tinto's destruction of a heritage site in Australia faces fresh criticism. What the mining firm is accused of doing and failing to do by the size traditional owners. We have that story just ahead.</p><p>ASHER: The traditional owners of a sacred site destroyed by Rio Tinto accused the mining firm of ignoring indigenous concerns and prioritizing profit. Angus Watson reports from Australia</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[15:45:10]</p><p>ANGUS WATSON, CNN JOURNALIST: A spirit etched into stone enduring here for thousands of years. Imprints of the world's oldest living culture found near Sydney, but many Indigenous Australians keep to a rule, never reveal the location of a sacred site, share them and they could be destroyed.</p><p>MITCHUM NEAVE, GOMEROI ELDER: It's so hard to say, that mountain, how significant is that. Well, it's like a page of a book, if you rip that hill out, the other hills have lost part of the page. That's a loss of their culture.</p><p>WATSON: In May, mining giant Rio Tinto tore a page from a 46,000-year-old book. An internal study proved two rock shelters in Western Australia could have been an enormous Museum of information, but Rio Tinto had government permission to blow them up in search for iron ore. So it did.</p><p>Heads have rolled as a result. Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two deputies forced to resign after pressure from shareholders. The destruction of the rock shelters should not have happened, the company has admitted.</p><p>But a parliamentary inquiry into the incident heard from an Aboriginal group that says Rio Tinto may retain the legal right to destroy at least another 124 such places.</p><p>The caves that Rio Tinto destroyed earlier this year were just one among countless indigenous sacred sites across Australia. Here in Northern New South Wales, people from the Gomeroi nation are fighting to save their heritage from a proposed coal mine to be operated by a Chinese company.</p><p>The Shenhua Company says its plan for an open cut coal mine here in the fertile Liverpool Plains would add $900 million to the nation's economy each year.</p><p>But on the proposed side are ancient burial grounds and ax grinding grooves that Gomeroi Elder Mitchum Neave likens to a war memorial.</p><p>NEAVE: Our burial sites might not have headstones, but it means a lot to us. So, just -- you just need to put the reverse role and say, if there was a cemetery, if that was a war memorial, but as soon as you go to an indigenous God site, it's not recognized.</p><p>WATSON: How does that make you feel about how Aboriginal Australians are treated more generally?</p><p>NEAVE: It might be our story or history, but hey, it's part of yours as well. It's your history as well.</p><p>WATSON: The state government has granted conditional approval for the coal mine to go ahead. After Shenhua promised to do its best to protect the sacred sites.</p><p>Shenhua has worked closely with relevant agencies and the community to develop a government approved plan that provides for the appreciation of heritage values within the project boundary, the company told CNN.</p><p>Federal Environment Minister Sussan Lee reviewed the state decision last year and declined to intervene. Stating, the expected social and economic benefits of the Shenhua Watermark Coal Mine to the local community outweighed the impacts of the mind on the applicants as a result of the likely destruction of parts of their Indigenous cultural heritage.</p><p>Lee's office told CNN this week that the case was carefully considered, and the minister's decision was upheld in subsequent legal proceedings.</p><p>Profits once again prioritized. Another project guaranteed to remove Indigenous Australians from their heritage, should it go ahead. Angus Watson in Northern New South Wales, Australia.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: Gamers will be able to get their hands on the next generation of consoles this holiday season. We'll hear from the head of Xbox about their new lineup after the break.</p><p>[15:51:26]</p><p>ASHER: Welcome back, everybody. The gaming industry has some new players on the way. Amazon announced a cloud gaming service called Luna on Thursday, it will integrate with Amazon's Fire T.V. hardware, as well as P.C.s, Macs, iPhones and iPads as well.</p><p>Meantime, Microsoft is unveiling the next generation of Xbox consoles. They're called the Series X and the Series S. Both of them will be released on November 10th as an aim to try to catch the holiday shopping season.</p><p>I spoke with Xbox head Phil Spencer earlier about how the pandemic has changed their clientele. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL SPENCER, HEAD OF XBOX, MICROSOFT (via Skype): The activity itself, we see it on the network, the engagement is way up. People are finding that gaming is a great outlet for them and their family when they're isolated at home.</p><p>And our job is as always in entertainment is to continue to offer them great games to play at an incredible value. And we're seeing the real durability of gaming and the growth in gaming happen right now.</p><p>ASHER: So, what do you think the role will be on the Xbox Series X in terms of bringing those new customers into the fold and keeping them?</p><p>SPENCER: Yes, you know, we're at a time of economic uncertainty for families, we really think about accessibility to gaming, making sure we have the right price points and the right offers for families. So, this holiday, we're coming out of this fall, we're coming out with two consoles a Series X which is our premium, 4K console and the Series S which is a much more affordable entry level console. But still with most of the technology that's in the higher console.</p><p>We also have things like Game Pass, which is our gaming subscription, which allows people to build their library for $10.00 a month as opposed to buying games individually.</p><p>So, it's really focused on accessibility, bringing more families in and giving them a great thing to do when they're at home.</p><p>ASHER: You've just made the biggest gaming purchase ever with Bethesda. What do you hope all of those new gaming titles will mean for the Xbox?</p><p>SPENCER: You know, gamers love to play games. And we know content is a really important part of our strategy. We've invested a lot in our cloud infrastructure so that we can deliver our Game Pass subscription to consoles, to P.C. and now to mobile phones. We've got a great Xbox Live service that reaches over 100 million people every month.</p><p>And the thing that we're going to continue to invest in is great content for players on our services. We now have over 23 amazing studios delivering content. So, Xbox customers know that they have a steady stream of great diverse games coming to the portfolio that they can continue to play.</p><p>ASHER: We're all talking about the potential for a vaccine, hopefully in the next few months. Once there is a vaccine, once people are actually able to leave their homes in a more meaningful way, how are you -- what is your strategy for still retaining those new customers that you've worked so hard to gain over the last six months?</p><p>SPENCER: Yes, even before COVID-19 and people working from home, you know, there are nearly three billion people on the planet that play video games, which is just a staggering number. You know, it's nearly half of the world's population play on some device, whether it's a phone or a gaming console or a P.C. to nearly $200 billion top line revenue business. And both of those numbers are growing by double digits even before the pandemic.</p><p>So, you know, what you see in the games business is a very durable and growing business. The generation that's coming along grew up natively playing interactive entertainment and it's something that they rely on for diversion and community entertainment creativity.</p><p>[15:55:09]</p><p>SPENCER: So, you know, I'm really obviously bullish on the durability of gaming, but we just see it. We see that this is a growing entertainment category bigger than almost any other entertainment category out there. And we're bringing in more and more gamers every day.</p><p>ASHER: Right Phil Spencer, live for us. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>SPENCER: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: All right, trading is almost done for the week on Wall Street. And let me tell you, it's certainly been a very volatile, very choppy week. The Dow is on track for four straight weeks of losses. Although it is up today, around 350 points, we'll have the closing bell and the final numbers next.</p><p>ASHER: All right, it is the last few minutes of trade on Wall Street for the week. Let's take a look and see how the Dow is doing. It's up about 370 points or so. Certainly, a bright finish to a very choppy, volatile week today has been buoyed by tech stocks, particularly Amazon, and Facebook as well.</p><p>But there have been so many headwinds for the markets, including, of course, the U.S. election and uncertainty surrounding that and the stimulus. Will Congress get a deal done before November 3rd? And of course, the pandemic, with all of that, all of those headwinds, you've had four straight weeks of losses on the Dow.</p><p>Let's take a look at the Dow 30. Today, we're seeing big gains for Apple and Microsoft. A surge in Boeing shares has allowed it to recoup much of the week's losses. UnitedHealth Group is in the mix there as well, trailing the index. We've got Nike giving back some of their gains this week and Dow Chemical as well.</p><p>Stocks in Europe. Let's take a look and see how they did. They ended the week mixed the FTSE 100 in London eked out a gain on Friday. Frankfurt in Paris were lower. Europe is contending with new restrictions fighting to contain a second wave of coronavirus cases. You've got daily cases in the U.K. around 6,000. And in France, that number is double that around 16,000.</p><p>And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.

HSBC followed swiftly behind when its mobile banking crashed on what was pay day for millions of people at the end of September. </p><p>Meanwhile, Barclays customers have endured three outages in the last two weeks as the bank painfully upgrades its security systems. </p><p>MPs have called for the banks to be brought to account over what can now only be described as a litany of IT failures - painful episodes that have put accounts at risk and left people out of pocket.</p><p>All the while, angry customers - many of whom are owed compensation - are beginning to lose faith in the 'good-old-reliable' banks they've always entrusted their money to, and are starting to explore alternatives.</p><p>Such a low level of customer service from the High Street banks is casting a long shadow over their future.</p><p>Not only does it leave the stalwarts wide open to disruption by the so-called 'Big Techs' - the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alibaba - but it makes them vulnerable to ambitious smaller fintech, like Monzo, Revolut and Starling.</p><p>                     Bank stalwarts suffer falling shares                    </p><p>The traditional banks' fall from grace is reflected in many of their share prices. </p><p>TSB - arguably the worst tech offender so far - forms part of the Sabadell banking group, which has seen its shares tumble in reaction to the fiasco. </p><p>Over the last five years, Barclays has trickled down from highs of around \u00a32.88 a share, to \u00a31.71 today. </p><p>And Government-owned RBS has lost value too, wilting from highs of \u00a33.02 in January to less than \u00a32.50 today, despite recently posting more positive results as it starts to regain strength a decade after the credit crunch.</p><p>                     What's eating the High Street banks?                   </p><p>The traditional banks are looking increasingly feeble for a number of reasons, says the latest World Retail Banking Report by Capgemini and Efma.</p><p>Firstly, satisfaction is low. Barely half of customers said their experience across different bank channels was positive, despite continued investment by the banks.</p><p>Simultaneously, customer expectations are on the up. People expect more now from their banking provider, including robust regulation and multiple digital contact points. </p><p>What's more, a third of those surveyed, across a range of age groups, said they would be open to using BigTechs for financial products and services. </p><p>Tech firms and start-ups have the huge advantage of being nimble. Unlike the retail banks, they aren't weighed down by costly store portfolios. Nor do they have complex legacy systems to unpick each time they want to implement changes. </p><p>Should the High Street banks bother fighting in what is beginning to look like a losing battle?</p><p>                     How can the banks change for the better?                    </p><p>Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says the retail banking giants must constantly adapt, rationalise costs and be more personal if they hope to survive in the long term. </p><p>'The rise of challenger banks and fintech rivals, the accelerating rate of technological change and the loss of trust, which dates back to the financial crisis, all mean that banks will have to continue to adapt,' he says. </p><p>                     Big banks still boss                    </p><p>Offering some context, Julian Wellesley, a senior analyst at Loomis Sayles, argues that the big banks, with scale on their side, are still 'in a strong position' and will 'continue to dominate UK banking'.</p><p>'They have strong balance sheets, healthy profitability and high market share. They have been losing a bit of market share to challenger banks, but still dominate the market,' he says.</p><p>Wellesley points out that the 'Big Six' dominated 66 per cent of UK mortgage lending in 2017, down just marginally on 2016, and added that challenger banks don't necessarily offer the best deals for customers.</p><p>This means they must embrace mobile technology and social media and at the same time prioritise cyber security. </p><p>Mould adds that banks will also need to keep rationalising their costs. He hints at the possibility of more branch closures as well as banks adapting their floor space to better suit their to customer needs.</p><p>'Some branches may be full-service offerings but others may be small kiosks in shopping centres or industrial parks. </p><p>'Customers will be looking for ease of access to services, either via a physical site or via a computer or handheld device, and this includes access to staff for information and help and not just data. </p><p>'Some customers, especially those of a certain vintage, will still require the branch-based service,' he says. </p><p>What all this means is that banks need to be better at the personal touch, 'a skill they have lost or intentionally jettisoned,' Mould says. </p><p>'People used to know their bank manager personally and introduce new generations of their family to the same branch as their financial needs grew and developed. </p><p>'Banks need to offer this again to win and retain customers and win and regain trust. </p><p>'This is why RBS' statement on its website that its primary purpose is 'to serve customers well' offers hope that banks are getting back to basics.' </p><p>The World Retail Banking Report agrees that banks must personalise their customer experience in order to fight back against soaring customer expectations and non-traditional forms of competition. </p><p>It found that satisfaction was notably higher - 49 per cent - among customers who had been proactively offered personalised digital experiences. </p><p>As Capgemini's Anirban Bose says: 'Retail banking today is all about the customer experience when interacting with their financial institution.' </p><p>                     If you can't beat 'em...                    </p><p>But that's easier said than done when you've got a monolithic tank to turn around and are hamstrung by the cost of branches as well as converting your turn-of-the-century systems to the latest state-of-the-art digital kit.</p><p>For some, there's too much to manage, hence earlier this month RBS announced plans to swing the axe on another 54 branches, 14 of which are the last bank in town.</p><p>Marking a real shift of focus, RBS is trying its arm at the mobile-only banking game, launching 'Bo', aimed at new, younger customers that crave a strong digital interaction in an attempt to take on the fintechs.</p><p>                     Are bank branches dead?                   </p><p>Since 2010, one out of every three UK banks has closed, with the Big Four all shrinking their networks.</p><p>'The UK bank branch network will continue to dwindle but I doubt very much that we will ever see the UK without a single bank branch,' says Jon Holt, head of financial services at KPMG.</p><p>'Banks will need to keep a presence on the high street even if it is only to burnish their community credentials, as evidenced by banks increasingly experimenting with flagship stores, which act as meeting spaces as well as offering banking services. </p><p>'This is in part because the rise in demand for digital is happening alongside the nations' increasing sense of social responsibility and branches play an important social role by providing a presence on the UK's struggling high streets and catering to customers who aren't online.' </p><p>Conversely, Metro Bank is expanding its footprint and offering a 7-days-a-week service. And, in some rural areas, banks are being replaced by 'branches on wheels' offering basic services in a village for a few hours a week.' </p><p>Some big banks may opt to change tack altogether and focus on a less-threatened part of their business. Barclay's chief executive Jes Staley, for example, has pinned his colours to the bank's investment arm.</p><p>In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Staley claimed that the biggest threat to Barclay's is its credit card business and consumer debt. He said that, given the drama at the bank in recent years, there's no better time to become a tour-de-force in investment banking to rival the likes of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>'It's time to let the bank run,' he said. </p><p>But another option is to use change to their advantage and partner up with new rivals. After all, the established banks have the benefit of already being regulated, and the power to snap up the younger incumbents. </p><p>So, some banks are eyeing collaborations with fintech and big-tech providers to make strategic use of data, generate new revenue streams and develop loyalty reward schemes and new services.</p><p>Some of these services could (once again) revolutionise how people interact with their banks. In the future we could be discussing our banking needs with a chatbot - some banks in the US have already started experimenting with this.</p><p>'The retail banking industry is at an inflection point, says Vincent Bastid, Secretary General of Efma.</p><p>'There is opportunity to innovate through collaboration as well as reinvention. It is an exciting time to be in banking as regulation, innovation, competition and collaboration merge to form the bank of the future.' </p><p>Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, says that banks are exploring analytics, the internet of things (IoT) and virtual assistants, as customers' desire for convenience drives a shift towards an increasingly digital world. </p><p>He predicts that Open Banking and artificial intelligence will transform the relationship we have with our banks over the next few years. </p><p>But some still have a lot of catching up to do. While the established players may be hard to dislodge, they will have to raise their game - become more personal and more technologically adept - if they want to maintain their lead and secure the custom of future generations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-48053666</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TFB-VNS1-F021-63NG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1706\"/><timeReceived>3:21 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

And now there's a sense of uncertainty about whether other newly public tech companies can remain above their public-debut prices, and if the appetite for tech IPOs is drying up just as popular names like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Square </emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Match Group </emphasis><br/> prepare to go public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Some of these companies are seen as one-trick ponies,\" said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner of Lutz, Fla.-based IPO Boutique, a research firm specializing in corporate stock offerings. \"The market is in a difficult period now. IPOs are risky by nature, and if not priced right, can turn negative.\"</p><p>It took looking no further than looking at the recent performances of Twitter and GoPro to see how negative sentiment has turned against what had been some IPO darlings.</p><p>Twitter, which went public on Nov. 7, 2013 at $26 a share, fell below its IPO price for the first time last week and has seen its shares fall nearly 30% since the start of the year. Many of the issues with Twitter surround the company's revenue outlook and slow growth in its user base. In October, Twitter forecast fourth-quarter revenue between $695 million and $710 million, which fell short of the $739.7 million in sales forecast by analysts surveyed by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Thomson Reuters</emphasis>. Twitter also said monthly active users of its service during the third quarter rose just 1% from a year ago, to 320 million.</p><p>GoPro shares also fell last week to below the $24 price level from the company's June 25, 2014 IPO. Shares recently changed hands at less than $22, having plunged more than 65% since the start of the year. Cloud-based file sharing and content management company <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Box</emphasis><br/> , which priced its Jan. 23 IPO at $14 a share, has also plunged, having seen its shares drop more than 40% since its first day of trading.</p><p>\"Investors are pickier now and are looking at profits as opposed to revenue growth, which doesn't bode well for start-up companies looking to go public,\" said Gregory Sichenzia, a partner with New York-based securities law firm Sichenzia, Ross, Friedman, Ference who has represented and advised companies and investment banks during their initial public offerings.</p><p>Sichenzia, who said there have been only 18 tech-specific IPOs this year, pointed to the case of Square as an example of a company that may have its IPO dreams turn out not as well as it hoped.<br/></p><p>Square, which is headed up by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, is hoping to price 27 million of its shares at between $11 and $13 when the company's stock is expected to begin trading on Thursday. But Sichenzia said that a recent regulatory filing by Square showing the company's valuation at $3.9 billion, compared with $6 billion a year ago, suggests it is seeing some hesitation from potential IPO-stage investors. And Square's net losses of $77.6 million in the first half of 2015, which came on top of $79.4 million in losses during the same period a year ago, aren't helping bolster the company's cause.</p><p>\"Square will face problems since they are a start-up with mounting losses,\" Sichenzia said. \"The valuation seems artificial and may tank below the IPO price as investors determine its true value.\"</p><p>Match, which is owned by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IAC/Interactive</emphasis><br/> and runs the Match.com and Tinder online dating sites, among others, is also slated to begin trading on Thursday, with 33.3 million shares hoping to be priced between and $12 to $14.

Unsurprisingly, Jones has decried it as 'censorship' and abridging his 'free speech.' Those who support such actions of these platforms include liberal Amanda Marcotte of Salon who said that it was a 'sudden bout of atypical decency and common sense' in fighting against 'disinformation' and Mike Snider of USA Today noting that 'free speech is a principle that businesses often choose to follow, but aren't bound to.'1[1] Similarly, Christine Emba blares in the Washington (Amazon) Post that the social media companies were within their rights and did 'nothing wrong,' as they are not obliged to 'host your speech on their platforms[or] promote your content' and The Economist, a magazine that represents the interests of the British bourgeoisie, declared that these companies are 'not the state,' meaning they are able to 'write their terms of service as they wish and police posts as they choose.' Following in suit was Hartford University Professor Adam Chiara, who declared that 'tech companies are privatethey have the right to decide what content goes on their platformssocial media platforms own the access to his [Jones's] audience, and they have every legal and moral right to cancel it.' </p><p>T.C. Sottek of The Verge write that InfoWars was hypocritical because it still claims the right to purge 'objectionable' content from their website while Kevin Drum of Mother Jones wrote that 'if no one else on the planet feels like giving him [Alex Jones] a soapbox to extract money from gullible conspiracy theorists, that's fine with me.' Furthest in this viewpoint was David Zurawik, an oft media critic for the Baltimore Sun, who openly applauded the action against Jones: 'Finally, the giants of digital media are showing some social responsibilityIt is long overdueit is a step in the right directionHere's hoping the crackdowns continue.' Even the libertarians of Reason.com jumped on board. While they expressed some reservations about selectively 'policing' harmful speech and claimed that conservatives 'need to worry,' arguing that 'private companies are under no obligation to provide a platform' to those like Jones and that 'Facebook, YouTube, and other mediahave a right to dictate the contours of permissible speech on their sites and to enforce those standardsNo one seriously disputes thisThere's no God-given right to be on Facebook or Twitter.' Even some in the ACLU seemed to accept the power of these social media platforms, only asking for transparency and 'protectionsagainst misuse' with nothing much more. On the other side was Cory Doctrow, co-editor of Boing Boing, who argued that the 'online world has almost no public spacesand a tiny handful of incredibly large, powerful companies control the vast majority of our civic discourse online,' with Harvey Silvergate of NY Daily News adding that 'when the haters are allowed to expose themselves through their words, we are all safer for knowing who they are and who, over time, they morph into,' saying the current debate over the actions against Jones is really 'about what it means for our society if a few tech companies should be able to decide for everyone what information is available.' At the same time, Black Agenda Report's Margaret Kimberley quip[2]ped[3] that 'there is no reason for anyone on the left to cheer Jones being censored. The move against him will be used to defend further censoring of left wing voicesHis absence helps no one except the intelligence apparatus.' Even, Matt Taibbi, a piece of bourgeois trash for other reasons[4] (like not supporting reproductive rights while smearing Venezuela and Karl Marx), wrote in Rolling Stone that there is a 'union of Internet platforms and would-be government censors' and that 'the sheer market power of these companies over information flow has always been the real threat. This is why breaking them up should have long ago become an urgent national priority', admitting that 'there was no First Amendment issue with the Jones ban.' Beyond the views of The Economist, Reason.com, some ACLU members, Marcotte, Snider, Emba, Chiara, Sottek, Drum, Sottek, Zurawik, Doctrow, Silvergate, Kimberley, and Taibbi, many others expressed their views on the actions against Jones, a number of whom worried about 'free speech' and the power of these social media platforms over people's lives.2[5] Taking all the views mentioned in the last paragraph into consideration, we don't need a number of Loyola University academics[6] or David Pozen of Columbia Law School to tell us that social media has become an important 'one stop shop' for many, allowing the internal rules, a form of private regulations of these platforms, to shape the existing public discourse. Undoubtedly, huge social media giants, such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, Pinterest, Instagram (owned by Facebook), and Tumblr (owned by Yahoo), have control of vast amounts of information.3[7] Amazon has a related role with its web services controlling 'roughly 40 percent of the cloud market, running the backend for Netflix, Pinterest, Slack and dozens of other services with no visible connection to the company,' showing the reach of their 'server empire.' Additionally, a recent study by Gallup[8] showed that the populace of the U$ not only opposes news personalized toward them, but the role of the companies as gatekeepers of content, with companies having to disclose why they have selected certain content for users. However, these companies, legally, have the right to determine the speech that is allowed on their sites. As such, Ron Jacobs[9], a writer for CounterPunch, is right: while the action against Jones 'may effect the ability of leftist and anarchist groups and individuals to provide content and share events on these corporate platforms' it isn't right to support 'those liberals and leftists who think they need to defend Alex Jones' since the latter should not 'have unfettered access to spout his outright lies and hate,' and, I might add, those on the Left are under no obligation to protect the speech of bigots, war criminals, or otherwise detestable people. Jacobs concludes, correctly, by saying that 'free speech will be further limited to those who can afford to pay for it[with] propagandists funded by wealthymillionaires and billionairesstrengthen[ing] their control over the so-called free press,' meaning that we should let 'Alex Jones fight his battles without our help.' Such societal dynamics mean that certain people have more privilege to speak than others. Without a doubt the Left is on the chopping block, but this is due to Russiagate and efforts by social media giants to pander to the Right, which dominates the political scene in the U$. After all, when Twitter was in 'hot water' since it had not fallen in line with other social media giants on efforts against Jones, its CEO, Jack Dorsey, did his first interview on the subject with Sean Hannity, who can accurately be described as a right-wing loud-mouth.4[10] While the social media network temporarily suspended Infowars for seven days, Alex Jones still continues to spout unflinching support for the current sitting US President including anti-immigrant racism, anti-socialism, anti-vax nonsense, and harping on the 'censorship' card, even tweeting cartoons drawn by Ben Garrison, whose drawings notoriously smear the Left, to support his 'case.' According to news reports, Jones made direct appeals to the current sitting US President to make 'censorship' a big issue in the upcoming election and deal with purported (by him) 'Chinese infiltration' of the Democratic Party and tech industry. Such claims of censorship by Jones and others ring a bit hollow as the right-wing in the U$ has their ready propaganda network of video platforms, social media sites, and even dating apps!5[11] Alex Jones can be promoted there, apart from his Twitter account which still has over 895,000 followers. So, he isn't going anywhere. Recently, Senator Chris Murphy infamously wrote on Twitter that 'Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart. These companies must do more than take down one website. The survival of our democracy depends on it.' Despite Don Trump, Jr complaining about 'Big Tech's censorship campaign' is about 'purging all conservative media,' and conspiracist David Icke decrying censorship, conservatives are not really the target of these proposed measures. Sure, some fascists, apart from Jones, have been removed from social media, like the hideous Proud Boys or Milo Yiannopoulos (for harassing Black actress Leslie Jones), while some liberal groups like Media Matters, Share Blue, and American Bridge have called for social media platforms to take more action against the right-wing.6[12] The conservative narrative of themselves as victims of social media censorship is only strengthened when those like Marcotte of Salon, quoted earlier in this article, say that journalists (and social media outlets) should serve as 'gatekeepers' against conservatives! Instead, it is the Left that is under attack[13] by these outlets. Just look at the permanent removal[14] of the Haiti Analysis on Facebook, the temporary de-publishing[15] of TeleSur English's page on the same site[16], with the same[17] happening to Venezuela Analysis, the takedown of an Occupy London page[18] which had 'pro-Palestinian posts,' censoring[19] the alternative media outlet SouthFront out of existence, and Facebook's deletion of pages which had up to 40 million followers, including a number of alternative media outlets[20]. Yet another example is when an episode of Abby Martin's The Empire Files (currently[21] targeted by U$ sanctions on Venezuela) on YouTube, which highlighted military violence of Zionists, was '[22]blocked[23]in 28 countries for supposedly violating 'local laws,'' possibly due to the participation of the stalwart Zionist group, the Anti-Defamation League, in 'YouTube's flagging system' since the group 'considers actions tied to Boycott, Sanctions and Divestmentand opposition to Israeli occupation as racism.' Also YouTube banned a video[24] showing a boy murdered by Zionist soldiers, Google downranked[25] and alternative website named Dandelion Salad, Facebook began ranking[26] news sources by their 'truthworthiness' with the help of establishment organizations, and social media giants meeting about 'information operations[27]' for the upcoming midterm elections in the U$. Most recently, Google, Facebook, and Twitter have begun going after Iranians[28] whom they declare (and claim) are 'government trolls,' another clear act of censorship. This isn't surprising since Facebook is, as one should note, letting the Digital Forensics Lab[29] of the Atlantic Council sort through content, leading to a further crackdown on the left. Even the changing of YouTube's algorithm which turns the site into a 'censored, walled garden which gives you search results from a tiny cadre of establishment media outlets,' will not 'hurt' conservatives as some declare[30], but will undoubtedly hurt those on the Left even more, as there is so much propagandistic content about left-leaning ideas out there! Such an attack on the Left could possibly intensify for a number of reasons: if these social media companies adopt the Chinese or European models of net regulation, the former being easily accepted by more tech companies every day, and if the U$ government is successful in forcing Facebook to help break the end-to-end encryption of their voice calls in messenger in order to supposedly fight the MS-13 gang.7[31] Twitter's policy[32] of ranking tweets and search results in an effort to downgrade those they deem 'bad faith actors,' like the Russians perhaps[33], 'who intend to manipulate or detract from healthy conversation,' and the uneven moderating on Facebook doesn't help matters. The same applies to the removal of accounts by Twitter following the indictments of 12 Russians by Robert Mueller and an effort to target so-called 'fake' accounts, and Reddit removing 944 'suspicious' accounts which they claimed were tied to the Russians even though they had little impact. Most worrisome is YouTube working with[34] establishment media organizations to promote 'quality journalism' with breaking news highlighting videos from CBS, Fox News, the New York Times, and CNN, to go by their examples, while YouTube is also showing information from 'third parties' (so-called 'information cues[35]') from sites such as Encyclopaedia Brittanica and Wikipedia on 'a small number of well-established historical and scientific topics that have often been subject to misinformation' or those that are the 'center of debate.' The latter effort by YouTube to link to Wikipedia, which wasn't informed about the initiative beforehand[36] and expressed their concerns about content scraping, to counter 'misinformation' and define certain media outlets is uneven. Looking at Wikipedia links on the videos of the Channel News Asia, TeleSur, TeleSur English, RT, SABC Digital News, and Al Jazeera, they are all described as 'funded' by specific governments. However, for BBC, it is only called a 'British broadcast service,' not that it is directly funded by the British government! Additionally, videos on the CNN, Bloomberg, ABC News, Vice News, Vox, Fox News, MSNBC, Washington Post, National Geographic, and The Guardian channels have no links to third-party websites even though they are funded and owned by corporate entities! Hence, this effort by YouTube will, without a doubt, disadvantage outlets like TeleSur and RT, which buck the general narrative of the corporate media, as it will assist in imperialist propaganda about those outlets. And no, YouTube, TeleSur is not funded by 'the Latin American government' as it says below every single video from their two channels (TeleSur and TeleSur English), a racist conception that denies the reality in the region, as this news organization is funded jointly by the Cuban, Bolivian, Venezuelan, Nicaraguan, and Uruguayan[37] governments. Such actions by YouTube and many other major social media platforms are led in part by what Hiroyuki Hamada rightly called[38] the 'Putin panic, an epidemic spewing hatred against anything Russian' while ignoring that 'Russia was subjected to political and economic intervention by the US in the 90s' with the U$ backing Boris Yeltsin who helped rip apart the country's social fabric. Currently, the U$ is waiting for 'Russia to jump on its Pearl Harbor or a 9/11,' with such a panic being an 'obvious scheme of imperialism' leading to war. As such, as he rightly notes, 'we must not be a voice for the capitalist lords nor for the hitmenwe must reach out to people like us in Russia, China, Syria, Iran, and other peoples of the planet, and people like us in our communities, with messages of peace, sharing and mutual respect.' As such, not only should there should be support for those on the Left who have been censored on these social media platforms but there should be local and international connections in the way that Hamada describes in order to counter the general narrative spread in capitalist societies.There were many articles on this subject, so it is hard to pick just a few, but I would say that the articles on Boing Boing, Washington Post, The Verge, New York Times, Washington Examiner, Reason.com, The American Conservative, and Rolling Stone were most informative on this subject. For those that want he full list of sources I used to make this determination, you are free to email me, and I will send you the list of sources I'm talking about here.At the same time, left-leaning comedian, Jimmy Dore, posted many YouTube videos on the topic, with him and his guests[39] rightly criticizing corporate control of social media, arguing that social media should be public utility, and defending[40] (especially by Jimmy himself) the right of Alex Jones to speak, sticking to[41] the free speech absolutist line, even defending the ACLU's stance of defending the speech of horrid bigots. To the credit of Jimmy and his guests, they are right that Russiagate can be used to silence the Left, while criticizing U$ wars and the corporate press.Some, like Reuters, define social media giants as only encompassing Facebook, YouTube (owned by Google), Twitter and Microsoft. But there are many more, as noted by LifeWire and DreamGrow, like LinkedIn, Google+, Instagram (owned by Facebook), Pinterest, Tumblr (owned by Yahoo!), Snapchat, Reddit (mainly owned by Advance Publications), Flickr (owned by SmugMug), Swarm (owned by Foursquare), Kik (owned by Kik interactive), Periscope (owned by Twitter), Medium (owned by A Medium Corporation), Soundcloud (owned by SoundCloud Limited), Tinder (owned by IAC (InterActiveCorp), WhatsApp (owned by WhatsApp Inc.), Slack (owned by Slack Technologies), Musical.ly (owned by Tik Tok, Chinese company), Meetup (owned by WeWork), and Peach ('a tiny journaling service of Byte, Inc' according to their terms of use). Others, most of which are not for English speakers but for those of other languages, include Weibo (owned by Sina Corp), Ask.Fm (owned by Noosphere Ventures), VK (owned by Mail.Ru Group), Odnoklassniki (owned by Mail.Ru Group), and Qzone (owned by Tencent Holdings Limited). For more about Amazon's Web Services, see Russell Brandom, 'Using the internet without the Amazon Cloud,' The Verge, July 28, 2018.Also consider a recent post by the Twitter company[42] saying that 'while we welcome everyone to express themselves on our service, we prohibit targeted behavior that harasses, threatens, or uses fear to silence the voices of others' saying they have certain rules, policies and enforcement options in place for a safe environment, while working to 'Twitter better for everyone' admitting they have a role to play in society and a 'wider responsibility to foster and better serve a healthy public conversation.' As for Apple, it still offers the InfoWars mobile app in its App Store even after removing many of Jones's podcasts, saying they support 'all points of view being represented' in their online marketplace. Additionally, the App is still in the Google Play store! The above information is extracted from Daisuke Wakabayashi, 'Gatekeepers or Censors? How Tech Manages Online Speech,' New York Times, August 7, 2018, Casey Newton, 'Twitter's fear of making hard decisions is killing it,' The Verge, August 17, 2018, and Avery Anapol, 'Twitter CEO on decision not to ban Alex Jones: 'He hasn't violated our rules',' The Hill, August 7, 2018.Brandy Zadrozny, 'Right-wing platforms provide refuge to digital outcasts \u2014 and Alex Jones,' NBC News, August 9, 2018. This article lists Mike Adams's Real.Video (like YouTube), Andrew Torba's Gab.ai (like Twitter), Codias (like Facebook), Conservapedia (like Wikipedia), Hatreon (like Patreon), TrumpSingles (like Tinder), and Rebel Media (like YouTube) as examples. And that's not counting right-wing media sites like The Daily Caller, Drudge Report, Fox News, Newsmax, The Blaze, One America News Network, National Review, The American Conservative (more critical of U$ imperialism than other outlets), The American Spectator, The Weekly Standard, The Washington Examiner, American Thinker, The Daily Wire, Gateway Pundit, The Federalist, TownHall, Breitbart, Hot Air, Instapundit, and Red State, along with talk radio shows and various others!Jim Hoft, 'Top Far Left Organizations Bragged About Working with Facebook and Twitter to Censor and Eliminate Conservative Content,' The Gateway Pundit, August 20, 2018; Rob Shimshock, 'Twitter Suspends Libertarian Commentator Gavin McInnes And His Activist Group,' The Daily Caller, August 11, 2018; Keith Wagstaff, 'Twitter suspends Proud Boys and Gavin McInnes,' Mashable, August 10, 2018. And, no, these are NOT 'far left' organizations. That's what Jim Hoft gets wrong, like many people on the Right, who think that liberal organizations are more left-leaning than they actually are in reality!Daniel Taylor, 'Free Speech Under Fire: Globalists Bet On Chinese Dominating the Internet's Future,' Old Thinker News, Aug 13, 2018; Xeni Jardin, 'Feds ask court to force Facebook to break Messenger's end-to-end voice encryption for MS-13 gang probe,' Boing Boing, Aug 17, 2018; Sam Haysom, 'Undercover footage exposes Facebook moderators' disturbing policies,' Mashable, July 18, 2018; Bruce Haring, 'Twitter Account Purges Continue As Service Cuts Guccifer 2.0 AndDCLeaks,' Deadline, July 14, 2018; April Glaser, 'YouTube Is Adding Fact-Check Links for Videos on Topics That Inspire Conspiracy Theories,' Slate, August 14, 2018; Lucas Matney, 'Reddit has banned 944 accounts linked to the IRA Russian troll farm,' TechCrunch, April 11, 2018.
