The measure allows companies to raise up to $50 million annually without many of the regulatory disclosure costs and delays associated with an initial public offering as part of a process that seeks to expand on existing so-called Reg A offering rules for raising up to $5 million. Many backers, including Cuban, view the offerings as a sort of stepping stone to full-blown IPOs.</p><p>\"The SEC has Reg A+, which simplifies the paperwork for [a] $25 million or $50 million offering,\" Cuban said. \"These rules with Reg A+ have just been crystallized recently and there is a huge opportunity and I've been talking to folks about creating a fund that says the goal is to invest in startup, but part of the effort is we're going to try to take them public within four to five years.\"</p><p>Cuban suggested that the goal of the fund would be to counter the culture of Silicon Valley, where the big tech giants acquire upstart companies before they can thrive and act as real competition on their own. \"Imagine if Instagram was public. Imagine if Whatsapp was public,\" Cuban said. \"What kind of discussion would we be having about Facebook with a competitor like Instagram where messaging could be dominated by a different company other than Facebook. Facebook has good R&amp;D but if there is a competitor they're buying them.\"</p><p>Facebook<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/13529482/index.dl\">purchased</url> messaging application maker WhatsApp for $21.8 billion in October 2014, about two years after acquiring Instagram for $1 billion in September 2012.</p><p>The most controversial part of Reg A+--and the one that proponents contend is its most attractive attribute--is its exemption from most state securities regulation, which would allow issuers to avoid an entire extra layer of oversight. Issuers seeking to raise up to $20 million, classified as Tier 1, can choose between federal or state registration. And the SEC's Tier 2 rule prohibits state securities regulators from requiring issuers seeking to raise up to $50 million from registering with states or subjecting their offerings to state qualifications.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook is a holding in Jim Cramer's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/k/aap/_tscnav/index.html\">Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio</url> .

Andrew Cuomo vetoed a popular bill that would do just that. But on Tuesday those advocates got confirmation from the governor that their efforts may succeed in the new year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cuomo detailed a proposal to legalize e-bikes and e-scooters during his budget address Tuesday, one of several tech-related proposals included in his fiscal year 2021 budget that signal a willingness to adapt New York's rules and regulations as technology transforms the streets, workforce and more. In addition to promising to legalize e-bikes, Cuomo also proposed a state task force to study the issue of classifying gig workers as employees \u2013 a debate that is ramping up across the country.</p><p> The governor's e-bikes proposal would allow localities to choose on their own how to regulate the increasingly popular devices \u2013 which is essentially what the vetoed bill sponsored by state Sen. Jessica Ramos and Assemblywoman Nily Rozic that passed by a wide margin last session would have done. When vetoing Ramos and Rozic's bill late last year, Cuomo said he supported the idea of legalizing e-bikes, but called for safety measures including a helmet requirement and mandatory front and rear lights. NY1 reported last week that Cuomo reached an agreement with advocates to legalize e-bikes and e-scooters, with the stipulation that helmets would be required for e-bikes that travel over 25 mph.</p><p> Cuomo did not address any details about how legalization would work in his speech, or whether other safety requirements would be included. But a statement released by Rozic on Tuesday afternoon said that legalization will include that helmet requirement for e-bikes over 25 mph, as well as a helmet requirement for 16 to 18-year-olds riding e-scooters. Penalties for driving while intoxicated would also be enforced in the event of a collision. Representatives for Cuomo did not respond to a request for comment about those or any other provisions.</p><p> Supporters of legalization hailed the issue's inclusion in the budget as a victory. \"Although the governor had the opportunity to legalize e-bikes and e-scooters much earlier, his agreement with the advocates is a clear win for workers across New York and for the future of sustainable mobility,\" Ramos said in an emailed statement on Tuesday, emphasizing the argument that legalization would have an outsized impact on delivery workers for whom an e-bike is often a job requirement.</p><p> Ramos wasn't alone in expressing regret that e-bikes and e-scooters weren't passed as legislation. \"I think it goes without saying that it probably should have been passed as legislation that was introduced by Assemblymember Rozic and Sen. Ramos earlier last year, and not as an obscure line item in the budget,\" said Emil Skandul, technologist and founder of the digital innovation firm, Capitol Foundry. \"It certainly creates a lot more transparency to introduce it as legislation. But regardless, this is a win for alternative transportation advocates and for New Yorkers.\"</p><p> Alternative transportation advocates also counted the proposal introduced by Cuomo Tuesday as a win, saying that requiring helmets only for faster e-bikes is a workable compromise \u2013 though the governor's office has yet to confirm details of the proposal, including any helmet requirements. \"It's very good that there are no helmet requirements for Class 1 and Class 2 (e-bikes) which can go up to 20 miles per hour,\" said Marco Conner, co-deputy director of the transportation advocacy group Transportation Alternatives.</p><p> E-bike legalization is not the only tech issue covered in Cuomo's budget address. In his State of the State address earlier this month, the governor highlighted several proposals that will have implications on both tech companies and how New Yorkers interact with technology. Many of those were also included in the 2021 budget, which mentioned a $9 million investment in New York's testing site upstate, building a STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) education and training center in Syracuse, and establishing net neutrality principles in New York.</p><p> One of the more controversial proposals deals with New York's gig economy workers, and Cuomo seemed to pick a side in that debate during his State of the State address, saying that some gig workers are exploited as independent contractors and tweeting that gig workers need to be \"appropriately classified.\"</p><p>California recently enacted a bill that reclassifies many gig workers as employees \u2013 rather than independent contractors \u2013 affording them labor protections, and stirring up resistance from tech companies for whom they work, like Uber and DoorDash. Since last summer, similar efforts to redesign how gig workers fit into New York's workforce have gained steam, with some legislators proposing bills like California's, and others advocating for a more middle-of-the-road approach that would offer portable benefits to gig workers without classifying them as employees.</p><p> Despite being hailed by some as worker-friendly, California's law has received considerable criticism for taking too broad an approach to rein in gig economy companies. Freelance writers have sued over the law, arguing that it harms their ability to get work as freelancers because if news outlets publish more than 35 pieces of work in a year by a freelancer, that worker must be classified as an employee.</p><p> On Tuesday, Cuomo didn't pick a side in the debate over how best to protect gig workers, but proposed a \"task force of stakeholders\" \u2013 presumably those working for tech companies like Uber as well as workers and labor advocates \u2013 to tackle the issue and come up with solutions by May 1st of this year. \"There is no doubt that there is abuse of employees,\" Cuomo said during his speech. \"Let's come up with a program working together that ends the abuse but grows the economy, and does both together.\" The budget book also noted that if the issue doesn't get resolved, then the Department of Labor would be authorized to enact regulations to protect workers.</p><p> Broadly, these proposals \u2013 both the ones explicitly referenced by Cuomo on Tuesday and ones unveiled earlier \u2013 tackle a few of the big tech issues that not only New York, but the rest of the country is grappling with, including efforts to maintain net neutrality protections as the federal government turns against them, and the classification of gig workers. \"This is most likely going to be the most important issue of 2020 for New York state,\" Skandul said of the latter. \"New York has an opportunity here to correct the flaws in California's bill.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Governor Cuomo presented his fiscal year 2021 budget on Tuesday.

A series of changes to policy settings are also hitting the industry and forcing bookies to start squeezing their customers.</p><p>Put simply, punters are starting to do their dough too quickly.</p><p>Taylor Collison analyst Andrew Orbach has studied the \"overround\" of leading bookmakers across all racing codes (thoroughbreds, harness and greyhounds) over more than two years to assess how bookmaker margins have changed.</p><p>An overround is essentially a bookmaker's expected profit across their entire book. At 110 per cent, it implies that the bookmaker's profit will be 10 per cent.</p><p>As online bookmakers streamed into the Australian market over the past five years, competition forced the overround down; at August 2017, they sat at around 119 per cent.</p><p>But in recent years, a series of changes has forced the bookies to increase their margins.</p><p>The most discussed has been the introduction of state-based point of consumption taxes, which force bookies to pay state governments a percentage of turnover when they take bets from citizens of that state.</p><p>The introduction of POC taxes in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia on January 1 saw the average overround climb 2 per cent from around 120 per cent to 122 per cent. The industry rule of thumb is that increasing overround by 100-basis-points means a 60-basis-point rise in gross margins.</p><p>A number of other changes fed into the bookies pushing their hiking their overround. Changes to advertising regulations for the industry meant it has been harder to lure new customers with inducements, which weighs on turnover. Victoria's regime of racefield fees for bookies and the general fragility of the economy have also eaten away at profitability.</p><p>But as Orbach explains, there's a vicious cycle at play here. Increasing your margins to offset lower turnover means punters lose their punting budget even faster. Instead of having 15 bets, they're tapped out after 10 or 12.</p><p>But this can depress turnover further. And it is from turnover that the racing industry funds prizemoney, which ultimately attracts owners and breeders.</p><p>Orbach says the industry has innovated to adapt to this changing landscape.</p><p>As advertising restrictions make it harder to run broad promotional offers to customers - known in the industry as \"generosities\" - the big operators are increasingly offering existing customers tailored offers. For example, some firms now let punters choose when they will boost their odds or enjoy other offers such as refunds on losing bets.</p><p>Market costs are also cheaper under this strategy, but punters still get to enjoy offers.</p><p>\"Their ability to market is being compromised to some extent and they are looking to get more bang for their buck,\" Orbach says. \"Rather than a scattergun approach, it's about giving the punter a more specific offer that might resonate with them.\"</p><p>A shift towards higher-margin betting products that allow a customer to punt on multiple outcomes in the same race or match in return for bigger odds - these bets are known as same-game or same-race multi bets - are another way the bookies have been able to protect profitability.</p><p>But again, these are more profitable for bookies, meaning punters go through their budgets faster.</p><p>A combination of personalised offers, higher-margin products and a run of luck that has seen favourites lose many of the big races during the Spring Carnival may well have protected margins for this year at least.</p><p>The mail is Tabcorp and Sportsbet have held their own during this period. But the potential for wagering turnover to keep falling should resonate for an industry-funded by the punt.</p><p>\"As results have been relatively favourable for wagering operators during the Carnival, the net impact might not be that great this year, but with turnover being suppressed it might be more problematic for racing industries down the track,\" Orbach says.</p><p>Banking's big tech problem</p><p>There is so much bad news in Westpac's annual result - a 15 per cent fall in cash profit, a 15 per cent cut to the dividend, falls in return on equity and net interest margin and a dilutive $2.5 billion capital raising - that it's tempting to see the group's announcement of a new digital push as a bit of light in the dark.</p><p>But while chief executive Brian Hartzer's shift towards what he's calling \"banking as a service\" does represent a potential differentiator for the bank, it's also based on a grim reality: rebuilding the bank's core systems remains an extremely difficult and expensive task.</p><p>Or as Antony Jenkins, the former Barclays CEO and the founder of Westpac's new technology partner 10x told the bank's internal news service: \"For all the progress banks have made - and it is significant in terms of adding modern technology to the customer experience - they are inhibited by the fact that legacy technologies are very expensive to operate, highly fragmented and don't generally run in real time unlike the customer expectation.\"</p><p>Westpac plans to build a new banking platform on the banking technology stack developed by 10x, which has apparently been named to inspire banks to deliver 10 times better service in a modern age (geddit?).</p><p>This will be completely separate from Westpac's core banking platform. And rather than being offered to existing customers, the platform on 10x is designed to allow Westpac's institutional customers and fintech partners to effectively rent Westpac's banking licence and offer Westpac products to their own customers.</p><p>And hey presto, welcome to banking as a service.</p><p>Westpac will take an undisclosed equity stake in 10x and will essentially run this as an experiment, at least initially.</p><p>\"In the long term, if that platform proves up in the way that we think it may, it's potentially something we can fold back into our own core operating environment and thereby drive our own cost and flexibility in a better direction,\" Hartzer says.</p><p>Hartzer has long been wary about banks and even fintech companies that do little more than perch fresh-looking customer interfaces on top of the spaghetti of existing core banking platforms.</p><p>\"Being a truly digital-ready bank is about more than having a cool app. Because apps can be copied, customer experience can be copied.</p><p>\"Of course you need to have that great customer experience, absolutely, but you also need to be set up to run yourself in a digital way internally, but also to partner with some of these news fintech companies and new services that we want to make available to our customers.\"</p><p>Was Hartzer caught off guard by the speed of the change happening in the market? Yesterday, he said there was a \"level of competitive urgency about trying to put digital services into the market\", which at least suggests there is recognition that waiting to reconfigure Westpac's core banking platform for these new digital products is no longer realistic.</p><p>It should be noted Westpac has made important strides on the tech front in recent years. It hasn't had a severity 1 tech stability incident in more than 18 months (and only two in the past two years) and has been able to deliver increasing levels of service to customers via digital channels. Digital transactions rose 10 per cent in 2018-19, while branch transactions fell 11 per cent.</p><p>But to Hartzer's point about shiny apps and customer interfaces, this is really about meeting customers' expectations and preferences.</p><p>Which is why using 10x to turbo-charge the testing of a new banking model can make some sense.</p><p>Clearly, a great leap forward will involve a completely new way of operating, on a completely new tech platform.

Instead, the American people are demanding - and intend to win - meaningful federal restraints on tech company abuses of power that also ensure the right of states to craft their own consumer protections.\"</p><p>From the Equifax data breach to foreign election interference and targeted digital ads based on race, health and income, it's clear that U.S. consumers face a crisis of confidence born from federal data privacy laws that are decades out of date and a lack of basic protections afforded them by digital conglomerates. These corporations, many of which dominate online spaces, are far more interested in monetizing every key stroke or click than protecting consumers from data breaches. For that reason, federal and state authorities must act, the groups maintain.</p><p>The groups will push for federal legislation based on a familiar privacy framework, such as the original U.S. Code of Fair Information Practices and the widely followed Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Privacy Guidelines. These frameworks should require companies that collect personal data and rights for individuals to:</p><p>* Establish limits on the collection, use and disclosure of sensitive personal data;</p><p>* Establish enhanced limits on the collection, use and disclosure of data of children and teens;</p><p>* Regulate consumer scoring and other business practices that diminish people's physical health, education, financial and work prospects; and</p><p>* Prohibit or prevent manipulative marketing practices.</p><p>The groups are calling for federal baseline legislation and oppose the pre-emption of state digital privacy laws. States have long acted as the \"laboratories of democracy\" and must continue to have the power to enact appropriate protections for their citizens as technology develops, the groups say.</p><p>\"Black communities should not have to choose between accessing the Internet and the right to control our data,\" said Brandi Collins-Dexter, senior campaign director at Color Of Change. \"We need privacy legislation that holds powerful corporations accountable for their impacts. Burdening our communities with the need to discern how complex terms of service and algorithms could harm us will only serve to reinforce discriminatory corporate practices. The privacy protection and digital rights principles released today create an important baseline for proactive data protections for our communities.\"</p><p>\"For years now, Big Tech has used our sensitive information as a cash cow,\" said Josh Golin, executive director of Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. \"Each innovation - whether it's talking home assistants, new social media tools or software for schools - is designed to spy on families and children. We desperately need both 21st century legislation and a new federal agency with broad enforcement powers to ensure that children have a chance to grow up without their every move, keystroke, swipe and utterance tracked and monetized.\"</p><p>The United States is woefully behind other nations worldwide in providing these modern data protections for its consumers, instead relying solely on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to safeguard consumers and promote competition. But corporations understand that the FTC lacks rulemaking authority and that the agency often fails to enforce rules it has established.</p><p>\"The FTC has failed to act,\" said Caitriona Fitzgerald, policy director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"The U.S. needs a dedicated data protection agency.\"</p><p>Alternately, many democratic nations like Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Ireland and Japan already have dedicated data protection agencies with independent authority and enforcement capabilities.</p><p>Groups that have signed on to the framework include Berkeley Media Studies Group, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, Center for Digital Democracy, Center for Media Justice, Color of Change, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Defending Rights &amp;#38;

Bill Reinsch: I'm Bill. Scott and Bill: And we're the Trade Guys. Andrew Schwartz: You're listening to The Trade Guys, a podcast produced by CSIS where we talk about trade in terms that everyone can understand. I'm H. Andrew Schwartz, and I'm here with Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch, the CSIS Trade Guys. </p><p>In this episode, we're going to talk the topsy-turvy situation with China, what's going on this week with the markets, with the currency manipulation accusation. What is going on with the U.S. and China? Plus, we welcome a special in-house guest. Jon Hillman is a senior fellow with the CSIS Simon Chair. Jon also directs the Reconnecting Asia Project at CSIS, which tracks new roads, railways, ports, and other infrastructure across Eurasia and China's Belt and Road Initiative. We'll discuss what the Belt and Road Initiative is, how it might be affecting global trade, and what the initiative says about China's economic vision. You'll hear all that and more on this episode of The Trade Guys. Andrew Schwartz: And we're off. This week, gentlemen, was a little insane with what's going on with China. We had a big back and forth with the Chinese, they're currency manipulators according to the Trump administration and the market had a precipitous fall. Today though, it's back up as we speak at 3:30 on, what are we, Tuesday, 3:30 on Tuesday, it's back up 277 points and climbing. What's going on, Trade Guys? Tell us your wisdom. Scott Miller: Just as a starting point, it looks to me like the president is frustrated. Andrew Schwartz: Yeah, he's frustrated. Scott Miller: Negotiations aren't going as he anticipated and so, he's taking action. Actually, what it looks like is a sort of classic pressure or leverage move on his part. I think there's some disappointment involved. The currency manipulation charge is a little odd, mostly because it seems to have been a relatively short-term effect. Andrew Schwartz: Well they think we're currency manipulators too, don't they? Bill Reinsch: We're about to be, I think. Scott Miller: We may be. It's a little harder for us to actually move it, but the Treasury Department does have criteria, they do evaluate all currencies every six months by statute, and China didn't meet the criteria for currency manipulated at the last regular evaluation, but it does now and being labeled a currency manipulator doesn't have any immediate action, I mean other than being called sort of you're a bad economy- Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. Scott Miller: ... or something like that. It's a messaging thing. At the same time, because the financial system is quite complicated, there's only so much that the Chinese can do in terms of lowering the value of the RMB without creating a lot of internal risks. For instance, if you're a Chinese company, you're buying and selling in RMB. If you have financing from a foreign bank, it's probably in a foreign currency. So, yesterday, if you're a Chinese entity selling and buying in RMB, which dropped precipitously, and you're repaying your loans in yen which went up precipitously, that's the recipe for default and is essentially the very thing, when it persisted, which caused the Asian financial crisis, or the start of the Asian financial crisis, in 1997. So this really can't go on too long and it looks like today that China began to defend the RMB, it didn't fall further and that, I think, calmed markets. Andrew Schwartz: Okay, so did they think they had us in a tough place? I don't really understand this, I have to tell you. It felt like we were at a disadvantage all of the sudden because we got tough with them, but is that not the case? Bill Reinsch: The charitable explanation and kind of my take on it is that this happens a lot when leaders or principals get together. They don't like to be confrontational with each other. They're confrontational when they're away from each other. Scott Miller: Yes. Bill Reinsch: But when they're in the same room together, they don't do that, and they talk past each other. And so they came out of Osaka announcing that they'd agreed without really understanding what the other guy was saying and it seemed to me that Trump clearly thought that the Chinese promised to buy more agricultural products and... Andrew Schwartz: That's what he wanted to hear. Bill Reinsch: That's what he wanted to hear, and he thinks that's what they said, and they haven't, at least as many or as much as he wants. It looks like Xi thought that Trump agreed there wouldn't be any new tariffs right away. Andrew Schwartz: Yep. Bill Reinsch: Because they were going to come back to the table, so Lighthizer and Mnuchin come back from Shanghai, report not a lot of progress. Trump loses it, announces the tariffs and announces that the Chinese are not buying enough agricultural products. So, from Trump's perspective, it's a breach of faith on the Chinese part. From Xi's standpoint, it's a breach of faith on the American part. And then, it's Trump doing what he... announcing the tariffs, which is a classic leverage move as you've said. Then I think what the Chinese have done is to say in effect, not too subtly, \"Hey, we got tools too.\" Andrew Schwartz: Right. Scott Miller: Yeah. Bill Reinsch: I mean, I don't think they... Nobody thinks they forced the RMB down. All they did was stop defending it, and it went down on its own accord- Scott Miller: Yes. That's right. Bill Reinsch: ... because those market forces are going to take it down because their economy's slowing down. Scott Miller: Sure. Bill Reinsch: So what they've done for the last year is prop it up, which is ironic because when you tell them not to manipulate their currency, you're... in fact, to the extent they've been manipulating their currency it's been to help us, not hurt us. And they stopped doing that, so it went down. There's a tool. They announced yesterday they're not going to buy anymore agricultural products. Another tool. Scott Miller: Yes. Bill Reinsch: I mean they're dropping hints all over the place. The Trump view was because we have a big deficit with them, we have more leverage. We buy all this stuff and they don't buy as much stuff, we could hurt them more than they could hurt us. I win. And what the Chinese are saying, \"No, it's more complicated than that. We've got a lot of other tools.\" Scott Miller: Yes, and while we may or may not have more leverage because of the size of the deficit, China definitely has more ability to withstand or tolerate irritation and pain. Just their politics are different. Andrew Schwartz: And their investors are not necessarily going to be able to call up their leader and say, \"Hey, I lost x millions of dollars if not billions today and I don't like it.\" Scott Miller: Yes. Now, yesterday was the worst day in equity markets for 2019. Andrew Schwartz: That's right. Scott Miller: And now every year has a worst day, it just happens, so- Bill Reinsch: But it's noteworthy just on that, that the market is lower now than it was in January 2018. Scott Miller: That, for me, is the key is this all started about January 2018 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at least, as a benchmark, is lower today than it was in January 2018. Andrew Schwartz: So all these gains we made are erased. Scott Miller: Well, the thing is that says the equity prices are equal despite a strong economy, despite strong corporate earnings, which says there's some uncertainty there. There's some questions about investment, so overall when you look over the period of 20 months- Andrew Schwartz: It's not that the gains we made there are erased, it's that there's uncertainty. Scott Miller: Yes. The markets have been basically flat for 18 months during the time of this controversy with China. Andrew Schwartz: So, if you're Trump and your claim to fame is you make good deals, you exert leverage, and you get results, maybe that's not the case here. Scott Miller: He's at a point of stalemate at the moment. Bill Reinsch: It's exactly what we said. It's an unusual... For me, it was an unexpected development. I had the great good luck to be in Canada while all this happened, so I didn't have to think about it too much, but I mean we've talked about this before. Eventually, he's going to figure out that he's not going to get what he wants, and then he has to decide whether to settle for less and call it victory or continue the war and keep on fighting. Scott Miller: Yes. Bill Reinsch: This, to me, is kind of an unexpected blip. He reacted, probably overreacted. I think they decided that they've had enough and needed to send some signals about what... their limitations to what they're going to put up with. What I hope does not happen is that, you know, the logical doubling down response for Trump is we're going to devalue the dollar, which is a lot easier said than done., and more pressure on the Fed to do that because the U.S. government... Not the Fed, the government doesn't have enough money to do that on its own, so the Fed would have to cooperate. The only way you can do that if you're the United States is if you line up all your allies- Scott Miller: Right. Bill Reinsch: ... to help you, which is what we did in the Plaza Accord in '85 or '86. But I can see Trump trying to muscle the Fed into doing this. At some point- Andrew Schwartz: Sounds like a lot of work. Bill Reinsch: Well, at some point we have to have an adult who says, \"This is stupid.\" You know, if you get into a cycle of competitive devaluations, the last time we did that was during the Depression and it did not have a happy ending. Scott Miller: Yeah, my sense is that it's going to be an interesting month because the tariff increases will take effect September 1, so there's some time for things to calm down here a little bit, and it could be that the president decides that we're going to live with this for a while and he's not going to try to escalate. Also, you know, I would just point out that when China says we're not buying American farm goods anymore, it's not like the Chinese or their livestock are going to stop eating, okay? They're going to buy some imported products likely from other economies, and there'll be some global demand for global exports, but it is a pretty direct message. I would agree with that. Andrew Schwartz: Politically, what's his game here? What's his endgame? Is it that he's going to play this out for a while, and then figure out a way to come in and save the day and take credit that he ultimately won? Is that the endgame? Bill Reinsch: You mean Trump? Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. Trump. Bill Reinsch: I think he has to play it out for a while, because in the end, it's going to be less than he wants, and he has to sell it as a victory. And the best time to do that is shortly before the election, so people won't know it's bad until after they voted. So, he has to string this out for a year. And, yeah, this is a way to do that. Just keep people guessing. Scott Miller: Which is roughly what we talked about a week ago- Andrew Schwartz: It is. Scott Miller: ... in the tweetstorm. Andrew Schwartz: Okay, but what I don't understand is, while he strings this out, maybe some Republicans have tolerance for that string of a game, but do investors and serious businesspeople have that kind of tolerance for that kind of game? Scott Miller: Look, the president's China policy is astonishingly popular in Washington. Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. Scott Miller: It is one of two things, in my view, there is actual bipartisan support for. The other thing is dealing with big tech. Where both Republicans, Democrats agree something has to be done. They don't agree on the something, but when it comes to U.S.-China economic policy, the president has a lot of support right at the moment, and I wouldn't expect that to change overnight. Andrew Schwartz: Okay, but what about the rich people that President Trump absolutely cares about. Rich guys in New York that are his peers, that call him on the phone and say, \"Hey, you know, we don't like this.\" Scott Miller: Well, look, Congress is out of town for five weeks, and, you know, summer is a time when interesting things happen, so we'll have to watch it. Andrew Schwartz: All right, well, we're going to have to watch it. As promised, though, we also have a very special guest with us here today: Jon Hillman, senior fellow at CSIS in the Simon Chair. He's also director of the Reconnecting Asia Project at CSIS. Now, for those of you who don't know about Reconnecting Asia, it is an amazing project and a website that analyzes China's Belt and Road, and it maps and analyzes all of China's new roads, and railways, and ports, and all the infrastructure that's emerging across the supercontinent that is known as Eurasia. Jon, welcome. Jon Hillman: Thanks for having me. Andrew Schwartz: We've got a lot to ask you. Let's start with Belt and Road 101. What is it, what are some of the examples of projects, and why is China doing it? Jon Hillman: So, I think we're still trying to figure out what it is, but this is Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy vision, and it's something he announced in 2013. It initially included an overland component, which is referred to as the \"Belt\", and a maritime component, which is confusingly referred to as the \"Road\", and- Bill Reinsch: Wouldn't it be the other way around? I mean... Jon Hillman: You would hope so, but this is what they went with. Well, there is a huge maritime focus to this. Andrew Schwartz: Okay. Jon Hillman: And so they've got ports- Andrew Schwartz: There's no good word for it. Jon Hillman: They've got that covered. I'm sure there are plenty of words for it- Andrew Schwartz: Okay. Jon Hillman: ... and in fact, this is actually good advice for them. I think they're, in a way, trying to rebrand the Belt and Road Initiative. Maybe not by changing the name, per se, but the brand has not done so well over the past few years since it's been announced. Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. \"Belt and Road\" sounds kind of harsh. Scott Miller: Yes. Andrew Schwartz: Sort of sounds like a failed sparkplug commercial, or something like that. Scott Miller: Yeah, or it sounds like the drills we use to do in two-a-day football practices in the summer. \"Okay, 20 belt and road,\" right? Andrew Schwartz: Yeah, yeah, there you go. 20 belt and road, got it. Bill Reinsch: I just think \"belt and suspenders\". Andrew Schwartz: Oh, yeah. \"Belt and suspenders\" is too much. You got to go with one or the other. Bill Reinsch: Yes, well, exactly. That's the point. Andrew Schwartz: So, who came up with Belt and Road? Why Belt and Road? Jon Hillman: So, this is... again, it's Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy vision, and it includes... it's a whole host of initiatives. So, it includes infrastructure, which is the component that we track very closely at the Reconnecting Asia Project. China's got seven of the world's ten largest construction firms. And so, they have these massive companies, a huge incentive to go build beyond their borders. So, this is allowing them to do that. Belt and Road, according to the policy documents, also is supposed to include trade agreements. There's supposed to be a network of trade agreements set up among Belt and Road countries. You know, there's a lot of bilateral deal-making going on. It's not like China's doing a multilateral deal under the Belt and Road. Andrew Schwartz: Well, Jon, you're a trade guy. I mean, as many who know you in the policy world know, you were a policy advisor at the Office of the USTR. What's the big trade component of Belt and Road? Jon Hillman: So, the physical infrastructure component of it actually involves selling goods to countries, often by providing the export financing for China to do that. When those links... if they are completed, that could also encourage trade as well. Facilitate trade. And then, Belt and Road, you know, includes a whole host of policy coordination, including things like improving customs arrangements to promote trade between countries. Scott Miller: Does China have what we'd call a \"model agreement\" of some sort? The model bilateral agreement that they try to strike? Or, is it improvised based on the partner? Jon Hillman: We have seen a few differences in the agreements that they negotiate, which are interesting. Not a lot of the agreements are public, and in fact, they're quite weak, if you were to compare them to something like a real trade agreement. Scott Miller: Sure. Jon Hillman: Often, at the bottom of these, there are MOUs, and they will literally say at the bottom, \"This is not a legally binding document.\" And, it's very aspirational, you know, \"we're going to promote connectivity over the following dimensions.\" Scott Miller: So, more of a press conference than a trade agreement. Jon Hillman: Yes. Very much so, yeah. Andrew Schwartz: So, Jon, what is China accomplishing so far with Belt and Road? Jon Hillman: So, I think in the early years of Belt and Road, which, by the way, this, according to Chinese officials, is supposed to be a multi-decade effort. So, we are still... By one count, we haven't even hit the implementation phase yet. In the early phase of this, there's a lot of political interest among other countries in participating in this. And, I think there's something really powerful about that, you know, China's offered a vision to provide infrastructure to any developing countries who urgently need infrastructure and don't have a lot of great alternatives. And so I think, you know, as we think about what the U.S. should be doing, it seems to me that offering some kind of positive alternative, not necessarily infrastructure, although we could do a little bit of that, but China's offered a very positive-oriented vision for the region that speaks to the needs of developing countries. So, there's something very attractive about that. We could talk about whether, you know, all of the promises that are being made are actually being followed, but there is something at least very attractive about the framing of it. Andrew Schwartz: Who are they making the promises to? The countries in Eurasia, that they're going to invest in them, and then they're not delivering? Is that the case? Jon Hillman: So, at the first Belt and Road forum, which was in May of 2017, in Beijing, there were about 30 or so heads of foreign states that showed up. So, I take that as a pretty significant sign of support for this. Andrew Schwartz: Sure. Jon Hillman: And then they had representatives from other countries and international organizations. Andrew Schwartz: When the big dog calls a meeting, you show up. Jon Hillman: Yeah. When Xi Jinping throws a Belt and Road party, everyone comes. Bill Reinsch: Yeah. Scott Miller: Yeah. Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. Scott Miller: You want to be there for the handshake and the photo. Andrew Schwartz: Yeah, for sure. Jon Hillman: And the MOU. They want that MOU. And, at the most recent forum, in April, I think the count was up to 39 heads of state. And so, even though this thing has really had some negative experiences in recent years, they got even more leaders to show up. They had people show up, you know, heads of state from Pakistan and Malaysia, who campaigned and basically, in some ways, against the Belt and Road. Took office. They're in office, they gave speeches essentially endorsing the Belt and Road at the recent forum. Scott Miller: Now, this is often portrayed in the media as a sort of a bet on land transport, on connecting the Asian continent via land routes, and land infrastructure. Now, last I checked, most world trade moves on water. The container ship is far and away the most efficient way to move goods, and building an infrastructure for what will ultimately be a less efficient transportation means doesn't strike me as a genius idea, but what else is going on here? Of course, is that portrayal correct? Andrew Schwartz: Well, and this is also... this is the new Silk Road. Scott Miller: Lots behind it. Jon Hillman: Right. So, that's a lot of the imagery, and I think a lot of the marketing around this, the parts that have been successful, they evoke the ancient Silk Road, and you think of camels, and caravans, and Marco Polo. Scott Miller: Marco Polo, yeah sure. Jon Hillman: And so, China has been increasing, you know, several types of connectivity with Europe going across land. Scott Miller: Now at one point it was the Silk Road, not the consumer electronics road. So, you only moved things that were light and valuable, because it was really expensive. Jon Hillman: So, I think the China-Europe rail services are a great example of this. About 15 years ago, there were almost no weekly reliable services, direct services, from China to Europe by rail. There's now over 50 cities in China, and over 50 cities in Europe, connected by these. However, heavily subsidized by the Chinese. Scott Miller: Yes. Jon Hillman: And, really, the business case, as you point out, is for those higher value items, like, you know, shipping computers and auto parts. Scott Miller: Yeah. They're doubling up on the coasts and moving on water. But there are a lot of big inland cities in China, and being able to connect them is quite an undertaking, so... Bill Reinsch: Say you're in Shanghai manufacturing something, is it advantageous, in terms of time and cost, to ship overland to Rotterdam, or is it cheaper and faster to go by boat? Jon Hillman: So, it's about half the time to go overland by rail, but it is more expensive. And that includes the subsidies from China, which, you know, maybe they continue indefinitely, because they like this as an advertising mechanism, but you know, if they eventually come off, I think the price goes up on that even further. Bill Reinsch: And it's more expensive because the per unit costs are greater, because you can't move as much cargo in a single train as you can on a container ship, I guess? Scott Miller: I mean, the most energy-efficient vehicle is the super large container ship, in terms of energy expended per mile moved per pound of goods. So, far and away, ocean shipping is more energy-efficient, therefore, more cost-efficient at the end of the day. It also requires less infrastructure because you don't have to build rails to move the boats. Bill Reinsch: No, but you do have to have special loading and unloading facilities at each port. Scott Miller: Yes, which rail operations have that as well, have terminals that are used for that. But overall, the reason people prefer shipping is now, particularly in the world of these super large container ships, it has efficiency advantages very difficult to overcome. Subsidies help, but they don't get it all the way there. Jon Hillman: And your shipping route with maritime shipping is more flexible too. Scott Miller: Right. Jon Hillman: You don't have to go, you know, back and forth between point A and point B. A huge challenge for these new rail services is that coming back from Europe, they're often empty, there are lots of empty rail cars. Scott Miller: Yeah. No, you have a substantial land mass and just like in the United States, efficient freight rail is a very important transportation service in the U.S. We benefited by the fact that U.S. freight rail is very efficient. So, China replicating that would be actually a useful thing for the interior, because it's a big country too. Andrew Schwartz: Jon, you mentioned that some of the promises haven't necessarily been delivered. I take it part of this isn't just building capacity to export and all that. It's also building relationships with these countries where China can have exerted influence and China can really lay the groundwork for dominating the region. How has that gone as a result of this plan? Jon Hillman: So I think you see that influence exerted even before projects are done. Countries will do things in order to attract the financing, attract deals. And so you even have a few examples in Central and Eastern Europe. Countries like Hungary have taken political positions that favor China and, you know, have weakened EU statements on human rights and other areas, in order to attract that financing. Bill Reinsch: What's the story in Italy? I seem to hear mixed reports but they signed something and now they're sort of saying, \"Maybe we didn't mean it quite that way.\" Is that right? Jon Hillman: So, Italy is an interesting case. I mean, it's the largest economy to sign an MOU for the Belt and Road so far. And, you know, when it was done, I think the U.S. took it as a slight, because we were advising them not to do that. But it is one of those documents that again, at the bottom it says, \"This is not a legally binding document.\" And, you know, it was signed when Xi Jinping visited Italy. I think the other thing that's interesting is he then went on to France. France has not signed a Belt and Road MOU, announced probably five- to six-fold more deals with China. Scott Miller: Yeah. Jon Hillman: So, signing up is not a precondition for doing business with China. Scott Miller: It used to be G7 members kind of cared about what we thought about them. I'm not so sure that's the case now. Bill Reinsch: You talked about how the U.S. had reacted. How has the U.S. handled this whole thing so far? Both Obama and Trump. Jon Hillman: In the Obama administration, this is even earlier days of Belt and Road, there was awareness of it. Again, I think an attempt to analyze and figure out what this thing was about. But at the time, you know, the U.S. also had its own positive economic vision for Asia, TPP, and so the U.S. didn't spend a lot of time criticizing Belt and Road because it had something positive to offer. Scott Miller: Now, we took a pass on the AIIB, right? The Asia Infrastructure- Bill Reinsch: Well, not just a pass, we tried to get everybody else to take a pass. Scott Miller: ... Yes, right. Andrew Schwartz: Well, and we were busy criticizing what was going on in the South China Sea. Which brings me to another question. I mean, are there concerns the Belt and Road projects are laying the groundwork for Chinese military bases, are those concerns valid? Jon Hillman: So, some of those concerns are valid. I think that all these infrastructure projects are dual use. You know, a port that works really well can be used for cargo ships, it can be used for naval vessels. And as a sort of analytical matter, it's often very difficult to separate those two things because lots of the characteristics that make a port good commercially, also give it some military utility. We see cases where a port is being developed near another port that already has excess capacity, and so that raises questions about whether the country actually needs another port. And then sometimes, I think people jump to the conclusion that if this project isn't economically viable, there must be some secret military purpose. That could be true, but there are also cases where there are interest groups that like to build things- Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. Jon Hillman: ... and there are leaders that like to announce projects, regardless if they serve some underlying military- Andrew Schwartz: We've got a lot of members of Congress that like to build things. Scott Miller: I've noticed that. Bill Reinsch: We got off the track here for a minute. You were talking about the Obama approach, what's the Trump approach? Jon Hillman: The Trump approach has been certainly more oppositional to Belt and Road. You know, a lot of the rhetoric that's used to describe what China is doing is predatory economics. You know, China's taking advantage of other countries. Bill Reinsch: Is it? Jon Hillman: In some cases, sure. I mean, I think a lot of these projects are negotiations and China's often the bigger, you know, more advantaged partner at the negotiating table. Often takes advantage of those situations. But there are things the U.S. can do to empower developing countries to be their own best advocates, and I also think, you know, there's a range of reactions that we see to the Belt and Road. There's India, which opposes it because it, you know, projects go through- Bill Reinsch: Because it's Chinese. Jon Hillman: ... Well, and some projects go through disputed Kashmir, which is, you know... that's a sovereignty issue for them. Japan is certainly not a Belt and Road booster. Very, you know... I think, has a pretty sober-eyed view of what this thing is and could be- Scott Miller: Sure. Jon Hillman: ... but they've taken a much more nuanced position on this and they've said, \"Look, the world needs infrastructure. Let's talk about the type of infrastructure it needs. And so, let's put some conditions around the types of projects we would support. Whether China builds them, whether we build them, whether someone else builds them.\" So I think there's probably room for a little more nuance in the U.S. position on this. Andrew Schwartz: How would there be a governing body that regulates what China would do across this region? Jon Hillman: So the G20 actually recently announced a set of quality infrastructure principles. Andrew Schwartz: Right. Jon Hillman: So that's been one forum in which these discussions have happened. It happened first in the G7 framework. Andrew Schwartz: Right, but those are principles, like how would this actually be enforced? Jon Hillman: Ultimately, recipient countries need to... Their response... They're sovereign countries, they need to decide how they want to handle this. They're- Andrew Schwartz: Right. Scott Miller: It comes down to the projects. And a lot of these projects are crazy. It doesn't matter who's building them, they shouldn't be built. And their infrastructure projects are rife with insane priorities, bridges to nowhere, you know, rail systems and subway systems that get half-built. I mean, it's notorious for that. Jon Hillman: Yeah- Scott Miller: So, I don't know how you avoid it. But- Jon Hillman: Yeah... I mean, even in the best business environments- Scott Miller: Yes. Jon Hillman: ... these projects are typically... cost more than expected, take longer than expected- Scott Miller: Too easy to get white elephants all- Jon Hillman: ... deliver fewer benefits than expected. Scott Miller: Right. Andrew Schwartz: So, in your view, do you think the United States should be trying to counter Belt and Road with its own infrastructure push in Asia? Jon Hillman: I think the best response to the Belt and Road is not even really a response to the Belt and Road per se. I think it's the U.S. pursuing its own interests, putting forward its own positive economic vision. I think trade needs to be a really important part of that. That's a U.S. strength. Andrew Schwartz: We love trade. Bill Reinsch: Indeed, we do. Jon Hillman: But I think it would be shortsighted and sort of reactionary for us to get focused on only infrastructure. I mean, that's China's game. It has the companies, it has the domestic political economy for certain types of infrastructure. You know, the U.S. does a lot of other things much better, providing services around a lot of economic activity. Andrew Schwartz: Yeah, we don't have seven of the largest construction companies in the world. Jon Hillman: Not anymore. Andrew Schwartz: No. And so, these seven construction companies are state owned, obviously. Jon Hillman: Yeah, and they receive generous subsidies from the Chinese government and the government will facilitate deals for them.

The panel discussed the move to 5G and fibre, trying to answer questions on the connectivity challenges. It also touched upon the impact of the Net Neutrality regulation on the 5G roll-out.  Mr Gungl explained that BEREC had a clear goal in 2018 \u2013 to find out, if there are any hurdles for a swift roll-out of 5G in Europe in the context of the Net Neutrality rules. </p><p>\u201cAccording to our findings, there is no evidence for it on table. We haven\u2019t seen any use case so far which wouldn\u2019t be possible under the existing rules. Therefore, we think that the current Net Neutrality framework is flexible enough for 5G,\u201d he confirmed.  At the panel session on \u201cDialogue: 2020 Vision - The next generation\u201d focusing on challenges and opportunities to be faced after the elections next year as well as new political objectives, pro-privacy initiatives and desired technology prowess, fast technological change and globalization, the Incoming BEREC Chair Mr Godfrey underlined the opportunity for Europe to become a leader in trust, saying that there is a lack of trust in big tech and a lack of trust in non-liberal democracies.  Chaired by the Financial Times (FT), and organised in association with European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association (ETNO), the Summit gathered together leading policymakers, regulators, industry executives and investors from Europe and beyond to discuss and debate progress towards harmonized technology media and telecoms rules, and Europe\u2019s role in an ever more connected world. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURUNN-RLPMN908494520181016</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURUNN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TH2-NNV1-DXCW-D2BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400456</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"295\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>European Union News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"660\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 16, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Informing Consumers about Smart Devices Act, introduced by Reps. Curtis, Moulton (D-MA), and Bilirakis (R-FL), requires the creation of reasonable disclosure guidelines for products that have audio or visual recording components that are not clearly obvious to a reasonable person, such as a kitchen or another household appliance.</p><p>\"This legislation balances protecting American consumers with continuing to foster innovation, and I am extremely pleased with this final bipartisan product we introduced today,\" said Curtis. \"By working with a broad range of stakeholders, this legislation will allow regulatory flexibility without hamstringing the technological pioneers who are developing smart technologies, while ensuring consumers are aware of the capabilities of items they are putting in their homes.\"</p><p>\"We should be allowed to make informed decisions about the electronic eavesdroppers we invite into our homes.

While some manufacturers have taken steps to more clearly label their products with listening devices, this legislation would make this information more obvious to consumers without overly burdensome requirements on producers of these devices.</p><p>Specifically, the bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to work alongside industry leaders to establish guidelines for properly disclosing the potential for their products to contain audio or visual recording capabilities. To ensure this does not become an overly burdensome labeling requirement, the legislation provides manufacturers the option of requesting customized guidance from the FTC that fits within their existing marketing or branding practices in addition to permitting these disclosures pre or post-sale of their products.</p><p>Text of the bill available [HERE <url normalizedValue=\"https://curtis.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Informing-Consumers-About-Small-Devices-Act.pdf\">https://curtis.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Informing-Consumers-About-Small-Devices-Act.pdf</url>].</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://curtis.house.gov/press-releases/curtis-moulton-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-protect-consumers-from-curious-smart-devices/\">https://curtis.house.gov/press-releases/curtis-moulton-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-protect-consumers-from-curious-smart-devices/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHM713010H6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BW-NFM1-DYVR-P1V3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 13, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

Given the limited time to act and the uncertain outlook, not much more could have been done.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what if banks could figure out a way to go even further to address a similar need in the future? What if they were able to put the customer first and address the entirety of the need - in this case, the missing paycheck - and then solve backward from there?</p><p>That solution might be quite a bit simpler, and quite a bit more powerful. It might be an email saying, \"You're not alone, and we've got your back,\" along with the regular deposit made to the account on payday - in the form of a loan from the bank. The bank would get repaid when the government reopened and repaid its workers.</p><p>That would be the essence of an active solution that addresses evolving customer needs - while also capturing hearts and minds, sowing goodwill and strengthening relationships. Such solutions can change the growth curve dramatically for banks, maybe even to the level of big tech.</p><p>Of course, there are many reasons why this didn't happen during the last shutdown. If technology, data or credit risk limitations didn't get in the way, a thicket of regulations and laws probably would have.</p><p>Despite these obstacles, some banks madecreative efforts. One bank allowed customers who were federal workers to cash in certificates of deposit early, giving them immediate access to money that had been tied up. Another small bank even created a $5 million pool from which to make interest-free loans to customers, earning the bank praise among personal finance experts.</p><p>The shutdown example provides a lens through which to view future products and services and ways to forge stronger bonds with customers. The most customer-centric banks of the future will focus on three essential concepts: function, experience and dynamism.</p><p>Functionally, our hypothetical federal-worker solution is built on the understanding that the risk of these specific customers for this specific need is very limited, with the loans essentially guaranteed by the government. As a result, the primary bank would be able to act like a primary bank, solving the big problem the customer had - a missing paycheck - in full.</p><p>Sure, there might be questions about who qualifies as a federal employee, who is working versus who is on furlough, and so on. But such challenges surely could be solved by big data and machine learning. In principle, this approach is like that used by student loan refinancing firms that have repriced a subset of clients that are less risky than others.</p><p>In terms of customer experience, our hypothetical example is simple, easy and delivered directly at the point of need. Rather than feeling confused, stressed, out of control or alone, customers would feel calm, empowered and part of a community of people going through the same difficulty, through no fault of their own.</p><p>This would all be possible because the banking solution would be dynamic. It would be constructed at inception based not on the blueprint of today's siloed products, but rather as a tool purpose-built to quickly solve whatever financial challenge life threw at the customer. If the problem wasn't something that had been anticipated, the institution would be capable of quickly adapting and bringing a new version to market before it was too late for the customer. Oliver Wyman's 2019 State of Financial Services report indicates that for most banks a new product launch takes at least three months, whereas startups can do it in a couple of weeks.</p><p>Thought experiments like these can help banks focus on what they should strive to do in the future. The federal shutdown is one small and short-lived example. Other customer problems are much larger and more enduring. For example, growing numbers of gig-economy workers struggle with income instability on a regular basis. Fully 40% of U.S. households can't cover a $400 emergency from their savings.</p><p>As banks invest in customer centricity, it's critical to examine where these dollars are going.

Given the limited time to act and the uncertain outlook, not much more could have been done.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what if banks could figure out a way to go even further to address a similar need in the future? What if they were able to put the customer first and address the entirety of the need - in this case, the missing paycheck - and then solve backward from there?</p><p>That solution might be quite a bit simpler, and quite a bit more powerful. It might be an email saying, \"You're not alone, and we've got your back,\" along with the regular deposit made to the account on payday - in the form of a loan from the bank. The bank would get repaid when the government reopened and repaid its workers.</p><p>That would be the essence of an active solution that addresses evolving customer needs - while also capturing hearts and minds, sowing goodwill and strengthening relationships. Such solutions can change the growth curve dramatically for banks, maybe even to the level of big tech.</p><p>Of course, there are many reasons why this didn't happen during the last shutdown. If technology, data or credit risk limitations didn't get in the way, a thicket of regulations and laws probably would have.</p><p>Despite these obstacles, some banks madecreative efforts. One bank allowed customers who were federal workers to cash in certificates of deposit early, giving them immediate access to money that had been tied up. Another small bank even created a $5 million pool from which to make interest-free loans to customers, earning the bank praise among personal finance experts.</p><p>The shutdown example provides a lens through which to view future products and services and ways to forge stronger bonds with customers. The most customer-centric banks of the future will focus on three essential concepts: function, experience and dynamism.</p><p>Functionally, our hypothetical federal-worker solution is built on the understanding that the risk of these specific customers for this specific need is very limited, with the loans essentially guaranteed by the government. As a result, the primary bank would be able to act like a primary bank, solving the big problem the customer had - a missing paycheck - in full.</p><p>Sure, there might be questions about who qualifies as a federal employee, who is working versus who is on furlough, and so on. But such challenges surely could be solved by big data and machine learning. In principle, this approach is like that used by student loan refinancing firms that have repriced a subset of clients that are less risky than others.</p><p>In terms of customer experience, our hypothetical example is simple, easy and delivered directly at the point of need. Rather than feeling confused, stressed, out of control or alone, customers would feel calm, empowered and part of a community of people going through the same difficulty, through no fault of their own.</p><p>This would all be possible because the banking solution would be dynamic. It would be constructed at inception based not on the blueprint of today's siloed products, but rather as a tool purpose-built to quickly solve whatever financial challenge life threw at the customer. If the problem wasn't something that had been anticipated, the institution would be capable of quickly adapting and bringing a new version to market before it was too late for the customer. Oliver Wyman's 2019 State of Financial Services report indicates that for most banks a new product launch takes at least three months, whereas startups can do it in a couple of weeks.</p><p>Thought experiments like these can help banks focus on what they should strive to do in the future. The federal shutdown is one small and short-lived example. Other customer problems are much larger and more enduring. For example, growing numbers of gig-economy workers struggle with income instability on a regular basis. Fully 40% of U.S. households can't cover a $400 emergency from their savings.</p><p>As banks invest in customer centricity, it's critical to examine where these dollars are going. How much of the budget is dedicated to making current products incrementally better - efforts that will almost certainly succeed but may not have enough impact to truly change customer lives or institutional growth curves when they do? And how much of the budget is going toward transformational solutions that will solve much bigger customer problems in much better ways - efforts that will be harder to land, but with the potential to be game changers if they do?</p><p>The challenges of developing this new breed of solutions are numerous, from technology and regulation to economics. But as many in the industry prepare for a possible wave of cost-cutting and consolidation, the opportunity, however difficult, is presenting itself. Banks that get it right have a chance to grow organically for years to come.</p><p>The changing financial needs of bank customers demand new solutions, and advancements in technology provide the ability to deliver them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARDPM-00000169-49ac-dd8a-adff-cbaf2b140000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARDPM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKK-6XC1-JCRW-51DD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Given the limited time to act and the uncertain outlook, not much more could have been done.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what if banks could figure out a way to go even further to address a similar need in the future? What if they were able to put the customer first and address the entirety of the need - in this case, the missing paycheck - and then solve backward from there?</p><p>That solution might be quite a bit simpler, and quite a bit more powerful. It might be an email saying, \"You're not alone, and we've got your back,\" along with the regular deposit made to the account on payday - in the form of a loan from the bank. The bank would get repaid when the government reopened and repaid its workers.</p><p>That would be the essence of an active solution that addresses evolving customer needs - while also capturing hearts and minds, sowing goodwill and strengthening relationships. Such solutions can change the growth curve dramatically for banks, maybe even to the level of big tech.</p><p>Of course, there are many reasons why this didn't happen during the last shutdown. If technology, data or credit risk limitations didn't get in the way, a thicket of regulations and laws probably would have.</p><p>Despite these obstacles, some banks madecreative efforts. One bank allowed customers who were federal workers to cash in certificates of deposit early, giving them immediate access to money that had been tied up. Another small bank even created a $5 million pool from which to make interest-free loans to customers, earning the bank praise among personal finance experts.</p><p>The shutdown example provides a lens through which to view future products and services and ways to forge stronger bonds with customers. The most customer-centric banks of the future will focus on three essential concepts: function, experience and dynamism.</p><p>Functionally, our hypothetical federal-worker solution is built on the understanding that the risk of these specific customers for this specific need is very limited, with the loans essentially guaranteed by the government. As a result, the primary bank would be able to act like a primary bank, solving the big problem the customer had - a missing paycheck - in full.</p><p>Sure, there might be questions about who qualifies as a federal employee, who is working versus who is on furlough, and so on. But such challenges surely could be solved by big data and machine learning. In principle, this approach is like that used by student loan refinancing firms that have repriced a subset of clients that are less risky than others.</p><p>In terms of customer experience, our hypothetical example is simple, easy and delivered directly at the point of need. Rather than feeling confused, stressed, out of control or alone, customers would feel calm, empowered and part of a community of people going through the same difficulty, through no fault of their own.</p><p>This would all be possible because the banking solution would be dynamic. It would be constructed at inception based not on the blueprint of today's siloed products, but rather as a tool purpose-built to quickly solve whatever financial challenge life threw at the customer. If the problem wasn't something that had been anticipated, the institution would be capable of quickly adapting and bringing a new version to market before it was too late for the customer. Oliver Wyman's 2019 State of Financial Services report indicates that for most banks a new product launch takes at least three months, whereas startups can do it in a couple of weeks.</p><p>Thought experiments like these can help banks focus on what they should strive to do in the future. The federal shutdown is one small and short-lived example. Other customer problems are much larger and more enduring. For example, growing numbers of gig-economy workers struggle with income instability on a regular basis. Fully 40% of U.S. households can't cover a $400 emergency from their savings.</p><p>As banks invest in customer centricity, it's critical to examine where these dollars are going. How much of the budget is dedicated to making current products incrementally better - efforts that will almost certainly succeed but may not have enough impact to truly change customer lives or institutional growth curves when they do? And how much of the budget is going toward transformational solutions that will solve much bigger customer problems in much better ways - efforts that will be harder to land, but with the potential to be game changers if they do?</p><p>The challenges of developing this new breed of solutions are numerous, from technology and regulation to economics. But as many in the industry prepare for a possible wave of cost-cutting and consolidation, the opportunity, however difficult, is presenting itself. Banks that get it right have a chance to grow organically for years to come.</p><p>The changing financial needs of bank customers demand new solutions, and advancements in technology provide the ability to deliver them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000169-4934-d311-a1ff-cd37f3380000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJR-FP31-F06X-W4WN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

The newly implemented Protection of Personal Information Act (PoPI Act) aims to govern how organisations collect, store and use personal information and while compliance and governance have traditionally fallen under the legal department's domain, this is changing. Marketing departments can no longer ignore their role in adhering to the requirements of the PoPI Act.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Privacy management is critical, not only as a compliance tool for legal and compliance practitioners but also as a tool for building trust with customers. As such marketers have to be involved in privacy programmes to establish trust and deliver the best user experience to meet customer expectations which include treating customers in a manner in which they feel respected and valued.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While customers are willing to disclose personal information and have this information used by an organisation, they want to know that the company has procedures in place to protect their individual privacy. According to Deloitte, data privacy is about more than keeping hackers at bay, it is also about assuring consumers that the trust they place in a brand is warranted.</p><p>What is privacy worth?</p><p>Customer privacy and its importance for business and profitability is gaining attention as consumers are increasingly aware that companies are collecting their data and do not know what it is being used for.</p><p>Brands with a privacy-first culture tend to be governed by ethics [report]</p><p>A new CMO report points to the growing need for customer trust to influence every corporate decision and customer engagement across every digital and physical channel. It calls for marketing, IT, legal and operations to adopt a privacy-first culture...</p><p>10 Dec 2019</p><p>Consumers are increasingly concerned about their privacy with the PWC Consumer Intelligence Series: Protect.Me citing that as many as 85% of consumers will not do business with a company if they have concerns about its security practices. Further, if companies have privacy scandals associated with them, it eliminates the potential brand from being considered during the selection process of the buyer's journey, thereby decreasing the chances of being chosen for purchase.</p><p>However, as many customers are not experts on data privacy, they expect the brands that they trust to put their privacy at the centre of all decisions they make. In other words, the trust that consumers place in brands trickles down to the privacy measures they believe the brand has in place to keep their data secure.</p><p>Trust and customer privacy go hand-in-hand and companies need to live by their brand promise and protect their customer's data if they are to meet customer expectations and establish a relationship of trust.</p><p>Marketers anticipate greater privacy regulation in 2020 [report]</p><p>Ahead of International Data Privacy Day, privacy-first marketing is the focus of the policy chapter of Warc's Marketer's Toolkit 2020...</p><p>27 Jan 2020</p><p>Customer experience builds trust</p><p>Although marketers have traditionally used customer data, gained either directly or via third party sources, to develop targeted campaigns, consumers needs have changed. While customers want personalised experiences and targeted campaigns this needs to be balanced with compliance and privacy requirements.</p><p>Transparency is critical to this process. Customers are more likely to give companies their data if they know that they are collecting it and what they will be using it for. This is supported by Deloitte's 2019 US Retail Privacy Survey, investing in building trust through consumer privacy can deliver a measurable return with 73% of consumers stating they are more likely to share data with companies that have privacy policies in place and advise how their data will be used.</p><p>In essence, the customer experiences develop trust and the data companies collect should add value to the consumer. Consumers want customer-centric user experiences that deliver on the brand promise while adhering to privacy policies. To achieve this the customer has to be central to the business strategy which includes the marketing and technology strategies that need to drive brand security.</p><p>Cracking the Privacy Paradox: How to future-proof trust in the fast-growing data economy</p><p>To leverage data and automated communications, marketers have to embrace responsible personalisation...</p><p>By JD Engelbrecht, Issued by Everlytic 8 Jul 2020</p><p>Implement privacy by design</p><p>Legal, marketing and IT departments need to work closely together to ensure that the proper privacy standards are adhered to, brand experiences delivered according to the brand promise and customer data is secure all times. As such marketing departments are becoming more reliant on IT departments to gather customer data and implement technology solutions to deliver on-brand experiences that adhere to brand security standards and maintain relationships of trust with customers.</p><p>Companies stand to benefit from using technologies that have been independently tested and align with European security standards to give customers and employees peace of mind that data is gathered and stored securely. Further solutions that have been designed with security upfront to include segmentation of risk, ensure that content is safeguarded and secure throughout the data storage and usage processes.</p><p>Consistency gives peace of mind</p><p>The increased focus on customer privacy means that marketing departments need to keep customers informed that they are collecting their data and how they are using it. They also need to ensure that they are engaging customers on their terms according to the data they have collected.</p><p>How the privacy debate will shift in 2020</p><p>Data privacy and protection are likely to be high on the agenda for 2020 in the wake of Facebook-Cambridge Analytica and other data scandals.

When companies pay attention to the smallest details in their branding, it gives customers peace of mind that they take their brand seriously and will have put thought into the brand security, privacy policy and strategy.</p><p>Trust is marketing's responsibility</p><p>Customer privacy can no longer fall solely in the domain of the legal department. Customer privacy has to move beyond checking compliance boxes to ensure that the company adheres to privacy regulations that have been stipulated by the government. Rather it is about focusing on the customer and prioritising trust.</p><p>To enhance customer experiences and build relationships of trust, marketing departments need to play an active role in establishing privacy or trust policies, implementing brand security measures and putting the customer at the centre of these strategies. Customers seek transparency and confirmation that companies will protect their data while balancing this with personalised customer experiences.</p><p>Overall marketing departments need to invest in privacy and take it seriously. From the newsletters companies send to pop-ups on websites and the technology solutions they implement to help deliver customer-centric experiences, customer privacy and brand security needs to be at the core.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Bizcommunity.

Those six join Citigroup and Stanford Federal Credit Union in offering the product at the beginning of 2021.</p><p>Through the partnership, BankMobile will be able to offer existing customers enhanced digital bank accounts through Google Pay. Customers who sign up for these accounts will be able to manage their accounts through Google Pay and have access to financial insights and budgeting tools to stay in control of their transactions.</p><p>The digital checking account will be built on top of BankMobile's existing banking infrastructure and the accounts will be FDIC-insured. Google will provide the front-end user experience.</p><p>BankMobile CEO Luvleen Sidhu said the partnership essentially fuses Google's expertise in building great user experiences and highly scaled and secure infrastructure with BankMobile's financial and regulatory expertise and its customer acquisition funnel in the higher education segment.</p><p>She said BankMobile has contracts with roughly 800 U.S. colleges and universities that use its technology platform to manage their student loan disbursement, as well as the account management and opening for the disbursements business for the students. She said being able to partner with one of the most prominent technology companies in the world will allow BankMobile to not only offer additional services to its existing clients but also add new customers.</p><p>In an interview Monday, Customers Bancorp Chief Operating Officer Sam Sidhu called the partnership a \"huge coup,\" noting that the real benefit will be having the deal serve as a proving ground for lining up more big tech partnerships for BankMobile.</p><p>\"We think this can snowball,\" he said. \"Success begets success.\"</p><p>Google is trying to reinvent the consumer banking experience by allowing financial institutions to connect to their customers' underlying bank accounts via Google Pay, with the goal being to provide consumers with an end-to-end view of their money to more efficiently budget and plan their spend. The customers of the various financial institution partners will keep their existing banking relationships while also receiving real-time financial management services based on spending patterns and goals.</p><p>\"Google is excited to partner with BankMobile in enabling a digital experience that is equitable for all and meets the evolving needs of a new generation of customers,\" said Felix Lin, vice president of Payments Ecosystems at Google, in a statement. \"We believe that we can use our technology expertise to benefit users, banks and the entire financial ecosystem.\"</p><p>Google is the second partnership that BankMobile has entered. In April 2019, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) officially <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2019/04/18/t-mobile-starts-marketing-its-no-fee-checking.html\">began to market</url> its no-fee, interest-earning, mobile checking account that it created with BankMobile. Called T-Mobile Money, the app provides the company's wireless customers with fee-free checking, bill payment, person-to-person payments, a checking account and debit card as well as biometric security with fingerprint and Face ID login, account alerts and debit card disabling.</p><p>Since T-Mobile began marketing the partnership, BankMobile's total deposits have increased from $456 million to $663 million. The subsidary turned a profit for the first time in the third quarter of 2019. It lost $1.2 million in the first half of 2020, but Customers indicated that it expects BankMobile to earn a profit for the full year.</p><p>Citing issues with the regulatory process and the pending T-Mobile partnership, Customers <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2018/12/17/univest-new-name-isbc-investors-bank-branch-close.html\">suspended plans</url> to spin off BankMobile to Clearwater, Florida-based Flagship Community Bank in October 2018.</p><p>The primary reason Customers wants to sell BankMobile, which it created in 2015, is that the bank was nearing and now has passed the $10 billion asset threshold that triggers tighter regulatory enforcement. Specifically, it would reduce the amount of money it could make from interchange fees due to the Durbin amendment of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.</p><p>The bank had exceeded the $10 billion threshold last year and was at $12 billion in the first quarter of this year before its $5 billion in Paycheck Protection Program loans increased that number to $18 billion in the second quarter. Sam Sidhu said once PPP loans are largely forgiven, he expects assets will shrink back to the $12 billion to $13 billion range, though he does hope to retain a good number of those small business customers.</p><p>On its second-quarter earnings call, Customers said it expects to complete the divestiture of BankMobile by the end of 2020.</p><p>\"There is a possibility that we could sell the technology or divest the technology company and then divest the deposits and loans or there is a possibility we could keep all the deposits and loans and simply have a partnership and divest the technology company,\" Customers CEO Jay Sidhu said on a call with analysts last week, noting that arrangement could increase the number of potential buyers because it doesn't need to be a bank.</p><p>Jay Sidhu is the father of Customers Bancorp's Sam Sidhu and BankMobile's Luvleen Sidhu.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

The podcast explores the crucial customs and border issues that are likely to be caused by protectionist laws and barriers that govern the movement of data, as well as tech related goods and services.The podcast will consider:The practical and realistic implications of these laws and the protectionist approachThe issues that this will create where the accelerated race to develop smart tech is concernedThe entire product development process - from mining and manufacturing to product development - and the individual concerns that protectionism creates for theseTranscriptAndrew Cave: I'm Andrew Cave, Business Writer with The Daily Telegraph and Forbes Magazine and I'm here today with two experts to talk about trade and protectionism. I'm here with Ursula Johnson, Director of customs and trade at law firm Gowling WLG and Sean Giles, Associate in the European Union Trade and Competition Team at the same firm.So this is an interesting time for trade being in the news, can you talk a bit about the general perspective with the Brexit talks and the focus on trade, has there ever been a time when trade and customs has been more in the news?</p><p>Ursula Johnston: No, I totally agree and thank you for that -it's an interesting open question. So I've been working in the customs and trade space for about 15 years and I've never seen customs and trade so high on the agenda, not only of governments but also businesses themselves as they struggle to come to terms with this sort of wholesale geopolitical change and move from a sort of free and open borders intolarge trading nations taking a much more protectionist outlook and looking to protect their domestic market. Now obviously that's very sharply felt in the UK, in the context of Brexit as we wait, today, for news and developments around whether Theresa May's proposal for a customs border either to be put between the UK and Europe, whether that will pass, business are really thinking about how can they move goods between the UK and the EU whilst maintaining frictionless trade.Andrew: That's very interesting. And Sean, what in terms of protectionism, how much of a threat is all this to trade as we know it?Sean Giles: Well I think you can see fromthe news agenda and the news headlines nowadaysthat there is a lot of talk about the US and China and the so called trade wall. We're just focussing on what this report calls the traditional protectionist measures, so that's tariffs and quotas that, there's no resource nationalism where you protect a certain resource within your country. But this report highlights a second run of nationalism and protectionism which is this digital protectionism which is a focus on the new oil that is data and the way countries are using legislation to prevent data from crossing borders which in the 21st century, in the digital age where companies are reliant on data ...and this is not just data companies but all companies that use data within their businesses. If you as a company cannot move your data from one country to another within your operations that makes it difficult for you to operate across borders.Andrew: And this is a really interesting area and it's one where Gowling WLG has just issued a report called Protectionism 2.0 Digital Forces Driving the New Protectionist Agenda. Ursula, how much at threat is the technology sector when you introduce protectionism into what's been relativetrade until now?Ursula: Yes, I mean I think the main impact if I look at it from a business perspective and commercial perspective is you know it tends to lead to a decreased consumer demand and potentially produce a surplus and this really makes for inefficient trade and it generally just increases prices in the market.So, why does that come into fruition? Well, it means tariff increases so that's where individual countries take the decision to increase the customs duty rate on importing material, that pushes up the priceto put a finished product into the market.When also you take into account that your natural resource material costs are higher, you also have a slight reduction potentially in market access for the producers so export subsidies will tend to depress world prices and that will damage our profits, investments and ultimately jobs as well, particularly for those perhaps in the lower income populous of developing countries. Those people really rely on a strong export market for their services and for their goods that they manufacture from their services, so protectionism ultimately can be a rather ineffective and costly means of protecting your domestic labour force. Tariffs also sort of tend to decrease the welfare population just through higher prices and a stricter consumer as well asconsumer costs so really the impact is quite wide ranging.Andrew: Thank you, and Sean from an EU perspective, how much of a threat is protectionism to tech companies in Europe? We hear mostly about the big tech companies in silicon valley but what about the European companies?Sean: I mean I thinkthe impact's probably global, it's probably spread equally, I wouldn't say European companies are necessarily more or less exposed than US companies. However, there is obviously a high degree of data protection generally within Europe and we've seen that recently with the introduction of GDPR, but I think we should draw a line between data protection and data protectionism and I think what our report's talking about is these countries that are traditionally seen as liberal countries when it comes to traditional measures such as tariffs, that impose legislation that restricts the free movement of intellectual property and of digital data. So Australia would be a good example where they're traditionally seen as quite liberal in terms of their tariffs but then if you look at the laws around data protection and data protectionism in particular you aren't allowed as a foreign company to export health data on Australian nationals for example, unless you have an Australian data centre, which is obviously a non-tariff barrier that can be quite an issue for any non-Australian company that the Australian company just will not fix.Andrew: So this is an example of unintended consequence is it, in terms of the privacy, GDPR and other privacy legislation and then the general EU talks which are about general trade, having all these unintended consequences on the tech sector?Sean: I don't know if it's necessarily unintended consequences, I think there are very good public reasons why you would want to have strong data protection laws. I think the data protectionism aspect that then prevents the movement of data is a separate issue, you know on legitimate grounds to prevent the movement of data when you want to protect your nationals, but when it comes to restricting the flow of intellectual property and the flow of ideas and the flow of communications in such a way that it impacts on a business's ability to trade that soon becomes not even necessary ulterior motive but perhaps there is no data protection motive there in the first place, it's purely motivated by protectionism rather than looking at business welfare.Andrew: So there's a bit of an interesting distinction between almost invisible technology, you know the data protection, IP issues and visible and very tangible technology which is affected by raw material suppliers and minerals and bits that are coming from all around the worldlithium and cobalt and all the other things which mobile phones and batteries need. Can you talk Sean a bit about the whole global product development process;is that going to come under threat as protectionism rises?Sean: I think it's definitely possible and I think that the key part at the moment what we're seeing in the context of Brexit and Trump is this move away from multilateralism which, you know, has traditionally been the dispute resolution mechanism between countries where they've sort of all seemingly agreed that actually we want to reduce barriers, we want to reduce tariffs, but since then, you know, since Trump's come into power and since the US particularly in the last 15 years, we've seen this sort of assertion of nationalism and we've seen this assertion of actually we need to protect our own, we need to put America first for example in the case of Trump and in the case of Brexit we see this move away from the rules based system which allows countries particularly within the EU, within the EU system to prevent one another from putting up trade barriers. Now if we look at a global picture we have the WTO Appellate Body and dispute resolution panels which are all appointed sort of, I consent that the WTO members which is most of the trading companies in this world and one issue that we're facing now is as countries turn away from this consent based system it makes it a lot more difficult at a geopolitical and macro level for tariffs to be reduced and for non-tariff barriers to be taken away and I think, I mean for businesses that's quite difficult unless they're at that table with their governments and they're able to influence policy changes.Andrew: And that's very interesting, so it's all getting a lot harder for companies and for their boards. Ursula what should boards do about this, how can boards position themselves to deal with this and other threat they have to think about.Ursula: Yesabsolutely, I think protectionism certainly since the first report that we published on this topic has certainly rocketed up the agenda obviously fuelled by Brexit concerns, also the so called trade wars between China and US. So if I was talking to a board about this what would I be trying to pinpoint as perhaps some active steps they can take to address the risks that this throws up? I think the first thing is to understand the market that you operate in, and understand you know what individual countries' approaches to protectionism, what does that mean in terms of your business's strategy around procurement, manufacturing and distribution. Do you for example want to look at your manufacturing footprint globally and to think about shifting where that occurs?I also think businesses will be looking at markets which offer very limited barriers to trade whether that be tariff or non-tariff barriers, so either direct costs or indirect costs as opportunities to sort of achieve savings as they look to put manufacturing strategy together. I also think businesses can conduct a supply chain audit so they look at the commercial effects of the increased protectionism so that could include, for example currency manipulation, a change in regulation or even a wholesale change in government and the sort of political environment of a particular market that they operate in.I also look, when I'm talking to companies around us about supply change audits andencourage them to look at the network or free trade agreements and look for opportunities again for reducing the costs base of sourcing and manufacturing.Thirdly and very importantly, protectionism is obviously driven at a political level and therefore businesses that want,to have a stake and have a say in how this influences and how this impacts their business need to think about engaging in discussion with government and being able to demonstrate what is the impact of a particular policy change, either just for them as a business or for the market and for the population as a whole, so therefore the board may want to think about options for login for example.I think lastly businesses, as the landscape bracket changesneed to keep agile, they need to make sure that they understand the long term consequences of making a particular investment commitment and really can they design an operating model that gives them flexibility to move operations globally and be able to react in a way to geopolitical change that gives them a competitive advantage, and you know I think this has been very well summarised towards the end of the report.Andrew: Thank you Ursula that's really interesting. So the report's called Protectionism 2.0 Digital Forces Driving the New Protectionist Agenda, this is a subject I'm sure we're going to be hearing about a lot more as the Brexit talks continue and this is an issue which isn't going to go away.Thank you Ursula and thank you Sean, very much.Ursula: Thank you Andrew.Read the original article on GowlingWLG.com[3]The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Yes, today Amazon is a behemoth, a supposed unbreakable monopoly, but back in 2000 it faced an uncertain future as an online startup going head-to-head with the \u201cbig boys\u201d of Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble.  </p><p><br/>At that time, according to Benzinga, \u201cAmazon had only 256 total employees and full-year revenue of only $15.75 million.\u201d Now, it has a market value of $783 billion, and it may be on its way to becoming the first trillion-dollar company. Or it may not. As my colleague Iain Murray wrote recently at FoxBusiness.com , \u201cgood ideas and innovation can still win out against Big Tech companies.\u201d  <br/>But thanks to government red tape enacted two years after Amazon went public, mom and pop shareholders likely won\u2019t be a part of the growth of the next Amazon. Ordinary investors savvy enough to invest in Amazon around the time it went public have grown wealthy with the company. As Fortune noted last year on Amazon\u2019s 20th anniversary, $5,000 invested in Amazon when it hit the markets would be worth at least $2.4 million today.  <br/>And this was not unusual for an IPO in Amazon\u2019s day and the years and decades before. As I said in my testimony last summer at a hearing held by the House Financial Services Committee: \u201cIn the early 1990s, 80 percent of companies launching IPOs\u2014including Starbucks and Cisco Systems\u2014raised less than $50 million each from their offerings. Entrepreneurs were able to get capital from the public to grow their firms, while average American shareholders could grow wealthy with the small and midsize companies in which they invested.\u201d  <br/>But all this changed dramatically after the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a law rammed through Congress after the failures of Enron and Worldcom that quadrupled auditing costs for many public companies. As a result, a few years after \u201cSarbox\u201d was enacted, 80 percent of firms went public with IPOs greater than $50 million, while IPOs greater than $1 billion have become a normal occurrence.  <br/>This means that ordinary investors\u2014as opposed to venture capitalists, angels, and other wealthy \u201caccredited investors\u201d the government allows to purchase shares in private companies\u2014are locked out of the early stage growth of the small companies that could become tomorrow\u2019s giants. Amazon turned out to be one of the last IPOs in which retail investors could get in on the company\u2019s early stages of growth and grow wealthy with it. But post-Sarbox and post-Dodd Frank, the red tape means most companies don\u2019t go public until they can raise billions on an IPO.  <br/>Facebook, for instance, waited to go public until it could launch an IPO of $16 billion, when it was already a behemoth. Even at its all-time high share price around $195, $5,000 invested in Facebook\u2019s IPO would be worth only a little more than $25,000. Nice change, but pocket money compared to the riches for those who bought and held shares in Amazon\u2019s IPO.  <br/>Fortunately, there is bipartisan legislation that has passed the U.S. House of Representatives that cuts red tape for smaller companies going public and allows some non-wealthy investors to join the ranks of the \u201caccredited.\u201d The Senate must pass, as part of the final banking regulatory relief bill or as separate pieces of legislation, the Fostering Innovation Act (H.R. 1645/ S. 2126) and the Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act (H.R. 1585).  <br/>Cutting the red tape that makes it so difficult for small and emerging growth companies to go public would give ordinary investors and entrepreneurs many more happy anniversaries to celebrate! </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN817127320180515</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SBC-TDB1-DXCW-D3GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"622\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 15, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002STY</classCode><className>BORDERS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001P56</classCode><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001O29</classCode><className>ENRON CREDITORS RECOVERY CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>CSCO (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

But it has been under pressure to improve its performance, cut costs and attract more business.\u00a0</p><p>In September,\u00a0Mr Neal published what he calls a \u201c <url normalizedValue=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/UVKLHu45wPvP2nBy04TLCw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRfotnxP0QvaHR0cHM6Ly9mdXR1cmVhdC5sbG95ZHMuY29tL2JsdWVwcmludC1vbmUvaG9tZS9XCGZpbnRpbWVzQgoAIPFUwF2CK_AEUhNuZWlsLm1heHdlbGxAZnQuY29tWAQAAAAA\"> Blueprint</url>\u201d detailing six ways he plans to turn Lloyd\u2019s around. They include new platforms to arrange insurance for both\u00a0complex and commoditised risks, and a more automated claims process. He hopes that, over time, these changes will help\u00a0 double \u00a0the amount of business done in the market from last year's \u00a336bn.</p><p>Although much of the more complex business at Lloyd's will still be negotiated face to face, the new platforms should help to process the policies more efficiently, helping Mr Neal in his goal to sharply cut down the 40p cost of every \u00a31 of premium sold at Lloyd's.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOverall, the (proposed) change is massive,\u201d said Greg Brown, partner at consultancy Oxbow Partners. \u201cAnd a lot of it is technology \u2014 only one of the six areas in the blueprint doesn\u2019t talk about building a platform for 2020. All of them are major large-scale platform builds or buys.\u201d</p><p>Mr Neal says it\u2019s easier to implement such major changes now than it would have been three or four years ago. \u201cThe advent of the cloud allows you to build in a step by step way with an open architecture,\u201d he said, referencing technology that allows companies to access computing power on demand rather than relying on their own servers.\u00a0</p><p>Mr Neal said\u00a0that in a \u201cmodern world\u201d there was no need to build everything from scratch, and companies can instead adapt what already exists.\u00a0</p><p>That is where the outside help comes in. As well as the giants of the tech world, Lloyd\u2019s has been approached by exchanges such as London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, and insurtech start-ups which all believe they can play a role in the marketplace's transformation. </p><p>Of the big tech companies, Mr Neal says: \u201cThey are platform companies, and we are a platform business as well. How much of what they have fits in with an insurance platform remains to be seen.\u201d</p><p>Technology experts say work on building or adapting the core systems is likely to go to experienced companies rather than start-ups.</p><p>Nevertheless, Mr Neal says\u00a0start-ups will have an important role to play in the future.

A guest contribution.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Von Nick Clegg</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Everybody agrees that the internet needs new rules - from those governing how people's private data is handled, or how the integrity of elections is preserved, to the mechanisms for allowing data to flow between companies and nation states or how harmful content is identified and taken down. These decisions will determine whether the norms and standards of the internet are created on a global level, preserving the open, accessible and universal internet of today, or whether individual countries will diverge further from each other, creating their own rules and systems, turning themselves into walled gardens and ending the universal global internet as we know it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But we in Europe and the West are not the only ones grappling with decisions about the future of the internet. As we speak, there is a fight for the soul of the internet already underway. In fact, another internet already exists. The Chinese internet - one based on very different values: state control; censorship; and surveillance. And some other countries, to greater or lesser degrees, are beginning to follow China's lead.</p><p>Europe may not have its own Silicon Valley, or be as advanced in large scale AI as China or the West Coast of the United States, but it is a thought leader when it comes to the future of the internet. GDPR was the first serious attempt to create a set of principles and rules around private data in the digital age. And those principles are at the heart of a vision for the internet that I believe is shared among all open societies: that it is accessible to all; transparent and accountable; that you control your own data; and that competition and innovation should be encouraged.Facebook wants to add its voice</p><p>In the US, the political debate is around whether big tech companies should be broken up. Here, in the EU, it is largely about how tech companies should be better regulated. In both cases, the fundamental question is the same: how can the power of large tech companies be held to account?</p><p>Facebook wants to add its voice to this debate in a constructive way. We are not resisting regulation - the opposite, in fact. Regulating the tech sector is a far more effective way to ensure that tech serves the needs of society than simply chopping successful companies into bits. We have not only long accepted the need for new regulation in a host of areas, we are impatient to get going.</p><p>It is now time we moved beyond words and towards action. A new EU Commission is in post, a new Parliament has been elected, and a great regulatory challenge lies before us. My message to European policymakers is: Everyone agrees the internet needs new rules. We want them, just as you do. So let's get to work.</p><p>One area where we should work together is data portability. The reason is simple: if we want a competitive, open internet where new services can compete with large platforms like Facebook, we have to enable to people to move their data from one service to a competing one.You're not giving us your data</p><p>It is a subject we have been working on with policymakers in Germany. Last year we held a series of round table discussions hosted by Stiftung Datenschutz and attended by government and industry representatives, privacy experts, civil society and data protection authorities, which resulted in a report that raised a number of questions and recommendations for how to move forward.</p><p>But it is not without its complexities. When you share on social media, you're not giving us your data, you're entrusting it to platforms like Facebook, which means we have a real responsibility to protect it; not to be reckless with it; not to share it with people you don't want us to. And we should only use it to fulfill our side of the bargain: to make your experience on Facebook engaging and rewarding, so that you see more of what interests you; hear more from the people you like to interact with the most; and when you see ads, that they are ads that are relevant to you.</p><p>But you can immediately see a tension: if the data we hold on one person is intrinsically linked with that of others, especially people's friends and family, and GDPR enshrines the principle of personal ownership of data, then how can we ensure people can move their shared data from one service to another without jeopardizing the privacy and safety of other people's data? In other words, how do we strike the right balance between rules governing the movement of data and the rules governing the privacy of data?Complete the digital single market</p><p>These tensions are real and the path to good regulation will be littered with complexities to overcome and dilemmas to resolve. As the EU limbers up to create new rules for the internet, decision makers have said that one of their main goals is for Europe to compete with the US and China in tech. So what will that take? While there's no secret recipe for success, the key ingredients seem to be top quality talent, a large domestic consumer market, deep and liquid capital markets, a climate of entrepreneurialism, top universities doing cutting edge research, and a culture of experimentation and innovation.</p><p>Above all, EU decision makers need to complete the digital single market. The greatest boost to European tech is not necessarily new regulation, but the creation of a genuinely borderless domestic market of tens of millions of affluent consumers. The biggest disadvantage for European tech companies compared to their Chinese and American competitors is the absence of a large-scale domestic market.</p><p>Much though I understand the political impulse for decision makers to decry the success of large US tech companies like Facebook, they should be under no illusion that cutting Silicon Valley giants down to size is not a recipe in itself for the success of European tech companies or the European economy.</p><p>As a report Facebook will be releasing shortly aims to demonstrate, a large proportion of European businesses use Facebook's apps as part of their day to day business. This is particularly true of small and medium sized businesses, who not only use Facebook to showcase their company and their products, but also as a trusted forum for communication with customers, a tool for analytics and insights and a source of cheap and efficient advertising, enabling them to reach new customers at home and abroad.Facebook's business model is not so mysterious</p><p>As a result, Facebook has become a vital part of Europe's business eco-system. Rather than being some extractive foreign company, making money off the backs of European consumers without giving anything back, the opposite is true: Europe is as big a factor in Facebook's success as Facebook's success is a factor in the growth of European companies and the European economy.</p><p>There's a growing trend in the European conversation that suggests 'Big Data' is in and of itself a bad thing, as if companies whose business model involves aggregating data on a large scale are inherently bad. You would expect me to disagree with that analysis - and I do. In the end, Facebook's business model is not so mysterious: we deliver relevant online ads to people based on the data they are prepared to share with us. This in turn allows us to offer the use of our apps for free. We also use data to ensure the experience on Facebook is as enjoyable and rewarding as possible as people connect with each other and express themselves in myriad different ways.</p><p>Of course, there is a wholly legitimate debate about how much data is held, for how long, where it comes from, how it is shared, and the controls that people have over the use of their own data. I strongly suspect that regulation in the coming years will have a significant impact on the way that data is held, aggregated and monetized.The global internet as we know it may cease to exist</p><p>But as those regulations evolve, EU decision makers will want to avoid damaging their own interests: there are countless growing European companies for which data, often aggregated at significant scale, is crucial to their future competitiveness. From German car manufacturers to French AI start ups, from traditional agri businesses to bio medical researchers, data is the elixir for their future success. Making it difficult for those companies to collect, share and monetize data at scale will hamper their ability to compete against Chinese and American companies in the future.</p><p>Yes, there must be stringent new measures to ensure that the privacy and safety of personal data is properly safeguarded - but the productive and innovative potential of data should be safeguarded too.</p><p>Above all else, the biggest risk to Europe's tech ambitions is the risk that, in a few years' time, the global internet as we know it may cease to exist. The fight for the soul of the internet is real. As others look to aspects of the Chinese model with admiration, it is more important than ever that policymakers in Europe understand that time is running out to preserve the open, accessible, global internet that has been built on so many of those cherished values that we share.</p><p>It's time for the shouting to end and the hard work of creating the new rules of the internet to begin.</p><p>But I'm not fatalistic. Time and again, Europe has demonstrated that it is a pioneer in this space. Just as GDPR has exercised great influence over the privacy debate in countries the world over, I believe that smart regulation born on this continent - and based on European values - can be a blueprint for a future internet that minimises the harms while protecting the best of the global, accessible internet we believe in.</p><p>Nick Clegg is Facebook's Vice-President for Global Affairs and Communications.</p><p>FAZ.NET</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FAZNET-6586463</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FAZNET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y19-5KV1-DXN2-R08C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">466502</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1616\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Alle Rechte Vorbehalten</copyright><publicationName>FAZ.Net</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13436\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>Sonntag 19.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s the promise of a digital revolution felt like the start of a potential golden age, Tim Wu says in this admirably concise and punchy account of \"how corporate giants came to rule the world\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Useful start-ups appeared; new services and portals selling everything sprouted. The possibilities opened up by this new technology seemed boundless. Tiny blogs even outstripped established media outfits. \"Everything,\" says Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School, \"was fast and chaotic, no position was lasting.\" The internet was a perpetual motion machine of competition and creative destruction.</p><p>For a while this worked, as the experience of AOL seemed to prove. It looked likely to be a defining presence in cyberspace, yet within a few years it was a joke, smashed to bits by newer, hungrier, more innovative rivals such as Google.</p><p>The revolution then went awry, as revolutions often do. Now we have monstrously large tech conglomerates under the command of a small, self-satisfied new elite based in Silicon Valley. Google has more than 80 per cent of the market share for internet search. In the US, Amazon accounted for 37 per cent of all ecommerce last year and lockdown has only strengthened its dominant position. When companies such as Facebook felt threatened by competitors such as Instagram or Snapchat, they behaved like old-fashioned monopolists, gobbling up rivals or cloning their services.</p><p>Big tech and other corporate giants get away with it, Wu says, because politicians and regulators lost sight of a vital lesson: that monopolies need to be broken up. In the late 19th century and early 20th century lawyers, politicians and officials combined to \"trust bust\" overly large and anti-competitive oil, steel and railroad companies under the banner of consumer choice. However, the anti-monopoly movement was derailed, Wu says, in the 1980s, when \"neoliberalism\" took over.</p><p>I am sympathetic to much of the argument laid out in The Curse of Bigness - as a journalist whose industry is being \"creatively disrupted\", and as a free marketeer who believes in fair competition. Monopolies and cartels are, as Adam Smith explained, conspiracies against the consumer and the citizen. But Wu puts too much reliance on the lazy term \"neoliberal\", a simplistic codeword for supposedly self-interested advocates of free-market economics. This is unfair. Many vocal critics of corporate monopoly and power are free marketeers and capitalist libertarians.</p><p>Several of the examples, such as the beer industry, used to highlight the iniquities of capitalist concentration are questionable too. Fair enough, there are several international mega-brewers dominant at the bland, high-volume end of the market, but in Britain there has never been a bigger variety of beers available, with all manner of independents popping up in recent years. My two favourite Spanish lagers are produced by independent family firms in Spain and imported by British brewers.</p><p>Wu concludes with a crisp mini manifesto, centred on justified calls to break up Facebook, to challenge concentrations of power. We will need tougher rules on mergers, and breaking up big tech is the way, longer term, to ensure healthy competition. That leads to the other big problem here. The Curse of Bigness was written before the damned virus.</p><p>In Britain we are slowly emerging from a Covid crisis in which government has wielded the most extraordinary power over us, confining the population and shutting down the economy. After that experience, any claim that the source of our problems is a weak state, in need of yet more power to check and harry bombedout business, is not going to sound credible.</p><p>The Curse of Bigness How Corporate Giants Came to Rule the World by Tim Wu Atlantic, 183pp;

Therefore, it can contain the offensive cyber technologies and provide the US the ability to control them.</p><p>One has to acknowledge that most of the cyber technologies are coming from American companies or companies that were funded by US money. That allows the US to use ITAR to control the export of those technologies.</p><p>The use of ITAR opens more possibilities in this context. For example, the US can decide that every code written on a CPU of Intel or AMD [US companies] is subject to ITAR. Equally, it can apply to any electronic product that is funded by US money or developed in the US.</p><p>If the US goes this way, others will follow. China is another country bothered with cyber defense. It is also a significant producer of electronics. That means that the Chinese government can apply a regulation like ITAR. Besides the US and China, this is true for any \"ITAR-Free\" country.</p><p>To summarize, cyber technologies regulation is a must.

We'll talk live with Dr. David Shulkin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump goes after Amazon again, and pushed his public-private partnership to fix America's crumbling infrastructure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And is your child suffering from the high-tech disorder of too much screen time? Our \"Kids and Culture\" series continues. This is SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, I'm Bret Baier. Just-fired Veterans Affairs Secretary, David Shulkin, is not going quietly tonight. The latest Trump administration to be shown the door is going public with his many grievances. We'll talk with him live in just a moment.</p><p>But first, Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon on Shulkin's parting shots against the Washington political culture.</p><p>Good evening, Lucas.</p><p>LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX CORRESPONDENT: Bret, President Trump used an event in Ohio today to defend the firing of his Veterans Affairs secretary, Dr. David Shulkin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I wasn't happy with the speed with which our veterans were taken care of. We made changes because we want them taken care of. We want them to have choice so that they can run to a private doctor.</p><p>TOMLINSON (voice-over): Shulkin wasn't too happy about getting axed, and took out his frustrations in a blistering op-ed this morning.</p><p>Saying, quote, \"Washington has turned so toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important work that our veterans need.\" The former secretary blamed critics for making false accusations against him. \"They saw me as an obstacle to privatization.\"</p><p>Calls for the Obama holdover's removal boiled over following an ethics scandal, but Shulkin was quick to point out his successes: expanding access to health care, reducing wait times and working closer with the private sector.</p><p>Shulkin says the percentage of veterans who regained trust in the V.A. has risen from 46 percent four years ago to 70 percent today. Still, he struggled to win over Congress and even vets.</p><p>SEN. JERRY MORAN (R), KAN.: You led me to believe that you and I were on the same page. Our inability to reach an agreement is in significant part related to your ability to speak out of both sides of your mouth, double- talk.</p><p>TOMLINSON (voice-over): Sarah Verardo's (ph) husband has had more than 100 surgeries since being wounded in Afghanistan. She says she's ready for change.</p><p>SARAH VERARDO (ph): We need a secretary in there who is empowering and enacting the president's plan. It's a system that needs massive and total overhaul. It's a stain on our nation, and we -- we owe these heroes so much more.</p><p>TOMLINSON (voice-over): President Trump's nominee to replace Shulkin, Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson.</p><p>ADM. RONNY JACKSON, NOMINEE, U.S. VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY: Some people have, you know, just great genes (ph).</p><p>TOMLINSON (voice-over): The White House physician, best known as the doctor who delivered the briefing on President Trump's physical, is already coming under fire for his credentials.</p><p>Some question whether the Navy doctor can successfully lead the federal government's second-largest department. The oldest war veterans organization saying, quote, \"Doctor JacksonOs bio does not reflect any experience working with the V.A. or with veterans, or managing any organization of this size.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOMLINSON: On Monday, Acting V.A. Secretary Robert Wilkie takes over on an interim basis. It could be months before Jackson is confirmed -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Lucas, thank you.</p><p>Let's hear directly, now, from Dr. Shulkin. He joins us.</p><p>Mr. Secretary, thanks for being here.</p><p>DR. DAVID SHULKIN, FORMER U.S. VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY: Glad to be here, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: So let's start with this. Why do you think you were fired?</p><p>SHULKIN: Well, every cabinet member serves at the pleasure of the president, and it's the president's prerogative to have a team around him that he thinks is doing the job. I think we heard today, from the president, that he wasn't happy with the pace.</p><p>And, you know, I agree with the president. This is an organization that needs to change. It needs to do better at its job, and we all want to do it faster and better because it's so important to the country. And I -- I think the president has the right to have the secretary that he wants with him.</p><p>BAIER: You said the administration wants to privatize the V.A. Have you ever seen -- we -- we haven't seen evidence of, as far as White House policy directives sent to Congress saying that, is there any direct communication with Congress that the administration wants to privatize the V.A.?</p><p>SHULKIN: No, Bret. I actually haven't said that. I'm -- I was part of the administration until yesterday. We are not trying to privatize the V.A. We are trying to improve and transform the V.A.</p><p>What I said in my editorial is, is that there are a number of political appointees within V.A. that are pushing to privatize much faster than I think is in the interest of veterans and is the safe way to care for our veterans.</p><p>And I've -- I've stood up for them because I was in Washington and I was working for the president on behalf of our veterans.</p><p>BAIER: Why did you feel the need to write the op-ed?</p><p>SHULKIN: Well, listen, I think it's important. I came to Washington from the private sector for one reason, to fix the V.A. I know this matters a lot to the president. And we as a country have a long way to go to get the V.A. in -- in proper shape.</p><p>But it would be a mistake to conclude that we do not need the V.A. and that we have to dismantle the V.A. We have to improve the V.A. while at the same time working with the private sector in an integrated way to meet the needs of our veterans.</p><p>BAIER: You know, we heard this sound bite in Lucas' piece from Senator Moran, questioning your dealings with that particular committee. Did -- did you have a credibility issue with Congress?</p><p>SHULKIN: Oh, I don't think so. You have to remember, I'm the only cabinet member that had 100 to zero vote. I've prided myself in working in a bipartisan way.</p><p>Senator Moran felt strongly about pushing to give veterans additional options that, frankly, his own senators, the committee, didn't agree with. He lost his amendment 14 to one. He was the only one voting against it. And he was frustrated by that.</p><p>And, by the way, he had some reasonable points there. So there are many things that he and I agreed upon. But in the end, he didn't like the position that I took, which was to do what I thought was the right thing for our veterans.</p><p>BAIER: About 11 months ago, I had you on SPECIAL REPORT. We were talking about the challenges. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Have things changed? Are you seeing change?</p><p>SHULKIN: We're in the intensive care unit. And we're monitoring things really closely, but I am optimistic that we're beginning to finally deal with the issues that have plagued the V.A. system for decades.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: So the president said today that he just wasn't happy, how fast or how -- how things were going. That they were going too slowly. What's your response to that, and what can be done to -- to change that pace?</p><p>SHULKIN: Well, I don't think the president should be happy with where we were. And as secretary, I wasn't happy with where we were. We have to figure out how to move this bureaucracy faster and be more responsive.</p><p>When you showed the Verardos, I know Michael and Sarah very well. And frankly, this was a system that failed them and we shouldn't be doing that. So -- so this is a system that needs to be pushed. Many of the bureaucratic elements need to be restructured. I've started that process. I hope that Dr. Jackson will continue that process because it needs to be done.</p><p>BAIER: You know, you had the inspector-general, obviously, come out with this scathing report about -- about your trip to Europe. We -- we've been over that and your response to that. Were there other I.G. investigations or audits that -- that were factoring into this whole thing?</p><p>SHULKIN: Well, you know, Washington is a town that throws up all sorts of allegations. There were allegations of additional reports, but there have been no other reports that have come out. And I've addressed that.</p><p>Everything that I did on this European trip was pre-approved by Ethics, was consistent with past policies at V.A. But when the inspector-general had concerns about it, I wrote a check and I paid back every penny of a single coach airfare. That was the total amount that -- that government funds were used for, and I paid that back.</p><p>So, look, I think I've addressed that. This was used in a political way to try to remove me. And, you know, this is Washington. I'm a big -- I'm a big boy. I understand that. I've said that it shouldn't be this hard to serve your country. And I don't think it should be. But thankfully, there are many people that are still trying to fix our systems like the V.A.</p><p>BAIER: So if you had a message for the incoming secretary, should he get confirmed, what would it be?</p><p>SHULKIN: I (ph) would (ph) take to -- you know, make sure that he is consistent with the president's agenda, to push really hard, always, to keep the veterans' interests at heart. To make sure that he's working closely with congress in a bipartisan way. V.A. cannot afford to be politicized.</p><p>And make sure that he's listening to the veteran groups because, frankly, that's why we're doing this. That's what a responsive organizations needs to be successful in doing, is listening to those that have served. So I will help Dr. Jackson in any way that he needs help because it's very important that we succeed at this mission.</p><p>BAIER: Mr. Secretary, thank you for your service. Not an easy interview on this day. We appreciate your time.</p><p>SHULKIN: Thank you, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: This is a FOX NEWS alert. The attorney general says there will be no second special counsel for now. Jeff Sessions is rejecting a Republican request for a special prosecutor to look into alleged bias at the Justice Department and the FBI.</p><p>But he is authorizing an investigation, and leaving the door open for more possible action later. Chief national correspondent Ed Henry is here with the breaking details.</p><p>Good evening, Ed.</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. This could be a big deal. Because what the attorney general is really saying is, he may not need a second special counsel just yet to find out whether FBI and Justice Department officials during the Obama years broke laws when they engaged in FISA abuse to spy on the Trump campaign because he already has a criminal prosecutor all over it.</p><p>Sessions revealing for the first time, he already has been quietly having U.S. attorney John Huber of Utah operating, of course, outside of the beltway, using his prosecutorial powers with a broad mandate to investigate misconduct that could extend beyond FISA abuse.</p><p>So former FBI officials James Comey, Andrew McCabe could be facing scrutiny for not just failing to tell the FISA judge that the anti-Trump dossier was paid for by the DNC and the Clinton campaign. This prosecutor could be looking at McCabe's leaking, his lying to investigators, plus those FBI text messages.</p><p>Sessions writing, quote, \"I am confident, Mr. Huber's review will include a full, complete and objective evaluation of these matters in a manner that is consistent with the law and the facts. I receive regular updates from Mr. Huber and upon the conclusion of his review, will receive his recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources or whether any matters merit the appointment of a special counsel.\"</p><p>Now, Sessions faced heat again last night when it was revealed, the Justice Department inspector-general was reviewing this, and critics said that -- that official there does not have prosecutorial powers.</p><p>Well, John Huber does. And remember, Sessions hinted this without naming Humer -- Huber in a recent interview with Shannon Bream. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: I have appointed a person outside of Washington, many years in the Department of Justice, to look at all the allegations that the House Judiciary Committee members sent to us, and we're conducting that investigation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY: Now Huber was first nominated by then-President Barack Obama, so if he brings criminal charges it will have credibility. Likewise, if he finds no criminal wrongdoing it will be noted, this was someone who was re- nominated by President Trump with the backing, we should note, of conservative Republican Utah senator, Mike Lee -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: All right. We'll follow this one, Ed. Thank you.</p><p>U.S. officials say there is no justification for Russia's retaliatory moves to expel 60 American diplomats and shutter the U.S. consulate in St. Petersburg.</p><p>Russia's foreign minister announced the action today. It's the Kremlin's response to punitive measures over its alleged involvement in the poisoning of a Russian -- a former Russian spy in England. Also today, we learned the deceased spy's daughter, who was also affected in that attack, is no longer in critical condition.</p><p>While not deceased, the other attack -- while we were probably active today -- you may have been on Amazon, who knows, this afternoon, for any number of items. President Trump was going hard after the online giant for what he says is behavior that is bad for America.</p><p>The president is also making a strong push for his infrastructure rejuvenization -- rejuvenation plan, which is \"necessary for America,\" he says. Correspondent Kevin Corke is at the White House tonight with that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Anything we can dream, you can build. You will create the new highways, the new dams and skyscrapers that will become lasting monuments to American strength and continued greatness.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Back on the road, and looking to get the White House back on message.</p><p>TRUMP: We're now finally putting America first. America first.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>CORKE (voice-over): President Trump traveled to Ohio today, to unveil his administration's infrastructure plan to use $200 billion in federal money to spur at least a trillion and a half in spending over a decade to repair or replace highways, bridges, ports and airports.</p><p>TRUMP: We'll transform our roads and bridges from a source of endless frustration into a source of absolutely incredible pride.</p><p>CORKE (voice-over): The appearance, his first in public in nearly a week, comes amid reports that, once again, he is prepared to take aim at a business behemoth: Amazon and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, who also owns the \"Washington Post,\" which the president has criticized for being unfair to his administration.</p><p>In fact, he's criticized Bezos and Amazon on Twitter more than a dozen times since late 2015, including today. This time, accusing the online retailer of paying little or no taxes, using the postal system as their delivery boy, and putting retailers out of business.</p><p>While Amazon does pay taxes -- about $412 million in 2016, according to SEC filings -- some municipalities complain the company doesn't collect enough local taxes or taxes on goods sold by third parties on its platform.</p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: This is really about policy. You have a huge company that's done amazing things, and Amazon sprang (ph) up in a very short amount of time. And, really, tax policy and other policy has to catch up to that so that way -- those who are competing with Amazon are on a level playing field.</p><p>CORKE (voice-over): The White House has declined to confirm if any new policies or actions are in the works. But the president has talked openly about the possibility of a change to Amazon's tax status through anti-trust rules, much to the dismay of some analysts.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FINANCIAL ANALYST: This is not standard oil, this is not the telephone company. They have about 5 percent of retail sales right now. That is hardly a monopoly at all.</p><p>CORKE (voice-over): Despite the president's tweet, the online retailer is thought by many to actually be helping to keep the postal service viable by driving up package delivery revenue at a time when first-class mail volume continues to drop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE: Bret, talking about the U.S. postal service, there, you may find this interesting. Its board of governors last had a member in December of 2016. No one's been replaced since that point. In fact, it now sits empty for the first time since its creation all the way back in 1970. More work to do for the Trump administration -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Kevin Corke, out (ph) on the North Lawn.</p><p>Kevin, thank you.</p><p>Stocks closed out a volatile week and month. On the positive side, the Dow gained 255 today. The S&amp;P 500 finished ahead 36. The NASDAQ picked up 114. What a big difference a day makes. Let's get some additional information tonight about tech stocks and the markets.</p><p>Deirdre Bolton of FOX BUSINESS NETWORK joins us, as she does, from New York.</p><p>Good evening, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX ANCHOR: Good evening, Bret. So investors bought some of the tech stocks that have fallen so much in the past few sessions: Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet, Google, Microsoft all closed higher.</p><p>Still a lot of long-term concerns about tech, though, with specific companies facing potential regulation. So Facebook, one example of that. It announced a few quick fixes today, presumably before Mark Zuckerberg testifies in front of Congress on April 10th.</p><p>So Facebook made its privacy controls easier to find (ph), easier to alter. It also cut off certain customer-targeting companies from the platform.</p><p>Tech companies face potential government challenges, investor pressure and public peer review. Apple CEO, Tim Cook, took a swipe at Facebook at a conference, saying, \"The best regulation is no regulation\" -- self- regulation -- \"however, I think we're way beyond that here.\" Facebook's stock did close higher today, but it is down about 10 percent for the month.</p><p>Apple, speaking of Tim Cook, faces more than a dozen class-action lawsuits. Consumer groups charge that it intentionally slowed older iPhones or failed to disclose power use changes with updated operating systems, so consumer groups say it was meant to encourage people to buy new, upgraded, more expensive phones.</p><p>President Trump put Amazon in the crosshairs again, in a response to a tweet. Analysts say Amazon has not broken any tax laws, and reports show that the U.S. postal service suffers from high labor costs and from paying into federal workers' pension and health care plans, not from delivering packages for Amazon.</p><p>Bigger picture? Tech has grown so far, so fast. It has an outsized influence on the stock market. And today is a really great example. So when tech rallied, overall markets rallied. But strategists say it is difficult to see what other groups of stocks will take over market leadership if tech falters -- Bret, back to you.</p><p>BAIER: Deirdre, thank you.</p><p>A California judge has ruled Starbucks and other coffee sellers must include cancer warnings on coffees sold in the state of California.</p><p>The judge says the companies have failed to show the threat from a chemical compound, produced in the coffee-roasting process, is insignificant. The coffee industry says the chemical is present -- present at harmless levels, and should be exempt from the law because it results naturally from the cooking process.</p><p>Up next, an emotional funeral for an African-American man shot by police who thought he had a gun. Plus, your kids and screen time: What do you need to know?</p><p>BAIER: A funeral was held today for an unarmed African-American man, shot by police who thought the cell phone in his hand was a gun. The March 18th incident has sparked days of unrest in Sacramento. Correspondent Claudia Cowan is live right now in the California capital.</p><p>Good evening, Claudia.</p><p>CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Well as they have all week, protestors with Black Lives Matter and other community groups have camped out here, at the Sacramento County district attorney's office.</p><p>They are demanding that prosecutors file criminal charges against the two officers involved in the fatal shooting of Stephon Clark. They also want to see sweeping changes in police departments across the country.</p><p>Clark, a 22-year-old father of two boys, was laid to rest today. His funeral drew hundreds of mourners as well as prominent Civil Rights activists. As he supported Clark's grieving brother, Reverend Al Sharpton gave the eulogy and called out the Trump administration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REV. AL SHARPTON: Yesterday, the president's press secretary said, \"This is a local matter.\" No, this is not a local matter. They've been killing young black men all over the country. And we are here to say that we're going to stand with Stephon Clark --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COWAN (voice-over): Video of the nighttime shooting has sparked controversy. Officers were chasing a robbery suspect, and thought Clark had a gun. It turned out to be a cell phone.</p><p>And then right after the shooting, officers were told to mute their body cameras. And demonstrators are demanding an explanation for why the audio was cut. Police will only say that is part of the ongoing investigation.</p><p>In the meantime, city leaders are hoping to resume what they're calling a community dialogue next week, so that residents can vent their anger and offer solutions. The meeting this past Tuesday night turned chaotic when Clark's brother Stevante highjacked the mike and jumped on the dais.</p><p>He has since apologized, and is asking the protestors not to interfere with tonight's Sacramento Kings basketball game. At two of the last three home games, police stood by while activists blocked the doors and the arena was locked down. The Kings organization is assuring ticketholders that they will have safe access to tonight's game.</p><p>A protest in support of police is now scheduled for this weekend, and those two officers involved in Stephon Clark's shooting remain on paid administrative leave -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Claudia Cowan, live in Sacramento.</p><p>Claudia, thank you.</p><p>Back in Washington, Defense Secretary James Mattis met today with incoming National Security Advisor John Bolton. The former U.N. ambassador will replace Lieutenant-General H.R. McMaster.</p><p>The Pentagon chief kept things light at the beginning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES MATTIS, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Good to finally meet you.</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: Absolutely.</p><p>MATTIS: I've heard that you're actually the devil incarnate, and I wanted to meet you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Heard you're the devil incarnate, some of Bolton's conservative views, obviously, have drawn the ire of the Left.</p><p>Up next, a major American city still has not recovered from a massive cyber-attack.</p><p>First, beyond our borders tonight, the families of 68 people killed in a fire at a Venezuelan police station jail are demanding information and answers tonight. The fast-moving blaze tore through the facility in Valencia, about 100 miles from the capital, Caracas. Venezuelan jails are overcrowded and inmates often go hungry, as the nation struggles through a massive economic crisis.</p><p>Italian police have arrested five people connected to the Tunisian terrorist responsible for the Berlin Christmas market truck attack in 2016. Anis Amri killed 12 people and died in a shootout with police four days later.</p><p>And former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is being ordered to stand trial on corruption and influence-peddling charges. It's one of several corruption investigations targeting Sarkozy. It is the second scheduled for trial. Sarkozy denied all wrongdoing.</p><p>Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: The city of Atlanta is still in recovery mode tonight, after a massive cyber-attack crippled many computers and systems over the past week. And the situation is still far from resolved.</p><p>Correspondent Jonathan Serrie shows us from Atlanta.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS, MAYOR OF ATLANTA: This is a marathon, not a sprint.</p><p>JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A week after a ransomware cyberattack paralyzed Atlanta's computer system, the city is still unable to process payments for water bills and traffic tickets. Municipal court hearings set for today are being rescheduled, and some city services are returning to pen and paper.</p><p>BOTTOMS: It was a sustainable model until we got computer systems. So it worked for many years. And for some of our younger employees, it will be a nice exercise in good penmanship.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SERRIE: But it's not a laughing matter. Atlanta officials haven't decided if they should pay the cyber criminals the $51,000 ransom to unlock their files or manually restore each desktop and laptop connected to the city's network which is quite a lengthy process.</p><p>ANDREW GREEN, KENNESAW STATE UNIVERSITY: They're in a no win situation. They're going to end up choosing what is the most -- the least painful of all bad solutions. There is no good solution to this. They're going to get criticized if they pay. They're going to get criticized if they don't pay.</p><p>SERRIE: Andrew Green, an information security lecturer with Kennesaw State University, says municipalities in general are vulnerable to cyberattack because they strive to provide 24/7 online services at minimal cost to taxpayers.</p><p>GREEN: They're expected to do all of this with a shoestring budget. And so this is a wake-up call potentially. Cities need to start looking at how seriously they're taking their own cyber security posture.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERRIE: Atlanta officials say they don't believe anyone's personal information was compromised and the cyberattack did not affect the city's 911 system or the world's busiest airport. But as a precaution, the airport has shut down its public wi-fi system and disabled the flight information feature on its website. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Jonathan, thank you.</p><p>Former Indiana governor and current president of Purdue University Mitch Daniels has some things to say about the use and abuse of technology and big data. He has just written an op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" titled \"Someone is Watching You\". He joins us tonight from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Governor, thanks for being here. Why write this op-ed?</p><p>MITCH DANIELS, (R) FORMER INDIANA GOVERNOR: It was something of a surprise to us, Bret, here how much we knew about our students, and we're beginning to discover ways we can use it to their benefit. We want to do that. Let them know things that would be -- that correlate with academic success and they're progressing better here at Purdue.</p><p>But at the same time, we can tell there could be misuses of that sort of data, and I wrote it just because I know there are institutions of all kinds who are now in possession of information in enormous quantities and we're all going to have some questions to ask about ourselves about making sure we do the right thing, not the wrong thing with it.</p><p>BAIER: That line between privacy and what you could use with that data, obviously, is something we deal with. In this op-ed, you say people serene in their assurance that they know what is best for others, have to stop and ask themselves on what authority they became the nudgers and great approvers. Many of us will have to stop and ask whether our good intentions are carrying us past boundaries are privacy and individual autonomy should still prevail.</p><p>I mean, that is in fact, not only on college campuses but what we're dealing with with these big tech companies and what they know about all of us.</p><p>DANIELS: And in government and in many other walks of life. There are many people, and it always, of course, is motivated by what they believe are good intentions who think they know what's best for others. And armed with these mountains of new information, they will be discovering patterns that they would like to encourage others to follow, that produce what in the nudger's eye is a good result.</p><p>So this is something I think to be careful about. There's somewhere, as I say, between helping a struggling student -- identifying a struggling student and connecting them with a tutor, and really shoving people into behaviors that somebody has decided are preferable. There's a line. And we ought to be debating it in individual institutions and collectively.</p><p>BAIER: I just want to get your thoughts about a couple of things. One is we're getting ready for this testimony up on Capitol Hill. Congress with the big tech companies, Facebook, Google, testifying before Congress. And there's really consideration about regulation. Where do you think that goes?</p><p>DANIELS: Well, he always got to regulate with great, great caution and thought. But this may be an area. There are certain, certainly antitrust and the suspicion of business is not without its foundation in American history. And we have set up various boundaries beyond which we don't think institutions should grow and sprawl. And it's hard not to notice the incredible concentration in that industry. It has economic consequences and now we know it has major societal consequence when's that much information is in that few hands.</p><p>BAIER: Two more things. One is you're historically a big deficit hawk. Somebody who is concerned about the deficit and debt for a long time. You talked about it. Just been through this whole omnibus spending issue. What are your thoughts on that and where the country is heading?</p><p>DANIELS: I'm very troubled. It shouldn't escape people's notice there was a massive amount of the discussion, debate, and there should have been about a tax bill that may over 10 years increase the deficit by $1 trillion. Not to be sneezed at, but when you're already at $20 trillion, it's only the percentage that it is.</p><p>Right on its heels, Congress happily and cheerfully passed a $2 trillion addition to spending. We finally found something people there can get together on and compromise on, but it was probably the wrong thing. And the looming debt that we have built is an economic menace, the biggest one to this country in the opinion of many of us. And to our future prosperity, it's also -- without question, a moral dubious thing to dump on the next generation, bills not for money that was borrowed and invested in their future but for many that their elders borrowed and spent on themselves. And the problem here, Bret, is I keep telling people, the can is getting heavier, and we're running out of road.</p><p>BAIER: And quickly, this weekend is the NCAA final four. Condoleezza Rice has been asked to head up a committee looking at the NCAA basketball and some of the problems they've been having. You've written about that as well. Your thoughts as we head into this weekend?</p><p>DANIELS: It's a little like the big data column. I'm all questions and very few answers. The one thing I know and think is very hard to argue with is the status quo in Division One basketball needs a lot of repair. We've seen corruption. We've seen the game, in essence, semi- professionalized, although the people, the young men who are creating all the value don't get paid for it. And something really needs to change.</p><p>I'm so glad that the NCAA has acted and commissioned a group led by someone like Condi Rice with her tremendous judgment and credibility. And there's some other good people on there. In the column, I threw out three ideas but they're probably the wrong ideas. I don't pretend to know the exact answer, but we need to reinstate the era, really, of genuine student athletes. And those who are really only attending college to pursue an athletic career and pretending to be students with the complicity of the institutions ought to be paid above the table in some sort of minor league, in my opinion.</p><p>Looking forward to a great tournament. There are four great teams there this weekend. All credit to them. But the system as a whole should not go on as it is much longer.</p><p>BAIER: Governor Daniels, we appreciate your time tonight.</p><p>DANIELS: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BAIER: When we come back, are your kids misbehaving because you let them spend too much time looking at a screen?</p><p>BAIER: Tonight, we continue our series on kids and culture with a look at how much is too much high-tech, and how it can be a very bad thing for your children. They even have a fancy name for it now. Correspondent Ellison Barber tells us what this is, what it means, and what can be done.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ELLISON BARBER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: All parents want what's best for their kids. They want them to be healthy, happy. But what if small thing --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just football and Minecraft.</p><p>BARBER: -- threaten that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's very worrisome because it's so part of our lives.</p><p>BARBER: Dana is a mom of three.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A 14-year-old, an 11-year-old and an eight-year-old.</p><p>BARBER: And they, like so many of us, enjoy technology, Especially her youngest.</p><p>If somebody took it away in the middle of the game, would you be a little bit mad? Or not really?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'd be a little bit mad because I'm like doing -- it's like really hard work and so it takes it away and you're almost finished with that thing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's happened before. He'll be in the middle of building something and I yank it away from him because I can't get his attention.</p><p>BARBER: What do you do when that happens?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't want to get into that.</p><p>BARBER: Dr. Victoria Dunckley says with a lot of children, their nervous systems are being overstimulated by electronics, and her research shows it leads to behavioral problems.</p><p>DR. VICTORIA DUNCKLEY, RESET YOUR CHILD'S BRAIN: The vivid colors and the rapid pace, all that is hard for the brain to process.</p><p>BARBER: It's a phenomenon she calls electronic screen time syndrome.</p><p>DUNCKLEY: Lot of kids become very irritable or they're tearful or some kids actually have full blown rages. Other kids are anxious. And a lot of kids will have trouble following directions.</p><p>BARBER: A 2010 study found that every day, eight to 18-year-olds spend an average of seven hours and 38 minutes using entertainment media. But some say technology isn't the issue. Parents can help their kids to use it in beneficial ways.</p><p>SARA DEWITT, PBS KIDS DIGITAL: They can help introduce kids to new things in the world, places they have never seen before. They can help them play with ideas in a way that it's harder to her do sometimes just like with a paper and pencil.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I used to have trouble reading. So I used to do this website. It helps you read like different books.</p><p>BARBER: Dunkley says the effects of too much screen time are sometimes misdiagnosed as behavioral and mental health disorders. If you're worried about your child, she recommends a detox.</p><p>DUNCKLEY: It allows the brain to get deep rest so the stress hormones normalize.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBER: And as kids become teens, the digital barrage only intensifies in the form of smartphones. According to Pew Research Center, 73 percent of American teens have a smartphone, 92 percent say they go online daily. Researchers say that percentage is fueled by smartphones. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Ellison, thank you. Last part of the series tomorrow. We can all use a little digital time-out every now and then.</p><p>The Vatican is disputing an interpretation of comments by Pope Francis that have the pontiff declaring there is no Hell. It says the story during this holy week in an Italian newspaper is a reconstruction that does not contain direct quotes from the Pope. The story purports to quote the pontiff as saying Hell does not exist and condemned souls just disappear. The writer has a history of interpretation conflicts with the Vatican.</p><p>Next up, infrastructure, the tech industry, and your privacy -- the panel joins me after a quick break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now, finally, putting America first. First, we'll invest in the American worker.</p><p>We will breathe new life into your very rundown highways, railways, and waterways. We'll transform our roads and bridges from a source of endless frustration into a source of absolutely incredible pride.</p><p>I've asked Republicans and Democrats in Congress to come together and deliver the biggest and boldest infrastructure plan in the last half century. The plan generates an unprecedented $1.5 trillion investment in American infrastructure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: The president in Ohio with this plan on infrastructure, kind of laying that out in a very campaign style speech for President Trump. The bullet points here, $200 billion in federal funding to spur, as he mentioned, $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investments, kind of a public/private partnership, $100 billion for incentives program for additional investments, states, localities, private sector, $50 billion rebuilding rural infrastructure, $20 billion promoting infrastructure projects, $20 billion expanding the financing programs, $10 billion in capital revolving fund to help reduce inefficient federal property leasing.</p><p>What about this? Let's bring in our panel. Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com, Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today,\" and Bill McGurn, Main Street columnist for the \"Wall Street Journal.\" Bill, realistic?</p><p>WILLIAM MCGURN, MAIN STREET, COLUMNIST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": It's a little realistic. Look, the problem isn't can we build this stuff? There's two problems. Who is going to pay for it? And can we get permission to build it from the regulatory process? So those are the areas I think where the president could have a little morning impact. We need a reform of how it's done.</p><p>In New York and New Jersey, for example, so much of this should have been done by the local and state governments. But because of the spending problems that they have, they don't have the money for it.</p><p>BAIER: Susan?</p><p>SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": I think there are some cities and states who see this as not a realistic prospect because it requires them to come up with so much of the money. There's traditionally been an 80/20 federal, state split. This puts it the other way around, the federal government putting 20 percent of the infrastructure spending.</p><p>Now, that's said, I think there is a bipartisan, across the country consensus that we need to have a bigger investment in infrastructure. But I'm not sure the president's plan is one that is politically feasible, and I think the prospects that it gets through Congress this year are pretty slim.</p><p>BAIER: Speaking of process, we just went through this omnibus, and I just talked to Governor Daniels about that. It doesn't seem like big legislative things are going to happen prior to the midterms. Do you agree with that, Katie?</p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, NEWS EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: Well, according to a White House senior official today, they're not looking for this to be a big infrastructure plan in terms of it being one big piece of legislation. They actually want to move this in parts. They want certain committees on Capitol Hill to take a look at the details and push them through individually. So I do think that there is a chance that some of these things can get past in bites and pieces rather than in a bigger piece of legislation.</p><p>But I want to go back quickly to the states issue. Yes, the states are going to have to take on a lot of responsibility here. But you can argue because of that, there will be more accountability in terms of the types of projects that they do and that they have to take a look at things they actually need rather than going back to the stimulus type package that we had with little accountability and all of the federal government money just getting dumped in for the sake of doing projects. States are going to have to take a look at what they actually need and make sure the money they are putting on the table and the money they're getting from the federal government is well spent to better their infrastructure in their states.</p><p>BAIER: Clearly, Bill, there is a process that is tough to go through if you're trying to do any big project in any state, that the hoops that you have to go through, that's what they're trying to affect.</p><p>MCGURN: Yes, but back to Katie's point, I think it's a good point. You know, if the federal government is going to pick up most of the tab, there's not a lot of incentive for states to be careful about the money being spent. In New York, of course, we have this issue with the Gateway project, the new tunnel and, you know, nine out of 10 people who would use that are people like me, local commuters. And so I would think, why should someone in Mississippi have to pay for that, or have to pay for the bulk of that?</p><p>So I think we need -- what would be nice is a lot of reform that creates incentives for states to focus on what they really need and start to pay for it themselves.</p><p>BAIER: Donald Trump, the president today, had one company in his sights. He tweeted out \"I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state and local governments, use our postal system as their delivery boy, causing tremendous loss to the U.S., and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business.\" Susan, it seems like he has Amazon, perhaps, in his sights.</p><p>PAGE: He does, and there may be a variety of reasons why. He's criticized Amazon before, and linked Jeff Bezos who owns Amazon with \"The Washington Post\" which he also owns. And that -- some people think that's part of his motivation for taking on Amazon.</p><p>It is true that Amazon has been disruptive for a lot of small businesses in communities, and that's a fair conversation to have. It is not accurate to say that Amazon does not collect sales tax, however. Since last April, April of 2017, so for the last year, Amazon has had a policy of collecting sales tax wherever there are communities -- states where sales tax is levied. So that's a criticism that used to be made against Amazon that I think is now a little out of date.</p><p>BAIER: Here's Steve Forbes asked about this kind of focusing in on one company, a big company, Amazon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN: Free markets will work in bringing that company down just as it does with any other company over time. I'm old enough to remember G.M. when that was the big, bad company, IBM when that was the big, bad company.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And Microsoft.</p><p>FORBES: Wal-Mart was going to take over the world. Now it's struggling. So let the free markets play out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Katie?</p><p>PAVLICH: Yes, I understand the president's willingness and urge to level the playing field certainly. But if he's going after Jeff Bezos and Amazon for personal reasons, then it's certainly an abuse of power. Look, states have taken this on themselves in terms of looking at the way that Amazon does third party sales and implemented their own types of sales tax. So I also believe that the free market will come into play here.</p><p>The other thing, too, is there is Supreme Court precedence for this going back to the 1990s when catalogs were selling goods from state to state and sales tax was not being paid in states that they were not actually located. And the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the catalog. Amazon is a little bit different and the Supreme Court will hear a case in April dealing with the tech side of that. But we have seen that this is not just an Amazon issue. There is some legal precedent here about the taxes and the way that they work when you're selling from a third party or from a different state.</p><p>BAIER: Lot of states and cities are courting Amazon for a big building somewhere. We'll see where that goes. Panel, as always, thank you.</p><p>When we come back, the lady doth protest, and so did her colleagues.</p><p>BAIER: Finally tonight, that's no way to treat a lady.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whatever it is. I can't remember what it is. Isn't that extraordinary?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson hit a nerve Tuesday when he addressed parliament member Emily Thornberry by her spouse's title rather than her preferred maiden name, then this happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's not lady something. We know what her name is. And it is inappropriate and frankly sexist to speak in those terms. And I'm not having it in this chamber. No matter how senior a member, that parlance is not legitimate. It will not be allowed.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Secretary Johnson did eventually apologize unreservedly for what he called his inadvertent sexism. Not having it in that chamber.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.

Thanks.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The outgoing Veterans' Affairs secretary blasts his Washington critics, who  he says cost him his job.  We'll talk live with Dr. David Shulkin.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> President Trump goes after Amazon again, and pushed his public-private  partnership to fix America's crumbling infrastructure. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And is your child suffering from the high-tech disorder of too much screen  time?  Our \"Kids and Culture\" series continues.  This is SPECIAL REPORT.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good evening, I'm Bret Baier.  Just-fired Veterans Affairs Secretary, David  Shulkin, is not going quietly tonight.  The latest Trump administration to  be shown the door is going public with his many grievances.  We'll talk  with him live in just a moment. </p><p> But first, Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon on Shulkin's parting shots  against the Washington political culture. </p><p> Good evening, Lucas. </p><p> LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Bret, President Trump used an event in  Ohio today to defend the firing of his Veterans Affairs secretary, Dr.  David Shulkin. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I wasn't happy with the  speed with which our veterans were taken care of.  We made changes because  we want them taken care of.  We want them to have choice so that they can  run to a private doctor.</p><p> TOMLINSON (voice-over):  Shulkin wasn't too happy about getting axed, and  took out his frustrations in a blistering op-ed this morning.  </p><p> Saying, quote, \"Washington has turned so toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and  subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important  work that our veterans need.\"  The former secretary blamed critics for  making false accusations against him.  \"They saw me as an obstacle to  privatization.\"  </p><p> Calls for the Obama holdover's removal boiled over following an ethics  scandal, but Shulkin was quick to point out his successes:  expanding  access to health care, reducing wait times and working closer with the  private sector. </p><p> Shulkin says the percentage of veterans who regained trust in the V.A. has  risen from 46 percent four years ago to 70 percent today.  Still, he  struggled to win over Congress and even vets. </p><p> SEN. JERRY MORAN (R), KAN.:  You led me to believe that you and I were on  the same page.  Our inability to reach an agreement is in significant part  related to your ability to speak out of both sides of your mouth, double- talk.  </p><p> TOMLINSON (voice-over):  Sarah Verardo's (ph) husband has had more than 100  surgeries since being wounded in Afghanistan.  She says she's ready for  change. </p><p> SARAH VERARDO (ph):  We need a secretary in there who is empowering and  enacting the president's plan.  It's a system that needs massive and total  overhaul.  It's a stain on our nation, and we -- we owe these heroes so  much more. </p><p> TOMLINSON (voice-over):  President Trump's nominee to replace Shulkin, Rear  Admiral Ronny Jackson. </p><p> ADM. RONNY JACKSON, NOMINEE, U.S. VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY:  Some people  have, you know, just great genes (ph). </p><p> TOMLINSON (voice-over):  The White House physician, best known as the  doctor who delivered the briefing on President Trump's physical, is already  coming under fire for his credentials. </p><p> Some question whether the Navy doctor can successfully lead the federal  government's second-largest department.  The oldest war veterans  organization saying, quote, \"Doctor JacksonOs bio does not reflect any  experience working with the V.A. or with veterans, or managing any  organization of this size.\"</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TOMLINSON:  On Monday, Acting V.A. Secretary Robert Wilkie takes over on an  interim basis.  It could be months before Jackson is confirmed -- Bret.</p><p> BAIER:  Lucas, thank you. </p><p> Let's hear directly, now, from Dr. Shulkin.  He joins us. </p><p> Mr. Secretary, thanks for being here. </p><p> DR. DAVID SHULKIN, FORMER U.S. VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY:  Glad to be  here, Bret. </p><p> BAIER:  So let's start with this.  Why do you think you were fired?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, every cabinet member serves at the pleasure of the  president, and it's the president's prerogative to have a team around him  that he thinks is doing the job.  I think we heard today, from the  president, that he wasn't happy with the pace.  </p><p> And, you know, I agree with the president.  This is an organization that  needs to change.  It needs to do better at its job, and we all want to do  it faster and better because it's so important to the country.  And I -- I  think the president has the right to have the secretary that he wants with  him. </p><p> BAIER:  You said the administration wants to privatize the V.A.  Have you  ever seen -- we -- we haven't seen evidence of, as far as White House  policy directives sent to Congress saying that, is there any direct  communication with Congress that the administration wants to privatize the  V.A.?</p><p> SHULKIN:  No, Bret.  I actually haven't said that.  I'm -- I was part of  the administration until yesterday.  We are not trying to privatize the  V.A.  We are trying to improve and transform the V.A.</p><p> What I said in my editorial is, is that there are a number of political  appointees within V.A. that are pushing to privatize much faster than I  think is in the interest of veterans and is the safe way to care for our  veterans. </p><p> And I've -- I've stood up for them because I was in Washington and I was  working for the president on behalf of our veterans.  </p><p> BAIER:  Why did you feel the need to write the op-ed?  </p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, listen, I think it's important.  I came to Washington from  the private sector for one reason, to fix the V.A.  I know this matters a  lot to the president.  And we as a country have a long way to go to get the  V.A. in -- in proper shape.  </p><p> But it would be a mistake to conclude that we do not need the V.A. and that  we have to dismantle the V.A.  We have to improve the V.A. while at the  same time working with the private sector in an integrated way to meet the  needs of our veterans.  </p><p> BAIER:  You know, we heard this sound bite in Lucas' piece from Senator  Moran, questioning your dealings with that particular committee.  Did --  did you have a credibility issue with Congress?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Oh, I don't think so.  You have to remember, I'm the only cabinet  member that had 100 to zero vote.  I've prided myself in working in a  bipartisan way.  </p><p> Senator Moran felt strongly about pushing to give veterans additional  options that, frankly, his own senators, the committee, didn't agree with.   He lost his amendment 14 to one.  He was the only one voting against it.   And he was frustrated by that. </p><p> And, by the way, he had some reasonable points there.  So there are many  things that he and I agreed upon.  But in the end, he didn't like the  position that I took, which was to do what I thought was the right thing  for our veterans. </p><p> BAIER:  About 11 months ago, I had you on SPECIAL REPORT.  We were talking  about the challenges.  Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Have things changed?  Are you seeing change? </p><p> SHULKIN:  We're in the intensive care unit.  And we're monitoring things  really closely, but I am optimistic that we're beginning to finally deal  with the issues that have plagued the V.A. system for decades.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  So the president said today that he just wasn't happy, how fast or  how -- how things were going.  That they were going too slowly.  What's  your response to that, and what can be done to -- to change that pace?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, I don't think the president should be happy with where we  were.  And as secretary, I wasn't happy with where we were.  We have to  figure out how to move this bureaucracy faster and be more responsive.  </p><p> When you showed the Verardos, I know Michael and Sarah very well.  And  frankly, this was a system that failed them and we shouldn't be doing that.   So -- so this is a system that needs to be pushed.  Many of the  bureaucratic elements need to be restructured.  I've started that process.   I hope that Dr. Jackson will continue that process because it needs to be  done.  </p><p> BAIER:  You know, you had the inspector-general, obviously, come out with  this scathing report about -- about your trip to Europe.  We -- we've been  over that and your response to that.  Were there other I.G. investigations  or audits that -- that were factoring into this whole thing?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, you know, Washington is a town that throws up all sorts of  allegations.  There were allegations of additional reports, but there have  been no other reports that have come out.  And I've addressed that. </p><p> Everything that I did on this European trip was pre-approved by Ethics, was  consistent with past policies at V.A.  But when the inspector-general had  concerns about it, I wrote a check and I paid back every penny of a single  coach airfare.  That was the total amount that -- that government funds  were used for, and I paid that back.</p><p> So, look, I think I've addressed that.  This was used in a political way to  try to remove me.  And, you know, this is Washington.  I'm a big -- I'm a  big boy.  I understand that.  I've said that it shouldn't be this hard to  serve your country.  And I don't think it should be.  But thankfully, there  are many people that are still trying to fix our systems like the V.A.</p><p> BAIER:  So if you had a message for the incoming secretary, should he get  confirmed, what would it be?</p><p> SHULKIN:  I (ph) would (ph) take to -- you know, make sure that he is  consistent with the president's agenda, to push really hard, always, to  keep the veterans' interests at heart.  To make sure that he's working  closely with congress in a bipartisan way.  V.A. cannot afford to be  politicized.</p><p> And make sure that he's listening to the veteran groups because, frankly,  that's why we're doing this.  That's what a responsive organizations needs  to be successful in doing, is listening to those that have served.  So I  will help Dr. Jackson in any way that he needs help because it's very  important that we succeed at this mission.  </p><p> BAIER:  Mr. Secretary, thank you for your service.  Not an easy interview  on this day.  We appreciate your time. </p><p> SHULKIN:  Thank you, Bret. </p><p> BAIER:  This is a FOX NEWS alert.  The attorney general says there will be  no second special counsel for now.  Jeff Sessions is rejecting a Republican  request for a special prosecutor to look into alleged bias at the Justice  Department and the FBI. </p><p> But he is authorizing an investigation, and leaving the door open for more  possible action later.  Chief national correspondent Ed Henry is here with  the breaking details. </p><p> Good evening, Ed. </p><p> ED HENRY, FOX CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.  This  could be a big deal.  Because what the attorney general is really saying  is, he may not need a second special counsel just yet to find out whether  FBI and Justice Department officials during the Obama years broke laws when  they engaged in FISA abuse to spy on the Trump campaign because he already  has a criminal prosecutor all over it. </p><p> Sessions revealing for the first time, he already has been quietly having  U.S. attorney John Huber of Utah operating, of course, outside of the  beltway, using his prosecutorial powers with a broad mandate to investigate  misconduct that could extend beyond FISA abuse. </p><p> So former FBI officials James Comey, Andrew McCabe could be facing scrutiny  for not just failing to tell the FISA judge that the anti-Trump dossier was  paid for by the DNC and the Clinton campaign.  This prosecutor could be  looking at McCabe's leaking, his lying to investigators, plus those FBI  text messages.</p><p> Sessions writing, quote, \"I am confident, Mr. Huber's review will include a  full, complete and objective evaluation of these matters in a manner that  is consistent with the law and the facts.  I receive regular updates from  Mr. Huber and upon the conclusion of his review, will receive his  recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation  should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require  further resources or whether any matters merit the appointment of a special  counsel.\"</p><p> Now, Sessions faced heat again last night when it was revealed, the Justice  Department inspector-general was reviewing this, and critics said that --  that official there does not have prosecutorial powers.  </p><p> Well, John Huber does.  And remember, Sessions hinted this without naming  Humer -- Huber in a recent interview with Shannon Bream.  Watch. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  I have appointed a person outside of  Washington, many years in the Department of Justice, to look at all the  allegations that the House Judiciary Committee members sent to us, and  we're conducting that investigation. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HENRY:  Now Huber was first nominated by then-President Barack Obama, so if  he brings criminal charges it will have credibility.  Likewise, if he finds  no criminal wrongdoing it will be noted, this was someone who was re- nominated by President Trump with the backing, we should note, of  conservative Republican Utah senator, Mike Lee -- Bret.</p><p> BAIER:  All right.  We'll follow this one, Ed.  Thank you.</p><p> U.S. officials say there is no justification for Russia's retaliatory moves  to expel 60 American diplomats and shutter the U.S. consulate in St.  Petersburg. </p><p> Russia's foreign minister announced the action today.  It's the Kremlin's  response to punitive measures over its alleged involvement in the poisoning  of a Russian -- a former Russian spy in England.  Also today, we learned  the deceased spy's daughter, who was also affected in that attack, is no  longer in critical condition. </p><p> While not deceased, the other attack -- while we were probably active today  -- you may have been on Amazon, who knows, this afternoon, for any number  of items.  President Trump was going hard after the online giant for what  he says is behavior that is bad for America. </p><p> The president is also making a strong push for his infrastructure  rejuvenization -- rejuvenation plan, which is \"necessary for America,\" he  says.  Correspondent Kevin Corke is at the White House tonight with that. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Anything we can dream, you  can build.  You will create the new highways, the new dams and skyscrapers  that will become lasting monuments to American strength and continued  greatness. </p><p> KEVIN CORKE, FOX WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Back on the road,  and looking to get the White House back on message.  </p><p> TRUMP:  We're now finally putting America first.  America first. </p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> CORKE (voice-over):  President Trump traveled to Ohio today, to unveil his  administration's infrastructure plan to use $200 billion in federal money  to spur at least a trillion and a half in spending over a decade to repair  or replace highways, bridges, ports and airports. </p><p> TRUMP:  We'll transform our roads and bridges from a source of endless  frustration into a source of absolutely incredible pride. </p><p> CORKE (voice-over):  The appearance, his first in public in nearly a week,  comes amid reports that, once again, he is prepared to take aim at a  business behemoth:  Amazon and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, who also owns the  \"Washington Post,\" which the president has criticized for being unfair to  his administration.</p><p> In fact, he's criticized Bezos and Amazon on Twitter more than a dozen  times since late 2015, including today.  This time, accusing the online  retailer of paying little or no taxes, using the postal system as their  delivery boy, and putting retailers out of business.  </p><p> While Amazon does pay taxes -- about $412 million in 2016, according to SEC  filings -- some municipalities complain the company doesn't collect enough  local taxes or taxes on goods sold by third parties on its platform. </p><p> RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  This is really  about policy.  You have a huge company that's done amazing things, and  Amazon sprang (ph) up in a very short amount of time.  And, really, tax  policy and other policy has to catch up to that so that way -- those who  are competing with Amazon are on a level playing field. </p><p> CORKE (voice-over):  The White House has declined to confirm if any new  policies or actions are in the works.  But the president has talked openly  about the possibility of a change to Amazon's tax status through anti-trust  rules, much to the dismay of some analysts. </p><p> JOHN LAYFIELD, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  This is not standard oil, this is not  the telephone company.  They have about 5 percent of retail sales right  now.  That is hardly a monopoly at all.</p><p> CORKE (voice-over):  Despite the president's tweet, the online retailer is  thought by many to actually be helping to keep the postal service viable by  driving up package delivery revenue at a time when first-class mail volume  continues to drop.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CORKE:  Bret, talking about the U.S. postal service, there, you may find  this interesting.  Its board of governors last had a member in December of  2016.  No one's been replaced since that point.  In fact, it now sits empty  for the first time since its creation all the way back in 1970.  More work  to do for the Trump administration -- Bret.</p><p> BAIER:  Kevin Corke, out (ph) on the North Lawn.  </p><p> Kevin, thank you. </p><p> Stocks closed out a volatile week and month.  On the positive side, the Dow  gained 255 today.  The S&amp;P 500 finished ahead 36.  The NASDAQ picked up  114.  What a big difference a day makes.  Let's get some additional  information tonight about tech stocks and the markets. </p><p> Deirdre Bolton of FOX BUSINESS NETWORK joins us, as she does, from New  York. </p><p> Good evening, Deirdre. </p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX ANCHOR:  Good evening, Bret.  So investors bought some  of the tech stocks that have fallen so much in the past few sessions:   Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet, Google, Microsoft all closed higher.  </p><p> Still a lot of long-term concerns about tech, though, with specific  companies facing potential regulation.  So Facebook, one example of that.   It announced a few quick fixes today, presumably before Mark Zuckerberg  testifies in front of Congress on April 10th. </p><p> So Facebook made its privacy controls easier to find (ph), easier to alter.   It also cut off certain customer-targeting companies from the platform. </p><p> Tech companies face potential government challenges, investor pressure and  public peer review.  Apple CEO, Tim Cook, took a swipe at Facebook at a  conference, saying, \"The best regulation is no regulation\" -- self- regulation -- \"however, I think we're way beyond that here.\"  Facebook's  stock did close higher today, but it is down about 10 percent for the  month.  </p><p>Apple, speaking of Tim Cook, faces more than a dozen class-action lawsuits.   Consumer groups charge that it intentionally slowed older iPhones or failed  to disclose power use changes with updated operating systems, so consumer  groups say it was meant to encourage people to buy new, upgraded, more  expensive phones. </p><p> President Trump put Amazon in the crosshairs again, in a response to a  tweet.  Analysts say Amazon has not broken any tax laws, and reports show  that the U.S. postal service suffers from high labor costs and from paying  into federal workers' pension and health care plans, not from delivering  packages for Amazon. </p><p> Bigger picture?  Tech has grown so far, so fast.  It has an outsized  influence on the stock market.  And today is a really great example.  So  when tech rallied, overall markets rallied.  But strategists say it is  difficult to see what other groups of stocks will take over market  leadership if tech falters -- Bret, back to you.</p><p> BAIER:  Deirdre, thank you. </p><p> A California judge has ruled Starbucks and other coffee sellers must  include cancer warnings on coffees sold in the state of California.  </p><p> The judge says the companies have failed to show the threat from a chemical  compound, produced in the coffee-roasting process, is insignificant.  The  coffee industry says the chemical is present -- present at harmless levels,  and should be exempt from the law because it results naturally from the  cooking process. </p><p> Up next, an emotional funeral for an African-American man shot by police  who thought he had a gun.  Plus, your kids and screen time:  What do you  need to know? </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  A funeral was held today for an unarmed African-American man, shot  by police who thought the cell phone in his hand was a gun.  The March 18th  incident has sparked days of unrest in Sacramento.  Correspondent Claudia  Cowan is live right now in the California capital.  </p><p> Good evening, Claudia. </p><p> CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.  Well as they have  all week, protestors with Black Lives Matter and other community groups  have camped out here, at the Sacramento County district attorney's office.  </p><p> They are demanding that prosecutors file criminal charges against the two  officers involved in the fatal shooting of Stephon Clark.  They also want  to see sweeping changes in police departments across the country. </p><p> Clark, a 22-year-old father of two boys, was laid to rest today.  His  funeral drew hundreds of mourners as well as prominent Civil Rights  activists.  As he supported Clark's grieving brother, Reverend Al Sharpton  gave the eulogy and called out the Trump administration.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REV. AL SHARPTON:  Yesterday, the president's press secretary said, \"This  is a local matter.\"  No, this is not a local matter.  They've been killing  young black men all over the country.  And we are here to say that we're  going to stand with Stephon Clark --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> COWAN (voice-over):  Video of the nighttime shooting has sparked  controversy.  Officers were chasing a robbery suspect, and thought Clark  had a gun.  It turned out to be a cell phone.  </p><p> And then right after the shooting, officers were told to mute their body  cameras.  And demonstrators are demanding an explanation for why the audio  was cut.  Police will only say that is part of the ongoing investigation. </p><p> In the meantime, city leaders are hoping to resume what they're calling a  community dialogue next week, so that residents can vent their anger and  offer solutions.  The meeting this past Tuesday night turned chaotic when  Clark's brother Stevante highjacked the mike and jumped on the dais.  </p><p> He has since apologized, and is asking the protestors not to interfere with  tonight's Sacramento Kings basketball game.  At two of the last three home  games, police stood by while activists blocked the doors and the arena was  locked down.  The Kings organization is assuring ticketholders that they  will have safe access to tonight's game. </p><p> A protest in support of police is now scheduled for this weekend, and those  two officers involved in Stephon Clark's shooting remain on paid  administrative leave -- Bret.</p><p> BAIER:  Claudia Cowan, live in Sacramento.  </p><p> Claudia, thank you. </p><p> Back in Washington, Defense Secretary James Mattis met today with incoming  National Security Advisor John Bolton.  The former U.N. ambassador will  replace Lieutenant-General H.R. McMaster. </p><p> The Pentagon chief kept things light at the beginning. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAMES MATTIS, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  Good to finally meet you. </p><p> JOHN BOLTON, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  Absolutely. </p><p> MATTIS:  I've heard that you're actually the devil incarnate, and I wanted  to meet you. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Heard you're the devil incarnate, some of Bolton's conservative  views, obviously, have drawn the ire of the Left. </p><p> Up next, a major American city still has not recovered from a massive  cyber-attack.  </p><p> First, beyond our borders tonight, the families of 68 people killed in a  fire at a Venezuelan police station jail are demanding information and  answers tonight.  The fast-moving blaze tore through the facility in  Valencia, about 100 miles from the capital, Caracas.  Venezuelan jails are  overcrowded and inmates often go hungry, as the nation struggles through a  massive economic crisis. </p><p>Italian police have arrested five people connected to the Tunisian  terrorist responsible for the Berlin Christmas market truck attack in 2016.   Anis Amri killed 12 people and died in a shootout with police four days  later.</p><p> And former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is being ordered to stand  trial on corruption and influence-peddling charges.  It's one of several  corruption investigations targeting Sarkozy.  It is the second scheduled  for trial.  Sarkozy denied all wrongdoing. </p><p> Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.  We'll be right  back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  The city of Atlanta is still in recovery mode tonight, after a  massive cyber-attack crippled many computers and systems over the past  week.  And the situation is still far from resolved.</p><p> Correspondent Jonathan Serrie shows us from Atlanta. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS, MAYOR OF ATLANTA:  This is a marathon, not a sprint.</p><p> JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):    A week after a  ransomware cyberattack paralyzed Atlanta's computer system, the city is  still unable to process payments for water bills and traffic tickets.   Municipal court hearings set for today are being rescheduled, and some city  services are returning to pen and paper.  </p><p> BOTTOMS:  It was a sustainable model until we got computer systems.  So it  worked for many years.  And for some of our younger employees, it will be a  nice exercise in good penmanship.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SERRIE:  But it's not a laughing matter.  Atlanta officials haven't decided  if they should pay the cyber criminals the $51,000 ransom to unlock their  files or manually restore each desktop and laptop connected to the city's  network which is quite a lengthy process.  </p><p> ANDREW GREEN, KENNESAW STATE UNIVERSITY:  They're in a no win situation.   They're going to end up choosing what is the most -- the least painful of  all bad solutions.  There is no good solution to this.  They're going to  get criticized if they pay.  They're going to get criticized if they don't  pay.  </p><p> SERRIE:  Andrew Green, an information security lecturer with Kennesaw State  University, says municipalities in general are vulnerable to cyberattack  because they strive to provide 24/7 online services at minimal cost to  taxpayers.  </p><p> GREEN:  They're expected to do all of this with a shoestring budget.  And  so this is a wake-up call potentially.  Cities need to start looking at how  seriously they're taking their own cyber security posture.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SERRIE:  Atlanta officials say they don't believe anyone's personal  information was compromised and the cyberattack did not affect the city's  911 system or the world's busiest airport.  But as a precaution, the  airport has shut down its public wi-fi system and disabled the flight  information feature on its website.  Bret?  </p><p> BAIER:  Jonathan, thank you.  </p><p> Former Indiana governor and current president of Purdue University Mitch  Daniels has some things to say about the use and abuse of technology and  big data.  He has just written an op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" titled  \"Someone is Watching You\".  He joins us tonight from Purdue University in  West Lafayette, Indiana.  Governor, thanks for being here.  Why write this  op-ed?  </p><p> MITCH DANIELS, (R) FORMER INDIANA GOVERNOR:  It was something of a surprise  to us, Bret, here how much we knew about our students, and we're beginning  to discover ways we can use it to their benefit.  We want to do that.  Let  them know things that would be -- that correlate with academic success and  they're progressing better here at Purdue.  </p><p> But at the same time, we can tell there could be misuses of that sort of  data, and I wrote it just because I know there are institutions of all  kinds who are now in possession of information in enormous quantities and  we're all going to have some questions to ask about ourselves about making  sure we do the right thing, not the wrong thing with it.  </p><p> BAIER:  That line between privacy and what you could use with that data,  obviously, is something we deal with.  In this op-ed, you say people serene  in their assurance that they know what is best for others, have to stop and  ask themselves on what authority they became the nudgers and great  approvers.  Many of us will have to stop and ask whether our good  intentions are carrying us past boundaries are privacy and individual  autonomy should still prevail.  </p><p> I mean, that is in fact, not only on college campuses but what we're  dealing with with these big tech companies and what they know about all of  us.  </p><p> DANIELS:  And in government and in many other walks of life.  There are  many people, and it always, of course, is motivated by what they believe  are good intentions who think they know what's best for others.  And armed  with these mountains of new information, they will be discovering patterns  that they would like to encourage others to follow, that produce what in  the nudger's eye is a good result.  </p><p> So this is something I think to be careful about.  There's somewhere, as I  say, between helping a struggling student -- identifying a struggling  student and connecting them with a tutor, and really shoving people into  behaviors that somebody has decided are preferable.  There's a line.  And  we ought to be debating it in individual institutions and collectively.  </p><p> BAIER:  I just want to get your thoughts about a couple of things.  One is  we're getting ready for this testimony up on Capitol Hill.  Congress with  the big tech companies, Facebook, Google, testifying before Congress.  And  there's really consideration about regulation.  Where do you think that  goes?  </p><p> DANIELS:  Well, he always got to regulate with great, great caution and  thought.  But this may be an area.  There are certain, certainly antitrust  and the suspicion of business is not without its foundation in American  history.  And we have set up various boundaries beyond which we don't think  institutions should grow and sprawl.  And it's hard not to notice the  incredible concentration in that industry.  It has economic consequences  and now we know it has major societal consequence when's that much  information is in that few hands.  </p><p> BAIER:  Two more things.  One is you're historically a big deficit hawk.   Somebody who is concerned about the deficit and debt for a long time.  You  talked about it.  Just been through this whole omnibus spending issue.   What are your thoughts on that and where the country is heading?  </p><p> DANIELS:  I'm very troubled.  It shouldn't escape people's notice there was  a massive amount of the discussion, debate, and there should have been  about a tax bill that may over 10 years increase the deficit by $1  trillion.  Not to be sneezed at, but when you're already at $20 trillion,  it's only the percentage that it is.  </p><p> Right on its heels, Congress happily and cheerfully passed a $2 trillion  addition to spending.  We finally found something people there can get  together on and compromise on, but it was probably the wrong thing.  And  the looming debt that we have built is an economic menace, the biggest one  to this country in the opinion of many of us.  And to our future  prosperity, it's also -- without question, a moral dubious thing to dump on  the next generation, bills not for money that was borrowed and invested in  their future but for many that their elders borrowed and spent on  themselves.  And the problem here, Bret, is I keep telling people, the can  is getting heavier, and we're running out of road.  </p><p> BAIER:  And quickly, this weekend is the NCAA final four.  Condoleezza Rice  has been asked to head up a committee looking at the NCAA basketball and  some of the problems they've been having.  You've written about that as  well.  Your thoughts as we head into this weekend?  </p><p> DANIELS:  It's a little like the big data column.  I'm all questions and  very few answers.  The one thing I know and think is very hard to argue  with is the status quo in Division One basketball needs a lot of repair.   We've seen corruption.  We've seen the game, in essence, semi- professionalized, although the people, the young men who are creating all  the value don't get paid for it.  And something really needs to change.  </p><p> I'm so glad that the NCAA has acted and commissioned a group led by someone  like Condi Rice with her tremendous judgment and credibility.  And there's  some other good people on there.  In the column, I threw out three ideas  but they're probably the wrong ideas.  I don't pretend to know the exact  answer, but we need to reinstate the era, really, of genuine student  athletes.  And those who are really only attending college to pursue an  athletic career and pretending to be students with the complicity of the  institutions ought to be paid above the table in some sort of minor league,  in my opinion.  </p><p> Looking forward to a great tournament.  There are four great teams there  this weekend.  All credit to them.  But the system as a whole should not go  on as it is much longer.  </p><p> BAIER:  Governor Daniels, we appreciate your time tonight.  </p><p> DANIELS:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BAIER:  When we come back, are your kids misbehaving because you let them  spend too much time looking at a screen?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  Tonight, we continue our series on kids and culture with a look at  how much is too much high-tech, and how it can be a very bad thing for your  children.  They even have a fancy name for it now.  Correspondent Ellison  Barber tells us what this is, what it means, and what can be done.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ELLISON BARBER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  All parents want what's best for  their kids.  They want them to be healthy, happy.  But what if small thing  --  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just football and Minecraft.  </p><p> BARBER:  -- threaten that.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's very worrisome because it's so part of our  lives.  </p><p> BARBER:  Dana is a mom of three.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A 14-year-old, an 11-year-old and an eight-year-old.  </p><p> BARBER:  And they, like so many of us, enjoy technology, Especially her  youngest.  </p><p> If somebody took it away in the middle of the game, would you be a little  bit mad?  Or not really?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'd be a little bit mad because I'm like doing -- it's  like really hard work and so it takes it away and you're almost finished  with that thing.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's happened before.  He'll be in the middle of  building something and I yank it away from him because I can't get his  attention.  </p><p> BARBER:  What do you do when that happens?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't want to get into that.  </p><p> BARBER:  Dr. Victoria Dunckley says with a lot of children, their nervous  systems are being overstimulated by electronics, and her research shows it  leads to behavioral problems.  </p><p> DR. VICTORIA DUNCKLEY, RESET YOUR CHILD'S BRAIN:  The vivid colors and the  rapid pace, all that is hard for the brain to process.  </p><p> BARBER:  It's a phenomenon she calls electronic screen time syndrome.  </p><p> DUNCKLEY:  Lot of kids become very irritable or they're tearful or some  kids actually have full blown rages.  Other kids are anxious.  And a lot of  kids will have trouble following directions.  </p><p> BARBER:  A 2010 study found that every day, eight to 18-year-olds spend an  average of seven hours and 38 minutes using entertainment media.  But some  say technology isn't the issue.  Parents can help their kids to use it in  beneficial ways.  </p><p> SARA DEWITT, PBS KIDS DIGITAL:  They can help introduce kids to new things  in the world, places they have never seen before.  They can help them play  with ideas in a way that it's harder to her do sometimes just like with a  paper and pencil.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I used to have trouble reading.  So I used to do this  website.  It helps you read like different books.  </p><p> BARBER:  Dunkley says the effects of too much screen time are sometimes  misdiagnosed as behavioral and mental health disorders.  If you're worried  about your child, she recommends a detox.  </p><p> DUNCKLEY:  It allows the brain to get deep rest so the stress hormones  normalize.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARBER:  And as kids become teens, the digital barrage only intensifies in  the form of smartphones.  According to Pew Research Center, 73 percent of  American teens have a smartphone, 92 percent say they go online daily.   Researchers say that percentage is fueled by smartphones.  Bret?  </p><p> BAIER:  Ellison, thank you.  Last part of the series tomorrow.  We can all  use a little digital time-out every now and then.  </p><p> The Vatican is disputing an interpretation of comments by Pope Francis that  have the pontiff declaring there is no Hell.  It says the story during this  holy week in an Italian newspaper is a reconstruction that does not contain  direct quotes from the Pope.  The story purports to quote the pontiff as  saying Hell does not exist and condemned souls just disappear.  The writer  has a history of interpretation conflicts with the Vatican.  </p><p> Next up, infrastructure, the tech industry, and your privacy -- the panel  joins me after a quick break.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Now, finally, putting  America first.  First, we'll invest in the American worker.  </p><p> We will breathe new life into your very rundown highways, railways, and  waterways.  We'll transform our roads and bridges from a source of endless  frustration into a source of absolutely incredible pride.  </p><p> I've asked Republicans and Democrats in Congress to come together and  deliver the biggest and boldest infrastructure plan in the last half  century.  The plan generates an unprecedented $1.5 trillion investment in  American infrastructure.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  The president in Ohio with this plan on infrastructure, kind of  laying that out in a very campaign style speech for President Trump.  The  bullet points here, $200 billion in federal funding to spur, as he  mentioned, $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investments, kind of a  public/private partnership, $100 billion for incentives program for  additional investments, states, localities, private sector, $50 billion  rebuilding rural infrastructure, $20 billion promoting infrastructure  projects, $20 billion expanding the financing programs, $10 billion in  capital revolving fund to help reduce inefficient federal property leasing.  </p><p> What about this?  Let's bring in our panel.  Katie Pavlich, news editor at  Townhall.com, Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today,\" and Bill  McGurn, Main Street columnist for the \"Wall Street Journal.\" Bill,  realistic?  </p><p> WILLIAM MCGURN, MAIN STREET, COLUMNIST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  It's a  little realistic.  Look, the problem isn't can we build this stuff?   There's two problems.  Who is going to pay for it?  And can we get  permission to build it from the regulatory process?  So those are the areas  I think where the president could have a little morning impact.  We need a  reform of how it's done.  </p><p> In New York and New Jersey, for example, so much of this should have been  done by the local and state governments.  But because of the spending  problems that they have, they don't have the money for it.  </p><p> BAIER:  Susan?</p><p> SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\":  I think there are some  cities and states who see this as not a realistic prospect because it  requires them to come up with so much of the money.  There's traditionally  been an 80/20 federal, state split.  This puts it the other way around, the  federal government putting 20 percent of the infrastructure spending.  </p><p> Now, that's said, I think there is a bipartisan, across the country  consensus that we need to have a bigger investment in infrastructure.  But  I'm not sure the president's plan is one that is politically feasible, and  I think the prospects that it gets through Congress this year are pretty  slim.  </p><p> BAIER:  Speaking of process, we just went through this omnibus, and I just  talked to Governor Daniels about that.  It doesn't seem like big  legislative things are going to happen prior to the midterms.  Do you agree  with that, Katie?  </p><p> KATIE PAVLICH, NEWS EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM:  Well, according to a White House  senior official today, they're not looking for this to be a big  infrastructure plan in terms of it being one big piece of legislation.   They actually want to move this in parts.  They want certain committees on  Capitol Hill to take a look at the details and push them through  individually.  So I do think that there is a chance that some of these  things can get past in bites and pieces rather than in a bigger piece of  legislation.  </p><p> But I want to go back quickly to the states issue.  Yes, the states are  going to have to take on a lot of responsibility here.  But you can argue  because of that, there will be more accountability in terms of the types of  projects that they do and that they have to take a look at things they  actually need rather than going back to the stimulus type package that we  had with little accountability and all of the federal government money just  getting dumped in for the sake of doing projects.  States are going to have  to take a look at what they actually need and make sure the money they are  putting on the table and the money they're getting from the federal  government is well spent to better their infrastructure in their states.  </p><p> BAIER:  Clearly, Bill, there is a process that is tough to go through if  you're trying to do any big project in any state, that the hoops that you  have to go through, that's what they're trying to affect.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Yes, but back to Katie's point, I think it's a good point.  You  know, if the federal government is going to pick up most of the tab,  there's not a lot of incentive for states to be careful about the money  being spent.  In New York, of course, we have this issue with the Gateway  project, the new tunnel and, you know, nine out of 10 people who would use  that are people like me, local commuters.  And so I would think, why should  someone in Mississippi have to pay for that, or have to pay for the bulk of  that?  </p><p> So I think we need -- what would be nice is a lot of reform that creates  incentives for states to focus on what they really need and start to pay  for it themselves.  </p><p> BAIER:  Donald Trump, the president today, had one company in his sights.   He tweeted out \"I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the  election.  Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state and local  governments, use our postal system as their delivery boy, causing  tremendous loss to the U.S., and are putting many thousands of retailers  out of business.\" Susan, it seems like he has Amazon, perhaps, in his  sights.  </p><p> PAGE:  He does, and there may be a variety of reasons why.  He's criticized  Amazon before, and linked Jeff Bezos who owns Amazon with \"The Washington  Post\" which he also owns.  And that -- some people think that's part of his  motivation for taking on Amazon.  </p><p> It is true that Amazon has been disruptive for a lot of small businesses in  communities, and that's a fair conversation to have.  It is not accurate to  say that Amazon does not collect sales tax, however.  Since last April,  April of 2017, so for the last year, Amazon has had a policy of collecting  sales tax wherever there are communities -- states where sales tax is  levied.  So that's a criticism that used to be made against Amazon that I  think is now a little out of date.  </p><p> BAIER:  Here's Steve Forbes asked about this kind of focusing in on one  company, a big company, Amazon.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN:  Free markets will work in bringing  that company down just as it does with any other company over time.  I'm  old enough to remember G.M. when that was the big, bad company, IBM when  that was the big, bad company.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And Microsoft.  </p><p> FORBES:  Wal-Mart was going to take over the world.  Now it's struggling.   So let the free markets play out.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Katie?  </p><p> PAVLICH:  Yes, I understand the president's willingness and urge to level  the playing field certainly.  But if he's going after Jeff Bezos and Amazon  for personal reasons, then it's certainly an abuse of power.  Look, states  have taken this on themselves in terms of looking at the way that Amazon  does third party sales and implemented their own types of sales tax.  So I  also believe that the free market will come into play here.  </p><p> The other thing, too, is there is Supreme Court precedence for this going  back to the 1990s when catalogs were selling goods from state to state and  sales tax was not being paid in states that they were not actually located.   And the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the catalog.  Amazon is a little  bit different and the Supreme Court will hear a case in April dealing with  the tech side of that.  But we have seen that this is not just an Amazon  issue.  There is some legal precedent here about the taxes and the way that  they work when you're selling from a third party or from a different state.  </p><p> BAIER:  Lot of states and cities are courting Amazon for a big building  somewhere.  We'll see where that goes.  Panel, as always, thank you.  </p><p> When we come back, the lady doth protest, and so did her colleagues.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BAIER:  Finally tonight, that's no way to treat a lady.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Whatever it is.  I can't remember what it is.  Isn't  that extraordinary?  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson hit a nerve Tuesday when he  addressed parliament member Emily Thornberry by her spouse's title rather  than her preferred maiden name, then this happened.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's not lady something.  We know what her name is.   And it is inappropriate and frankly sexist to speak in those terms.  And  I'm not having it in this chamber.  No matter how senior a member, that  parlance is not legitimate.  It will not be allowed.  </p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BAIER:  Secretary Johnson did eventually apologize unreservedly for what he  called his inadvertent sexism.  Not having it in that chamber.  </p><p> Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.  That's it for this SPECIAL  REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid.  \"The Story\" with guest host Sandra  Smith starts right now.

Our \"Kids and Culture\" series continues.  This is SPECIAL REPORT.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, I'm Bret Baier.  Just-fired Veterans Affairs Secretary, David  Shulkin, is not going quietly tonight.  The latest Trump administration to  be shown the door is going public with his many grievances.  We'll talk  with him live in just a moment. </p><p>But first, Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon on Shulkin's parting shots  against the Washington political culture. </p><p>Good evening, Lucas. </p><p>LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Bret, President Trump used an event in  Ohio today to defend the firing of his Veterans Affairs secretary, Dr.  David Shulkin. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I wasn't happy with the  speed with which our veterans were taken care of.  We made changes because  we want them taken care of.  We want them to have choice so that they can  run to a private doctor.</p><p>TOMLINSON (voice-over):  Shulkin wasn't too happy about getting axed, and  took out his frustrations in a blistering op-ed this morning.  </p><p>Saying, quote, \"Washington has turned so toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and  subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important  work that our veterans need.\"  The former secretary blamed critics for  making false accusations against him.  \"They saw me as an obstacle to  privatization.\"  </p><p>Calls for the Obama holdover's removal boiled over following an ethics  scandal, but Shulkin was quick to point out his successes:  expanding  access to health care, reducing wait times and working closer with the  private sector. </p><p>Shulkin says the percentage of veterans who regained trust in the V.A. has  risen from 46 percent four years ago to 70 percent today.  Still, he  struggled to win over Congress and even vets. </p><p>SEN. JERRY MORAN (R), KAN.:  You led me to believe that you and I were on  the same page.  Our inability to reach an agreement is in significant part  related to your ability to speak out of both sides of your mouth, double- talk.  </p><p>TOMLINSON (voice-over):  Sarah Verardo's (ph) husband has had more than 100  surgeries since being wounded in Afghanistan.  She says she's ready for  change. </p><p>SARAH VERARDO (ph):  We need a secretary in there who is empowering and  enacting the president's plan.  It's a system that needs massive and total  overhaul.  It's a stain on our nation, and we -- we owe these heroes so  much more. </p><p>TOMLINSON (voice-over):  President Trump's nominee to replace Shulkin, Rear  Admiral Ronny Jackson. </p><p>ADM. RONNY JACKSON, NOMINEE, U.S. VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY:  Some people  have, you know, just great genes (ph). </p><p>TOMLINSON (voice-over):  The White House physician, best known as the  doctor who delivered the briefing on President Trump's physical, is already  coming under fire for his credentials. </p><p>Some question whether the Navy doctor can successfully lead the federal  government's second-largest department.  The oldest war veterans  organization saying, quote, \"Doctor JacksonOs bio does not reflect any  experience working with the V.A. or with veterans, or managing any  organization of this size.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOMLINSON:  On Monday, Acting V.A. Secretary Robert Wilkie takes over on an  interim basis.  It could be months before Jackson is confirmed -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Lucas, thank you. </p><p>Let's hear directly, now, from Dr. Shulkin.  He joins us. </p><p>Mr. Secretary, thanks for being here. </p><p>DR. DAVID SHULKIN, FORMER U.S. VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY:  Glad to be  here, Bret. </p><p>BAIER:  So let's start with this.  Why do you think you were fired?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, every cabinet member serves at the pleasure of the  president, and it's the president's prerogative to have a team around him  that he thinks is doing the job.  I think we heard today, from the  president, that he wasn't happy with the pace.  </p><p>And, you know, I agree with the president.  This is an organization that  needs to change.  It needs to do better at its job, and we all want to do  it faster and better because it's so important to the country.  And I -- I  think the president has the right to have the secretary that he wants with  him. </p><p>BAIER:  You said the administration wants to privatize the V.A.  Have you  ever seen -- we -- we haven't seen evidence of, as far as White House  policy directives sent to Congress saying that, is there any direct  communication with Congress that the administration wants to privatize the  V.A.?</p><p>SHULKIN:  No, Bret.  I actually haven't said that.  I'm -- I was part of  the administration until yesterday.  We are not trying to privatize the  V.A.  We are trying to improve and transform the V.A.</p><p>What I said in my editorial is, is that there are a number of political  appointees within V.A. that are pushing to privatize much faster than I  think is in the interest of veterans and is the safe way to care for our  veterans. </p><p>And I've -- I've stood up for them because I was in Washington and I was  working for the president on behalf of our veterans.  </p><p>BAIER:  Why did you feel the need to write the op-ed?  </p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, listen, I think it's important.  I came to Washington from  the private sector for one reason, to fix the V.A.  I know this matters a  lot to the president.  And we as a country have a long way to go to get the  V.A. in -- in proper shape.  </p><p>But it would be a mistake to conclude that we do not need the V.A. and that  we have to dismantle the V.A.  We have to improve the V.A. while at the  same time working with the private sector in an integrated way to meet the  needs of our veterans.  </p><p>BAIER:  You know, we heard this sound bite in Lucas' piece from Senator  Moran, questioning your dealings with that particular committee.  Did --  did you have a credibility issue with Congress?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Oh, I don't think so.  You have to remember, I'm the only cabinet  member that had 100 to zero vote.  I've prided myself in working in a  bipartisan way.  </p><p>Senator Moran felt strongly about pushing to give veterans additional  options that, frankly, his own senators, the committee, didn't agree with.   He lost his amendment 14 to one.  He was the only one voting against it.   And he was frustrated by that. </p><p>And, by the way, he had some reasonable points there.  So there are many  things that he and I agreed upon.  But in the end, he didn't like the  position that I took, which was to do what I thought was the right thing  for our veterans. </p><p>BAIER:  About 11 months ago, I had you on SPECIAL REPORT.  We were talking  about the challenges.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Have things changed?  Are you seeing change? </p><p>SHULKIN:  We're in the intensive care unit.  And we're monitoring things  really closely, but I am optimistic that we're beginning to finally deal  with the issues that have plagued the V.A. system for decades.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  So the president said today that he just wasn't happy, how fast or  how -- how things were going.  That they were going too slowly.  What's  your response to that, and what can be done to -- to change that pace?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, I don't think the president should be happy with where we  were.  And as secretary, I wasn't happy with where we were.  We have to  figure out how to move this bureaucracy faster and be more responsive.  </p><p>When you showed the Verardos, I know Michael and Sarah very well.  And  frankly, this was a system that failed them and we shouldn't be doing that.   So -- so this is a system that needs to be pushed.  Many of the  bureaucratic elements need to be restructured.  I've started that process.   I hope that Dr. Jackson will continue that process because it needs to be  done.  </p><p>BAIER:  You know, you had the inspector-general, obviously, come out with  this scathing report about -- about your trip to Europe.  We -- we've been  over that and your response to that.  Were there other I.G. investigations  or audits that -- that were factoring into this whole thing?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, you know, Washington is a town that throws up all sorts of  allegations.  There were allegations of additional reports, but there have  been no other reports that have come out.  And I've addressed that. </p><p>Everything that I did on this European trip was pre-approved by Ethics, was  consistent with past policies at V.A.  But when the inspector-general had  concerns about it, I wrote a check and I paid back every penny of a single  coach airfare.  That was the total amount that -- that government funds  were used for, and I paid that back.</p><p>So, look, I think I've addressed that.  This was used in a political way to  try to remove me.  And, you know, this is Washington.  I'm a big -- I'm a  big boy.  I understand that.  I've said that it shouldn't be this hard to  serve your country.  And I don't think it should be.  But thankfully, there  are many people that are still trying to fix our systems like the V.A.</p><p>BAIER:  So if you had a message for the incoming secretary, should he get  confirmed, what would it be?</p><p>SHULKIN:  I (ph) would (ph) take to -- you know, make sure that he is  consistent with the president's agenda, to push really hard, always, to  keep the veterans' interests at heart.  To make sure that he's working  closely with congress in a bipartisan way.  V.A. cannot afford to be  politicized.</p><p>And make sure that he's listening to the veteran groups because, frankly,  that's why we're doing this.  That's what a responsive organizations needs  to be successful in doing, is listening to those that have served.  So I  will help Dr. Jackson in any way that he needs help because it's very  important that we succeed at this mission.  </p><p>BAIER:  Mr. Secretary, thank you for your service.  Not an easy interview  on this day.  We appreciate your time. </p><p>SHULKIN:  Thank you, Bret. </p><p>BAIER:  This is a FOX NEWS alert.  The attorney general says there will be  no second special counsel for now.  Jeff Sessions is rejecting a Republican  request for a special prosecutor to look into alleged bias at the Justice  Department and the FBI. </p><p>But he is authorizing an investigation, and leaving the door open for more  possible action later.  Chief national correspondent Ed Henry is here with  the breaking details. </p><p>Good evening, Ed. </p><p>ED HENRY, FOX CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.  This  could be a big deal.  Because what the attorney general is really saying  is, he may not need a second special counsel just yet to find out whether  FBI and Justice Department officials during the Obama years broke laws when  they engaged in FISA abuse to spy on the Trump campaign because he already  has a criminal prosecutor all over it. </p><p>Sessions revealing for the first time, he already has been quietly having  U.S. attorney John Huber of Utah operating, of course, outside of the  beltway, using his prosecutorial powers with a broad mandate to investigate  misconduct that could extend beyond FISA abuse. </p><p>So former FBI officials James Comey, Andrew McCabe could be facing scrutiny  for not just failing to tell the FISA judge that the anti-Trump dossier was  paid for by the DNC and the Clinton campaign.  This prosecutor could be  looking at McCabe's leaking, his lying to investigators, plus those FBI  text messages.</p><p>Sessions writing, quote, \"I am confident, Mr. Huber's review will include a  full, complete and objective evaluation of these matters in a manner that  is consistent with the law and the facts.  I receive regular updates from  Mr. Huber and upon the conclusion of his review, will receive his  recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation  should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require  further resources or whether any matters merit the appointment of a special  counsel.\"</p><p>Now, Sessions faced heat again last night when it was revealed, the Justice  Department inspector-general was reviewing this, and critics said that --  that official there does not have prosecutorial powers.  </p><p>Well, John Huber does.  And remember, Sessions hinted this without naming  Humer -- Huber in a recent interview with Shannon Bream.  Watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  I have appointed a person outside of  Washington, many years in the Department of Justice, to look at all the  allegations that the House Judiciary Committee members sent to us, and  we're conducting that investigation. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY:  Now Huber was first nominated by then-President Barack Obama, so if  he brings criminal charges it will have credibility.  Likewise, if he finds  no criminal wrongdoing it will be noted, this was someone who was re- nominated by President Trump with the backing, we should note, of  conservative Republican Utah senator, Mike Lee -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  All right.  We'll follow this one, Ed.  Thank you.</p><p>U.S. officials say there is no justification for Russia's retaliatory moves  to expel 60 American diplomats and shutter the U.S. consulate in St.  Petersburg. </p><p>Russia's foreign minister announced the action today.  It's the Kremlin's  response to punitive measures over its alleged involvement in the poisoning  of a Russian -- a former Russian spy in England.  Also today, we learned  the deceased spy's daughter, who was also affected in that attack, is no  longer in critical condition. </p><p>While not deceased, the other attack -- while we were probably active today  -- you may have been on Amazon, who knows, this afternoon, for any number  of items.  President Trump was going hard after the online giant for what  he says is behavior that is bad for America. </p><p>The president is also making a strong push for his infrastructure  rejuvenization -- rejuvenation plan, which is \"necessary for America,\" he  says.  Correspondent Kevin Corke is at the White House tonight with that. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Anything we can dream, you  can build.  You will create the new highways, the new dams and skyscrapers  that will become lasting monuments to American strength and continued  greatness. </p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Back on the road,  and looking to get the White House back on message.  </p><p>TRUMP:  We're now finally putting America first.  America first. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>CORKE (voice-over):  President Trump traveled to Ohio today, to unveil his  administration's infrastructure plan to use $200 billion in federal money  to spur at least a trillion and a half in spending over a decade to repair  or replace highways, bridges, ports and airports. </p><p>TRUMP:  We'll transform our roads and bridges from a source of endless  frustration into a source of absolutely incredible pride. </p><p>CORKE (voice-over):  The appearance, his first in public in nearly a week,  comes amid reports that, once again, he is prepared to take aim at a  business behemoth:  Amazon and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, who also owns the  \"Washington Post,\" which the president has criticized for being unfair to  his administration.</p><p>In fact, he's criticized Bezos and Amazon on Twitter more than a dozen  times since late 2015, including today.  This time, accusing the online  retailer of paying little or no taxes, using the postal system as their  delivery boy, and putting retailers out of business.  </p><p>While Amazon does pay taxes -- about $412 million in 2016, according to SEC  filings -- some municipalities complain the company doesn't collect enough  local taxes or taxes on goods sold by third parties on its platform. </p><p>RAJ SHAH, WHITE HOUSE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  This is really  about policy.  You have a huge company that's done amazing things, and  Amazon sprang (ph) up in a very short amount of time.  And, really, tax  policy and other policy has to catch up to that so that way -- those who  are competing with Amazon are on a level playing field. </p><p>CORKE (voice-over):  The White House has declined to confirm if any new  policies or actions are in the works.  But the president has talked openly  about the possibility of a change to Amazon's tax status through anti-trust  rules, much to the dismay of some analysts. </p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  This is not standard oil, this is not  the telephone company.  They have about 5 percent of retail sales right  now.  That is hardly a monopoly at all.</p><p>CORKE (voice-over):  Despite the president's tweet, the online retailer is  thought by many to actually be helping to keep the postal service viable by  driving up package delivery revenue at a time when first-class mail volume  continues to drop.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE:  Bret, talking about the U.S. postal service, there, you may find  this interesting.  Its board of governors last had a member in December of  2016.  No one's been replaced since that point.  In fact, it now sits empty  for the first time since its creation all the way back in 1970.  More work  to do for the Trump administration -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Kevin Corke, out (ph) on the North Lawn.  </p><p>Kevin, thank you. </p><p>Stocks closed out a volatile week and month.  On the positive side, the Dow  gained 255 today.  The S&amp;P 500 finished ahead 36.  The NASDAQ picked up  114.  What a big difference a day makes.  Let's get some additional  information tonight about tech stocks and the markets. </p><p>Deirdre Bolton of FOX BUSINESS NETWORK joins us, as she does, from New  York. </p><p>Good evening, Deirdre. </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX ANCHOR:  Good evening, Bret.  So investors bought some  of the tech stocks that have fallen so much in the past few sessions:   Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet, Google, Microsoft all closed higher.  </p><p>Still a lot of long-term concerns about tech, though, with specific  companies facing potential regulation.  So Facebook, one example of that.   It announced a few quick fixes today, presumably before Mark Zuckerberg  testifies in front of Congress on April 10th. </p><p>So Facebook made its privacy controls easier to find (ph), easier to alter.   It also cut off certain customer-targeting companies from the platform. </p><p>Tech companies face potential government challenges, investor pressure and  public peer review.  Apple CEO, Tim Cook, took a swipe at Facebook at a  conference, saying, \"The best regulation is no regulation\" -- self- regulation -- \"however, I think we're way beyond that here.\"  Facebook's  stock did close higher today, but it is down about 10 percent for the  month.  </p><p>Apple, speaking of Tim Cook, faces more than a dozen class-action lawsuits.   Consumer groups charge that it intentionally slowed older iPhones or failed  to disclose power use changes with updated operating systems, so consumer  groups say it was meant to encourage people to buy new, upgraded, more  expensive phones. </p><p>President Trump put Amazon in the crosshairs again, in a response to a  tweet.  Analysts say Amazon has not broken any tax laws, and reports show  that the U.S. postal service suffers from high labor costs and from paying  into federal workers' pension and health care plans, not from delivering  packages for Amazon. </p><p>Bigger picture?  Tech has grown so far, so fast.  It has an outsized  influence on the stock market.  And today is a really great example.  So  when tech rallied, overall markets rallied.  But strategists say it is  difficult to see what other groups of stocks will take over market  leadership if tech falters -- Bret, back to you.</p><p>BAIER:  Deirdre, thank you. </p><p>A California judge has ruled Starbucks and other coffee sellers must  include cancer warnings on coffees sold in the state of California.  </p><p>The judge says the companies have failed to show the threat from a chemical  compound, produced in the coffee-roasting process, is insignificant.  The  coffee industry says the chemical is present -- present at harmless levels,  and should be exempt from the law because it results naturally from the  cooking process. </p><p>Up next, an emotional funeral for an African-American man shot by police  who thought he had a gun.  Plus, your kids and screen time:  What do you  need to know? </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  A funeral was held today for an unarmed African-American man, shot  by police who thought the cell phone in his hand was a gun.  The March 18th  incident has sparked days of unrest in Sacramento.  Correspondent Claudia  Cowan is live right now in the California capital.  </p><p>Good evening, Claudia. </p><p>CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Bret.  Well as they have  all week, protestors with Black Lives Matter and other community groups  have camped out here, at the Sacramento County district attorney's office.  </p><p>They are demanding that prosecutors file criminal charges against the two  officers involved in the fatal shooting of Stephon Clark.  They also want  to see sweeping changes in police departments across the country. </p><p>Clark, a 22-year-old father of two boys, was laid to rest today.  His  funeral drew hundreds of mourners as well as prominent Civil Rights  activists.  As he supported Clark's grieving brother, Reverend Al Sharpton  gave the eulogy and called out the Trump administration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REV. AL SHARPTON:  Yesterday, the president's press secretary said, \"This  is a local matter.\"  No, this is not a local matter.  They've been killing  young black men all over the country.  And we are here to say that we're  going to stand with Stephon Clark --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COWAN (voice-over):  Video of the nighttime shooting has sparked  controversy.  Officers were chasing a robbery suspect, and thought Clark  had a gun.  It turned out to be a cell phone.  </p><p>And then right after the shooting, officers were told to mute their body  cameras.  And demonstrators are demanding an explanation for why the audio  was cut.  Police will only say that is part of the ongoing investigation. </p><p>In the meantime, city leaders are hoping to resume what they're calling a  community dialogue next week, so that residents can vent their anger and  offer solutions.  The meeting this past Tuesday night turned chaotic when  Clark's brother Stevante highjacked the mike and jumped on the dais.  </p><p>He has since apologized, and is asking the protestors not to interfere with  tonight's Sacramento Kings basketball game.  At two of the last three home  games, police stood by while activists blocked the doors and the arena was  locked down.  The Kings organization is assuring ticketholders that they  will have safe access to tonight's game. </p><p>A protest in support of police is now scheduled for this weekend, and those  two officers involved in Stephon Clark's shooting remain on paid  administrative leave -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Claudia Cowan, live in Sacramento.  </p><p>Claudia, thank you. </p><p>Back in Washington, Defense Secretary James Mattis met today with incoming  National Security Advisor John Bolton.  The former U.N. ambassador will  replace Lieutenant-General H.R. McMaster. </p><p>The Pentagon chief kept things light at the beginning. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES MATTIS, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  Good to finally meet you. </p><p>JOHN BOLTON, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  Absolutely. </p><p>MATTIS:  I've heard that you're actually the devil incarnate, and I wanted  to meet you. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Heard you're the devil incarnate, some of Bolton's conservative  views, obviously, have drawn the ire of the Left. </p><p>Up next, a major American city still has not recovered from a massive  cyber-attack.  </p><p>First, beyond our borders tonight, the families of 68 people killed in a  fire at a Venezuelan police station jail are demanding information and  answers tonight.  The fast-moving blaze tore through the facility in  Valencia, about 100 miles from the capital, Caracas.  Venezuelan jails are  overcrowded and inmates often go hungry, as the nation struggles through a  massive economic crisis. </p><p>Italian police have arrested five people connected to the Tunisian  terrorist responsible for the Berlin Christmas market truck attack in 2016.   Anis Amri killed 12 people and died in a shootout with police four days  later.</p><p>And former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is being ordered to stand  trial on corruption and influence-peddling charges.  It's one of several  corruption investigations targeting Sarkozy.  It is the second scheduled  for trial.  Sarkozy denied all wrongdoing. </p><p>Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  The city of Atlanta is still in recovery mode tonight, after a  massive cyber-attack crippled many computers and systems over the past  week.  And the situation is still far from resolved.</p><p>Correspondent Jonathan Serrie shows us from Atlanta. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS, MAYOR OF ATLANTA:  This is a marathon, not a sprint.</p><p>JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):    A week after a  ransomware cyberattack paralyzed Atlanta's computer system, the city is  still unable to process payments for water bills and traffic tickets.   Municipal court hearings set for today are being rescheduled, and some city  services are returning to pen and paper.  </p><p>BOTTOMS:  It was a sustainable model until we got computer systems.  So it  worked for many years.  And for some of our younger employees, it will be a  nice exercise in good penmanship.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SERRIE:  But it's not a laughing matter.  Atlanta officials haven't decided  if they should pay the cyber criminals the $51,000 ransom to unlock their  files or manually restore each desktop and laptop connected to the city's  network which is quite a lengthy process.  </p><p>ANDREW GREEN, KENNESAW STATE UNIVERSITY:  They're in a no win situation.   They're going to end up choosing what is the most -- the least painful of  all bad solutions.  There is no good solution to this.  They're going to  get criticized if they pay.  They're going to get criticized if they don't  pay.  </p><p>SERRIE:  Andrew Green, an information security lecturer with Kennesaw State  University, says municipalities in general are vulnerable to cyberattack  because they strive to provide 24/7 online services at minimal cost to  taxpayers.  </p><p>GREEN:  They're expected to do all of this with a shoestring budget.  And  so this is a wake-up call potentially.  Cities need to start looking at how  seriously they're taking their own cyber security posture.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERRIE:  Atlanta officials say they don't believe anyone's personal  information was compromised and the cyberattack did not affect the city's  911 system or the world's busiest airport.  But as a precaution, the  airport has shut down its public wi-fi system and disabled the flight  information feature on its website.  Bret?  </p><p>BAIER:  Jonathan, thank you.  </p><p>Former Indiana governor and current president of Purdue University Mitch  Daniels has some things to say about the use and abuse of technology and  big data.  He has just written an op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" titled  \"Someone is Watching You\".  He joins us tonight from Purdue University in  West Lafayette, Indiana.  Governor, thanks for being here.  Why write this  op-ed?  </p><p>MITCH DANIELS, (R) FORMER INDIANA GOVERNOR:  It was something of a surprise  to us, Bret, here how much we knew about our students, and we're beginning  to discover ways we can use it to their benefit.  We want to do that.  Let  them know things that would be -- that correlate with academic success and  they're progressing better here at Purdue.  </p><p>But at the same time, we can tell there could be misuses of that sort of  data, and I wrote it just because I know there are institutions of all  kinds who are now in possession of information in enormous quantities and  we're all going to have some questions to ask about ourselves about making  sure we do the right thing, not the wrong thing with it.  </p><p>BAIER:  That line between privacy and what you could use with that data,  obviously, is something we deal with.  In this op-ed, you say people serene  in their assurance that they know what is best for others, have to stop and  ask themselves on what authority they became the nudgers and great  approvers.  Many of us will have to stop and ask whether our good  intentions are carrying us past boundaries are privacy and individual  autonomy should still prevail.  </p><p>I mean, that is in fact, not only on college campuses but what we're  dealing with with these big tech companies and what they know about all of  us.  </p><p>DANIELS:  And in government and in many other walks of life.  There are  many people, and it always, of course, is motivated by what they believe  are good intentions who think they know what's best for others.  And armed  with these mountains of new information, they will be discovering patterns  that they would like to encourage others to follow, that produce what in  the nudger's eye is a good result.  </p><p>So this is something I think to be careful about.  There's somewhere, as I  say, between helping a struggling student -- identifying a struggling  student and connecting them with a tutor, and really shoving people into  behaviors that somebody has decided are preferable.  There's a line.  And  we ought to be debating it in individual institutions and collectively.  </p><p>BAIER:  I just want to get your thoughts about a couple of things.  One is  we're getting ready for this testimony up on Capitol Hill.  Congress with  the big tech companies, Facebook, Google, testifying before Congress.  And  there's really consideration about regulation.  Where do you think that  goes?  </p><p>DANIELS:  Well, he always got to regulate with great, great caution and  thought.  But this may be an area.  There are certain, certainly antitrust  and the suspicion of business is not without its foundation in American  history.  And we have set up various boundaries beyond which we don't think  institutions should grow and sprawl.  And it's hard not to notice the  incredible concentration in that industry.  It has economic consequences  and now we know it has major societal consequence when's that much  information is in that few hands.  </p><p>BAIER:  Two more things.  One is you're historically a big deficit hawk.   Somebody who is concerned about the deficit and debt for a long time.  You  talked about it.  Just been through this whole omnibus spending issue.   What are your thoughts on that and where the country is heading?  </p><p>DANIELS:  I'm very troubled.  It shouldn't escape people's notice there was  a massive amount of the discussion, debate, and there should have been  about a tax bill that may over 10 years increase the deficit by $1  trillion.  Not to be sneezed at, but when you're already at $20 trillion,  it's only the percentage that it is.  </p><p>Right on its heels, Congress happily and cheerfully passed a $2 trillion  addition to spending.  We finally found something people there can get  together on and compromise on, but it was probably the wrong thing.  And  the looming debt that we have built is an economic menace, the biggest one  to this country in the opinion of many of us.  And to our future  prosperity, it's also -- without question, a moral dubious thing to dump on  the next generation, bills not for money that was borrowed and invested in  their future but for many that their elders borrowed and spent on  themselves.  And the problem here, Bret, is I keep telling people, the can  is getting heavier, and we're running out of road.  </p><p>BAIER:  And quickly, this weekend is the NCAA final four.  Condoleezza Rice  has been asked to head up a committee looking at the NCAA basketball and  some of the problems they've been having.  You've written about that as  well.  Your thoughts as we head into this weekend?  </p><p>DANIELS:  It's a little like the big data column.  I'm all questions and  very few answers.  The one thing I know and think is very hard to argue  with is the status quo in Division One basketball needs a lot of repair.   We've seen corruption.  We've seen the game, in essence, semi- professionalized, although the people, the young men who are creating all  the value don't get paid for it.  And something really needs to change.  </p><p>I'm so glad that the NCAA has acted and commissioned a group led by someone  like Condi Rice with her tremendous judgment and credibility.  And there's  some other good people on there.  In the column, I threw out three ideas  but they're probably the wrong ideas.  I don't pretend to know the exact  answer, but we need to reinstate the era, really, of genuine student  athletes.  And those who are really only attending college to pursue an  athletic career and pretending to be students with the complicity of the  institutions ought to be paid above the table in some sort of minor league,  in my opinion.  </p><p>Looking forward to a great tournament.  There are four great teams there  this weekend.  All credit to them.  But the system as a whole should not go  on as it is much longer.  </p><p>BAIER:  Governor Daniels, we appreciate your time tonight.  </p><p>DANIELS:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BAIER:  When we come back, are your kids misbehaving because you let them  spend too much time looking at a screen?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  Tonight, we continue our series on kids and culture with a look at  how much is too much high-tech, and how it can be a very bad thing for your  children.  They even have a fancy name for it now.  Correspondent Ellison  Barber tells us what this is, what it means, and what can be done.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ELLISON BARBER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  All parents want what's best for  their kids.  They want them to be healthy, happy.  But what if small thing  --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just football and Minecraft.  </p><p>BARBER:  -- threaten that.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's very worrisome because it's so part of our  lives.  </p><p>BARBER:  Dana is a mom of three.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A 14-year-old, an 11-year-old and an eight-year-old.  </p><p>BARBER:  And they, like so many of us, enjoy technology, Especially her  youngest.  </p><p>If somebody took it away in the middle of the game, would you be a little  bit mad?  Or not really?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'd be a little bit mad because I'm like doing -- it's  like really hard work and so it takes it away and you're almost finished  with that thing.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's happened before.  He'll be in the middle of  building something and I yank it away from him because I can't get his  attention.  </p><p>BARBER:  What do you do when that happens?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't want to get into that.  </p><p>BARBER:  Dr. Victoria Dunckley says with a lot of children, their nervous  systems are being overstimulated by electronics, and her research shows it  leads to behavioral problems.  </p><p>DR. VICTORIA DUNCKLEY, RESET YOUR CHILD'S BRAIN:  The vivid colors and the  rapid pace, all that is hard for the brain to process.  </p><p>BARBER:  It's a phenomenon she calls electronic screen time syndrome.  </p><p>DUNCKLEY:  Lot of kids become very irritable or they're tearful or some  kids actually have full blown rages.  Other kids are anxious.  And a lot of  kids will have trouble following directions.  </p><p>BARBER:  A 2010 study found that every day, eight to 18-year-olds spend an  average of seven hours and 38 minutes using entertainment media.  But some  say technology isn't the issue.  Parents can help their kids to use it in  beneficial ways.  </p><p>SARA DEWITT, PBS KIDS DIGITAL:  They can help introduce kids to new things  in the world, places they have never seen before.  They can help them play  with ideas in a way that it's harder to her do sometimes just like with a  paper and pencil.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I used to have trouble reading.  So I used to do this  website.  It helps you read like different books.  </p><p>BARBER:  Dunkley says the effects of too much screen time are sometimes  misdiagnosed as behavioral and mental health disorders.  If you're worried  about your child, she recommends a detox.  </p><p>DUNCKLEY:  It allows the brain to get deep rest so the stress hormones  normalize.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBER:  And as kids become teens, the digital barrage only intensifies in  the form of smartphones.  According to Pew Research Center, 73 percent of  American teens have a smartphone, 92 percent say they go online daily.   Researchers say that percentage is fueled by smartphones.  Bret?  </p><p>BAIER:  Ellison, thank you.  Last part of the series tomorrow.  We can all  use a little digital time-out every now and then.  </p><p>The Vatican is disputing an interpretation of comments by Pope Francis that  have the pontiff declaring there is no Hell.  It says the story during this  holy week in an Italian newspaper is a reconstruction that does not contain  direct quotes from the Pope.  The story purports to quote the pontiff as  saying Hell does not exist and condemned souls just disappear.  The writer  has a history of interpretation conflicts with the Vatican.  </p><p>Next up, infrastructure, the tech industry, and your privacy -- the panel  joins me after a quick break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Now, finally, putting  America first.  First, we'll invest in the American worker.  </p><p>We will breathe new life into your very rundown highways, railways, and  waterways.  We'll transform our roads and bridges from a source of endless  frustration into a source of absolutely incredible pride.  </p><p>I've asked Republicans and Democrats in Congress to come together and  deliver the biggest and boldest infrastructure plan in the last half  century.  The plan generates an unprecedented $1.5 trillion investment in  American infrastructure.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  The president in Ohio with this plan on infrastructure, kind of  laying that out in a very campaign style speech for President Trump.  The  bullet points here, $200 billion in federal funding to spur, as he  mentioned, $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investments, kind of a  public/private partnership, $100 billion for incentives program for  additional investments, states, localities, private sector, $50 billion  rebuilding rural infrastructure, $20 billion promoting infrastructure  projects, $20 billion expanding the financing programs, $10 billion in  capital revolving fund to help reduce inefficient federal property leasing.  </p><p>What about this?  Let's bring in our panel.  Katie Pavlich, news editor at  Townhall.com, Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today,\" and Bill  McGurn, Main Street columnist for the \"Wall Street Journal.\" Bill,  realistic?  </p><p>WILLIAM MCGURN, MAIN STREET, COLUMNIST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  It's a  little realistic.  Look, the problem isn't can we build this stuff?   There's two problems.  Who is going to pay for it?  And can we get  permission to build it from the regulatory process?  So those are the areas  I think where the president could have a little morning impact.  We need a  reform of how it's done.  </p><p>In New York and New Jersey, for example, so much of this should have been  done by the local and state governments.  But because of the spending  problems that they have, they don't have the money for it.  </p><p>BAIER:  Susan?</p><p>SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\":  I think there are some  cities and states who see this as not a realistic prospect because it  requires them to come up with so much of the money.  There's traditionally  been an 80/20 federal, state split.  This puts it the other way around, the  federal government putting 20 percent of the infrastructure spending.  </p><p>Now, that's said, I think there is a bipartisan, across the country  consensus that we need to have a bigger investment in infrastructure.  But  I'm not sure the president's plan is one that is politically feasible, and  I think the prospects that it gets through Congress this year are pretty  slim.  </p><p>BAIER:  Speaking of process, we just went through this omnibus, and I just  talked to Governor Daniels about that.  It doesn't seem like big  legislative things are going to happen prior to the midterms.  Do you agree  with that, Katie?  </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, NEWS EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM:  Well, according to a White House  senior official today, they're not looking for this to be a big  infrastructure plan in terms of it being one big piece of legislation.   They actually want to move this in parts.  They want certain committees on  Capitol Hill to take a look at the details and push them through  individually.  So I do think that there is a chance that some of these  things can get past in bites and pieces rather than in a bigger piece of  legislation.  </p><p>But I want to go back quickly to the states issue.  Yes, the states are  going to have to take on a lot of responsibility here.  But you can argue  because of that, there will be more accountability in terms of the types of  projects that they do and that they have to take a look at things they  actually need rather than going back to the stimulus type package that we  had with little accountability and all of the federal government money just  getting dumped in for the sake of doing projects.  States are going to have  to take a look at what they actually need and make sure the money they are  putting on the table and the money they're getting from the federal  government is well spent to better their infrastructure in their states.  </p><p>BAIER:  Clearly, Bill, there is a process that is tough to go through if  you're trying to do any big project in any state, that the hoops that you  have to go through, that's what they're trying to affect.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes, but back to Katie's point, I think it's a good point.  You  know, if the federal government is going to pick up most of the tab,  there's not a lot of incentive for states to be careful about the money  being spent.  In New York, of course, we have this issue with the Gateway  project, the new tunnel and, you know, nine out of 10 people who would use  that are people like me, local commuters.  And so I would think, why should  someone in Mississippi have to pay for that, or have to pay for the bulk of  that?  </p><p>So I think we need -- what would be nice is a lot of reform that creates  incentives for states to focus on what they really need and start to pay  for it themselves.  </p><p>BAIER:  Donald Trump, the president today, had one company in his sights.   He tweeted out \"I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the  election.  Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state and local  governments, use our postal system as their delivery boy, causing  tremendous loss to the U.S., and are putting many thousands of retailers  out of business.\" Susan, it seems like he has Amazon, perhaps, in his  sights.  </p><p>PAGE:  He does, and there may be a variety of reasons why.  He's criticized  Amazon before, and linked Jeff Bezos who owns Amazon with \"The Washington  Post\" which he also owns.  And that -- some people think that's part of his  motivation for taking on Amazon.  </p><p>It is true that Amazon has been disruptive for a lot of small businesses in  communities, and that's a fair conversation to have.  It is not accurate to  say that Amazon does not collect sales tax, however.  Since last April,  April of 2017, so for the last year, Amazon has had a policy of collecting  sales tax wherever there are communities -- states where sales tax is  levied.  So that's a criticism that used to be made against Amazon that I  think is now a little out of date.  </p><p>BAIER:  Here's Steve Forbes asked about this kind of focusing in on one  company, a big company, Amazon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN:  Free markets will work in bringing  that company down just as it does with any other company over time.  I'm  old enough to remember G.M. when that was the big, bad company, IBM when  that was the big, bad company.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And Microsoft.  </p><p>FORBES:  Wal-Mart was going to take over the world.  Now it's struggling.   So let the free markets play out.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Katie?  </p><p>PAVLICH:  Yes, I understand the president's willingness and urge to level  the playing field certainly.  But if he's going after Jeff Bezos and Amazon  for personal reasons, then it's certainly an abuse of power.  Look, states  have taken this on themselves in terms of looking at the way that Amazon  does third party sales and implemented their own types of sales tax.  So I  also believe that the free market will come into play here.  </p><p>The other thing, too, is there is Supreme Court precedence for this going  back to the 1990s when catalogs were selling goods from state to state and  sales tax was not being paid in states that they were not actually located.   And the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the catalog.  Amazon is a little  bit different and the Supreme Court will hear a case in April dealing with  the tech side of that.  But we have seen that this is not just an Amazon  issue.  There is some legal precedent here about the taxes and the way that  they work when you're selling from a third party or from a different state.  </p><p>BAIER:  Lot of states and cities are courting Amazon for a big building  somewhere.  We'll see where that goes.  Panel, as always, thank you.  </p><p>When we come back, the lady doth protest, and so did her colleagues.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAIER:  Finally tonight, that's no way to treat a lady.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Whatever it is.  I can't remember what it is.  Isn't  that extraordinary?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson hit a nerve Tuesday when he  addressed parliament member Emily Thornberry by her spouse's title rather  than her preferred maiden name, then this happened.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's not lady something.  We know what her name is.   And it is inappropriate and frankly sexist to speak in those terms.  And  I'm not having it in this chamber.  No matter how senior a member, that  parlance is not legitimate.  It will not be allowed.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER:  Secretary Johnson did eventually apologize unreservedly for what he  called his inadvertent sexism.  Not having it in that chamber.  </p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.  That's it for this SPECIAL  REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid.  \"The Story\" with guest host Sandra  Smith starts right now.

Research conducted by McAfee found the use of \"fileless\" hacking, using scripts instead of programs, is rapidly growing. PowerShell is a sophisticated scripting engine that's frequently used by system administrators to automate common management functions. </p><p>PowerShell provides command-line access to almost all features of a Windows computer, including software installation, process management, configuration editing and various code execution capabilities. The deep OS-level integration of PowerShell makes it an ideal scripting language for admins working with Windows PCs. This same characteristic also renders it a highly attractive target for cyberattackers, who can craft PowerShell scripts to interfere with a system, extract data and run malicious commands.As reported by ComputerWeekly[1], McAfee Labs found[2] adoption of PowerShell malware soared over the past year. The number of observed attacks rose by 432%, a figure that suggests cybercriminals are moving away from traditional file-based attack vectors. Compared with placing malicious executables on a machine, a PowerShell exploit may be harder to detect and easier to deploy.READ NEXT: Sir Tim Berners-Lee calls for \"regulatory framework\" for big tech[3]Attacks that have used PowerShell to infiltrate systems include several Microsoft Office threats, crypto-jacking software and the Operation Gold Dragon[4] campaign against the 2018 Winter Olympics. McAfee said the latter was an \"exemplary\" example of the possibilities of PowerShell malware. The company said the tool is rapidly becoming a \"go-to\" option for cyberattackers crafting malware designed to go unnoticed.\"In 2017, McAfee Labs saw PowerShell malware grow by 267% in Q4, and by 432% year over year as the threat category increasingly became a go-to toolbox for cybercriminals,\" said McAfee[5]. \"The scripting language was irresistible, as attackers sought to use it within Microsoft Office files to execute the first stage of attacks.\"Mitigating PowerShell attacks can be difficult because the contents of malicious scripts can easily be obfuscated. Once it's running, a PowerShell script can disguise its operations and persist itself in a target system. Admins might not necessarily spot its existence, especially if they're already using legitimate PowerShell scripts on the same machine.Because PowerShell is preinstalled and enabled by default on Windows, attackers can count on it being always being available. McAfee said the best way to defend against script-based invasions is to provide training to users on spotting potential attacks.

A Fruit of the Loom moment could be just around the corner for Ireland. It's very, very worrying.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The figures around Ireland's dependence on multinational tech firms are certainly eye-opening. Between them, giants such as Apple, Google, Intel, Dell and Facebook now employ some 10pc of the country's workforce, a figure that puts tech ahead of farming for the first time.</p><p>Counting the indigenous businesses that supply the tech companies with services, the digital giants are now crucial for as much as a fifth of the 'real' Irish economy.</p><p>This penetration is continuing to grow as quickly as the tech firms' influence on our daily lives through what we see, hear and read.</p><p>But is Ireland becoming too dependent on foreign-based multinational tech firms which, in theory, could relocate to a cheaper base if they so decided? Moreover, what power do they now exercise over the Irish policymaking process as government officials and industrial strategists scramble to keep them based in Ireland in a post tax-break era? \"Can you imagine if Ireland woke up one day to an Apple or an Amazon or a Google announcing a major office elsewhere in Europe?\" says Cosgrave. \"Those companies and our politicians could try and cover over reality, but Ireland has been down this road too many times. The writing would be on the wall. The lights wouldn't switch off overnight. Much like Fruit of the Loom, it would signify a slow decade of decline for all of Ireland. Let's hope it never happens, as right now Ireland only has Plan A, which is multinationals, multinationals, multinationals.\"</p><p>And with great power comes great influence. Data from the Standards in Public Office Commission, together with some illuminating Freedom of Information results, give some idea as to what tech firms want and how they seek to get their agenda instilled. Google, for example, has lobbied figures within Government on 47 occasions the last two years. It has pressed positions on everything from the regulation of child safety issues online to digital surveillance issues, copyright reform and how the Government should react to upcoming EU data protection legislation.</p><p>Some of these were in the form of routine meetings with department officials, usually at assistant secretary level. However, others were far more pointed, involving face-to-face meetings with ministers up to, and including, the sitting Taoiseach of the day.</p><p>One typical instance cites a 2016 meeting where the company achieved face time with (then) Taoiseach Enda Kenny \"to brief Irish policymakers on Google's investment in Ireland and to encourage policies supportive of innovation\".</p><p>A similar lobbying encounter, involving Amazon's public policy chief John Midgley, frames it similar terms.</p><p>\"Amazon provided the Taoiseach with an overview of the company's presence in Ireland and supply chain, and there was a general discussion on issues related to Ireland's international competitiveness and economic development,\" say official documents regarding a face-to-face meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar late last year.</p><p>As Freedom of Information documents show, soft power is never far from the surface. In 2014, the powerful chief operating officer of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg, held a meeting with then Taoiseach Enda Kenny in Davos, Switzerland. After the meeting, Sandberg wrote to Kenny, gently reminding him the connection between \"reasonable\" policies and \"future investment\".</p><p>\"When it came to the European data protection regulation, you and your staff really internalised our concerns and were able to present them in a reasonable way, which has had a positive impact,\" wrote Sandberg.</p><p>\"We hope we can rely on you for your continued leadership on this regulation since we still have more work to do here. Along the same lines, I was pleased to hear that you are so involved in the OECD working group process on tax reform. These discussions will be very complicated and important, and we hope to be Warning: PHOTO:FRANK helpful to you identifying the implications with different options for future investment and growth in Europe. We are keen to collaborate with your office on this, just as we have on the DPR [data protection regulation].\"</p><p>She went on to praise the Taoiseach on Ireland's policy of having a \"collaborative\" data protection commissioner, the entity that regulates Facebook in much of its online activity across Europe.</p><p>\"It was helpful to hear how you are focused on finding a strong successor to Billy Hawkes, as data protection commissioner for Ireland. Billy will be a hard act to follow and we are hopeful that his successor will be someone who will establish a collaborative working relationship with companies like ours and be able to lead on the important issue of data protection compliance in Europe.\"</p><p>Kenny responded in kind, seemingly acknowledging the point Sandberg was trying to make.</p><p>\"One of the key challenges going forward for companies such as yours, is data protection,\" he wrote. \"I believe that it is of the utmost importance to work closely with our new data protection commissioner.\" This exchange was read in some quarters as a notso-subtle way of Facebook letting the Irish Government know what kind of data protection commissioner it preferred, a key issue for the tech giant in an era when the EU, led by Germany, was starting to push for tighter control over US web companies. Others argue that this sort of lobbying dialogue is perfectly legitimate for both the company pursuing it and the government listening. Facebook now employs 2,500 people in Dublin, goes the Cosgrave Mc GRATH argument, and is a magnet for tech companies to continue coming to Dublin, where they employ people at higher-than-average wages.</p><p>Some bosses of tech multinationals in Ireland say that interaction with government officials is usually done at a more routine pace.</p><p>\"Discussions are well received,\" says Aisling Keegan, vice president and general manager of Dell EMC in Ireland, a company which has experienced highs and lows in its operations here over the last 30 years \"There's a strong appetite for dialogue. We have various ministers in every couple of months when we have something to talk about or push. There's an acknowledgement of partnership. You have to make sure that the infrastructure we have is lending itself to a better working environment. I would say it's a very good relationship.\"</p><p>However, not every tech multinational firm here goes all in on lobbying. \"We wouldn't necessarily have regular contact with government officials or ministers,\" said Sinead McSweeney, head of Twitter's Irish operations and its vice president for public policy in Europe.</p><p>\"Lobbying is done to varying degrees. We find no great necessity. We have our business here which is regional across Europe. It's not entirely Ireland focused. That said, relations are healthy and professional with various regulatory bodies. There's a maturity in the way which our authorities do business here. They have a global mindset.\" McSweeney said that trade bodies such as Ibec are often used to parlay issues of concern on an industry basis.</p><p>So does any of this lobbying or 'soft power' interaction pay off? The tech firms' influence may be detected in some recent legal and regulatory decisions. Ireland, for example, will adopt the lowest end of the age scale this May when EU countries formalise a child's digital age of consent as part new European data protection laws. This was important to big tech companies such as Google and Facebook, for a variety of reasons.</p><p>(To be fair, while tech companies lobbied for this age to be enshrined in law for their own purposes, so did entities such as the Children's Rights Alliance and Dr Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children, arguing that it was unrealistic to set an older age and that kids of 13 have a right to be able to find information themselves on issues such as mental health.) The Government has also dragged its feet on the introduction of a (previously announced) new digital safety commissioner, something that may not be entirely welcome by tech giants operating in Ireland.</p><p>On issues such as data privacy, Ireland has historically been relatively lenient on companies found not to have adhered to current data protection law, with no more than a handful of prosecutions and minor fines pursued by the data protection commissioner here. The former data protection commissioner's ruling on Facebook - a clean bill of health amid controversy over some of its practices - still rankles in other European countries, which view social media platforms with more disdain. Indeed, it was disillusionment with the Irish agency's handling of Facebook issues that indirectly led to a trade crisis between the US and EU, when the European Court of Justice struck down the 'Safe Harbour' data agreement, a crucial transatlantic treaty.</p><p>Latterly, Ireland has taken a staunch stance alongside Microsoft in that company's judicial battle with US authorities seeking to recover emails from Microsoft servers in Ireland. On the merits of the case, which Ireland supports via an 'amicus' brief, the state's position is widely seen as righteous. But was that Ireland's motivation in jumping on board so quickly? Critics fear that even as the power and importance of the tech sector here grows, there is nothing like the regulation that the farming, retail, banking or hospitality sectors face.</p><p>That may mean Airbnb (which lobbied government and city officials over 40 times in the last two years) taking over large parts of Dublin's available housing availability or a creeping 'gig economy' mentality in conventional industries.</p><p>Even Ireland's trade unions, once the guardians of work practices for ordinary families, have stepped out of the way of technology firms with minimal union membership sought. (Political parties back this up, with none of Ireland's parties actively pursuing union recognition or participation in Ireland's tech giants.) When it comes to lobbying, there are some basic skills involved. It helps to have someone who knows how the system works. It's even better if you have someone on board who used to work in government, preferably at a high political level.</p><p>For example, Google has Ryan Meade, a former special advisor to Environment and Local Government Minister John Gormley between 2007 and 2011. Meade, who is currently the web giant's public policy director in place of Anne Rooney (who is on maternity leave), has extensive political contacts and experience.</p><p>In a similar vein, Facebook's lobbying lead in Ireland is Niamh Sweeney, a former special adviser to T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Eamon Gilmore.</p><p>Lobbying isn't always done directly by a company executive. Facebook, for instance, has used Dublin law firm Mason Hayes and Curran to lobby then Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald (and department assistant secretary Peter Mullan) on the reform of interception laws.</p><p>While Irish transparency and Freedom of Information laws limit the quantitative nature of lobbying efforts here, US disclosures give some idea of how much tech giants spend on the activity when they have to show receipts.</p><p>Figures this month show that Google spent around (EURO)14m last year lobbying the US government on issues such as how regulations would affect how ads appear on services such as YouTube. Similarly, Amazon spent (EURO)11m on efforts for more favourable conditions around online sales CONTINUED ON PAGE 4 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WHO LOBBIES FOR BIG TECH?

(In Ireland, Amazon representatives similarly lobbied Government ministers here on the importance of industry-friendly conditions for cloud computing firms.) Meanwhile, Facebook pumped almost (EURO)10m into making legislators and regulators see its side of the story amid the 'fake news' controversy that continues to engulf the world.</p><p>Most of these companies will regard the money as well spent. Some will point to results for other lobbying efforts, such as the massive windfall that tech giants won from the US government's one-off tax repatriation rate of 15pc, far below the standard US corporate tax rate.</p><p>But is it all becoming a little one-sided where Ireland is concerned? Or is the undoubted employment and skills boost that we get a fair exchange for evermore pervasive influence in our public governance and daily lives? \"The five largest companies in the world now generate so much tax revenue for Ireland that even our own Central Bank has warned repeatedly of our over-reliance on these companies,\" says Paddy Cosgrave.</p><p>\"There have been rumours in Silicon Valley and Brussels that some of the biggest tech companies are considering major offices elsewhere in Europe. I think a big part of Leo Varadkar's trip to Silicon Valley (last November) was to seek assurances about the future of these companies in Ireland. But unfortunately none of the big tech companies were prepared to give specific assurances.\"</p><p>Cosgrave is one of the most senior Irish tech figures yet to voice serious concern over Ireland's future industrial strategy and the basis on which it hopes to retain its most valuable employers. He is not alone. Several indigenous entrepreneurs are starting to voice similar criticism.</p><p>However, senior bosses of the tech multinationals in question dispute that their presence in Ireland is more fragile now than before, or that a change in tax law has changed their attitude.</p><p>Moving facilities to other countries from Ireland isn't under way, they insist.</p><p>\"I haven't seen any evidence of that happening,\" says Twitter vice president Sinead McSweeney.</p><p>\"All of the big companies continue to grow here. I haven't seen any about-face or signs of companies starting to move functions away. The tax thing is a narrative without much evidence of companies switching because of it. Because we live in a global market, obviously things can change with geopolitical shifts. But there are genuinely lots of reasons why companies choose Dublin, not just as a location but as a headquarters. When there's such a cluster of companies running functions from one location, with the diverse, rich talent pool that this brings, that's a factor that's not going to change overnight.\"</p><p>This view - that Ireland pulls its weight for multinational companies aside from any taxation or regulatory advantages it may benefit from here - is echoed by a number of other senior multinational tech bosses here.</p><p>\"Michael Dell has said the commitment to Ireland remains,\" said Dell EMC vice president Aisling Keegan. \"Every global function that exists in Dell, from a jobs perspective, is in Ireland. It's the largest footprint we have in Emea [Europe, Middle East, Africa]. You have to look at the capabilities we've built up here. We have functional expertise which we just don't have in other countries, supporting both global and European customers.\"</p><p>This, she says, includes advanced facilities for next-generation 'internet of things' technology, enterprise research centres and even a Dell bank.</p><p>\"If anything, the commitment is stronger now than it ever was. That's the importance we put on Ireland from a jobs perspective. We're hiring at the moment.\"</p><p>Ireland's biggest tech employer, Apple, makes the same point. While it has been at the forefront of world headlines over the 2016 (EURO)13bn tax ruling imposed by the European Commission, senior company executives - up to and including Tim Cook - still insist that Ireland remains a critical part of Apple's business planning.</p><p>Senior managers there point to its iMac factory in Hollyhill, Cork, which is Apple's only self-owned manufacturing facility around the world and a mainstay since the firm's original iteration here in 1980. \"It's often the team from this facility that is called upon to help out in other parts of the world,\" said one senior Apple manager. \"You have to understand that manufacturing skills are very scarce and specialised. What we have collected at this base is invaluable.\"</p><p>This theme - the concentration of skilled, older managers with years of critical experience - is a common one throughout Apple and a number of other large tech companies based in Ireland.</p><p>However, while all of these companies extol the virtues of their workforces, none deny that a large reason they first came to Ireland was associated with a fiscal advantage through tax.</p><p>Arguably, the European Commission's (EURO)13bn tax ruling against Apple in Ireland brought that era to a shuddering halt. There are no double Irish with Dutch sandwiches on the menu for them anymore. So what is it that they will continue to press Irish policy makers for? It's a question that Ireland may soon need to ask a little more vigorously.</p><p>\"Can you imagine if Ireland  ;  ;  woke up one day to an Apple  ;  ;  or an Amazon or a Google  ;  ;  announcing a major office  ;

He was joined by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Alphabet/Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook.</p><p>All appeared remotely because of the pandemic, reducing some of the drama of a crowded hearing room.</p><p>Under the disciplined leadership of Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., the committee focused on big issues: the enormous market power of these companies and their harm to competition; ways they weaken, snap up or destroy rivals; their danger to consumer privacy, and how data they collect is used.</p><p>As Cicilline put it in his opening remarks, \"Simply put: They have too much power. Their ability to dictate terms, call the shots, upend entire sectors and inspire fear represents the powers of a private government. Our founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\"</p><p>Also, Republicans, who typically go easy on antitrust issues, asked tough questions along with their Democratic colleagues on the committee. One hot-button issue for them is alleged censorship of conservative voices. Another was whether Big Tech is doing business with China, including allegedly peddling products made by slave labor.</p><p>Oh, and if you're wondering why you can't get Purell in the time of COVID-19? The hearing offered no answer to this supply chain mystery, but pump bottles of the coveted hand sanitizer were in abundant view on the committee dais.</p><p>The lawmakers (and their staffs) were admirably prepared on complex and highly technical topics. Still, the CEOs mostly denied, promised to get back to them or elided over uncomfortable topics.</p><p>As my colleague Benjamin Romano reported, Bezos faced some uncomfortable questions, especially from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who represents the district where Amazon's headquarters is located, and from Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania, both Democrats.</p><p>The only time I noticed Bezos thrown off balance, though, was when Jayapal brought up an April Wall Street Journal report detailing how the company gathered data from its third-party sellers to launch competing products.</p><p>Last year, an Amazon lawyer testified that \"we don't use individual seller data directly to compete\" with the third-party sellers on its platform.</p><p>However, on Wednesday, Bezos said, \"I can't answer that question yes or no.\" He said he couldn't guarantee Amazon's policy to protect the sellers had never been violated, but now the company was examining the issue \"very carefully.\"</p><p>Still, Amazon got off relatively lightly compared with criticism leveled against Google and Facebook.</p><p>Bezos was poised and as deferential and cooperative-seeming as possible for the world's richest person. He was far from John Pierpont Morgan's infamous 1901 quote, \"I owe the public nothing.\"</p><p>His opening statement was a paean to the American rags-to-riches story, the son first of a single mother and then a poor immigrant stepfather, starting a business out of his garage with no guarantee of success.</p><p>\"You earn trust slowly, over time, by doing hard things well - delivering on time; offering everyday low prices; making promises and keeping them; making principled decisions, even when they're unpopular; and giving customers more time to spend with their families by inventing more convenient ways of shopping, reading and automating their homes.\"</p><p>He said Amazon created more jobs than any other company over the past decade and now employs 1 million.</p><p>He also mentioned a program to help 100,000 Amazon workers gain training for in-demand fields.</p><p>Bezos cleans up well and should spend more time talking to the public like this, rather than remaining silent behind lawyers, PR people or no comments at all. Of course, he'd have to engage on uncomfortable topics such as lack of unionization, and the effect of speed and intensity on workers at Amazon warehouses (which are still coveted by most localities).</p><p>The Amazon CEO would do himself good to take the Giving Pledge spearheaded by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. The wealthy participants promise to give away at least half their wealth. MacKenzie Scott, Bezos' ex-wife, took it.</p><p>At the hearings, Bezos was in agreement with the other CEOs that their companies faced abundant and vigorous competition, including internationally. And maybe that's true seen through the lens of this moment, but certainly not compared with the American economy that existed even a few years ago.</p><p>But the bigness problem, which includes competition-stifling market power and even systemic risks to the economy, is not confined to tech. Overconcentration includes Walmart, the big banks, and such sectors as airlines, broadcasting, telecom, railroads, health care and food.</p><p>This grew up over decades of lax antitrust enforcement, where regulators looked mainly at the so-called consumer welfare standard. This was easily met  by giants offering convenience and low prices. The risks to  employment, unionization and disparate corporateheadquarters distributed broadly across the country were not relevant.</p><p>But they should be. Today's concentration is a big cause of rising inequality, stagnant incomes for most households and lower levels of business formation and innovation. To take one example, the national market share of the top three drugstore chains grew from 30% in 2002 to 67% in 2017. In 2018, the top four cellphone companies controlled 97% of the market - now it's three, Sprint being acquired by Bellevue-based T-Mobile.</p><p>The change in antitrust enforcement can be traced to the late 1970s, when deregulation began. In most cases, it opened the door to ever-larger companies controlling markets. Not surprisingly, the Federal Trade Commission stopped keeping and publishing data on industry concentration in 1981.</p><p>Will Wednesday's hearing resonate with most people? (You can watch on C-SPAN.) Political will and Democrats controlling both houses of Congress as well as the White House could break up this toxic concentration. This would require shedding the ideology that focused only on \"consumer welfare.\"</p><p>But a cynic would answer, \"The hearing will resonate until Americans buy the next item on Amazon that they found on Google using their iPhone and telling their friends on Facebook.\"</p><p>The \"cyberbarons\" aren't like the robber barons of the late 19th century railroads; the backlash against those created the Progressive movement and its historic reforms.</p><p>Bezos and his peers make life seem easy, amuse us, beguile us, keep us spending. The likes of J.P. Morgan are looking down with envy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-12985271</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GJ-6SC1-JBR8-500J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1139\"/><timeReceived>06:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Seattle Times Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

At the same time however, lurking on the Dark Web are fraudsters and rogue employees looking to ruin your festive shopping spree. </p><p>Commercial disputes lawyer and cyber-crime expert, Oliver Smith looks at combatting the festive online fraud onslaught.The winter holidays are the gift that keeps on giving for cyber criminals who thrive on popular promotional dates such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday and the January sale season. Indeed, theft of sensitive data from online businesses is a serious and growing problem, according to official figures for the High Court which show a 25% rise in data theft cases by disgruntled employees in 2016. Increased reliance on technology has made businesses more vulnerable to theft of large volumes of valuable data such as customer email addresses or other sensitive information like profit margins or passwords. The number of passwords consumers now have to remember means they, understandably, often use the same or similar passwords for many of their accounts. When one is compromised it can make other accounts vulnerable.There are, however, technical and legal solutions available to the savvy online retailer and shopper. Many big tech companies like Apple, Microsoft and Googleoffer encrypted password apps which will remember or create any number of complex different passwords for all your online accounts. The best part is that you only need to remember one password to use it. Meanwhile, there are many new software programs for businesses to help them police and protect their data. This will become particularly important when the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into operation on 25 May 2018 which makes certain individuals at companies responsible for data breaches and allows large fines based on a percentage of annual turnover.As a last resort, businesses may have to seek assistance from the courts by seeking an urgent interim injunction to stop a rogue employee using stolen data or selling it to a competitor. In extreme cases a judge may even allow solicitors, under supervision of another independent solicitor, to carry out an unannounced search of the ex-employee's home, new office or computers to find and preserve evidence of wrongdoing.But what about consumers?Shoppers concerned that a data breach may have affected them or led to them being defrauded online can contact the Information Commissioner's Office[1] online for help in securing their data or claiming compensation. If the matter is high value or urgent, an intellectual property solicitor should be consulted.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

The banks had reported eight \"major\" cyber-incidents since 2016, Cameron told the Senate banking committee on Feb. 28. Though none of those incidents affected the banks in a material way, she added that OSFI, Canada's banking regulator, also requires financial institutions to advise of \"noteworthy\" cyber-incidents, and it usually gets two or three of those per quarter.</p><p>Eliminating those risks isn't as simple as closing the digital door. Cameron said consumers have come to count on ongoing innovation in their banking services, noting that the shift from cash and cheques to e-transfers and tap-to-pay features was made possible \"because financial institutions have leveraged technology to develop highly integrated systems with a wide variety of partners.\"</p><p>But there are concerns they do not have a wide variety of partners available for all digital services, and that there could be problems if, for example, the banks all wound up using the same brand of anti-virus software, or the same data storage platform.</p><p>Carolyn Wilkins, the Bank of Canada's senior deputy governor, mentioned the third-party issue in a Feb. 8 speech at the G7 Symposium on Innovative and Inclusive Growth. The speech took special aim at the tech industry, with Wilkins saying the size and market dominance of some firms \"raise many of the usual concerns about the potential effects of monopoly power.\"</p><p>Wilkins also told her audience that one area where there could be a better strategy is in managing the risks related with a small group providing digital services to systemically important financial institutions.</p><p>\"Top of mind for me are the growing operational risks, including the cyber risks, from a very concentrated set of third-party service providers that our financial institutions use - cloud services or data aggregators,\" she said. \"We're going to need to judge wisely when it's best to use public policy tools to manage the risks, and when it's best to let private enterprise work its magic.\"</p><p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision noted in a February report that many banks and financial institutions have been partnering with \"bigtech\" firms, such as Amazon.com Inc. or Alphabet Inc.'s Google, \"which then become relevant third-party providers in the financial system.\"</p><p>Sean Mullin, executive director of the Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship, said that what he gleaned from Wilkins' comments was the possibility of a new area of risk, however unlikely it could be.</p><p>\"Because without knowing how these services are apportioned amongst banks and other institutions, we don't know how concentrated they are on the service-provider level,\" he said. \"And so if, let's say, all five banks and a bunch of insurance companies all happen to have used Amazon's cloud services, and that somehow got hacked, that would be one point of defence. That would then allow all the financial institutions' data from across the whole country to potentially be compromised.\"</p><p>It's a different concern from the one that usually comes up when big tech and banking are mentioned together, which is typically about the likelihood of a digital giant wanting to become a bank.</p><p>But banks, like other businesses, rely on third parties for some services, even simple ones such as keeping the lights on, and increasingly use technology companies, and big ones at that.</p><p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision noted in a February report that many banks and financial institutions have been partnering with \"bigtech\" firms, such as Amazon.com Inc. or Alphabet Inc.'s Google, \"which then become relevant third-party providers in the financial system.\"</p><p>The committee added: \"It will therefore be important to properly monitor and assess the concentration risk, given that bigtech firms could become systemically important.\"</p><p>Banks could snuff out the market risk from a fintech startup by buying it, but the same can't be said of tech companies with massive market caps. Those same tech companies are the ones banks could also turn to for relatively mundane services, such as storage.</p><p>\"We have basically an oligopoly that's forming in infrastructure around data management, around cybersecurity, around cloud storage, around computation, I would say, with all the platforms that are used for machine learning and data processing, data analytics,\" said Jean-Philippe Vergne, an associate professor and co-director of the Scotiabank Digital Banking Lab at the University of Western Ontario's Ivey Business School.</p><p>The regulators, he adds, see no reason to take action because the companies provide economies of scale, and the prices of these services keep decreasing, which makes banks and their customers happy.</p><p>***</p><p>Ottawa has recently announced a federal cybersecurity plan.</p><p>Canadian regulators have made it clear that they have not forgotten about third-party tech risks. For example, OSFI has a guideline for federally regulated financial institutions and their interactions with outside service providers.</p><p>A spokesperson for the regulator said federally regulated entities may have some flexibility, but they have \"ultimate accountability\" for their outsourced activities.</p><p>\"Furthermore, OSFI's supervisory powers should not be constrained, irrespective of whether an activity is conducted in-house, outsourced, or otherwise obtained from a third party,\" the spokesperson said in an email.</p><p>\"OSFI does monitor trends and developments related to third-party service providers and fintech and we expect institutions to have processes and controls in place to manage their risks, including those from potential concentration.\"</p><p>But OSFI, according to current legislation, is not mandated to regulate third-party service providers or fintechs. Any change to those marching orders would have to come via legislation.</p><p>The federal government has proposed a number of commitments aimed at bolstering cybersecurity, such as updating a national strategy.</p><p>Annette Ryan, an associate assistant deputy minister in the federal finance department, told the Senate banking committee that they have also been talking to partners in the G7 economies about third-party risks, which can come from another sector or industry.</p><p>\"Assessing those risks and planning measures to harden systems against those risks is actively underway,\" Ryan said.</p><p>The banking sector, like many others, is still wrestling with a big tech dilemma, including any third-party risks.</p><p>\"There will be new resources coming for those critical cyber systems, and then beyond that, we're trying to identify, well, what are the next wider set of concentric circles out?\" Ryan told the Senate committee, which is studying the issues and concerns around cybersecurity and cyber fraud.</p><p>Mullin sees that debate as one that is just starting.</p><p>\"And it's one that I think if there's an easy answer,\" he said, \"we'd be gravitating towards it by now.\"</p><p>Financial Post</p><p>.

The banks had reported eight \"major\" cyber-incidents since 2016, Cameron told the Senate banking committee on Feb. 28. Though none of those incidents affected the banks in a material way, she added that OSFI, Canada's banking regulator, also requires financial institutions to advise of \"noteworthy\" cyber-incidents, and it usually gets two or three of those per quarter.</p><p>Eliminating those risks isn't as simple as closing the digital door. Cameron said consumers have come to count on ongoing innovation in their banking services, noting that the shift from cash and cheques to e-transfers and tap-to-pay features was made possible \"because financial institutions have leveraged technology to develop highly integrated systems with a wide variety of partners.\"</p><p>But there are concerns they do not have a wide variety of partners available for all digital services, and that there could be problems if, for example, the banks all wound up using the same brand of anti-virus software, or the same data storage platform.</p><p>Carolyn Wilkins, the Bank of Canada's senior deputy governor, mentioned the third-party issue in a Feb. 8 speech at the G7 Symposium on Innovative and Inclusive Growth. The speech took special aim at the tech industry, with Wilkins saying the size and market dominance of some firms \"raise many of the usual concerns about the potential effects of monopoly power.\"</p><p>Wilkins also told her audience that one area where there could be a better strategy is in managing the risks related with a small group providing digital services to systemically important financial institutions.</p><p>\"Top of mind for me are the growing operational risks, including the cyber risks, from a very concentrated set of third-party service providers that our financial institutions use - cloud services or data aggregators,\" she said. \"We're going to need to judge wisely when it's best to use public policy tools to manage the risks, and when it's best to let private enterprise work its magic.\"</p><p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision noted in a February report that many banks and financial institutions have been partnering with \"bigtech\" firms, such as Amazon.com Inc. or Alphabet Inc.'s Google, \"which then become relevant third-party providers in the financial system.\"</p><p>Sean Mullin, executive director of the Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship, said that what he gleaned from Wilkins' comments was the possibility of a new area of risk, however unlikely it could be.</p><p>\"Because without knowing how these services are apportioned amongst banks and other institutions, we don't know how concentrated they are on the service-provider level,\" he said. \"And so if, let's say, all five banks and a bunch of insurance companies all happen to have used Amazon's cloud services, and that somehow got hacked, that would be one point of defence. That would then allow all the financial institutions' data from across the whole country to potentially be compromised.\"</p><p>It's a different concern from the one that usually comes up when big tech and banking are mentioned together, which is typically about the likelihood of a digital giant wanting to become a bank.</p><p>But banks, like other businesses, rely on third parties for some services, even simple ones such as keeping the lights on, and increasingly use technology companies, and big ones at that.</p><p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision noted in a February report that many banks and financial institutions have been partnering with \"bigtech\" firms, such as Amazon.com Inc. or Alphabet Inc.'s Google, \"which then become relevant third-party providers in the financial system.\"</p><p>The committee added: \"It will therefore be important to properly monitor and assess the concentration risk, given that bigtech firms could become systemically important.\"</p><p>Banks could snuff out the market risk from a fintech startup by buying it, but the same can't be said of tech companies with massive market caps. Those same tech companies are the ones banks could also turn to for relatively mundane services, such as storage.</p><p>\"We have basically an oligopoly that's forming in infrastructure around data management, around cybersecurity, around cloud storage, around computation, I would say, with all the platforms that are used for machine learning and data processing, data analytics,\" said Jean-Philippe Vergne, an associate professor and co-director of the Scotiabank Digital Banking Lab at the University of Western Ontario's Ivey Business School.</p><p>The regulators, he adds, see no reason to take action because the companies provide economies of scale, and the prices of these services keep decreasing, which makes banks and their customers happy.</p><p>***</p><p>Ottawa has recently announced a federal cybersecurity plan.</p><p>Canadian regulators have made it clear that they have not forgotten about third-party tech risks. For example, OSFI has a guideline for federally regulated financial institutions and their interactions with outside service providers.</p><p>A spokesperson for the regulator said federally regulated entities may have some flexibility, but they have \"ultimate accountability\" for their outsourced activities.</p><p>\"Furthermore, OSFI's supervisory powers should not be constrained, irrespective of whether an activity is conducted in-house, outsourced, or otherwise obtained from a third party,\" the spokesperson said in an email.</p><p>\"OSFI does monitor trends and developments related to third-party service providers and fintech and we expect institutions to have processes and controls in place to manage their risks, including those from potential concentration.\"</p><p>But OSFI, according to current legislation, is not mandated to regulate third-party service providers or fintechs. Any change to those marching orders would have to come via legislation.</p><p>The federal government has proposed a number of commitments aimed at bolstering cybersecurity, such as updating a national strategy.</p><p>Annette Ryan, an associate assistant deputy minister in the federal finance department, told the Senate banking committee that they have also been talking to partners in the G7 economies about third-party risks, which can come from another sector or industry.</p><p>\"Assessing those risks and planning measures to harden systems against those risks is actively underway,\" Ryan said.</p><p>The banking sector, like many others, is still wrestling with a big tech dilemma, including any third-party risks.</p><p>\"There will be new resources coming for those critical cyber systems, and then beyond that, we're trying to identify, well, what are the next wider set of concentric circles out?\" Ryan told the Senate committee, which is studying the issues and concerns around cybersecurity and cyber fraud.</p><p>Mullin sees that debate as one that is just starting.</p><p>\"And it's one that I think if there's an easy answer,\" he said, \"we'd be gravitating towards it by now.\"</p><p>Financial Post</p><p>.

The speech took special aim at the tech industry, with Wilkins saying the size and market dominance of some firms \"raise many of the usual concerns about the potential effects of monopoly power.\"</p><p>Wilkins also told her audience that one area where there could be a better strategy is in managing the risks related with a small group providing digital services to systemically important financial institutions.</p><p>\"Top of mind for me are the growing operational risks, including the cyber risks, from a very concentrated set of third-party service providers that our financial institutions use - cloud services or data aggregators,\" she said. \"We're going to need to judge wisely when it's best to use public policy tools to manage the risks, and when it's best to let private enterprise work its magic.\"</p><p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision noted in a February report that many banks and financial institutions have been partnering with \"bigtech\" firms, such as Amazon.com Inc. or Alphabet Inc.'s Google, \"which then become relevant third-party providers in the financial system.\"</p><p>Sean Mullin, executive director of the Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship, said that what he gleaned from Wilkins' comments was the possibility of a new area of risk, however unlikely it could be.</p><p>\"Because without knowing how these services are apportioned amongst banks and other institutions, we don't know how concentrated they are on the service-provider level,\" he said. \"And so if, let's say, all five banks and a bunch of insurance companies all happen to have used Amazon's cloud services, and that somehow got hacked, that would be one point of defence. That would then allow all the financial institutions' data from across the whole country to potentially be compromised.\"</p><p>It's a different concern from the one that usually comes up when big tech and banking are mentioned together, which is typically about the likelihood of a digital giant wanting to become a bank.</p><p>But banks, like other businesses, rely on third parties for some services, even simple ones such as keeping the lights on, and increasingly use technology companies, and big ones at that.</p><p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision noted in a February report that many banks and financial institutions have been partnering with \"bigtech\" firms, such as Amazon.com Inc. or Alphabet Inc.'s Google, \"which then become relevant third-party providers in the financial system.\"</p><p>The committee added: \"It will therefore be important to properly monitor and assess the concentration risk, given that bigtech firms could become systemically important.\"</p><p>Banks could snuff out the market risk from a fintech startup by buying it, but the same can't be said of tech companies with massive market caps. Those same tech companies are the ones banks could also turn to for relatively mundane services, such as storage.</p><p>\"We have basically an oligopoly that's forming in infrastructure around data management, around cybersecurity, around cloud storage, around computation, I would say, with all the platforms that are used for machine learning and data processing, data analytics,\" said Jean-Philippe Vergne, an associate professor and co-director of the Scotiabank Digital Banking Lab at the University of Western Ontario's Ivey Business School.</p><p>The regulators, he adds, see no reason to take action because the companies provide economies of scale, and the prices of these services keep decreasing, which makes banks and their customers happy.</p><p>***</p><p>Ottawa has recently announced a federal cybersecurity plan.</p><p>Canadian regulators have made it clear that they have not forgotten about third-party tech risks. For example, OSFI has a guideline for federally regulated financial institutions and their interactions with outside service providers.</p><p>A spokesperson for the regulator said federally regulated entities may have some flexibility, but they have \"ultimate accountability\" for their outsourced activities.</p><p>\"Furthermore, OSFI's supervisory powers should not be constrained, irrespective of whether an activity is conducted in-house, outsourced, or otherwise obtained from a third party,\" the spokesperson said in an email.</p><p>\"OSFI does monitor trends and developments related to third-party service providers and fintech and we expect institutions to have processes and controls in place to manage their risks, including those from potential concentration.\"</p><p>But OSFI, according to current legislation, is not mandated to regulate third-party service providers or fintechs. Any change to those marching orders would have to come via legislation.</p><p>The federal government has proposed a number of commitments aimed at bolstering cybersecurity, such as updating a national strategy.</p><p>Annette Ryan, an associate assistant deputy minister in the federal finance department, told the Senate banking committee that they have also been talking to partners in the G7 economies about third-party risks, which can come from another sector or industry.</p><p>\"Assessing those risks and planning measures to harden systems against those risks is actively underway,\" Ryan said.</p><p>The banking sector, like many others, is still wrestling with a big tech dilemma, including any third-party risks.</p><p>\"There will be new resources coming for those critical cyber systems, and then beyond that, we're trying to identify, well, what are the next wider set of concentric circles out?\" Ryan told the Senate committee, which is studying the issues and concerns around cybersecurity and cyber fraud.</p><p>Mullin sees that debate as one that is just starting.</p><p>\"And it's one that I think if there's an easy answer,\" he said, \"we'd be gravitating towards it by now.\"</p><p>Financial Post</p><p>.

Those same tech companies are the ones banks could also turn to for relatively mundane services, such as storage.</p><p>\"We have basically an oligopoly that's forming in infrastructure around data management, around cybersecurity, around cloud storage, around computation, I would say, with all the platforms that are used for machine learning and data processing, data analytics,\" said Jean-Philippe Vergne, an associate professor and co-director of the Scotiabank Digital Banking Lab at the University of Western Ontario's Ivey Business School.</p><p>The regulators, he adds, see no reason to take action because the companies provide economies of scale, and the prices of these services keep decreasing, which makes banks and their customers happy.</p><p>***</p><p>Ottawa has recently announced a federal cybersecurity plan.</p><p>Canadian regulators have made it clear that they have not forgotten about third-party tech risks. For example, OSFI has a guideline for federally regulated financial institutions and their interactions with outside service providers.</p><p>A spokesperson for the regulator said federally regulated entities may have some flexibility, but they have \"ultimate accountability\" for their outsourced activities.</p><p>\"Furthermore, OSFI's supervisory powers should not be constrained, irrespective of whether an activity is conducted in-house, outsourced, or otherwise obtained from a third party,\" the spokesperson said in an email.</p><p>\"OSFI does monitor trends and developments related to third-party service providers and fintech and we expect institutions to have processes and controls in place to manage their risks, including those from potential concentration.\"</p><p>But OSFI, according to current legislation, is not mandated to regulate third-party service providers or fintechs. Any change to those marching orders would have to come via legislation.</p><p>The federal government has proposed a number of commitments aimed at bolstering cybersecurity, such as updating a national strategy.</p><p>Annette Ryan, an associate assistant deputy minister in the federal finance department, told the Senate banking committee that they have also been talking to partners in the G7 economies about third-party risks, which can come from another sector or industry.</p><p>\"Assessing those risks and planning measures to harden systems against those risks is actively underway,\" Ryan said.</p><p>The banking sector, like many others, is still wrestling with a big tech dilemma, including any third-party risks.</p><p>\"There will be new resources coming for those critical cyber systems, and then beyond that, we're trying to identify, well, what are the next wider set of concentric circles out?\" Ryan told the Senate committee, which is studying the issues and concerns around cybersecurity and cyber fraud.</p><p>Mullin sees that debate as one that is just starting.</p><p>\"And it's one that I think if there's an easy answer,\" he said, \"we'd be gravitating towards it by now.\"</p><p>Financial Post</p><p>.

Our previous entry discussed the CCPA[1], energy[2], Brexit, and health privacy[3]. Next up: trends in GDPR enforcement.Out of all governmental agencies, state attorneys general are likely to have the greatest impact on privacy enforcement in 2020 for the average business. Over the past few years, state AGs have taken an increasingly active role in privacy and data security matters, using their broad consumer protection authority to enforce rapidly evolving state laws and investigate data security lapses. Even more recently, state AGs have begun to step out of their typical enforcement roles to pursue policy and legislative initiatives.Despite signs of momentum, Congress is unlikely to pass any major new national cybersecurity legislation this election year. </p><p>Companies are thus likely looking at another year where privacy and data security enforcement remains largely in the hands of state AGs. Here are three trends to watch out for in 2020.More AG notification laws.In order to wield their consumer protection authority, state AGs need to keep abreast of data breaches. It's no surprise that in 2019 we saw several states pass or expand legislation requiring that state AGs be notified after a cybersecurity incident (including Massachusetts[4], New York[5], Arkansas[6], Illinois[7], Oregon[8], Texas[9], and Washington[10]). We predict this trend will continue in 2020.Currently, upwards of twenty-five states require[1][11] some form of AG notification after a breach. Some notification statutes are triggered by the number of residents affected (as few as 250 residents in South Dakota[12], and as many as 1,000 in Arizona[13]), whereas others require disclosure no matter the size of the breach. The required contents of these notification can vary as well. For instance, in 2019 Massachusetts expanded its AG notification law[14] to require that companies disclose: A detailed description of the nature and circumstances of the breach; The number of Massachusetts residents affected; The person responsible for the incident, if known; The type of personal information compromised, including, but not limited to: Social Security number Driver's license number Financial account number Credit or debit card number or other data; Whether the company maintains a written information security program; All the steps the company has taken or plans to take relating to the incident, including updating the written information security program; Whether a report has been made to law enforcement and whether law enforcement is investigating the incident; and Where applicable, certification of credit monitoring services pursuant to Chapter 93H, section 3A.AG notifications add another layer of complexity to your breach response. If you experience a breach, you will need to track the relevant deadlines, and draft and send a notification that meets the statutory requirements applicable to your state. Depending on the state, the AG may also have some law-enforcement responsibility related to data breaches, meaning you could be looking at an investigation if your breach is severe.Because state laws in this area are constantly changing, it is important to stay current on breach notification laws in your state(s).Ramping up the pressure on federal regulators.In 2019, AGs in several states ramped up the pressure on federal regulators to police big tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Google. Over the last few years, there has been a growing feeling in many quarters that the federal government has adopted a laissez faire (and overly business-friendly) attitude toward consumer data privacy. Increasingly, state AGs and other state regulators are picking up the perceived slack at the federal level.For example, in June, nine state AGs and the District of Columbia sued to block the T-Mobile/Sprint merger[15], a move that later gained support from FTC and DOJ. In July, thirty-nine state AGs signed onto a letter[16] requesting that the FTC take several steps to better protect consumer privacy. More recently, on September 6, New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) announced[17] that a bipartisan coalition that would be investigating whether Facebook 'may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices or increased the price of advertising.' And on September 10, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) announced[18] that a bipartisan coalition of 50 attorneys general investigating Google's alleged market power in search and digital advertising as well as potential abuses of consumer privacy.Pressure from state AGs throughout 2019 likely contributed to the FTC's record-breaking $5 billion settlement with Facebook[19], its $175 million settlement with Google's YouTube[20] (where the FTC was joined by New York Attorney General's Office), and DOJ's recent announcement[21] that it was investigating all four big tech giants, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon. While Congress is unlikely to make any big legislative moves during an election year, we expect that won't stop state AGs from continuing to turn up the pressure in 2020.Increased power to state AGs.Finally, watch out for state laws that increase AGs' roles in data privacy and security enforcement. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a case in point. The law, which became effective January 1, 2020, authorizes the California attorney general's office to draft implementing regulations and bring enforcement actions. In October 2019, California AG Xavier Becerra released the long-awaited draft regulations[22]. Enforcement will begin six months after the regulations are finalized or on July 1, 2020, whichever comes first. We expect that other states will follow California's example and give their AGs greater privacy watchdog power.Another such example is the federal Mind Your Business Act[23], which was introduced by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) in October 2019. The Act allows state AGs to bring a civil action on behalf of residents if they have reason to believe residents' interests '[have] been or [are] being threatened or adversely affected' by a practice that violates the FTC regulations. Although the Act is unlikely to become law, it is indicative of the trend toward giving AGs greater enforcement tools[1][24] Including Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.

Up next: a look at trends in the energy space.Lists of 'top' things used to come in a standard size of 10: The 10 Commandments, 10 Things I Hate About You[1], David Letterman's Top 10[2], etc. There is even a Wikipedia page[3] dedicated to Top 10 lists. And then, for whatever reason, people started making Top 11 lists. I won't pretend to understand the origins of this internet phenomenon (other than to assume that some influential list-maker had an obsession with prime numbers), but I am not one to buck a trend. So, to keep this Year in Preview collection at the cutting edge of internet culture, I present this list of the Top 11 CCPA Developments to Watch Out for in 2020.Overview of the California Consumer Privacy ActThe California Consumer Privacy Act (the 'CCPA') is a landmark information privacy law enacted in late 2018. The Act is a big deal for businesses that collect consumers' personal information, for two main reasons. </p><p>First, the CCPA applies to a wide range of businesses across the country. It covers for-profit entities that 'do business' in California and meet certain revenue or data-collection criteria. That means a business located in another state that sells products or provides services to California residents through the internet may have to comply with the CCPA. Second, the CCPA gives California residents (known as 'consumers' under the law) rights to their personal information that are unprecedented in the United States. Consumers have the right to know certain information about how their data is collected, used, and shared; the right to delete their information in some circumstances; and the right to opt-out from the sale of their personal information. Businesses are required to make certain disclosures related to these rights and to establish processes for responding to consumer requests to exercise their rights.The CCPA goes into effect on January 1, 2020, and California's Attorney General has not yet promulgated final regulations to implement the law. The AG cannot enforce the law until six months after the regulations go into effect, or July 1, 2020 (whichever comes first). As of the date of this writing, there is still significant uncertainty along several fronts about what businesses need to do to comply with the law. This list touches on that uncertainty and highlights some other aspects of the CCPA to consider heading into 2020.11. Will the Attorney General Enforce Non-Compliance that Occurred Between January and July?Section 1798.185 of the CCPA prohibits the Attorney General from bringing 'an enforcement action . . . until six months after the publication of the final regulations issued pursuant to this section or July 1, 2020, whichever is sooner.' While this clause makes clear that we won't see any CCPA enforcement actions until the latter half of 2020, it leaves ambiguous whether those enforcement actions may cover conduct that occurred in the first half of the year. This could turn out to be an especially important ambiguity for companies that fail to comply with the Act on January 1. If the Attorney General brings an enforcement action against such a business, the business might be able to successfully argue that 1798.185 bars the action because the alleged non-compliance occurred before the July 1 enforcement date. Or, a court could take the position that the legislature intended to give businesses a six-month transition period during which non-compliance will not later be penalized.10. Will California Receive 'Adequate' Status Under the GDPR?The General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') is the European Union's data privacy law, and the CCPA is often compared to it. Both the GDPR and CCPA grant similar rights to individuals, but also contain significant differences. One key difference is that the GDPR restricts the transfer from a country within the European Economic Area to an outside country. Such transfers must be made subject to a method approved by European data privacy regulators, ostensibly to protect data subjects' privacy.One approved mechanism for transferring data is an adequacy decision. Under this mechanism, the GDPR permits cross-border data transfers when the European Commission has determined that the receiving country has an adequate data privacy regulatory regime. Very few countries have received such status.There is some speculation that the CCPA may allow California to receive an adequacy determination, though it is far from certain[4] that the state would meet the requisite criteria. If, however, California does receive an adequacy determination under the GDPR, it would mean that businesses in California would have an easier time receiving data transfers from the EEA than would businesses in the rest of the country. That advantage could become even more pronounced because the Court of Justice of the European Union is currently considering a case[5] that may invalidate two of the mechanisms for transferring data from the EEA to the U.S. currently in use: standard contractual clauses and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.9. What Does it Mean to 'Sell' Personal Information?The CCPA defines the term 'sale' or 'sell' broadly - very broadly. Any transfer of personal information from a business to a third party 'for monetary or other valuable consideration' counts as a sale. Cal. Civ. Code  1798.140(t). Since nearly all business relationships involve monetary or 'other valuable' consideration (the point of establishing a business relationship is usually to make money), nearly every transfer of personal information between businesses is arguably a sale. Yet, the CCPA's definition of 'sale' certainly has its outer boundaries.One key question regarding those boundaries is how they relate to online advertising. The working assumption is that when a content publisher (such as a streaming video platform) shares a user's personal information with an advertising network and the network uses that information to display targeted ads, the content publisher has 'sold' the personal information under the CCPA. But the ad-tech industry is complex, and not all transfers of personal information involved in the delivery of online advertisements necessarily constitute a sale; there is already disagreement about how the definition of 'sale' applies to online advertising.8. Will the IAB's CCPA Framework Withstand Regulatory Scrutiny?The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), a digital-ad industry group, has created a unique mechanism for the adtech industry to comply with consumers' right to opt out from the sale of their personal information under the CCPA. The IAB's CCPA Compliance Framework works like this:When a consumer opts out, the content publisher sends a digital signal to notify all of the downstream businesses associated with their advertising platform that the consumer has opted out. That signal triggers a series of contractual arrangements that turn the adtech businesses into 'service providers' to the content publisher. Under the CCPA, information shared between a business and service provider is not a sale, but there are restrictions surrounding how such information can be used by the service provider.The IAB Framework calls the relationship between the content publisher and the adtech business a 'Limited Service Provider' relationship. The idea is that when a consumer opts out from the sale of their information, the adtech company who still wants to display ads to the consumer becomes a service provider to the content publisher - but only for the purpose of displaying ads to that particular consumer. In other words, the service-provider relationship is limited to a single advertising transaction or series of transactions affecting a single consumer. The CCPA does not contemplate this type of relationship, and it is unclear how it will be viewed by the Attorney General. If the Attorney General decides that service provider relationships can't be tailored to specific transactions, then the digital ad industry may be in for a significant disruption.7. What Does it Mean to 'Do Business' in California?The CCPA applies to a company that meets certain criteria and 'does business' in California. Cal. Civ. Code  1798.140(c). Neither the CCPA nor the Attorney General's draft regulations define the term 'does business,' so some companies are left with uncertainty. Stakeholders should pay close attention to any enforcement actions in 2020 that involve a company with no physical presence in California but that sells products to consumers in the state. The working assumption is that the Act applies to such companies, in part because California legal provisions contain broad definitions of what it means to 'do business' in the state. But, early precedent on the issue will become important to determining how much contact with the state is enough to 'do business' for future, closer cases.6. What Industry Best Practices will Emerge?One of the questions I sometimes get from clients about the CCPA is 'what is everyone else doing?' It's a difficult question to answer because everyone is doing things differently. Lawyers (outside counsel, inside counsel, and interest group lawyers) have varying interpretations of the law and the regulations, and the CCPA interacts differently with different business and data-use models. As the Attorney General finalizes the regulations and the law goes into effect and starts getting enforced, best practices for complying with the CCPA will emerge across affected industries. Companies should pay particular attention to how CCPA disclosures in privacy policies read, how webforms for responding to consumer rights look, and whether their competitors have decided to extend CCPA rights to users outside of California.5. Will Other States Play Copycat?The CCPA is a big deal because California is the largest economy in the country and because the Act applies to a substantial percentage of big businesses that aren't physically located in the state. But California is just one state. There are 49 others - plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories - that have an interest in protecting their residents' information privacy. It would take just one state to enact a more restrictive information privacy law than the CCPA to create a new national standard, at least for businesses that collect personal information from residents across the country. For example, New York considered a bill[6] earlier this year that would have created more robust privacy protections than the CCPA offers. Will another state steal California's thunder in 2020? And if one does . . .4. Will the Feds Step Up?Calls for comprehensive federal information privacy regulation have intensified since the passage of the CCPA. Many of these calls have come from a surprising source: Big tech companies. Companies are concerned with the prospect of having to comply with 50 (+!) sets of data privacy regulations, and would rather deal with one federal law that preempts more restrictive state laws. The House and the Senate are busy with other things right now, but a deal on federal privacy regulation could be possible in 2020 after the November election while Congress is in a 'lame duck' session.3. How Many Consumers will Exercise their CCPA Rights?Another question that I sometimes get is whether a company should use manual or automated processes to respond to requests from consumers to exercise their CCPA rights. The right approach depends on a company's resources, technical capabilities, and the number of consumers from whom it collects personal information. The answer also depends on how many consumers will exercise their rights - especially the Right to Know and Right to Delete, both of which require locating and either deleting or disclosing information requested by the consumer.This is a difficult one to predict. There are 40 million people in California, and if a business chooses to extend CCPA rights to its users across the country, over 300 million in the U.S. Companies with large volumes of users may be inundated with requests when the law goes into effect on New Year's Day 2020; but requests may taper off thereafter.Interestingly, the draft regulations require companies that collect personal information from over 4,000,000 consumers to annually compile and disclose statistics about how many requests they receive. By December 31, 2020, we might actually have a good idea of how many consumers chose to exercise their new rights under the CCPA in 2020.2. Will the Legislature Let Key CCPA Amendments Sunset?California's legislature passed the CCPA with some haste in 2018. A CCPA-like ballot measure looked likely to pass in the November election, but at the eleventh hour the measure's sponsor - Californians for Consumer Privacy - struck a deal with the legislature to pull the ballot measure in exchange for the state enacting the CCPA. The last-minute deal resulted in a law with more than a few inconsistencies, ambiguities, and uncertainties that needed subsequent clarification. The legislature accordingly amended the CCPA several times in 2019. Most notably, California amended the Act to exempt information collected by businesses from employees and to exempt information collected in a business-to-business context. However, these amendments are scheduled to sunset on January 1, 2021. Will the legislature extend the exemptions, or decide that CCPA rights should apply to employees and to business-to-business relationships?1. Will CCPA 2.0 Become Law?Californians for Consumer Privacy see the CCPA as just the start for consumer privacy protections in California. In November 2019, the group filed a new privacy initiative that it wants to place on the ballot in November 2020. The California Privacy Rights Act - which is colloquially being called CCPA 2.0 - would create new consumer rights regarding sensitive personal information, geolocation data, algorithmic decision-making, and more. CCPA 2.0 would also create a dedicated regulatory agency called the California Privacy Protection Agency to enforce consumers' privacy rights.Just as businesses are beginning to get the hang of complying with the CCPA, they may have to start thinking about complying with CCPA 2.0.

Some in the group<br/>also are pushing for a recommendation on liability protection<br/>for companies that invest in cyber security.<br/>\"We all donated our ideas, and then they'll be consolidated into<br/>one readable document and sent to the White House,\" said William<br/>Crowell, current CEO of Cylink and former deputy director of the<br/>National Security Agency.</p><p>Companies besides Cylink that participated in the joint<br/>discussions included Applied Materials, Cisco Systems,<br/>Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Sun Microsystems, while academic<br/>institutions represented included Dartmouth College and Stanford<br/>University.<br/>The attempt to draft a consensus is significant because<br/>high-tech companies rarely have commented on cyber security as a<br/>group. The White House Office of Cyberspace Security is<br/>soliciting public comments on the strategy until Nov. 18.<br/>Individually, Crowell has publicly said that while the strategy<br/>is a good roadmap for securing computer systems, there is no<br/>\"carrot or stick\" to induce companies to adopt it. Hence he<br/>supports targeted tax incentives for companies that spend money<br/>on specific network security applications.<br/>Richard Clarke, head of the Office of Cyberspace Security, said<br/>last week that the White House Office of Management and Budget<br/>is reluctant to back tax incentives because they would take<br/>dollars out of already slim federal budgets and the federal<br/>government could not be sure the money is spent on computer<br/>security.<br/>\"I don't think the tax incentive should be provided for security<br/>services \u2026 such as vulnerability assessments but rather for<br/>real, applied security,\" Crowell said in response to Clarke's<br/>comments.<br/>Crowell underscored that he does not believe government<br/>regulation should be used to convince companies to adopt<br/>computer security. \"I'm not advocating regulation because one<br/>size doesn't fit all\" when it comes to computer security, he<br/>said.<br/>He added that a better approach, besides tax incentives, would<br/>be a requirement by the Securities and Exchange Commission that<br/>public companies disclose efforts to secure their systems.<br/>Crowell also noted that the government, through an agency such<br/>as the National Institute of Standards and Technology, could<br/>develop one standard for security products for the private<br/>sector to help businesses choose what products to buy.<br/>Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard both confirmed that their<br/>scientists attended the Oct. 7 meeting, but the scientists were<br/>not immediately available to comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source

A puzzle where you fill in the blanks with the principal characters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Every week, another big company somehow gets hacked or accidentally releases the usernames, passwords, Social Security numbers, or much worse into the proverbial wild. Sensitive data for millions of Americans becomes exposed regularly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is an unfortunate reality of cybersecurity, or the lack thereof, in 2019.</p><p>It is not only a problem for big tech companies, though. Local businesses around Philadelphia deal with these threats every day. IT departments have become a focal point for data security throughout the city's law firms, accounting firms, and the like.</p><p>\"It remains an ongoing challenge,\" said Mark Green, Director of Information Technology at Isdaner &amp; Company, a local accounting firm. \"There's no silver bullet, there's no one solution that is sort of a cure-all for cybersecurity. The challenge for companies like my firm is that we have to remain vigilant. We have to continue to change with the growing cybersecurity threat landscape.\"</p><p>There is an interesting disparity of worry, too. Many in the baby boomer generation who did not grow up with the Internet are troubled by every news update, and for good reason. Meanwhile, also understandably, the younger generations are more apathetic. When you read those headlines every week, are they actually news by the fourth or fifth one? You have entered your data so many times into so many different sites.</p><p>\"The younger generation, because they have a better grasp of technology and they're certainly more intuitive to using technology, they don't view security and privacy the same way as the older generations,\" Green said. \"We have clients that give very little thought to security. We have those who give a great deal of thought to security. We have to make sure that across the board, when we say that your data is secure, we're doing everything in our power to make sure that we're doing just that.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROTECTING DATA</emphasis></p><p>Mark McCreary, Chief Privacy Officer at local law firm Fox Rothschild, said that as life becomes more and more Internet-centric some people just assume their data is out there to be had, unfortunately.</p><p>\"We're numb to it. No one quits shopping at Target because their card was compromised. We've kind of come to expect it,\" McCreary said. \"You can only stop a hacker so much. It's true, unfortunately. I don't know a company that will say it can't be hacked.\" The one site that triggers anger - at least these days - across all age groups: Facebook. It is never a good look when story after story has come out about how Facebook is selling data as the company's CEO is appearing in front of multiple governing bodies across the world, trying to defend Facebook's involvement in election interference.</p><p>\"The interesting thing is, they don't share any more data than Google,\" McCreary said. \"They just have a bad reputation right now.\"</p><p>These concerns are not going away any time soon. As the Internet invades myriad devices around us in our daily lives - smart speakers, doorbell cameras, home security systems, even refrigerators - there are more opportunities for security breaches to happen.</p><p>\"Those things are Internet-aware, but they are produced by appliance companies, not technology companies,\" Green said. \"The same amount of security and thought put into security does not go into securing those devices. Those same devices are then introduced to a person's home network, where your data resides. You create a weak point in security to your home network.\"</p><p>There are ways to fight back, however.</p><p>Green said in the IT world, issuing patches and software updates is not the main route to fixing these problems anymore. Analytics and behavior analysis - on both people and machines - is the most effective security strategy today.</p><p>\"The shift became less on the preventive side, and more on the detective side. We mitigate what's detected,\" Green said. \"With machine analytics, there's a layer of security where you get to study the behavior of the user's activity, or the behavior of a machine. Often times, with those models in place, you can almost proactively determine where your next threat is going to be. Or, in a very fast way, you can do some detective work and realize if there's been a problem or a potential problem.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIG FINES POSSIBLE</emphasis></p><p>On a broader scale, the European Union recently passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016, which implements harsh penalties on companies who share customers' data without their knowledge. It is seen as an extreme, but effective, measure to ensure individuals' privacy as they search the web.</p><p>The law went into effect in May 2018 and has already levied huge fines. Particularly noteworthy was Google's hefty $57 million fine for violating the protocol.</p><p>\"It's not that they didn't try to warn consumers about their data practices. They did,\" McCreary said. \"They didn't get extreme with consumers. You have to spell out how their data will be used. [The fine] was really severe.\"</p><p>Momentum is gaining for a similar law to go into effect in the United States. In early February, tech giant Cisco joined Apple, Microsoft and others in calling for an American version of GDPR to happen sooner rather than later.</p><p>\"How will that impact the United States business? It's a hard adoption,\" Green said. \"[The United States has] been lax when it comes to data privacy and security. For many companies, it's going to be a significant investment in retraining, adopting, and even retrofitting technology to help the client.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-PHQP20190224Ar05802</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VH0-8G51-JC3R-B38C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"926\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 24, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In fact, in Latin America, 96% of organizations have implemented some kind of telework modality. On the workers' side, for example, in Spain 93% of people considered in a survey say they want to telework. During the Secure Data Forum, organized by the technology company Kingston at the regional level, Miguel Zlosilo, head of studies at the Ministry of Communications of the Government of Chile released the aforementioned data and said that telework has \"positive and negative externalities\". For example, the time people save without having to move is an advantage. </p><p>One disadvantage is that sometimes it is difficult to separate working time from staff. Zlosilo added that in Chile, \"as a government telework is being promoted. A law was launched and people respond that this contributes to them and improves their quality of life,\" he said, adding that the trend is very big as even the big tech giants have stated that they will maintain telework conditions until at least the first months of 2021. Another trend that is expected to grow exponentially is that of e-commerce. Citing YouGov, Miguel Zlosilo said that between 60% and 80% of respondents avoid public places. Of these percentages, between 40% and 60% of people, when they leave, avoid touching objects in public spaces. \"That affects physical retail stores. That's why the strong trend will be e-commerce.\" In these scenarios, what about the multiplicity of users, are public communications networks efficient? are transactions secure to make purchases derived from ecommerce?. What is a fact is that more and more technological systems capable of providing safe and efficient work platforms will be needed. Security levels Jos\u00e9 Luis Fernandez, Technology Manager for Kingston Technology Cono Sur identifies three pillars of security: at the software, hardware and policy level. Beyond traditional companies offering antivirus and antimalware solutions to their employees (i.e. software-level protection), it must be complemented by other actions. \"With software alone it is not enough, policies are needed,\" Fernandez said, referring to the need for no regulations and rules and no successful policies that workers enforce, it is very difficult to have real security. \"For example, we've seen companies buy secure pendrives, but if people don't use it, there are no successful implementations.\" The specialist noted that there is ignorance of the tools that people have at their fingertips to keep the information safe. And, at the enterprise level, \"what we see is that very few companies put security into this new telework ecosystem.\" For less than $100, Fernandez said, you can implement a system that supports hardware data encryption. But, companies \"don't get into this out of ignorance, because they think it's too expensive and because they think they're going to kill productivity.\" And it is at the hardware level that great advances in computer security can be made. What it's all about is implementing systems that complement each other.  That is, in addition to installing efficient software, appropriate policies, it is also important that users' hardware is secure. New generation of SSD ready to be encrypted Previously, experts explain, encrypting a mechanical disk took hours, perhaps that's why organizations are reluctant to encrypt their workers' machines. The reality is that today, with the newtechnologies, protecting data takes seconds. In this age of telework where there is a big boost to the issue of upgrades, an upgrade to use solid-state memory-based storage or SSD can be an investment that will return many security and productivity benefits. For example, Kingston SSDs support encryption protocols. Thus, the SSD, through a centralized enterprise console, can set necessary security policies for organizations. \"Our solid-state drives are compatible with computer equipment of any brand, performance is not sacrificed, they are safe and can be managed remotely through an end point,\" Fernandez said. He added that there are also USB that are encrypted, \"Kingston has models to, for example, link them to the company console to see where they are being used, and even reset them.\" This is very important because, according to Paulino Calder\u00f3n, founder of computer security company Websec, there are hacker groups that are looking to breach organizations of all kinds, even those that are working on health issues and even some related to the development of Covid vaccines. \"That shows that we should all be vigilant, both the big organizations that have intellectual property information to the people who believe their information is not relevant to hackers.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-13807501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K8-0JD1-DY1R-B2F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"798\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The proposed EU Cybersecurity Directive will extend security regulation beyond the confines of personal data and telcos. Operators of critical infrastructure will be aff ected, as will online platforms that support other online services.</p><p><br/><br/>Is anyone unsure about the EU agenda for cyber and data security? If you want some insight you could easily check the UK Information Commissioner's website and you see that in 2012 over 20 data controllers were hit with big fines for security breaches affecting personal data.<br/><br/>Or you could rewind to January 2012, when the EU published the Draft General Data Protection Regulation, which will impose mandatory breach disclosure on every data controller operating in the EU, backed up with potential fines of up to 2% of annual worldwide turnover for those organisations who fail badly.<br/><br/>Or you could go back a little further still, to October 2009, when the EU introduced the mandatory breach disclosure rule for telcos and ISPs, which has been operating since early 2011.<br/><br/>Actually, you don't need to do any of that. Instead, just focus on the draft EU Cybersecurity Directive, which was published on 7 February 2013. It's a short document, easy to get to grips with, and within a few minutes the implications will be obvious to you.<br/><br/>The new Directive makes it compulsory for all \"market operators\", including utilities, transport and financial services businesses, as well as public authorities who use \"network and information systems\" within their businesses to implement technical and organisations measures to manage cyber risks. These organisations will be subject to independent regulation, they will have to disclose security breaches to the regulators, they will have to submit to compulsory regulatory audits and they will be sanctioned if they fail to comply with the law.<br/><br/>The scope and magnitude of this new Directive is huge. Obviously, the regulation of cyber risks in utilities, transport, financial services and public authorities is massive in its own right, but it's the wider concept of \"market operator\" that really needs to be looked at.<br/><br/>A market operator includes a provider of information society services \"that enable the provision of other information society services\".<br/><br/>Information society services are colloquially called ecommerce services in the EU, but this is about much more than online shopping, because in the EU an information society service is essentially a service that is provided over the internet, whether or not a fee is charged. In other words, an information society service can be a shopping site, a social network, a search engine, or an \"over the top\" communications systems (like Skype) and so on, whether or not they are web or app based.<br/><br/>Looking again at the definition of market operator, what really counts is whether the information society service is supporting another information society service. Our privacy blog, privacylawblog.ffw.com[1], is an information society service, but it's not supporting another, so it's not caught by the Cybersecurity Directive. What the Directive is looking for is the platform of support - if you are a platform for an ISS, then you are regulated.<br/><br/>If all of this sounds too complicated, don't worry, the Directive provides some indicative examples. These are: ecommerce platforms, internet payment gateways, social networks, search engines, cloud computing services and application stores.<br/><br/>This is an incredible list and the magnitude of the Directive becomes obvious when you start adding names to the list:<br/><br/>ecommerce platform = Amazon and eBay provide market platforms for traders and iTunes has to be captured too<br/>internet payment gateways = PayPal is the most obvious one, but there loads of others, like Worldpay<br/>social networks = Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and so on<br/>search engines = Google<br/>cloud = basically every tech co in the World!!!<br/>application stores = I think Apple has one (!), Google too, Amazon again and what about the telcos ... isn't Blackberry launching one now too?<br/><br/>This seems quite incredible at first, but it's real. And its obvious really, isn't it, because it is the Cybersecurity Directive after all! It wouldn't deserve this name if it didn't regulate these household names.<br/><br/>There is a lot to like in the Directive, but businesses will have concerns about the nature of regulation and the competence of the regulators. There are also some worrying grey areas in the Directive, such as the delegation of many powers to quangos, which is never good for legal certainty. I would expect many big tech companies to be looking hard at how to engage with the EU on this, because there is much to be shaped-up.<br/><br/>But wrapping this altogether and tying up the various strands, what we see within the EU is radical lawmaking for security. Any organisation that misses this point will come unstuck. That's why the law is being reformed, specifically to cause behavioural change. Whether you look at security from a data protection angle or a cyber angle, it does not matter; you just have to be more secure.<br/><br/>I've posted a diagram below which shows the core legal pillars for data and cybersecurity in the EU, now and coming. What you are seeing here is a coalescence of approach and obligation. The end game is a single legal test - take appropriate technical and organisational measures to secure your networks and data. That's the European approach.<br/><br/><br/>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.<br/><br/> Mr Stewart Room<br/>Field Fisher Waterhouse<br/>35 Vine Street<br/>London<br/>EC3N 2AA<br/>UNITED KINGDOM<br/> Tel: 2078614000<br/>Fax: 2074880084<br/><br/>E-mail: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:publications@ffw.com\">publications@ffw.com</email>;<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Jack.cooke@ffw.com\">Jack.cooke@ffw.com</email>;<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hannah.perry@ffw.com\">hannah.perry@ffw.com</email>;

In fact, in Latin America, 96% of organizations have implemented some kind of telework modality. On the workers' side, for example, in Spain 93% of people considered in a survey say they want to telework.</p><p><br/><br/>During the Secure Data Forum, organized by the technology company Kingston at the regional level, Miguel Zlosilo, head of studies at the Ministry of Communications of the Government of Chile released the aforementioned data and said that telework has \"positive and negative externalities\". For example, the time people save without having to move is an advantage. One disadvantage is that sometimes it is difficult to separate working time from staff.<br/><br/>Zlosilo added that in Chile, \"as a government telework is being promoted. A law was launched and people respond that this contributes to them and improves their quality of life,\" he said, adding that the trend is very big as even the big tech giants have stated that they will maintain telework conditions until at least the first months of 2021.<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>Another trend that is expected to grow exponentially is that of e-commerce.<br/><br/>Citing YouGov, Miguel Zlosilo said that between 60% and 80% of respondents avoid public places. Of these percentages, between 40% and 60% of people, when they leave, avoid touching objects in public spaces. \"That affects physical retail stores. That's why the strong trend will be e-commerce.\"<br/><br/>In these scenarios, what about the multiplicity of users, are public communications networks efficient? are transactions secure to make purchases derived from ecommerce?. What is a fact is that more and more technological systems capable of providing safe and efficient work platforms will be needed.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Security levels</emphasis><br/><br/>Jos\u00e9 Luis Fernandez, Technology Manager for Kingston Technology Cono Sur identifies three pillars of security: at the software, hardware and policy level.<br/><br/>Beyond traditional companies offering antivirus and antimalware solutions to their employees (i.e. software-level protection), it must be complemented by other actions.<br/><br/>\"With software alone it is not enough, policies are needed,\" Fernandez said, referring to the need for no regulations and rules and no successful policies that workers enforce, it is very difficult to have real security. \"For example, we've seen companies buy secure pendrives, but if people don't use it, there are no successful implementations.\"<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>The specialist noted that there is ignorance of the tools that people have at their fingertips to keep the information safe. And, at the enterprise level, \"what we see is that very few companies put security into this new telework ecosystem.\"<br/><br/>For less than $100, Fernandez said, you can implement a system that supports hardware data encryption. But, companies \"don't get into this out of ignorance, because they think it's too expensive and because they think they're going to kill productivity.\" And it is at the hardware level that great advances in computer security can be made.<br/><br/>What it's all about is implementing systems that complement each other. \u00a0That is, in addition to installing efficient software, appropriate policies, it is also important that users' hardware is secure.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New generation of SSD ready to be encrypted</emphasis><br/><br/>Previously, experts explain, encrypting amechanical disk took hours, perhaps that's why organizations are reluctant to encrypt their workers' machines. The reality is that today, with new technologies, protecting data takes seconds.<br/><br/>In this age of telework where there is a big boost to the issue of upgrades, an upgrade to use solid-state memory-based storage or SSD can be an investment that will return many security and productivity benefits.<br/><br/>For example, Kingston SSDs support encryption protocols. Thus, the SSD, through a centralized enterprise console, can set necessary security policies for organizations.<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>\"Our solid-state drives are compatible with computer equipment of any brand, performance is not sacrificed, they are safe and can be managed remotely through an end point,\" Fernandez said.<br/><br/>He added that there are also USB that are encrypted, \"Kingston has models to, for example, link them to the company console to see where they are being used, and even reset them.\"<br/><br/>This is very important because, according to Paulino Calder\u00f3n, founder of computer security company Websec, there are hacker groups that are looking to breach organizations of all kinds, even those that are working on health issues and even some related to the development of Covid vaccines.<br/><br/>That shows that we should all be vigilant, both the big organizations that have intellectual property information to the people who believe their information is not relevant to hackers.\"<br/><br/> \u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-13819817</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KF-YYP1-DY1R-B0R1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"793\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Tecnolog\u00eda</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Last year's report identified cybersecurity, consumer-facing technology, and predictive analytics as the top three HIT areas of focus for 2018.</p><p>\"While consumerism and analytics remain hot topics in healthcare, it was not surprising to see telehealth and interoperability rise in the minds of health IT executives for 2019,\" states the report. \"Policymakers, in particular, have emphasized telehealth and interoperability in the past year, and the threats of cyberattacks and data breaches are constant in healthcare.\"</p><p>Not surprisingly, spending on cybersecurity will increase for the second year in a row as health systems attempt to bolster their defenses against cybercriminals. In the survey, 87 percent of respondents indicated that they expect to increase spending on cybersecurity in 2019, with nearly half expecting an increase of greater than 5 percent, while no health system is expecting to decrease spending.</p><p>Among healthcare execs, the most commonly cited cybersecurity challenge was employee education-62 percent of respondents named \"staff\" as the greatest potential vulnerability, with phishing and spear-phishing topping the list of the most common types of cyberattacks over the past 12 months.</p><p>\"Despite increasing financial investment and prioritization of cybersecurity at health systems, executives did not express robust confidence in their organization's IT recovery and business continuity plans after an attack or breach,\" notes the report. \"Seven out of 10 respondents reported being \"~somewhat confident' in their recovery and continuity plans; only 20 percent said they were \"~very confident.'\"</p><p>Also See:Survey finds many providers fall short on security preparedness</p><p>Execs in the survey also indicated that a lack of interoperability has made it more difficult for health systems to address certain key IT priorities such as improved efficiency, cost reduction, and advanced analytics. In the \"other\" category, survey respondents included closing the care gap, collecting longitudinal patient data, and integration with non-owned partners.</p><p>While a lack of interoperability was cited as a barrier to achieving certain IT priorities, when execs were asked if their organization's use of major electronic health record vendors was stifling innovation, 61 percent answered no.</p><p>\"This was a surprising finding that appeared to conflict with the comments provided by executives in the qualitative interviews,\" the report observed. \"There also may be some hesitance on the part of informatics executives to admit problems with infrastructure their health systems have spent millions of dollars to stand up.\"</p><p>Other key findings from the survey include:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>HIT leaders overwhelmingly expect government and commercial reimbursement to provide the majority of funding for telehealth services by 2022; internal funding and patient payments are expected to provide the majority of funding for telehealth in 2019.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>70 percent of responding executives said they were \"somewhat concerned\" about big tech companies, such as Apple, Amazon and Google, disrupting the healthcare market; 10 percent were \"very concerned.\"</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>\"Health systems are making the leap to offer telehealth services, despite the nebulous economics of offering such services,\" states the report. \"Most health system executives interviewed for this study said their health system had not yet calculated a specific return on investment (ROI) for telehealth. But systems are investing anyway as a hedge that future reimbursement will outweigh the potential losses of today.\"</p><p>When it comes to big tech companies-such as Apple, Amazon, and Google-entering the healthcare space, the overarching concern among execs about these behemoths was their ability to offer a better consumer experience-an area where many health systems are feeling vulnerable.</p><p>\"The biggest threat is if these companies get between us and the end consumer.

Last year's report identified cybersecurity, consumer-facing technology, and predictive analytics as the top three HIT areas of focus for 2018.</p><p>\"While consumerism and analytics remain hot topics in healthcare, it was not surprising to see telehealth and interoperability rise in the minds of health IT executives for 2019,\" states the report. \"Policymakers, in particular, have emphasized telehealth and interoperability in the past year, and the threats of cyberattacks and data breaches are constant in healthcare.\"</p><p>Not surprisingly, spending on cybersecurity will increase for the second year in a row as health systems attempt to bolster their defenses against cybercriminals. In the survey, 87 percent of respondents indicated that they expect to increase spending on cybersecurity in 2019, with nearly half expecting an increase of greater than 5 percent, while no health system is expecting to decrease spending.</p><p>Among healthcare execs, the most commonly cited cybersecurity challenge was employee education-62 percent of respondents named \"staff\" as the greatest potential vulnerability, with phishing and spear-phishing topping the list of the most common types of cyberattacks over the past 12 months.</p><p>\"Despite increasing financial investment and prioritization of cybersecurity at health systems, executives did not express robust confidence in their organization's IT recovery and business continuity plans after an attack or breach,\" notes the report. \"Seven out of 10 respondents reported being \"~somewhat confident' in their recovery and continuity plans; only 20 percent said they were \"~very confident.'\"</p><p>Also See:Survey finds many providers fall short on security preparedness</p><p>Execs in the survey also indicated that a lack of interoperability has made it more difficult for health systems to address certain key IT priorities such as improved efficiency, cost reduction, and advanced analytics. In the \"other\" category, survey respondents included closing the care gap, collecting longitudinal patient data, and integration with non-owned partners.</p><p>While a lack of interoperability was cited as a barrier to achieving certain IT priorities, when execs were asked if their organization's use of major electronic health record vendors was stifling innovation, 61 percent answered no.</p><p>\"This was a surprising finding that appeared to conflict with the comments provided by executives in the qualitative interviews,\" the report observed. \"There also may be some hesitance on the part of informatics executives to admit problems with infrastructure their health systems have spent millions of dollars to stand up.\"</p><p>Other key findings from the survey include:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>HIT leaders overwhelmingly expect government and commercial reimbursement to provide the majority of funding for telehealth services by 2022; internal funding and patient payments are expected to provide the majority of funding for telehealth in 2019.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>70 percent of responding executives said they were \"somewhat concerned\" about big tech companies, such as Apple, Amazon and Google, disrupting the healthcare market; 10 percent were \"very concerned.\"</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>\"Health systems are making the leap to offer telehealth services, despite the nebulous economics of offering such services,\" states the report. \"Most health system executives interviewed for this study said their health system had not yet calculated a specific return on investment (ROI) for telehealth. But systems are investing anyway as a hedge that future reimbursement will outweigh the potential losses of today.\"</p><p>When it comes to big tech companies-such as Apple, Amazon, and Google-entering the healthcare space, the overarching concern among execs about these behemoths was their ability to offer a better consumer experience-an area where many health systems are feeling vulnerable.</p><p>\"The biggest threat is if these companies get between us and the end consumer. If there is a platform regulated and controlled by someone other than us-that makes us nervous,\" a CEO commented. \"There are many places where some of these new platforms and conveniences can and will likely succeed-we haven't been good in this space.

The Center for Connected Medicine[2] (CCM), which is jointly operated by GE Healthcare[3], Nokia[4] and UPMC[5], partnered with The Health Management Academy[6] for the Top of Mind 2019 survey[7]. Conducted in three parts, the research started with a survey of health system information officers in May 2018 to determine the top areas of health IT for 2019. According to the CCM, key findings include: Hackers and other cyber-criminals are stepping up their attacks on the health care industry, leading 87 percent of respondents to say they expect to increase spending on cybersecurity in 2019; no health system was expecting to decrease spending. Health information technology (IT) leaders overwhelmingly expect government and commercial reimbursement to provide the majority of funding for telehealth services by 2022; internal funding and patient payments are expected to provide the majority of funding for telehealth in 2019. 70 percent of responding executives said they were 'somewhat concerned' about big tech companies, such as Apple, Amazon and Google, disrupting the health care market; 10 percent were 'very concerned.' </p><p>Cybersecurity Cybersecurity was the top concern from the 2018 survey so it is not surprising to see it on top of the list for 2019 - especially as the number of cyberattacks continues to increase each year. What is surprising is the level of confidence that executives have in their ability to recover from an attack. According to the report: Only 20% of respondents reported being 'very confident' in their organization's IT recovery and business continuity plans 70% of respondents said they were 'somewhat confident' in those plans I'm not sure I would want to be at a healthcare organization that was only 'somewhat confident' it could recover from a cyber attack. For me, the survey highlights how much work we still have to do around cybersecurity in healthcare. It's not just a matter of hardening HealthIT systems, that is only part of the solution. Healthcare organizations also need to implement robust security processes and ensure staff are properly educated. The latter is particularly important as Phishing[8] and spear-phishing were cited by 80% of Top-of-Mind survey respondents as the most common types of cyberattacks. My colleague John Lynn recently wrote an article[9] that dives deeper into cybersecurity. Telehealth One of the most interesting findings in the survey was the optimism healthcare executives have for telehealth. 'Telehealth represents a low percentage of total care delivery at all responding health systems, yet executives unanimously anticipate growth in the next three years as reimbursement increases and consumer demand picks up. All responding health systems report 10% or less of their organization's total care delivery is currently provided through telehealth. However, all health systems expect an increase over the next three years, with 45% expecting a significant increase of 10% or more.' According to the survey the biggest barrier to telehealth adoption is not the technology, but rather the lack of reimbursement. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hospitalemrandehr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Top-of-Mind-Survey-2019-Telehealth-Barriers-Graph-1.jpg\">https://www.hospitalemrandehr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Top-of-Mind-Survey-2019-Telehealth-Barriers-Graph-1.jpg</url> Part of the optimism executives feel toward telehealth may have to do with the final 2019 Physician Fee Schedule and Quality Payment Program[10] issued early in November 2019 by The Centers for Medicare ...dicaid Services (CMS). As of 1 January 2010, CMS will reimburse a number of telehealth and communication-technology based services: Brief communication technology-based service, e.g. using phone or other telecommunications device to decide whether an office visit is needed Remote evaluation of recorded video and/or images submitted by an established patient Remote patient monitoring (CPT codes 99453, 99454, 99457) Interprofessional Internet consultations (CPT codes 99451, 99452, 99446, 99447, 99448, 99449) It is widely expected that CMS will continue to expand the reimbursement for communication technology enabled services in future years. Entry of Big Tech Companies Companies like Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft have each made significant healthcare-related announcements this past year and continue to push into the healthcare space. Their entry has executives concerned, according to the Top-of-Mind survey results. 'The biggest threat is if these companies get between us and the end consumer,' said one CEO in a written survey comment. 'If there is a platform regulated and controlled by someone other than us - that makes us nervous. There are many places where some of these new platforms and conveniences can and will likely succeed - we haven't been good in this space.' What this CEO is referring to is the consumer-focus that these Big Tech companies have and how relentless they are at providing superior consumer experiences based on data as well as deep analytics. That is something traditional healthcare organizations have only just woken up to realize - that patients want the consumer-friendly conveniences they have become accustomed to from other industries like retail and banking. Top-of-Mind Conference In a few weeks CCM will be hosting healthcare leaders from around the country at their annual Top-of-Mind conference. I'm really excited to attend the event and learn first-hand how leaders plan to address their concerns in 2019.

Based in Queen's Centre for Secure IT in the heart of the growing cyber hub in the Titanic Quarter, the centre will help deliver the 'Cyber Security: A Strategic Framework for Action'.</p><p>Sue Gray, permanent secretary at Department of Finance, says \"working collaboratively across the public, private and community sectors the NI Cyber Security Centre has a key role in ensuring business and citizens are better informed when it comes to protecting our technology, systems and data\".</p><p>And speaking in her new role as Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said the new Microsoft hub was secured as \"a direct result of the skills and talent available here, but it is also an indicator of the strength and vibrancy of the local IT sector, particularly in the field of cyber-security\".</p><p>Alongside the hub, the Department for the Economy is funding pre-employment training places in Assured Skills Academies at Belfast Met, to help individuals compete for these vacancies. </p><p>\"Assured Skills Academies have a track record of ensuring local employers have access to the skilled people they need in order to grow, while also upskilling local people and developing the capability of further education colleges,\" the minister said.</p><p>\"Microsoft is collaborating with my department and the college to develop Assured Skills Academies for participants to upskill and compete for roles in the company's new Cyber Security Centre.\"</p><p>Building on what Northern Ireland already has, Joe O'Neill - Belfast Harbour boss and the man leading the Belfast delegation to MIPIM - told Ulster Business: \"We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location - particular those from the US.\"</p><p>And that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, along with new names coming in to the marketplace creating a \"cluster\" around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.</p><p>Asked whether there was also the goal of attracting a tech giant such as Facebook or Google to Northern Ireland, Joe said: \"Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that - a technology or an investment company - they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.\"</p><p>Speaking about Microsoft's latest cyber-security expansion here, Kevin Holland, the newly appointed chief executive of Invest NI, said it was a \"vote of confidence for both Northern Ireland and the talented people here\".</p><p>And Damian Duffy, director of development at Belfast Met, said: \"Belfast Met is a leading provider of pre-employment training that is industry-relevant and equips participants with hard and soft skills that will help them operate in the business world. We look forward to welcoming the first cohort of participants.\"</p><p>Elsewhere, financial tech is also on the rise here, with Andrew Jenkins appointed new fintech envoy for Northern Ireland, by HM Treasury. </p><p>\"The UK is a world leader in the financial services with Northern Ireland playing a strong role, but we cannot stand still,\" he said.</p><p>Speaking following the publication of the Financial Services Skills Taskforce: Final Report from HM Treasury, he said Northern Ireland \"must continue to move forward and identify the trends which are impacting upon further growth. This is essential to transforming the workforce and the sector as a whole\".</p><p>\"The issues identified in this report are true right across the UK and despite vibrant ecosystems in Belfast, London, Edinburgh and Cardiff, we need an effective strategy and overarching vision to continue to be a world leader for the next decade and beyond,\" he said.</p><p>\"We have a flourishing sector in Northern Ireland, but competition is strong and we are not only competing with other UK cities but also right across the world. To remain competitive, we need to invest in those with the talent and skills which can drive us forward.\"</p><p>The rising demand for both job creation and FDI for tech firms and cyber-security also mirrors the rise in household access and use of tech.</p><p>More than four in five households have broadband access, and the overall uptake of broadband technology has been rapid - a three-fold increase in little over a decade - while smartphone use among those over 16 now sits at 82%.</p><p>Professional services firm PwC has also joined up with Catalyst - home to a host of Northern Ireland's leading tech and cyber firms - in a bid to boost its research and development around areas such as artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p>The collaboration will see the firm's tech-enabled Operate delivery division work with the innovation community to help shape programmes and support entrepreneurship. It helps businesses overcome operational challenges, such as financial crime operations and regulatory testing. </p><p>Also in the world of cyber, the first UK wide semi-final of the CyberFirst Girls Competition, organised by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), took place in Belfast last month.</p><p>The competition was developed by the NCSC to introduce young female students to the world of cyber-security and the skills that can inspire a future career. The regional winners will progress to the UK Final which will take place later this month. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELWEB-60944174</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELWEB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCS-2FK1-JCJY-G1DS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400553</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1032\"/><timeReceived>11:37 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent News &amp;

Some of the findings of the report reveal that cryptojacking is gaining traction as more than 5,000 websites have been compromised since September 2017 thanks to javascript cryptocurrency miner CoinHive threatening to mine Monero by way of hijacking site visitors' CPU power. The report also highlights that ransomware and all of its variants continue posing threats, which the Investing News Network (INN) reported on in December of last year, highlighting the WannaCry attack last May, NotPetya in June, and BadRabbit in October.[2] Moving into 2018 and what to expect for this year, our 2018 outlook[3] indicated that more of the same would happen this year.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://investingnews.com/get-download/?dtd=1410076...c=TA1410229Download\">https://investingnews.com/get-download/?dtd=1410076...c=TA1410229Download</url> your free report.On that note, as we move out of Q1 2018 and into Q2, here INN takes a look back at Q1 as to what the biggest trends in the sector have been so far this year and what to look forward to with insight from experts in the industry.Cybersecurity Q1 2018: Trends and takeawaysSteve Morgan, founder and Editor-In-Chief at Cybersecurity Ventures said in a report that ransomware was projected to to cost the world $5 billion[4] in 2017, up from $325 million in 2015. In an email statement to INN, Morgan said that a 'growing number' of new companies in the space are attempting to become ethical 'white hat' hackers by signing up for programs that cost as low as $20. 'Although hardly everyone that tries actually becomes an ethical hacker, the white hats are definitely gaining ground on the black hats,' Morgan said.In terms of other highlights from Q1, Morgan said Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL[5])'s announcement of a cyber defense solution was particularly noteworthy, stating the company has partnered with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO[6]) on a cyber resilience evaluation service offered by AON, and a cyber insurance product from Allianz. 'Cybersecurity has been a part of Apple's DNA for a long time, and embedded into all of its products,' Morgan said. 'I wasn't expecting them to come forward with a cybersecurity offering that breaks out of its product line. It will be interesting to see if Apple will follow Google's push into cyber with its new Chronicle[7] business.'      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://investingnews.com/get-download/?dtd=1410076...c=TA1410229Download\">https://investingnews.com/get-download/?dtd=1410076...c=TA1410229Download</url> your free report. Beyond Q1 2018: Pure-play cybersecurity companies to enter ransomware space, damages to increaseLooking ahead into Q2 2018 and the rest of the year, Morgan said he expects to see more of the larger pure-play cybersecurity companies, as well as major tech vendors, entering the ransomware defense space. '[Ransomware is ] predicted to reach $11.5 billion in damages by 2019[8] -- with ransomware attacking a business every 14 seconds[9] by that time,' Morgan said. 'The market opportunity will be too big to resist.' Webroot's report also said that the spam emails were the long preferred method for distributing ransomware but that an easier method has emerged which is using unsecured remote desktop protocol (RDP) campaigns. 'Big tech vendors will continue their push into cyber[10], shaking up the market and giving pure-play cybersecurity companies a run for their money,' said Morgan on the key factor that one should pay close attention to in the coming months and years. A recent report[11] from Barkly said that 54 percent of companies experiences one or more successful attacks that compromised data and or IT infrastructure. 'New attack tools and frameworks continue to lower the barriers to entry, making it easier for criminals to use fileless attack techniques[12] even if they have little to no technical expertise,' said the report from Barkly. 'Fileless attacks techniques are actively bypassing security solutions much more effectively than traditional, file-based attacks. In short, they're working.' The report further adds that 77 percent of attacks that successfully compromised organizations in 2017 utilised fileless techniques. In addition to that, Morgan said that the tide is starting to turn on numerous factors in the industry with the explosion of cybercrime and cybersecurity spending in 2018.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://investingnews.com/get-download/?dtd=1410076...c=TA1410229Download\">https://investingnews.com/get-download/?dtd=1410076...c=TA1410229Download</url> your free report. Beyond Q1 2018: Companies will spend more on cybersecurityGartner said in its report[13] that organizations will spend more security as a result of regulations, awareness of emerging threats and evolution to a digital business strategy. 'Overall, a large portion of security spending is driven by an organization's reaction toward security breaches as more high profile cyberattacks and data breaches affect organizations worldwide,' Ruggero Contu[14], research director at Gartner said. 'Cyberattacks such as WannaCry[15] and NotPetya, and most recently the Equifax breach[16] (NYSE:EFX[17]), have a direct effect on security spend, because these types of attacks last up to three years.' Morgan said that the 2018 list of top cybersecurity companies will be very interesting and that he's looking forward to the first annual Cybersecurity 500 list that will be announced in May. 'With cybersecurity spending predicted to exceed $1 trillion[18] cumulatively from 2017-2021, and a continual stream of new VC investments into cybersecurity[19] startups, the market has become increasingly competitive,' Morgan said.Investor takeawayDespite the fact that the hackers continue to find a way to harm the systems, companies are still finding ways to step in andprevent attacks. Investors should note that companies will potentially be spending money to beef up their security systems-meaning that the cybersecurity sector will be an interesting industry to keep an eye for the next quarter and beyond.

Sometimes the regret almost seemed to get out of hand. It is, nevertheless, probably worth remembering that Zuckerberg's done this all before, on numerous occasions. He has, however, avoided repeating the mistake he made back in 2004 when he described anyone who'd given him their information, the trusting users, as \"dumb f--ks\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Back then the Facebook founder wanted to \"move fast and break things\".</p><p>He's certainly succeeded. What a pity that one of the things that he broke along the way was democracy. He admits \"we didn't spend enough time thinking about the risks\". Not true. People have warned of this for years. The problem is that his business model is predicated entirely on giving away highly intimate and personal information about users in return for advertising dollars. Access is complete: you've just got to pay for it.</p><p>The important thing to understand is that this is not a glitch, this is a characteristic of the system.</p><p>That's why the time has come to make a choice. Who do you want to hold your information - the government, or a company aiming to maximise its own profit?</p><p>Ever since the defeat of the Australia Card legislation back in the 1980's, government's been wary of being seen to be creating some sort of national database of Australians. And yet, at this very moment, there are plans for all our driver's license photos to be scanned and turned into exactly that. It's too easy, and too useful, to be avoided. The only question is the sort of system we'll end up with and, vitally, what sorts of checks and balances will be involved to keep individual information in silos so that, for example, access to results from a criminal records check won't offer taxation information or personal medical records.</p><p>The key to privacy is, perversely, embracing the opportunities offered by digitisation.</p><p>Possessing a unique identifier will soon be like having your mobile phone number. The important requirement is ensuring that you can retain control of that information, and the only organisation capable of doing this is the government.</p><p>We've gotten used to treating security on the web as an afterthought. We know to keep our PIN's covered when we're pulling money from an automatic teller, but haven't bothered quarantining critical information, like our birthdate, from Facebook. Similarly with hardware. Defence admits it's concerned about its personnel using particular mobile phones produced in China - although it won't say why. This raises similar questions about storage in the cloud. Are documents revealing commercial-in-confidence negotiations really secure if they're held overseas, even in the US? National security laws are very different over there.</p><p>The Australian Strategic Policy Institute this week's released a review into our offensive cyber capacity this week, assessing it as \"world class\". I'm sure it is. So too are our swimmers, but they win far more gold in the Commonwealth Games than they manage in the Olympics. This is an area that's more than usually difficult to make an informed assessment about. It's difficult, however, to see exactly why we happen to be a leader in this particular field when we're not similarly leading the world with associated civilian technological breakthroughs. There's a big difference between competence and supremacy. In the absence of any demonstrations of disruptive innovation in other fields, why would we happen to be at the front of the pack here? It's all a bit hard to believe.</p><p>It's a good rule that government should never interfere in any area where it's not required. Its function is normally simply to act as a facilitator, ensuring a level playing field for business. Nevertheless it has an even greater responsibility to protect us from unscrupulous actors and, until there's some proof to the contrary, that's exactly how big-tech companies should be viewed: as dangerous and often malevolent organisations driven by their own motives and whose sole objective is to boost profits.</p><p>Three simple steps are all that's needed to demonstrate that our politicians actually understand and are prepared to grapple with the new terrain of our cyber-society. The first is simplistic, obvious, and little more than symbolic; it is, nonetheless, vital. There's an urgent need for a cabinet level minister to co-ordinate our approach, as a nation, in this field. Someone capable of bringing the many and various strands of current policy together, at an intellectual level, and adding the intellectual heft needed to achieve a unified approach.</p><p>Secondly, the government must get involved with explaining how it's acting to regulate this space by spelling out some simple principles. This will provide us with the confidence to continue using the web as a trusted resource, with the same degree of confidence that we expect to be able to use a road.</p><p>And finally, urgently, it needs to find a path that will provide us with control over our own cyber identity. Now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nicholas Stuart is a Canberra writer.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520017170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2R-V791-DY19-C1BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It is, nevertheless, probably worth remembering that Zuckerberg's done this all before, on numerous occasions.</p><p>He has, however, avoided repeating the mistake he made back in 2004 when he described anyone who'd given him their information, the trusting users, as \"dumb f..ks\". Back then the Facebook founder wanted to \"move fast and break things\".</p><p>He's certainly succeeded. What a pity that one of the things that he broke along the way was democracy. He admits \"we didn't spend enough time thinking about the risks\". Not true. People have warned of this for years. The problem is his business model is predicated on giving away highly intimate and personal information about users in return for advertising dollars. Access is complete: you've just got to pay for it. The important thing to understand is that this is not a glitch, this is a characteristic of the system.</p><p>That's why the time has come to make a choice. Who do you want to hold your information - the government, or a company aiming to maximise its own profit?</p><p>Ever since the defeat of the Australia Card legislation back in the 1980s, government's been wary of being seen to be creating some sort of national database of Australians. And yet, at this very moment, there are plans for all our driver's license photos to be scanned and turned into exactly that. It's too easy, and too useful, to be avoided. The only question is the sort of system we'll end up with and, vitally, what sorts of checks will be involved to keep individual information in silos so that, for example, access to results from a criminal records check won't offer taxation information or medical records. The key to privacy is embracing opportunities offered by digitisation. Possessing a unique identifier will soon be like having your mobile phone number. The important requirement is ensuring that you can retain control of that information, and the only organisation capable of doing this is the government.</p><p>We've got used to treating security on the web as an afterthought. We know to keep our PIN's covered when we're pulling money from an automatic teller, but haven't bothered quarantining critical information, like our birthdate, from Facebook. Similarly with hardware. Defence admits it's concerned about its personnel using particular mobile phones produced in China - although it won't say why. This raises similar questions about storage in the cloud. Are documents revealing commercial-in-confidence negotiations really secure if they're held overseas, even in the US? National security laws are very different over there.</p><p>The Australian Strategic Policy Institute this week's released a review into our offensive cyber capacity this week, assessing it as \"world class\". I'm sure it is. So too are our swimmers, but they win far more gold in the Commonwealth Games than they manage in the Olympics. This is an area that's more than usually difficult to make an informed assessment about. It's difficult to see exactly why we happen to be a leader in this particular field when we're not similarly leading the world with associated civilian technological breakthroughs. There's a big difference between competence and supremacy. In the absence of any demonstrations of disruptive innovation in other fields, why would we happen to be at the front of the pack here? It's a good rule that government should never interfere in any area where it's not required. Its function is normally simply to act as a facilitator, ensuring a level playing field for business. It has an even greater responsibility to protect us from unscrupulous actors and, until there's some proof to the contrary, that's exactly how big-tech companies should be viewed: as dangerous and often malevolent organisations driven by their own motives and whose sole objective is to boost profits.</p><p>Three simple steps are all that's needed to demonstrate our politicians understand and are prepared to grapple with the new cyber terrain.</p><p>First is simplistic, obvious, and little more than symbolic, but it is vital. There's an urgent need for a cabinet level minister to co-ordinate our approach, as a nation, in this field.</p><p>Someone capable of bringing the many and various strands of policy together, at an intellectual level, and adding the heft needed to achieve a unified approach.</p><p>Secondly, the government must get involved with explaining how it's acting to regulate this space by spelling out simple principles.</p><p>This will provide us with the confidence to continue using the web as a trusted resource, with the same degree of confidence we expect to use a road.</p><p>And finally it needs to find a path that will provide us with control over our own cyber identity. Now.</p><p>Nicholas Stuart is a Canberra writer.</p><p>Three simple steps are needed to demonstrate politicians are prepared to grapple with the new cyber terrain.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc6zneu5g4a1ulivi26x3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2R-VCV1-F0J6-J1NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"855\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

But it is a decision that will insidiously affect every single American.&lt;nl/&gt; Innocently couched in the term 'net neutrality,' the FCC decision to 'level the playing field' on internet service threatens to do what socialism always does - improve the lot of the few at the expense of the many, impede the free market and grant the federal government broad new powers.&lt;nl/&gt; Of course, we are assured that, new regulations aside, if you like your internet, you can keep your internet. And that is about as true as when it was originally said about your health insurance policy in the wake of 'we have to pass it [1]so you can find out what's in it'.&lt;nl/&gt; In what can only be fairly described as a breathtaking power grab, the FCC has given us Obamanet. So now is the time to wax nostalgic about the heady early days of the internet and the free market pioneers who turned it into an indispensable vehicle for the entire world. Because Barack Obama has tried to make certain those days are gone forever.&lt;nl/&gt; Indeed, one of the things that made the astounding scope of the internet possible is that it was left free from government meddling for so much of its young life. If you try, in many (most) places in these United States to start a new business, you face innumerable hurdles of regulation and government interference. How many government offices do you think you have to visit, call, write, petition and pay to, say, start a restaurant? Does that obstacle course make for greater or fewer choices for the dining public? We know the answer is fewer. But starting a website or web-based business has until now been free from many of these hassles, and as such, activity has soared. This benefits both seller and buyer, making both richer, and that's why it's a no-brainer that such exchanges should be encouraged rather than discouraged, protected rather than hobbled.&lt;nl/&gt; So what did the FCC do? I mean, you haven't gotten a notice from the new federal internet police when visiting your favorite website. You can still buy your books and most everything else from Amazon, and your music from Apple, so where's the trouble? Well, the FCC, in a straight party line decision, voted[2] 3-2 to incorporate the internet into its content and distribution regulation web. Under the new rules[3], the 'FCC officials would \u2026 no longer classify the Internet as an 'information service' but a 'telecommunications service' subject to Title II of the 1934 Communications Act.'&lt;nl/&gt; That may not seem like such a big deal\u2026until you find out what it allows them to do. This reclassification empowers the FCC to govern the internet and internet companies as they would a utility company. As per the dissenting FCC Commissioner Pai's statement[4] on the new rule, '[i]t seizes unilateral authority to regulate Internet conduct, to direct where Internet service providers (ISPs) make their investments, and to determine what service plans will be available to the American public. This is\u2026a radical departure from the bipartisan, market oriented policies that have served us so well for the last two decades. '&lt;nl/&gt; The reason for such a radical change in policy is simply stated by Commissioner Pai - 'We are flip-flopping for one reason and one reason alone. President Obama told us to do so. On November 10, President Obama asked the FCC to implement his plan for regulating the Internet, one that favors government regulation over marketplace competition. As has been widely reported in the press, the FCC has been scrambling ever since to figure out a way to do just that.'&lt;nl/&gt; Hard and fast rules are effective if you want a simple system of laws and rules to follow. If, however, you want to exploit the rules for your own gain, to limit competition, and to help your friends and punish your enemies, then you need more rules and regulations - the more the better, and the more nebulous the better.&lt;nl/&gt; The Wall St. Journal's Gordon Crovitz has done a great job discussing[5] how these rules will be used to limit competition, harming consumers in favor of companies who can exploit the rules in their favor:&lt;nl/&gt; Competitors could have objected to the 'fast lane' that Amazon got from Sprint [6]at the launch of the Kindle to ensure speedy e-book downloads. The FCC could have blocked Apple from integrating Internet access into the iPhone. Activists could have objected to AOL bundling access to The Wall Street Journal in its early dial-up service.&lt;nl/&gt; Among the first targets of the FCC's 'unjust and unreasonable' test are mobile-phone contracts that offer unlimited video or music. Netflix[7],the biggest lobbyist for utility regulation, could be regulated for how it uses encryption to deliver its content.&lt;nl/&gt; Unlike mere profit-seeking companies, you see, utilities must act in the 'public good.' So who gets to determine what is good for the public? The simple answer is that Barack Obama and his friends at the FCC will decide what's good. This will inevitably lead to tech companies funneling even more campaign cash to the people promoting and enforcing these regulations, revolving door consultancies and the soft corruption of board seats and speaking fees.&lt;nl/&gt; The very regulation itself is a double bonus for Obama - in addition to the increase in power, he can provide a simple payoff to large tech companies who support increased regulation to thwart competition. Per the Washington Post[8], 'The affinity between the White House and the tech industry has enriched Obama's campaigns through donations, and it has presented lucrative opportunities for staffers who leave for the private sector.' That piece goes on to document the veritable panoply of Obama insiders who are now the beneficiaries of sweetheart deals at big tech companies.&lt;nl/&gt; This President makes sport of punishing his enemies and rewarding his friends, allies and those who have paid for protection. These current rules will allow him to do more of the same. Then, after he leaves office, the rules can continue in place for the next administration to do the same - the left ignores this political reality at their own peril.&lt;nl/&gt; Lest we need say it again, the reason to limit executive power is because we know from centuries of politics that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. We can only hope that will bear out via legislative and judicial attempts now underway to restrict these new rules that threaten to turn our vibrant internet into just another victim of a power-hungry government trying to regulate everything that's not nailed down.&lt;nl/&gt;
