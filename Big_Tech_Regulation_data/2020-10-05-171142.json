The consequences of sharing our lives and ceding control of our privacy to big tech, which scholars such as Siva Vaidhyanathan and Zeynep Tufecki, and organisations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, had been warning us about for years. It finally welled up into a massive dataclysm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amid all the digital finger pointing, the Cambridge Analytica CEO has been suspended and Mark Zuckerberg, after a few days' silence, has finally issued a waffling non-apology.</p><p>The crux of the story, as revealed in The Guardian, is this: Facebook granted permission to a firm, Cambridge Analytica (CA), to use data, via an app, for a non-commercial personality quiz. But the app harvested not just their data but that of their connections as well, eventually collating information on about 50 million people. The data was commercialised for expressly political purposes, notably for influencing Americans to vote Trump in 2016 and to persuade people to vote to leave in Brexit vote.</p><p>Appropriately enough for a country that congratulates itself twice a week on being a rising global superpower, India, too, has found itself embroiled in the controversy. The BJP and the Congress have both accused each other of soliciting CA's services while pleading their own innocence. An excellent Twitter thread by Jaydevan P.K., the co-founder of the media organisation FactorDaily, has detailed the workings of SCL India, a joint venture between Ovleno Business Intelligence, an Indian firm, and the London-based SCL Group, the parent firm of CA, in the Indian political sphere.</p><p>CA is but one face of SCL, the hydra-headed holding firm that has boasted of influencing election outcomes across the world, in often extremely unsavoury ways. CA itself, on its site, claimed to have worked with several Indian election campaigns, for both the Congress and the BJP, a charge both parties have denied, respectively, through Amit Malviya, BJP's IT cell employee, and Divya Spandana, a Congress spokesperson.</p><p>Telecom minister R.S. Prasad sounded a bugle call for war against Facebook if it were to be found guilty of meddling in the Indian electoral process. Zuckerberg could be brought to stand trial in India through the formidable powers of the IT Act.</p><p>The scandal raises several deeper and discomfiting questions about our relationship with technology, radical changes in ideas of privacy and ownership of the self, and the implications of the new data-driven order for democracy and politics.</p><p>These issues can be understood in terms of several concentric circles of facts and their ripple effects.</p><p>At the core is a profound failure of Facebook in terms of a lack of transparency about how much data it collects from users, the nature and range of processes by which it collects data, how it monetises this data, who it shares it with, and the choices (or lack thereof) that users have in terms of controlling the lives and uses to which this data may be put. Whether in terms of user design, self-image and self-definition, or public perception, Facebook's position has been that it is a social media company that utilises your data to be able to enhance your experience of community, connection, and commerce. That claim is, to put it bluntly, questionable, which brings us to the second circle of facts.</p><p>Facebook, but other prominent technology companies like Google as well, are essentially firms that exist at the juncture of surveillance and advertising, each one enabling the other. That they may provide a range of services, some of which do not seem directly related to the business of either surveillance or advertising, is incidental. Their business model is one that depends on sophisticated surveillance capabilities that allow them to gather vast amounts of data on the basis of which they are able to sell audiences to advertisers. Crucially - and this brings us to the next concentric circle - they have been the main (but not the only one) driver of a radical shift in ideas of privacy in our times, with the de facto implication that users of the internet (or even non-users) do not really own their digital selves.</p><p>As Aaron Bady notes in his seminal and prescient essay, 'World Without Walls', we now live in a world in which privacy can no longer be thought of as something that was naturally protected by material barriers or distance. A post-9/11 security environment, combined with the reach of the internet, and sophisticated tools like predictive policing, have turned this notion of privacy inside out, and regulatory mechanisms either at the national or global level remain grossly inadequate for dealing with the challenges posed by this new state of affairs. Curiously and oddly, India's attorney general, K.K. Venugopal, has used precisely the obsolete definition of privacy to defend the security of Aadhaar-related data in front of the Indian Supreme Court.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Kashmir Monitor.

The latest example comes in the form of a new investigation[2] of Google opened by Missouri's Attorney General, Josh Hawley. Mr. Hawley \u2014 a Republican who, not coincidentally, is running for Senate in 2018[3] \u2014 alleges various consumer protection violations and unfair competition practices. But while Hawley's investigation may jump start his campaign and help a few vocal Google rivals intent on mobilizing the machinery of the state against the company, it is unlikely to enhance consumer welfare \u2014 in Missouri or anywhere else.  According to the press release issued by the AG's office: [T]he investigation will seek to determine if Google has violated the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act\u2014Missouri's principal consumer-protection statute\u2014and Missouri's antitrust laws. </p><p> The business practices in question are Google's collection, use, and disclosure of information about Google users and their online activities; Google's alleged misappropriation of online content from the websites of its competitors; and Google's alleged manipulation of search results to preference websites owned by Google and to demote websites that compete with Google. Mr. Hawley's justification[4] for his investigation is a flourish of populist rhetoric: We should not just accept the word of these corporate giants that they have our best interests at heart. We need to make sure that they are actually following the law, we need to make sure that consumers are protected, and we need to hold them accountable. But Hawley's 'strong' concern is based on tired retreads of the same faulty arguments[5] that Google's competitors (Yelp chief among them), have been plying for the better part of a decade. In fact, all of his apparent grievances against Google were exhaustively scrutinized[6] by the FTC and ultimately rejected or settled in separate federal investigations in 2012 and 2013. The antitrust issuesTo begin with, AG Hawley references the EU antitrust investigation as evidence that this is not the first-time Google's business practices have come into question. In June, the European Union issued Google a record $2.7 billion antitrust fine.  True enough \u2014 and yet, misleadingly incomplete. Missing from Hawley's recitation of Google's antitrust rap sheet are the following investigations, which were closed without any finding of liability related to Google Search, Android, Google's advertising practices, etc.: United States FTC[7], 2013. The FTC found no basis to pursue a case after a two-year investigation: 'Challenging Google's product design decisions in this case would require the Commission \u2014 or a court \u2014 to second-guess a firm's product design decisions where plausible procompetitive justifications have been offered, and where those justifications are supported by ample evidence.' The investigation did result in a consent order regarding patent licensing unrelated in any way to search and a voluntary commitment by Google not to engage in certain search-advertising-related conduct. South Korea FTC[8], 2013. The KFTC cleared Google after a two-year investigation. It opened a new investigation in 2016, but, as I have discussed[9], '[i]f anything, the economic conditions supporting [the KFTC's 2013] conclusion have only gotten stronger since.' Canada Competition Bureau[10], 2016. The CCB closed a three-year long investigation into Google's search practices without taking any action. Similar investigations have been closed without findings of liability (or simply lie fallow) in a handful of other countries (e.g., Taiwan and Brazil) and even several states (e.g., Ohio and Texas). In fact, of all the jurisdictions that have investigated Google, only the EU and Russia have actually assessed liability. As Beth Wilkinson, outside counsel to the FTC during the Google antitrust investigation, noted[11] upon closing the case: Undoubtedly, Google took aggressive actions to gain advantage over rival search providers. However, the FTC's mission is to protect competition, and not individual competitors. The evidence did not demonstrate that Google's actions in this area stifled competition in violation of U.S. law. The CCB was similarly unequivocal[12] in its dismissal of the very same antitrust claims Missouri's AG seems intent on pursuing against Google: The Bureau sought evidence of the harm allegedly caused to market participants in Canada as a result of any alleged preferential treatment of Google's services. The Bureau did not find adequate evidence to support the conclusion that this conduct has had an exclusionary effect on rivals, or that it has resulted in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition in a market. Unfortunately, rather than follow the lead of these agencies, Missouri's investigation appears to have more in common with Russia's effort to prop up a favored competitor (Yandex) at the expense of consumer welfare.The Yelp ClaimTake Mr. Hawley's focus on 'Google's alleged misappropriation of online content from the websites of its competitors,' for example, which cleaves closely to what should become known henceforth as 'The Yelp Claim.' While the sordid history of Yelp's regulatory crusade against Google is too long to canvas in its entirety here, the primary elements are these:  Once upon a time (in 2005), Google licensed Yelp's content[13] for inclusion in its local search results. In 2007 Yelp ended the deal[14]. By 2010, and without a license from Yelp (asserting fair use), Google displayed small snippets of Yelp's reviews that, if clicked on, led to Yelp's site. Even though Yelp received more user traffic from those links as a result, Yelp complained, and Google removed Yelp snippets from its local results. In its 2013 agreement[15] with the FTC, Google guaranteed that Yelp could opt-out of having even snippets displayed in local search results by committing Google to: make available a web-based notice form that provides website owners with the option to opt out from display on Google's Covered Webpages of content from their website that has been crawled by Google. When a website owner exercises this option, Google will cease displaying crawled content from the domain name designated by the website owner. The commitments also ensured that websites (like Yelp) that opt out would nevertheless remain in Google's general index. Ironically, Yelp now claims in a recent study[16] that Google should show not only snippets of Yelp reviews, but even more of Yelp's content. (For those interested, my colleagues and I have a paper[17] explaining why the study's claims are spurious). The key bit here, of course, is that Google stopped pulling content from Yelp's pages to use in its local search results, and that it implemented a simple mechanism[18] for any other site wishing to opt out of the practice to do so. It's difficult to imagine why Missouri's citizens might require more than this to redress alleged anticompetitive harms arising from the practice.  Perhaps AG Hawley thinks consumers would be better served by an opt-in mechanism? Of course, this is absurd, particularly if any of Missouri's citizens \u2014 and their businesses \u2014 have websites. Most websites want at least some of their content to appear on Google's search results pages as prominently as possible \u2014 see this[19] and this[20], for example \u2014 and making this information more accessible to users is why Google exists.  To be sure, some websites may take issue with how much of their content Google features and where it places that content. But the easy opt out enables them to prevent Google from showing their content in a manner they disapprove of. Yelp is an outlier in this regard because it views Google as a direct competitor, especially to the extent it enables users to read some of Yelp's reviews without visiting Yelp's pages.  For Yelp and a few similarly situated companies the opt out suffices. But for almost everyone else the opt out is presumably rarely exercised, and any more-burdensome requirement would just impose unnecessary costs, harming instead of helping their websites.The privacy issuesThe Missouri investigation also applies to 'Google's collection, use, and disclosure of information about Google users and their online activities.' More pointedly, Hawley claims[21] that 'Google may be collecting more information from users than the company was telling consumers.'  Presumably this would come as news to the FTC, which, with a much larger staff and far greater expertise, currently has Google under a 20 year consent order[22] (with some 15 years left to go) governing its privacy disclosures and information-sharing practices, thus ensuring that the agency engages in continual \u2014 and well-informed \u2014 oversight of precisely these issues. The FTC's consent order with Google (the result of an investigation into conduct involving Google's short-lived Buzz social network, allegedly in violation of Google's privacy policies), requires the company to: '[N]ot misrepresent in any manner, expressly or by implication the extent to which respondent maintains and protects the privacy and confidentiality of any [user] information'; 'Obtain express affirmative consent from' users 'prior to any new or additional sharing of the Google user's identified information with any third party' if doing so would in any way deviate from previously disclosed practices; '[E]stablish and implement, and thereafter maintain, a comprehensive privacy program that is reasonably designed to [] address privacy risks related to the development and management of new and existing products and services for consumers, and (2) protect the privacy and confidentiality of [users'] information'; and Along with a laundry list of other reporting requirements, '[submit] biennial assessments and reports [] from a qualified, objective, independent third-party professional, approved by the [FTC] Associate Director for Enforcement, Bureau of Consumer Protection in his or her sole discretion.' What, beyond the incredibly broad scope of the FTC's consent order, could the Missouri AG's office possibly hope to obtain from an investigation?  Google is already expressly required to provide privacy reports to the FTC every two years. It must provide several of the items Hawley demands in his CID to the FTC; others are required to be made available to the FTC upon demand. What materials could the Missouri AG collect beyond those the FTC already receives, or has the authority to demand, under its consent order?  And what manpower and expertise could Hawley apply to those materials that would even begin to equal, let alone exceed, those of the FTC?  Lest anyone think the FTC is falling down on the job, a year after it issued that original consent order the Commission fined Google $22.5 million for violating the order[23] in a questionable[24] decision that was signed on to by all of the FTC's Commissioners (both Republican and Democrat) \u2014 except the one who thought it didn't go far enough[25]. That penalty is of undeniable import, not only for its amount (at the time it was the largest in FTC history[26]) and for stemming from alleged problems completely unrelated to the issue underlying the initial action, but also because it was so easy to obtain. Having put Google under a 20-year consent order, the FTC need only prove (or threaten to prove) contempt of the consent order, rather than the specific elements of a new violation of the FTC Act, to bring the company to heel. The former is far easier to prove[27], and comes with the ability to impose (significant) damages.So what's really going on in Jefferson City?While states are, of course, free to enforce their own consumer protection laws to protect their citizens, there is little to be gained \u2014 other than cold hard cash, perhaps \u2014 from pursuing cases that, at best, duplicate enforcement efforts already undertaken by the federal government (to say nothing of innumerable other jurisdictions).  To take just one relevant example, in 2013 \u2014 almost a year to the day following the court's approval of the settlement in the FTC's case alleging Google's violation of the Buzz consent order \u2014 37 states plus DC (not including Missouri) settled their own, follow-on litigation against Google on the same facts. Significantly, the terms of the settlement[28] did not impose upon Google any obligation not already a part of the Buzz consent order or the subsequent FTC settlement \u2014 but it did require Google to fork over an additional $17 million.  Not only is there little to be gained from yet another ill-conceived antitrust campaign, there is much to be lost. Such massive investigations require substantial resources to conduct, and the opportunity cost of doing so may mean real consumer issues go unaddressed. The Consumer Protection Section[29] of the Missouri AG's office says it receives some 100,000 consumer complaints a year. How many of those will have to be put on the back burner to accommodate an investigation like this one?  Even when not politically motivated, state enforcement of CPAs is not an unalloyed good. In fact, empirical studies of state consumer protection actions like the one contemplated by Mr. Hawley have shown that such actions tend toward overreach \u2014 good for lawyers, perhaps, but expensive for taxpayers and often detrimental to consumers. According to a recent study [30]by economists James Cooper and Joanna Shepherd: [I]n recent decades, this thoughtful balance [between protecting consumers and preventing the proliferation of lawsuits that harm both consumers and businesses] has yielded to damaging legislative and judicial overcorrections at the state level with a common theoretical mistake: the assumption that more CPA litigation automatically yields more consumer protection. [C]ourts and legislatures gradually have abolished many of the procedural and remedial protections designed to cabin state CPAs to their original purpose: providing consumers with redress for actual harm in instances where tort and contract law may provide insufficient remedies. The result has been an explosion in consumer protection litigation, which serves no social function and for which consumers pay indirectly through higher prices and reduced innovation. AG Hawley's investigation seems almost tailored to duplicate the FTC's extensive efforts \u2014 and to score political points. Or perhaps Mr. Hawley is just perturbed that Missouri missed out its share of the $17 million multistate settlement in 2013.  Which raises the spectre of a further problem with the Missouri case: 'rent extraction[31].'  It's no coincidence that Mr. Hawley's investigation follows closely on the heels of Yelp's recent letter to the FTC and every state AG[32] (as well as four members of Congress and the EU's chief competition enforcer, for good measure) alleging that Google had re-started scraping Yelp's content, thus violating the terms of its voluntary commitments to the FTC.  It's also no coincidence that Yelp 'notified' Google of the problem only by lodging a complaint with every regulator who might listen rather than by actually notifying Google[33]. But an action like the one Missouri is undertaking \u2014 not resolution of the issue \u2014 is almost certainly exactly what Yelp intended, and AG Hawley is playing right into Yelp's hands.  Google, for its part, strongly disputes[34] Yelp's allegation, and, indeed, has \u2014 even according to Yelp \u2014 complied fully with Yelp's request to keep its content off Google Local and other 'vertical' search pages since 18 months before Google entered into its commitments with the FTC. Google claims that the recent scraping was inadvertent, and that it would happily have rectified the problem if only Yelp had actually bothered to inform Google.  Indeed, Yelp's allegations don't really pass the smell test: That Google would suddenly change its practices now, in violation of its commitments to the FTC and at a time of extraordinarily heightened scrutiny by the media, politicians of all stripes, competitors like Yelp, the FTC, the EU, and a host of other antitrust or consumer protection authorities, strains belief. But, again, identifying and resolving an actual commercial dispute was likely never the goal. As a recent, fawning New York Times article on 'Yelp's Six-Year Grudge Against Google[35]' highlights (focusing in particular on Luther Lowe, now Yelp's VP of Public Policy and the author of the letter): Yelp elevated Mr. Lowe to the new position of director of government affairs, a job that more or less entails flying around the world trying to sic antitrust regulators on Google. Over the next few years, Yelp hired its first lobbyist and started a political action committee. Recently, it has started filing complaints in Brazil. Missouri, in other words, may just be carrying Yelp's water. The one clear lesson of the decades-long Microsoft antitrust saga is that companies that struggle to compete in the market can profitably tax their rivals by instigating antitrust actions against them. As Milton Friedman admonished, decrying 'the business community's suicidal impulse[36]' to invite regulation: As a believer in the pursuit of self-interest in a competitive capitalist system, I can't blame a businessman who goes to Washington [or is it Jefferson City?] and tries to get special privileges for his company. Blame the rest of us for being so foolish as to let him get away with it. Taking a tough line on Silicon Valley firms in the midst of today's anti-tech-company populist resurgence may help with the electioneering in Mr. Hawley's upcoming bid for a US Senate seat and serve Yelp, but it doesn't offer any clear, actual benefits to Missourians. As I've wondered before[37]: 'Exactly when will regulators be a little more skeptical of competitors trying to game the antitrust laws for their own advantage?'Filed under: anticompetitive

He is also co-director of the Stanford Venture Capital Director's College and is a lecturer at Stanford Law School.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The conversation with the A16Z managing director was timed to the release of his new book on Tuesday, \"Secrets of Sand Hill Road: Venture Capital and How to Get It.\" But it ranged from there to anti-Big Tech regulatory moves, China trade disputes and why the topic of diversity isn't discussed in the book.</p><p>The following Q&amp;A has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>Why did you think this book was needed?</p><p>I've been in the tech business for about 25 years now. I was a banker and then in the startup world and now here for 10 years. I just kept seeing more entrepreneurs come to me from lots of different backgrounds asking me the same questions.</p><p>When I started to write the book, I was like, \"Wow, this all seems obvious to me.\" But it is amazing the number of times I get the same questions, \"How does the business work? How do I know if it's right for me? Quite frankly, how do I know that I'm not getting taken advantage of when I'm negotiating or trying to do these things?\"</p><p>So, I just felt like, based on my own maybe unscientific research, that people's desires to learn about the industry was way greater than their ability to find resources that can help them explain it. My hope in writing the book is to demystify and explain it to people.</p><p>How much of it is timeless and how much of it is new? What are the chances that it will remain relevant 10 years from now?</p><p>I hope that the lessons and the advice are timeless. The whole idea was to try and start from first principles. 'What is the incentive structure under which VCs live and how does that drive their behavior?' - I think that's relatively timeless.</p><p>The part that may not be timeless is the fact that the industry has been and will continue to be as competitive as it has ever been. The biggest sea change in the industry over the last 10 years is the introduction of seed as its own institutional category and what that's done, in terms of the volume of new company startups.</p><p>It has really upset the competitive dynamic of the traditional venture firms who were always used to being the first institutional money in. I think we're in a new environment.</p><p>But what I try to impart in the book is, look: VCs and entrepreneurs share exactly the same goal. Entrepreneurs are in a great spot right now in the amount of capital that's available. The ability to raise capital is just as strong as it's ever been from an entrepreneur's perspective.</p><p>What I think this book foreshadows is that for VCs to be competitive in the long term, they're going to have to do some things I write about. They're going to have to be more transparent with their customers, quite frankly. They're going to have to assume that there's something other than capital they need to provide and really think about what is it that differentiates them and sets them apart.</p><p>I hope that piece is both timely and timeless. I think the onus is on the venture capitalist to demonstrate their value to the entrepreneur community.</p><p>Is there something in the book that might have saved you some pain if you hadn't had to learn it for yourself, other than maybe a deal you didn't do or a deal you did that you wish you hadn't done?</p><p>Yeah, there's a lot of that but I would say there's a couple of things that definitely would have saved us some pain.</p><p>One is the concept of errors of omission versus errors of commission. What I mean by that in the errors of commission space is that we, unfortunately, invest in a lot of things that just don't actually ever go anywhere. That's unpleasant. Nobody likes when that happens. But that's just part of being in this business. We are not clairvoyant. We can't always know what's going to work.</p><p>When you come, as we did, from an operating business, you stress a lot about errors of commission. They're very tangible and when they happen you have to live with them. You constantly want to do postmortems on what you got wrong.</p><p>But the answer sometimes is that you didn't get anything wrong. It was actually a good venture investment, based upon the data you knew. For whatever reason, the market didn't take, the product didn't take.</p><p>I think what you forget about - and the lesson that I wish I understood - is that coming from an operating world, you don't ever think about acts of omission. You generally don't go back and say, \"What if we had done something that we didn't, in fact, do?\"</p><p>In venture, that's in your face all day long. Why did I miss Facebook? Why did I miss Twitter? Why did I miss the winners? The way this business works, you can't afford to miss those things. If you miss all those things, the math just doesn't work.</p><p>So I think the big thing that I've learned in this business is to make sure that you learn the right lessons from the things that don't work and also continue to really push yourself on those acts of omission. Make sure that you are taking the right level of risk to actually be successful in business.</p><p>How do you avoid that act of omission? You've usually only got one shot at picking the right company that is going to dominate a new opportunity. Many entrepreneurs are usually out there pitching very similar sounding solutions to the same problems.</p><p>The way we try to do it - and we don't always get it right - is to really be very careful about whether we are evaluating a pitch in the right way to make a good decision. For example, at an early stage, you are really evaluating the \"what if\" question. You have to suspend disbelief for a second. Imagine if this company existed, how big could it be, how important could it be, what are all the things that would need to go right to make this thing work?</p><p>We use a phrase here that says, \"Invest in strength, not lack of weakness.\" There's a hundred reasons to say no to any of these companies. The question is, can you be creative and imagine enough to at least figure out what the success case could be?</p><p>I talk about this in the book a little bit. I think some mistakes that we made - and my guess is other VCs would say the same - is sometimes you're not imaginative enough on market size. You have to think creatively, particularly in a space like a Lyft, for example, or an Airbnb. These are new markets that didn't exist. Therefore it's hard to judge the kind of limits they face as to how big they can become.</p><p>It's very easy to reference them with respect to existing markets - to say the proxy for Lyft as the taxi market, or the proxy for Airbnb is the hotel market. But part of what we constantly have to do is apply that \"what if\" imagination and be willing to be expansive in our thinking about whether a new technology or new service might actually expand the market. Could something that was constrained no longer become constrained?</p><p>There's no perfect answer for it, other than I think we constantly have to question ourselves and our decision-making to be sure that we are investing in strength and not lack of weakness.</p><p>Peter Thiel has said that one of the main things that he looks at when evaluating a prospect is whether it has a chance to become a monopoly.</p><p>Yes, though he probably wouldn't use that word today.</p><p>Maybe. In today's climate of a growing distrust of Big Tech in Washington and elsewhere around the world, could it become harder for new companies to establish that kind of position?</p><p>Well, what I think what he means, and certainly what we mean, is what is the long-term competitive moat for the business that will allow it to actually have staying power in the market, have unit economics that are profitable and ultimately generate free cash flow?</p><p>Ultimately, as we know, these businesses will all be valued on what type of free cash flow can they generate over the long term.</p><p>So, when we think about the equivalent of what he would say is monopoly, it's what are the competitive moats for the business? Do they increase or decrease over time? Take a network effect business like Airbnb, for example. Network effects are not impenetrable. But they can become pretty strong over time. So you can imagine over time that creates a real competitive moat for the next company that's trying to go after it.</p><p>But how about the political climate? Isn't there the possibility that could become a factor?</p><p>We're at an interesting time here from a political perspective. Democrats and Republicans don't agree on much these days. But they seem to agree on two things. One is that China is a problem. The other is that people seem to worry about concentration of power and competitiveness, from both sides of the aisle. You generally would not expect Republicans in Congress and an Republican administration to have that level of interest in that.</p><p>I think what we have to do as an industry is to do a better job of recognizing that the implications of our technology are felt in different levels of society in ways that it hasn't before, because of the pervasiveness of the technology.</p><p>We as a firm are active in this. But I think as an industry, we've got to be more active in that dialogue with D.C., with regulators and policymakers, to make sure that we figure out a way that we can drive the types of consumer value we're driving, but also make sure that from a regulatory perspective that we're doing it in a way that actually doesn't create a competitive barrier or consumer harm.</p><p>How big a threat do you think this new attitude is to the VC model?</p><p>I don't know how to quantify the threat, to be completely honest. I would say there's near-term things and there's longer-term stuff, right?</p><p>To me, the near term stuff that we worry about as an industry is, and we've been on record on about, is that a lot of the anti-China sentiment that I think is pervasive in the dialogue today is net negative for the industry over the long term.</p><p>I don't think it has that much near-term impact in terms of investments from China. There's not a ton of Chinese money that's being invested into U.S. startups today. There's some, but it's not a massive amount of money. There's plenty of other available capital, so it probably doesn't impact financing.</p><p>But if we as a country put up competitive barriers that make it harder for the U.S. to continue to be a leader in entrepreneurship and company building, I think that's a problem. If you go back 20 years ago, the U.S. was 90 percent of venture capital globally. Today it's about 50 percent. The pie has obviously gotten a lot bigger. And we've been a huge beneficiary of that.</p><p>But whether the issue is China or it's immigration or other things, I do worry longer term that we lose some of the magic that has made the U.S. such a hub for entrepreneurial activity if we're not careful about some of the unintended consequences of regulatory action.</p><p>Success as a startup is more of a global question today than it used to be, isn't it?</p><p>You're exactly right. It's interesting. It used to be that U.S. companies could build their U.S. business and go public before they would go to other markets.</p><p>I come from the enterprise software world where we would try to get a good U.S. business going. Then we'd go to English-speaking parts of Europe - basically the U.K. Then you'd go to English-speaking parts of Asia Pacific, probably Australia and New Zealand. Eventually you would bite the bullet and convert so you could handle Japan and Korea. And then you would go do localization for Germany and France. You could do those things serially over seven to 10 years.</p><p>Today, all these companies basically are prosecuting multiple geographic fronts almost from Day 1 because - in a very positive way - the U.S. does not have a monopoly on these technologies anymore. That's a good thing, I think, globally. But it does mean the bar is incredibly high for these companies.</p><p>I think this is weird irony in the venture business. It's never been cheaper to start a company than it is today. But it's also probably never been more expensive to win the market because the amount of capital that's required to prosecute these multiple parallel endeavors across different geographies is really high.</p><p>I don't see diversity addressed in your book. Why didn't you address that in the book?</p><p>It's incredibly important. But I didn't put in the book only because I wasn't sure how best to address it in a way that would be informative and accessible. It's a really important matter.</p><p>I think we know as an industry, both the venture industry and the entrepreneur community more generally, that we have not done a good job historically of ethnic diversity or gender diversity.</p><p>We were actually the first firm, in the wake of a lot of the #MeToo stuff that was happening, to put in our term sheets a requirement that companies go through sexual harassment training and actually consult and adopt appropriate HR policies.

On one hand, it describes a firm trust in something or someone -- the kind of trust that people around the world, from Brazil to the United States to North Africa, increasingly lack in their leaders and even governance systems. On the other hand, confianza refers to confidence in oneself -- something that is in particularly short supply in Europe.In fact, the European Union is suffering from a deficit of confianza in both senses. This is a uniquely dangerous mix, because a lack of trust and self-confidence is leading the EU not just to outsider politics and even outlaw politicians, but also to policy paralysis, public outrage, and an utter inability to determine its own destiny. </p><p>Both before and after next month's European Parliament election -- which will precede a new European Commission and a new European Council president -- this deficit must urgently be addressed.Public trust in EU leaders and institutions took a serious hit after the 2008 financial crisis. By then, the original purpose of the European project -- to support peace on the continent after the devastation of World War II -- had lost its purchase on public opinion. Europeans had gotten used to peace. Meanwhile, 'Europe' became focused on the broader -- and vaguer -- goal of championing 'shared values.' That objective underpinned the establishment of the formal EU institutions.For voters, however, lofty ideals were not the point. Europe had achieved peace through prosperity; mutually beneficial economic relations were the key to deterring conflict. But, as the memory of the war faded, the means became the ends. Prosperity was all that mattered.So, when markets crashed in 2008, and Europe was engulfed by a series of crises (which were exacerbated by flaws in the European architecture), the public lost confidence that the European project was even viable, let alone desirable. These doubts intensified as other trends -- including globalization, automation, and the emerging dominance of Big Tech -- transformed economies and societies, creating new sources of insecurity.Economies had become much broader than societies, and therefore lacked the social underpinnings of the past. Add to that the expansion of the regulatory state, and citizens felt a perceptible loss of agency.The resulting uncertainty has produced fear and frustration, fueling popular anger not just at flaws in the system, but also at the system itself -- and the 'elites' who had 'imposed' it. Aided by opportunistic politicians, mainstream political parties have become the enemy, and experts have lost credibility. Truth itself is under attack.An effective response to this challenge must be broad, multilayered, and robust. In European countries -- and in the Western democracies more broadly -- such a response requires political leaders to engage more deeply with citizens, together with efforts to build societal resilience. At the European level, it also demands the development of a clear raison d'etre that extends beyond prosperity. But it also means the construction of a more effective, results-oriented institutional arrangement.The EU has been an intergovernmental, rather than a transnational, endeavor since at least the financial crisis. Agenda-setting and decision-making authority lies with national governments, and, by default, powerful members, especially Germany, and disruptive mavericks, such as Hungary and Poland, dominate these processes. During the financial crisis, Europeans looked to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, not then-European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, for a solution. Despite the declaration by Barroso's successor, Jean-Claude Juncker, that his Commission represented a 'last chance' for winning back the support of citizens, Merkel has also dominated decision making these last five years. This is exemplified by migration, where time and again decisions impacting the EU as a whole, including the bloc's agreement with Turkey, were taken in Berlin with little or no consultation. This is the reality.And yet the European Parliament and the Commission have sought to increase their own powers. This is the wrong way to achieve a meaningfully central place in policymaking. Instead of attempting to offset the power of member states by expanding their competencies, these institutions should focus on comparative advantage.For the European Parliament, this could mean establishing itself as a source of facts, ideas, and vision, rather than as a co-legislator, given how little appetite there is for surrendering sovereignty even over the most practical issues. At a time of disinformation and confusion, the Parliament could conduct credible studies and disseminate authoritative research, much like the House of Lords does in the United Kingdom.For the European Commission, the goal should be to strengthen its role as protector of the spirit and vision of the EU treaties while taking responsibility for proper policy implementation. This would require the Commission to stop trying to show at every opportunity that it is the captain of the ship. As these last years have shown, without political buy-in, it cannot follow through on any course it charts, whether on migration, energy independence, or defense. This failure undermines the EU's credibility, while wasting time and resources.As for the European Council, it must act more as a collegium and less a loudspeaker for the views of certain capitals in setting direction. Here the role and personality of the Council's incoming president, who will set the tone, is crucial. By focusing on rebuilding confianza in both its forms, the next Commission, Parliament, and Council can bolster the EU's legitimacy and facilitate progress in core areas, such as consolidating the euro and completing the single market and banking union. This new, stronger EU would be far better equipped to defend European interests and values on the world stage, which would bolster public trust further.But if the EU institutions fail to show the needed humility and vision, no such virtuous circle will emerge. The European ship could continue to drift along aimlessly; worse, it will take on water until, ultimately, it sinks. In the stormy seas of escalating great power competition, that will happen more quickly than EU leaders seem to recognize.Ana PalacioAna Palacio is former minister of foreign affairs of Spain and former senior vice president and general counsel of the World Bank Group.

A whistleblower who exposed that Apple was hoovering up people's Siri recordings has gone public in decrying the company.Thomas le Bonniec was a contractor for Apple's Siri \"grading\" project, taking snippets of people talking to Siri and transcribing them to improve the smart assistant's accuracy.Now le Bonniec, who is based in Cork, Ireland, has sent an open letter to European privacy regulators, published in the early hours of Wednesday, calling on them to take action against the tech giant.\"It is worrying that Apple (and undoubtedly not just Apple) keeps ignoring and violating fundamental rights and continues their massive collection of data,\" he writes.\"I am extremely concerned that big tech companies are basically wiretapping entire populations despite European citizens being told the EU has one of the strongest data protection laws in the world. Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders.\"Last year le Bonniec revealed to The Guardian[2] that working for Apple he heard a huge array of private and sometimes intimate voice recordings[3] sent unwittingly by Siri users including medical discussions, drug deals, and couples having sex. </p><p>These snippets were sometimes taken without a user deliberately activating Siri. Apple's smart assistant Siri was sending off users' voice recordings to Apple contractors without users realising.  Wachiwit/Shutterstock [4] \"I listened to hundreds of recordings every day, from various Apple devices (eg. iPhones, Apple Watches, or iPads). These recordings were often taken outside of any activation of Siri, eg in the context of an actual intention from the user to activate it for a request. These processings were made without users being aware of it, and were gathered into datasets to correct the transcription of the recording made by the device,\" le Bonniec said in his letter.\"The recordings were not limited to the users of Apple devices, but also involved relatives, children, friends, colleagues, and whoever could be recorded by the device. The system recorded everything: names, addresses, messages, searches, arguments, background noises, films, and conversations.

Do you know how much salt you should eat for lunch? Neither do I, but thankfully the introduction of food standards and clearer information on labels means that many consumers can easily judge an item's salt content without requiring a chemistry degree.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Food labelling has not been without its critics, but plenty of evidence now suggests that calorie counts and colours showing the concentration of fats, sugars and carbohydrates in a product have had a positive effect on both consumer choice and, just as importantly, their trust in food products. Without them, very few of us would have a clue about what we're putting in our body. Simple labelling is important for the food industry because, over the last century, how our food is grown and made has become far more complex, which naturally raises a lot of trust issues for consumers that such labels have helped to tackle.</p><p>The users of big consumer tech platforms are facing a similar problem today, as once straightforward services have become exponentially more complex.</p><p>While big tech platforms have benefited over the past decade from a perfect storm of more time spent online, a greater demand for outcomedriven advertising and powerful new software tools such as neural nets, they have radically changed their industries in the process.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with such innovation, but it has turned what were once relatively comprehensible industries like advertising, and some pretty well understood technologies - your telephone, camera and Game Boy - into incredibly complicated machines.</p><p>For some, the immediate reaction to such complexity, especially when cases of abuse such as the seeming transgressions of Cambridge Analytica and others appear, is to take control of these systems. It has become almost a clich\u00e9 to claim that \"data is the new oil\", but the analogy is useful if you believe we should look to nationalise them both.</p><p>However, most recent surveys suggest that in reality people don't mind sharing some data, as the relatively poor performance of the #DeleteFacebook movement last week suggests. What does concern people is not the potential trade-off between free services and advertising, but rather a lack of clarity about what data they are actually trading.</p><p>Users can hardly be blamed. Twitter's user agreement runs to 11,000 words (or almost 400 of your old-money tweets) and there have been over 40 iOS updates, each with T&amp;Cs stretching into thousands of words. When I downloaded all the data Google held on me, it ran to over 5GB, or 2.5m Word documents. T&amp;Cs have got so long that there is even an automated bot that's been developed to help make sense of them for you.</p><p>Even if you did read the T&amp;Cs for one service and decided not to download that app, it's increasingly unclear where else it might be operating. In a recent survey of Android phones, for instance, Facebook's Advertising &amp; Tracking service was present in over a third of apps used - it's much more than just Facebook Messenger and Instagram.</p><p>Such opacity and complexity naturally breeds mistrust, and big tech hasn't been entirely tone-deaf. There have been efforts by some of the larger tech companies to simplify the language they use. Apple does a good job of forcing apps to tell you in plain language if they are getting access to your microphone or camera, and Google and Facebook both offer multiple ways to see what data they store. However, the relationship between the user and these big platforms is now becoming too important to let each platform work it out for themselves.</p><p>Instead, the Government and regulators could be working with these platforms to develop a scale to show how much data their services are capturing and sharing when you use them. \"A+\" services might not use any identifiable data at all, while \"C-\" might get your location and search history, but in return deliver some great restaurant recommendations when you're in a new town.</p><p>A simple rating system would also open up some more competition for services. Sure, you can delete Google Maps out of concerns for your privacy, but how do you know if any of the other services are any better? Without a shared language it is hard to make comparisons, but by enforcing a common rating system, users would be able to consciously make trade-offs between the services they want and the data they are willing to share.</p><p>The rise of healthy choices in supermarkets, such as gluten-free or low-calorie meals, was certainly helped by unified wording on products. If enough users decide that they are only happy using low-data services, \"B\" or above, then new companies may be able to crack into that market, and we will soon be bored of the clique at work that rave about having gone \"A+\" only online.</p><p>A rating service may seem simplistic, but from food ingredients to energy efficiency and car safety they have empowered consumers by giving them a clear choice across complex products, and increased confidence in the process. As our online activity becomes an even bigger part of our lives, rebuilding that consumer confidence in technology services is urgently needed.</p><p>James Wise is a partner at Balderton Capital</p><p>'What concerns people is not the trade-off between free services and ads, but lack of clarity about what data they are actually trading'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-136197399</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1D-GKN1-DY9P-N401-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"896\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 4, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DHZK</classCode><className>FOOD SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000742</classCode><className>FOOD LABELING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001903</classCode><className>FOOD INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001902</classCode><className>FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009SWJ</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009O2V</classCode><className>FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DHZK</classCode><className>FOOD SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000742</classCode><className>FOOD LABELING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000A39R</classCode><className>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Pendant longtemps, rien n'est venu d\u00e9ranger un consensus d\u00fbment acquis sous la forme d'un pacte de non-agression tacite, bien que fragile. Trump a eu beau r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement attaquer les agissements des r\u00e9seaux sociaux en les mena\u00e7ant de renforcer leur contr\u00f4le, il a agi sur ces m\u00eames r\u00e9seaux sociaux sans jamais \u00eatre censur\u00e9.  Une section 230\u00a0d\u00e9natur\u00e9e \u00e0 coups de jurisprudencesIl faut rappeler qu'en 1996, lorsque le Congr\u00e8s avait adopt\u00e9 le Communications Decency Act et sa section\u00a0230\u00a0visant particuli\u00e8rement les entreprises de la \u00ab\u00a0Big Tech\u00a0\u00bb, l'id\u00e9e \u00e9tait de faire peser une responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale sur les plateformes Internet et de les traiter non pas en simples h\u00e9bergeurs de contenus mais en \u00e9diteurs, afin de s'assurer que leur politique de mod\u00e9ration ne s'\u00e9loigne pas trop de l'esprit et de la lettre du premier amendement. Vingt-cinq ans plus tard, les innombrables proc\u00e8s et les centaines de millions de frais d'avocats d\u00e9bours\u00e9s par les Gafa ont eu raison de cette section 230, d\u00e9natur\u00e9e \u00e0 coups de jurisprudences, au point de devenir une loi faite par les juges, offrant une immunit\u00e9 presque totale \u00e0 toutes les plateformes.  Or, sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me am\u00e9ricain, le pr\u00e9sident a le pouvoir de proposer, souvent sous la forme d'un d\u00e9cret pr\u00e9sidentiel (executive order), une interpr\u00e9tation de la loi concurrente \u00e0 celle des juges, \u00e0 condition que la loi en question ne soit pas \u00ab\u00a0claire\u00a0\u00bb et que l'interpr\u00e9tation du chef de l'\u00c9tat soit \u00ab\u00a0raisonnable\u00a0\u00bb.

He wanted Australia to be the world's \"model\" country. \"I want Australia to be in the leadership pack, if not even at the front of that pack, when it comes to our success,\" he told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I want us to be the model jurisdiction in the world.\" This is an admirable sentiment, the sort of ambition and leadership Australians want from their national leader.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But he was talking about only one particular field - the digital economy. It's a vital field, and a commendable aim. He announced a series of policy steps to tame the Big Tech buccaneers and protect Australia's national interests. Among those interests were the privacy of citizens. And, he said, he was also advancing \"the safety of our children at the same time as realising the benefits to our economy that comes from these digital technologies\".</p><p>\"We want our cake and we want to eat it when it comes to digital in Australia,\" said Morrison. \"We want the benefits for the the public and our economy.\" Absolutely.</p><p>His government is pioneering in bringing these rampaging multinational corporations into the realm of civilised behaviour. Morrison, with New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern, led the world in demanding that Facebook and other sites prevent the live-streaming of atrocities after the Christchurch terrorist attack.</p><p>And now he's moving to the broader agenda. Big Tech has had 23 years to do exactly what Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg urged in his company's old motto: \"Move fast and break things.\"</p><p>Because 23 years ago, the US Congress passed a law that actually suspended the normal operation of law so that the tech industry could have unique advantages, section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act. This gave the tech companies a special immunity - they're not responsible for what others put on their platforms.</p><p>That is the root of the problem. No one noticed when they were quirky, fun, garage start-ups. But now that they are among the biggest and most ruthless corporations on the planet, governments everywhere are waking up.</p><p>With the Big Tech firms blithely enabling child abuse, criminal fraud, rampant misinformation and foreign undermining of democratic elections while making vast profits from it all, Morrison stated that \"we are not going to put up with this\".</p><p>So why stop there? On the same day, in the same press conference, he addressed the bushfires, drought, and climate change. Why not declare his ambition for Australia to to lead the world in firefighting best practice and innovation, drought management and climate change?</p><p>But no. Suddenly the emphasis was on the limitations of Australia's powers, not the breadth of its ambitions. He didn't squarely address the problems but stressed that existing government policy was adequate.</p><p>\"The Commonwealth, the Federal Government, is responding to all of the needs that have been presented to us by our state and territory authorities,\" he assured.</p><p>\"We have over 200,000 registered firefighters in this country. That is an enormous, an enormous national resource, which we value greatly. They are supported for their equipment and needs by our state and territory governments. And that is where that support is provided. And they deal with the Commonwealth for broader nationally coordinated efforts.\"</p><p>Good to know, Prime Minister, but hardly leadership. Decoded, \"it's someone else's problem, but we help when we're asked\".</p><p>He made the case for Australian activism on the digital economy, but he argued for complacency on the urgent crisis preoccupying his people.</p><p>If anything, he sought to minimise the current demands for help and leadership as being merely youthful hysteria at a bit of smoke haze: \"I'm a Sydneysider and I know how unusual it is to see that haze across my city. And I know how distressing that has been, particularly for young people who wouldn't have seen that before.\"</p><p>Apart from the condescension, there's the implicit assurance that it's all just business as usual. The former NSW commissioner of fire and rescue, Greg Mullins, says repeatedly that climate change has introduced a \"step change\" in the nature of drought and fire in Australia.</p><p>But Morrison knows better, evidently: \"I do remember Sydney being ringed by fire in my lifetime. I remember as a young fellow being down at the beach and seeing smoke all around as I looked back out from the surf across the sand and I've seen it before.\" What would an internationally recognised firefighting expert know?</p><p>With masses of evidence of the physical harm to Australia's people, the mental illnesses building up across a frightened community under stress, the practical problems of firefighter exhaustion, pressures on small business who have freed their employees to battle blazes, and so on, the country is crying out for leadership. Instead it got excuses.</p><p>He didn't urge Australia to be calm about the misconduct of Big Tech, but he urged the country to be calm about the fires and the choking smoke haze that repeatedly descends on some of Australia's main cities.</p><p>Perhaps the saddest of all was hearing the Prime Minister regurgitate the hoary excuse for inaction on climate change - that Australia accounts for only 1.3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>This is what the former High Court judge and banking royal commissioner <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/hayne-rebukes-directors-on-climate-risk-failure-20191206-p53hnd\">Kenneth Hayne has described as \"learned helplessness\" on emissions</url>. You could make the same excuse on regulating the tech titans. Australia this year accounts for 1.1 per cent of global retail e-commerce, according to Statista. Did Morrison cite this in announcing his plan to assert sovereignty over the digital economy? Did he say, \"anything Australia does will not make a difference\"? Of course not.</p><p>If Australia surrendered to this self-declared helplessness, it would never contribute to solving any shared problem. We certainly would not have fought for the defeat of fascism in World War Two, for example, or taken part in the Montreal Protocol that successfully saved the earth's ozone layer.</p><p>Morrison sees the whole complex of problems - fire, drought, water shortage and climate - as a political risk for himself and his government. After years of Coalition civil war over climate change, Morrison does not want to upset the delicate ceasefire. And it has worked for him. So far.</p><p>But the balance of risk is changing. The raging fires, the drought, the water shortages, not caused by climate change but intensified by it, are changing attitudes in Australia. Rather than play a grudging catch-up later, Morrison has the opportunity to lead. Not by rushing to take selfies with Greta Thunberg and announcing a target of zero emissions by Monday.</p><p>The big opportunity is to smash the whole paradigm that has held Australia in paralysis for a decade. Renewable energy is a multi-trillion dollar growth industry. Australia already is participating, but largely in spite of federal government policy, not because of it.</p><p>With an immobilised federal government sitting in the middle of the landscape, Australia is working around it. Households are installing huge acreage of solar panels, companies are investing tens of billions in new power generating capacity, state governments are setting their own renewable energy targets.</p><p>Imagine how Australia's economy could be energised, in every sense of the word, by a nationally coordinated drive to be the world leader in this enormous growth industry. Australia has the opportunity to be the lowest-cost electricity supplier on the planet. This is exactly the scenario explained in Ross Garnaut's new book Superpower. This would be a competitive advantage for Australian industry and the entire economy.</p><p>Morrison has the opportunity to transform Australia's politics as well as its economy and climate policy. Champion an economic opportunity for Australia to lead in one of the biggest growth sectors of the early 21st century.</p><p>Rather than persisting with the dead-end dichotomy of \"cheap electricity versus climate action\", he can take the lead in enlarging an existing investment boom, creating a strong economy, with the cheapest electricity, and dramatically cutting carbon output as a result. He would be able to pledge \"the safety of our children at the same time as realising the benefits to our economy that comes from these renewable technologies\".</p><p>If he were to move early, he could secure economic and climate advantage for Australia and shut out Labor, depriving it of one of its major campaign strengths. The politics of complacency can succeed against the realities of intensifying fires, drought, water shortages and climate change for a while. But not forever. <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Fire season began in winter this year</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.

You could make the same excuse on regulating the tech titans. Australia this year accounts for 1.1 per cent of global retail e-commerce, according to Statista.

Australia has the opportunity to be the lowest-cost electricity supplier on the planet. This is exactly the scenario explained in Ross Garnaut's new book Superpower. This would be a competitive advantage for Australian industry and the entire economy.</p><p>Morrison has the opportunity to transform Australia's politics as well as its economy and climate policy. Champion an economic opportunity for Australia to lead in one of the biggest growth sectors of the early 21st century.</p><p>Rather than persisting with the dead-end dichotomy of \"cheap electricity versus climate action\", he can take the lead in enlarging an existing investment boom, creating a strong economy, with the cheapest electricity, and dramatically cutting carbon output as a result. He would be able to pledge \"the safety of our children at the same time as realising the benefits to our economy that comes from these renewable technologies\".</p><p>If he were to move early, he could secure economic and climate advantage for Australia and shut out Labor, depriving it of one of its major campaign strengths. The politics of complacency can succeed against the realities of intensifying fires, drought, water shortages and climate change for a while.

He wanted Australia to be the world's \"model\" country. \"I want Australia to be in the leadership pack, if not even at the front of that pack, when it comes to our success,\" he told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I want us to be the model jurisdiction in the world.\" This is an admirable sentiment, the sort of ambition and leadership Australians want from their national leader.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But he was talking about only one particular field - the digital economy. It's a vital field, and a commendable aim. He announced a series of policy steps to tame the Big Tech buccaneers and protect Australia's national interests. Among those interests were the privacy of citizens. And, he said, he was also advancing \"the safety of our children at the same time as realising the benefits to our economy that comes from these digital technologies\".</p><p>\"We want our cake and we want to eat it when it comes to digital in Australia,\" said Morrison. \"We want the benefits for the the public and our economy.\" Absolutely.</p><p>His government is pioneering in bringing these rampaging multinational corporations into the realm of civilised behaviour. Morrison, with New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern, led the world in demanding that Facebook and other sites prevent the live-streaming of atrocities after the Christchurch terrorist attack.</p><p>And now he's moving to the broader agenda. Big Tech has had 23 years to do exactly what Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg urged in his company's old motto: \"Move fast and break things.\"</p><p>Because 23 years ago, the US Congress passed a law that actually suspended the normal operation of law so that the tech industry could have unique advantages, section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act. This gave the tech companies a special immunity - they're not responsible for what others put on their platforms.</p><p>That is the root of the problem. No one noticed when they were quirky, fun, garage start-ups. But now that they are among the biggest and most ruthless corporations on the planet, governments everywhere are waking up.</p><p>With the Big Tech firms blithely enabling child abuse, criminal fraud, rampant misinformation and foreign undermining of democratic elections while making vast profits from it all, Morrison stated that \"we are not going to put up with this\".</p><p>So why stop there? On the same day, in the same press conference, he addressed the bushfires, drought, and climate change. Why not declare his ambition for Australia to to lead the world in firefighting best practice and innovation, drought management and climate change?</p><p>But no. Suddenly the emphasis was on the limitations of Australia's powers, not the breadth of its ambitions. He didn't squarely address the problems but stressed that existing government policy was adequate.</p><p>\"The Commonwealth, the Federal Government, is responding to all of the needs that have been presented to us by our state and territory authorities,\" he assured.</p><p>\"We have over 200,000 registered firefighters in this country. That is an enormous, an enormous national resource, which we value greatly. They are supported for their equipment and needs by our state and territory governments. And that is where that support is provided. And they deal with the Commonwealth for broader nationally coordinated efforts.\"</p><p>Good to know, Prime Minister, but hardly leadership. Decoded, \"it's someone else's problem, but we help when we're asked\".</p><p>He made the case for Australian activism on the digital economy, but he argued for complacency on the urgent crisis preoccupying his people.</p><p>If anything, he sought to minimise the current demands for help and leadership as being merely youthful hysteria at a bit of smoke haze: \"I'm a Sydneysider and I know how unusual it is to see that haze across my city. And I know how distressing that has been, particularly for young people who wouldn't have seen that before.\"</p><p>Apart from the condescension, there's the implicit assurance that it's all just business as usual.

In Germany some legislators want to make new hate-speech law more transparent and user-friendly. The law, called NETZDG (or Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtsdurchsetzung in sozialen Netzwerken to give it its full name), stipulates that Facebook, YouTube, and other sites with more than two million users in Germany must take down posts containing hate speech or other criminal material within 24 hours. Platforms that fail to comply can be hit with fines ranging from (EURO)5m to (EURO)50m.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is it working? Well, complaints are being made and the social platforms have put in teams and policies to respond. Facebook said in July it had received 886 reports of inappropriate content: 524 of these were removed or blocked. YouTube has been busier, receiving 214,827 concerns, resulting in 58,297 removals.</p><p>So what changes do Germans legislators want to make to NETZDG? First off they want to make it easier for users to find the forms needed to lodge a complaint. They also want increased fines for social platforms that offer meaningless replies to queries from find the required forms on social media platforms.</p><p>Germans are understandably wary of hate speech and surveillance. But while they are ensuring social media platforms take responsibility for their reach, they are also trying to improve policies for European tech firms. Angela Merkel's cabinet held a two-day retreat last week, to devise an artificial intelligence strategy. The plan, which won't be revealed until December, will reportedly make masses of data available to German researchers and developers, loosen some regulation, encourage entrepreneurship and try to prevent AI boffins from swapping Berlin for Beijing or Boston. Over in France, Facebook and the government are forging a relationship that can only be described as \"it's complicated\". They are going to cooperate to examine how Facebook has handled moderation to date. In 2019, French regulators will be given access to Facebook's internal processes and algorithms.</p><p>\"I am delighted with this very innovative, experimental approach that will allow us to reflect very concretely on the best ways to ensure that the major platforms apply a high level of quality in the moderation of content,\" said Emmanuel Macron. Facebook new-boy, Nick Clegg, said the announcement was significant. \"That model of co-regulation of the public tech sector is absolutely key,\" Facebook's vice president for Global Affairs and Communications said.</p><p>This is an interesting softly-softly approach from the French. They are starting small and informally and getting a look under the hood at a finely tuned engine. They can be praised for taking a non-combative approach, but also for getting to know the details of a company they may choose to regulate at some time in the future. France has insisted there should be a European approach to regulating tech companies. President Emmanuel Macron has criticised America for lacking political accountability and China for being overly centralised. \"What is at stake is how we build a European model reconciling innovation and common good,\" he said earlier this year. \"We have to work together to build this common framework.\"</p><p>What does that look like? Well, Macron has called GDPR a bit step forward. He supports a European tax on big tech companies, which would see them taxed on local revenues generated in each country. He has held direct discussions with tech CEOs about using technology for the common good. And the French government is going to check in with tech companies every six months to ensure they're keeping their promises around commitments to improve things.</p><p>There's no doubt that the European approach is making waves. And some technology CEOs are onboard. Apple's Tim Cook is now calling for a federal privacy law in the US, saying it's a necessary step in countering the \"data industrial complex\". But he would say that wouldn't he? Unlike Facebook, Google and others, Apple doesn't make money from tracking users, and any such regulation could give it a competitive edge in shifting high end, secure devices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SINDIR-143737979</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SINDIR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TS3-4NT1-DYTY-C2GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">333993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"735\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58258\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 18, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

On Aug 25 at 10am PDT, learn how Ekata data insights can help with fraud risk assessments. Register Today!      2020 began a decade that I think will be defined by irony. I'll skip over the prominent political examples and jump right into social media and drill down to focus on Facebook.    Last week we ran a survey asking people which of the CEOs that were questioned by Congress last month is the most trustworthy. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg took the dubious prize for last place . Tim Cook of Apple was voted the most trustworthy.    If you think about it, you have a CEO of a company that is structured to mine user information and manipulate opinion, and a firm that still mostly sells hardware.  There shouldn't be any competition; Facebook has the tools and information access to assure it is beloved. Yet Apple, which doesn't have anywhere near that level of reach nor engagement, has a far better image.    I think this survey and Zuckerberg's image showcases an incredible level of incompetence, particularly given that Facebook appears to be tied so deeply to the amount of fake news that is currently surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak -- and I believe it will eventually lead to the mother of all class-action lawsuits against the company.    Let's talk about ironic incompetence this week, and we'll close with my product of the week: a stand-alone Microsoft Teams appliance that belatedly makes the video phone real (sort of).       The Potential Power of Facebook   For those that participate on Facebook, the company has data on you that is unprecedented.  It knows when you were born, where you like to vacation, where you work, your title, your close friends (at least those on Facebook), what makes you mad, and what makes you happy. Facebook knows much of what you buy, who you are likely to vote for, and it likely knows who you voted for in past elections.    With the level of information Facebook collects on you, it could manipulate you, emulate you, and either do you great harm or, potentially, help you out a great deal.  Harm could include aggregating comments you've made over time to make you appear sexist or racist.  Doing you well could include making you visible in a positive way to those that have some control over your career or might be convinced to give you a job offer.    There is also little doubt Facebook has the capability to change the outcome of an election or change the impression of a sitting politician.    It can also help keep you safe by pointing out false information that puts you at risk, or it can ( as Facebook did in my case ) spread information that could put your life at risk.    With that kind of massive power, the person running the company needs to be trustworthy, because, if he or she isn't, we are not only in a world of hurt individually, but likely in a world of hurt as a nation.  I believe that by the end of the year it is very likely that we'll conclude that, for the good of the nation, Facebook will need to be shut down -- and it doesn't need to end that way.   With Great Power   \"With high power comes great responsibility\" is one of the most memorable Stan Lee Spiderman quotes, and that is hard to argue with.  What we often talk about is the abuse of power and the other well-known quote, \"power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" Facebook has an unprecedented amount of power, and it has the potential to be a great force for good in the world. Instead, it the company has chosen a very different path, and Mark Zuckerberg is seen as the face of that problem.    The ideal person to run a company like Facebook is someone who both understands the technology that Facebook uses and the social science underneath human interaction.  That grants the core skills to steer the company; but if we want the company to do good rather than evil with the power, the person leading the company needs some other skills.    The leader must understand strategy to assure long-term outcomes. They need empathy so they are less apt to harm intentionally or by accident, they must have a strong ethical core, and the person needs to be successfully charismatic.  Together these attributes would assure the company is run by someone that people trust, and is trustworthy, and that Facebook's power isn't used to abuse people.    As TikTok is exemplifying, if a social media service is seen as a threat, a government can ban it. There is a decent chance that enough people will see Facebook as a problem during both the pandemic and the coming election that a more serious effort to shut down the service -- along with other social media properties -- will result.  That's on top of the possible class action litigation over false information tied to folks who now aren't socially distancing.    Fast forward a year, and I doubt there will be a jury pool or judge that did not lose someone due to this false information being spread on social media.  Since Facebook is at the heart of this issue and appears to have deep pockets, it'll be an extremely attractive target, particularly given how poorly Zuckerberg does in testimony.   Discovery to Judgement   I was reminded last week of how advanced discovery tools had become when I was briefed by Celebrate, who has one of the newer class of AI-driven solutions.  I expect internal emails, notes, and employee social media posts will showcase that a large number of Facebook employees have been concerned with the firm's spread of false medical (and other) information.  This information should build a case for intentional gross negligence that, in turn, will be tied to the historic death toll we are likely to see by year-end.    I, and other Facebook users, have been actively trying to fight this false information. But we don't have the tools or scale that Facebook enjoys, and when we lose loved ones, as a result, we are likely to make credible and motivational statements about Facebook's culpability.    It's not just the deaths directly connected to not wearing masks and socially distancing. Millions of people could become insolvent by the end of next month, suicides are on the rise and likely not to peak before year-end, and divorces are expected to spike in the coming months.  A large percentage, if not most, of these outcomes, should be partially tied to the spread of critical false information on Facebook.    In short, once we can again open the courts, Facebook is on the shortlist of companies likely to be blamed for the avoidable severity of this pandemic.  This outcome is not only because it had the power, but it failed to use it to stop the dissemination of false information, but Facebook will be shown to have profited from the spread.   Wrapping Up:  Facebook Needs a New CEO   If Facebook doesn't step up to the challenge (and frankly it may be too late) of using the incredible power it has responsibly and for the good of its users, it is likely to be put down much like what may happen to TikTok.    Zuckerberg may find that even his extreme wealth isn't enough to cover the liability he has accrued.  The company desperately needs a new face and better leadership to both fully utilize the potential of a social media platform at scale, and to assure it is a force for good -- and not partially responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and the millions of devastated people we are likely to be talking about by the end of 2020.    The firm needs to be run by someone trusted and trustworthy, and that isn't Mark Zuckerberg.  Not even close.       I first got excited about video conferencing in the mid-60s after seeing the AT&amp;T exhibit at Disneyland.  The future was coming, and it sure as heck took a lot longer than anyone expected for this technology to catch on.  With the pandemic, the need to replicate in-person meetings with video technology has become the go-to solution for most of us.    However, using your laptop to do a video call and also to do work is problematic because you are consuming your limited screen real estate for both note taking and the call itself.  It makes multitasking, where you are listening to a meeting while catching up with your work, far more difficult.  But if you take the call on separate hardware, like a phone, your laptop remains untouched, and you can continue to function much like you would with a hands-free phone call.  That is what the Lenovo ThinkSmart View does.    Tied to Microsoft Teams, which is fast becoming the new enterprise standard for video collaboration; this is an affordable (US$349.99), easy-to-use device that is dedicated to video calls. Reviews by Microsoft Teams users have generally been positive. However, there have been issues with the camera placement being too low, and the lack of support for other collaboration platforms like Zoom or WebEx.  (The video conferencing industry is on a 40-year whirlwind effort to improve interoperability.)     Lenovo ThinkSmart View    The ThinkSmart View is a first-generation product, but it did borrow from Lenovo's impressive digital assistant design.  You do need a business Teams license to use it properly and, while it has a great speaker, you may find pairing a set of headphones works better to both keep the background noise down and limit how much you annoy your spouse.  For the right user and business, the ThinkSmart View could be an ideal tool to connect remote employees more solidly with their teams and management.  As a result, the ThinkSmart View is my product of the week.    The opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of ECT News Network.

Over a 20-year period in the early 1900s, streets filled with horse-drawn carriages gave way to roads overtaken by gas-fueled automobiles. In just two decades, everything changed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"That's the type of difference we could see,\" said Alexandre Marian, a managing director at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm that studies the auto industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Electric vehicles, though still a small percentage of new cars sold globally, could gradually replace gasoline engines as the drivers of the future industry -- especially in Europe and Asia -- as the world grapples with the growing problem of climate change. Autonomous vehicles will also be part of the next generation of transportation modes, as government agencies and safety advocates continue seeking solutions to crashes that take around 40,000 lives each year on the nation's streets and highways. </p><p>At the same time there are big changes in the way people (particularly young people) move around, especially in urban areas, with consumers opting to purchase transport from Uber and Lyft to get where they need to go. The shift could make a dent in sales of new cars at a time when U.S. automakers are bleeding jobs: Last year saw the highest employment losses in the industry since 2009, when Chrysler and General Motors both declared bankruptcy in the midst of a disastrous financial crisis.</p><p>In the midst of all this, there is a wild card on the table: The administration of President Donald Trump, which is sowing division in the industry and creating uncertainty for businesses that must do capital planning and make investment decisions years in advance.</p><p>The administration is embroiled in a fight with California over fuel-efficiency standards -- a spat that has spurred automakers to choose sides, with some embracing Trump's not-yet-announced new regulations and others opting to back California's more stringent standards.</p><p>And even as Congress moves to ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (which the Senate approved Jan. 16 and sent to Trump for his signature) and Trump enters into a Phase One trade agreement with China, the president's multi-fronted trade war continues to keep automakers on edge, worried they'll lose their share of the global demand for their vehicles.</p><p>Those factors, combined with what economists say is the end of a cyclical period of sales growth, have added to the turbulence that automakers are already navigating.</p><p>The chaos contributed to the industry's decision this month to restructure how it addresses policy priorities in Washington: Global Automakers, the lobbying group for foreign manufacturers operating in the U.S., and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers representing U.S. makers announced they were merging into a new organization, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. The new group represents manufacturers and supply chain partners that produce nearly 99 percent of all light-duty vehicles sold in the United States.</p><p>The new alliance's president and CEO, John Bozzella, said in an interview that while the auto industry is in \"an extraordinary period of transformation ... there is a significant level of uncertainty in the political environment.\"</p><p>The new organization, Bozzella says, seeks to unify automakers around policies that will help them develop and work for common policy priorities. \"We need a supportive, stable and balanced policy environment to support innovation,\" he says.</p><p>The sentiment is echoed by Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat whose district is at the heart of the U.S. auto industry in southeast Michigan. \"The industry has got to figure out what its priorities are and what is needed to support an industry that will be healthy,\" she says, adding, \"A divided industry is a hurt industry.\" </p><p>Other than providing tax incentives for alternative vehicles such as EVs or funding federal research and development, Congress has far less of a role in helping automakers than the executive branch, which has the regulatory authority and largely sets policies on tariffs and trade. </p><p>Analysts say manufacturers are crying out for some stability. \"There's so much uncertainty in the industry when things are steady state,\" says Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics for the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. \"And right now, nothing is steady state.\"</p><p>Adds Robert Kudrle, a professor of public affairs and law at the University of Minnesota Law School: \"Business is terribly difficult to conduct even in a stable political environment. But in a chaotic political environment, it's hell.\"</p><p>The Climate Cauldron</p><p>Despite the obstacles created by the Trump administration, the transformation of the auto industry is well underway. The biggest driver is climate change and pressure to address it, especially from governments in Europe and Asia.</p><p>Before Trump took office, the United States was also leading the way, with the Obama administration working out a deal with 13 manufacturers to increase the average fuel economy of vehicles sold in America to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. The goal was to cut emissions of carbon dioxide by simply reducing the amount of fuel that is burned.</p><p>Trump, who has famously called climate change a hoax, began formally working to roll back the rules last year and the administration is promising to set new standards early this year, with a freeze of the current 37 mpg standard among the options being considered. The decision to scrap the Obama rules came after two years of debate between federal agencies, auto companies and the oil industry, which stands to lose billions of dollars in revenue as fuel economy increases. Some automakers wanted to stick with the Obama standards because they were already making plans to meet them.</p><p>California rebelled at the Trump move and worked out a deal with four automakers -- Ford, BMW, Honda and Volkswagen -- to continue moving toward something closer to the Obama standard. GM, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan and Kia sided with the White House in a fight to revoke California's authority to set its own auto emission standards, which have been adopted by 13 other states. The result is a legal battle that will keep companies guessing for at least another year about what the rules will be.</p><p>With California and Trump locked in to their respective positions, the fate of fuel efficiency may be ultimately destined for the courts -- or the outcome of the 2020 elections, with the winner deciding the direction of the standards.</p><p>\"I imagine this is going to come to a head in 2020,\" says Jeremy Acevedo, senior manager of insights for industry tracker edmunds.com. </p><p>Both sides predict the legal fight will be lengthy -- \"Another shock and another source of uncertainty at a time when the economy as a whole is showing some slowing and when the auto industry is clearly slowing,\" says Mark Muro, a senior fellow and policy director at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.</p><p>Ned Hill, a professor of economic development at Ohio State University, says the split between companies may be caused not by philosophical differences, but by differences in the bottom line.</p><p>GM, Hill says, wants to build more fuel-efficient cars but is still a few years out. In the meantime, they need to make money, which it does best by selling highly profitable pickup trucks and large SUVs. </p><p>Toyota, he says, is a bit more confusing. It does, after all, have the hybrid Prius, which is very popular in California. But \"they have as many gas guzzlers as anyone else,\" Hill says, and their larger SUVs and pickup trucks are among their most popular products. \"They may be looking at this and saying, 'We're past the peak cycle. We still have to worry about our margins.'\"</p><p>Honda, which sided with California, \"is much less dependent on pickup trucks,\" Hill says. The cash cow for Honda is the CRV, a crossover that averages 34 mpg on the highway.</p><p>\"I think the balance sheets may be affecting their policy alignment,\" Hill says.</p><p>But Dave Cooke, a senior vehicles analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, believes the four automakers that sided with California opted to do so because they wanted predictability. The other automakers, he says, decided it would be easier to back Trump in the hopes they would get \"as much of what they asked for as possible.\" </p><p>Even as automakers pick sides, they remain uncertain about the standards they'll need to meet, though the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is required to have its 2022 standard in place by April 1 of this year, says Cooke.</p><p>Automakers, says Acevedo of Edmunds.com, \"are making their best guess with the information they have available. But if 2019 has taught us anything, it's that things move at breakneck speed and the best-laid plans can be upended very quickly.\" </p><p>EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has said he hopes to have the rules, which will be released in conjunction with the Department of Transportation, early this year. \"We've pretty much finished our part of it,\" he told reporters at an event in Virginia on Jan. 6.</p><p>The new standards, Wheeler said last fall, will be more reasonable than those set by the Obama administration. \"And, for the sake of American workers, American car buyers and the economy, the rule will not force automakers to spend billions of dollars developing cars that people do not want to drive,\" Wheeler said.</p><p>Marlo Lewis Jr., a senior fellow with the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, also argues that Trump's stance will ultimately help the auto industry, giving them \"the certainty that they have craved for a long time.\" </p><p>Trade Worries</p><p>There is anything but certainty on an issue of primary importance to automakers: global trade rules. </p><p>Kudrle at the University of Minnesota says that despite the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada deal and the Phase One agreement with China, uncertainty and chaos still prevail in U.S. trade policy.</p><p>\"My own view is the Trump administration's general approach to trade creates constant uncertainty about almost everything,\" he says. \"I think that's a hallmark of his policy. He wants to be a disrupter. ... The bottom line would be nobody can relax with this administration on trade.\"</p><p>The USMCA, which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement, does give relief to automakers who worried that the absence of a new agreement would effectively kill NAFTA, but it has provisions that could drive jobs out of North America altogether, Kudrle says.</p><p>The agreement requires that 40 percent of a car's value (and 45 percent of a light truck's value) be manufactured by North American labor earning an average of at least $16 an hour by 2023 -- a decision, he says, which \"basically prices Mexican labor out of the market.\"</p><p>The provision, says Michelle Casario, an assistant professor of economics at Villanova University, \"is definitely designed to have more production in the United States ... but one of the negatives of this is that it will actually raise the cost of production.\"</p><p>Casario says the average wage in Mexico is about $8 an hour.</p><p>The new agreement will also disrupt supply chains that have been developed over the course of the 25 years NAFTA has been in effect. \"And that's going to be an additional cost for U.S. auto producers,\" Casario says.</p><p>Finally, a provision requiring automobiles to have 75 percent of their components built in Mexico, the U.S. or Canada in order to avoid tariffs, Kudrle says, also might inadvertently drive manufacturing costs up. The prior agreement was that 62.5 percent of components be made in the three countries.</p><p>\"It makes our cars less competitive,\" he says. </p><p>Casario says auto companies are applauding the agreement only because \"the alternative is much worse.\"</p><p>\"The president successfully leveraged the threat of tariffs and the threat of withdrawal from NAFTA to get concessions from Mexico and Canada that are not necessarily beneficial,\" she says. \"But certainly, they're better than the possibility of no deal.\"</p><p>A much bigger concern in the trade battles is the threat of tariffs on imports of vehicles and parts.</p><p>\"The climate is still one of uncertainty,\" says Acevedo. Automakers, he says, \"feel like tariffs are still on the horizon in 2020, [and] will still be something they'll have to actively work to navigate.\"</p><p>The administration failed to meet a self-imposed Nov. 14 deadline to determine whether to slap tariffs on imports of automobiles and auto parts coming from the European Union and \"any other country the Trade Representative deems appropriate\" because of national security concerns.</p><p>Trump's rationale is that automobiles and parts being imported into the U.S. reduces the incentive for research and development in American companies that often transfers to the defense industry. His delay in making a decision has been interpreted broadly; Some analysts say the missed deadline means the EU is in the clear, while others say it's a grenade he continues to hold.</p><p>Were Trump to impose the tariffs, analysts say, it would be one of the most impactful trade moves of his presidency. And the worries about what Trump will do increased this month when it was reported that the administration threatened to impose a 25 percent tariff on European automobile imports if Britain, France and Germany did not formally accuse Iran of violating the terms of a 2015 nuclear agreement.</p><p>The auto industry is widely integrated, which means for some U.S. auto manufacturers, the price of their imported parts would go up because of the tariffs and they'd have to determine whether to pass that cost onto the consumer. </p><p>And the cost would be significant: According to the Center for Automotive Research, the dollar value of imported light vehicles and parts totaled more than $340 billion in 2017. </p><p> According to 2018 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data, no vehicle assembled in the U.S. is 100 percent U.S.-made and the average vehicle produced in the U.S. relies on 40 to 50 percent imported parts.</p><p>Hill says the integration makes it hard to determine what's U.S.-made and what's not. BMW, for example, builds multiple models in Spartanburg, S.C. BMW is a German company. It all makes for a confusing soup: What, exactly, do the tariffs apply to?</p><p>\"That's when your head starts exploding on the trade stuff,\" Hill says.</p><p>The other major battleground is China. The U.S. in December announced a tentative deal that avoided a fourth round of tariffs on $156 billion worth of Chinese imports that, if imposed, would've effectively meant essentially 100 percent of goods coming in from China would have had a tariff. Trump signed the deal in mid-January. Tariffs still exist on roughly $360 billion of imports from China.</p><p>The costs of an escalating trade war would be high for the U.S. auto industry. Exports of vehicles to China, currently the second-largest foreign market for U.S. vehicles behind Canada, would likely drop, and since Chinese auto parts are used in many vehicles made in America, the prices of new cars in the U.S. would rise between $1,000 to $3,000, according to a University of Southern California report last year.</p><p>The Phase One deal largely ignores the auto sector, but Casario says the portions of the agreement released to the public so far are stunning in their refusal to address China's heavily subsidized electric vehicle and steel industry.</p><p>It's in the U.S. interest that China not invest heavily in its own industry because it creates an unfair competitive advantage, but the deal is silent on that practice, she says.</p><p>\"After three years of a trade war, what have we accomplished?\" she asks. \"We have a Phase One trade deal that may make China buy more soybeans and pork, but what does that really do? With all that we've gone through, all the uncertainty, all the disruption on the supply chain and in business investment -- what do we really have to show for it?\"</p><p>Electric Power</p><p>Perhaps most significantly, a trade war with China could effectively leave U.S. automakers cut out of the largest market for electric vehicles -- and give the world's most populous nation a leading role in defining the future of the transportation industry. U.S. manufacturers are already behind in the race to develop alternatives to gasoline-powered cars -- partly because Americans love them -- and getting into overseas markets where demand for EVs is greater could help them catch up.</p><p>China is now No. 1 in the world in sales of electric vehicles after the government invested $60 billion to develop the industry over the past decade. It plans to invest just as much in this decade. There are now more than 100 Chinese companies making electric cars, and the government and its producers have cornered the markets for the raw materials used in batteries.</p><p>In 2018, there were 1.3 million electric and plug-in hybrid cars sold in China, or about 4.6 percent of all new car sales; the government wants EVs to make up about a quarter of the country's auto sales by 2025, Reuters reported in December.</p><p>The markets for EVs in America and Europe pale by comparison. Currently only about 2 percent of U.S. vehicles sold are EVs, and only 3.4 percent in Europe, but the sector is growing, particularly in the European Union, where new rules imposed last year will impose heavy penalties on auto companies that exceed strict limits on carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>As a result, European makers are calling 2020 the year of the EV.</p><p>Even without a similar mandate, U.S. companies are planning to spend $225 billion on electrification from 2019 through 2023, roughly the same amount that automakers combined spent on capital expenditures and research and development in a single year. </p><p>The effort is already showing signs of growth:</p><p>- Ford has announced that eventually every one of its models will have an electric option. The company introduced an all-electric Mustang in November that it aggressively promoted, and it says it is developing more gas-electric hybrids and pure electric vehicles by spending $11 billion over the next three years.</p><p>- GM sold its plant in Lordstown, Ohio, last year to a company that says it plans to build electric trucks near there. It also formed a joint venture to develop what it says will be one of the largest battery-cell plant in the world. GM says it will rely on Michigan plants to focus on EV development. </p><p>- Volkswagen said it is expanding its plant in Tennessee to be the center of its North American EV production.</p><p>- Tesla said it sold 367,500 electric cars in 2019, double what it sold in the previous two years. The company's stock went up and down, largely because it is spending billions to try to get into the EV markets in China and Europe. It recently opened what it says is the first plant in China that is fully foreign-owned and it plans to make 250,000 EVs there in early years, rising to 500,000.</p><p>But innovation needs Washington's support, automakers say. In December, Congress opted not to expand a tax credit sought by Tesla and GM for electric vehicle buyers.</p><p>That credit of up to $7,500, used to reduce the price of all-electric vehicles, phases out after an automaker has sold 200,000 electric vehicles -- thresholds that both Tesla and GM have hit. Both companies sought to raise the threshold to 600,000. That means an automobile buyer who wants to take advantage of the credit must buy from other automakers, such as Nissan, Ford or BMW.</p><p>Republicans and the Trump administration have argued the credit is primarily used by the wealthy and doesn't benefit the working class who would be priced out of an electric car or truck even with the tax credit. But Democrats argue that electrification is inevitable: House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter A. DeFazio has promised that any infrastructure bill passed by his committee will take into account the need to accommodate the coming increase in electric vehicles.</p><p>The Other Big Tech Push</p><p>Electrification comes at the same time that automakers are increasingly embracing autonomous technology -- which can be as straightforward as brakes triggered when one vehicle too closely tailgates another or the more complex self-driving vehicles. Those technologies, too, require capital investment. AlixPartners predicts that investment in autonomous technologies will grow to a cumulative $85 billion through 2025 -- on top of spending for electric vehicles.</p><p>But while the auto industry is pouring money into autonomous vehicles, Marian cautions \"not everyone will be a winner.\"</p><p>Autonomous vehicles could change the industry into one in which motorists own cars that drive themselves or \"robo taxis\" eliminate the need to own a car at all.</p><p>Add to that the increased use of Uber and Lyft ride-purchase services, says Dziczek at the Center for Automotive Research, and \"there are new models of how people buy mobility.\"</p><p>The federal government has largely stayed out of the debate, relying primarily on voluntary guidance to regulate the advancing technology -- another uncertainty for the auto industry. In the absence of federal rules for vehicle autonomy, states have begun implementing a patchwork of regulations aimed at encouraging innovation while keeping people safe. </p><p>Regardless of whether the changes are global or granular, analysts say the effect is the same: making an already unpredictable industry even more so -- and more worrisome.</p><p>Andy Challenger, a vice president at Challenger, Gray and Christmas, says the 2019 job losses caused in part by the turbulence of a rapidly evolving industry could be interpreted as a warning sign for the rest of the economy.</p><p>\"As Detroit goes, so goes the nation,\" he says. \"A lot of times auto jobs are the first to go.\"</p><p>Automotive sales -- which hit a record high of 17.6 million cars sold in 2016, according to AlixPartners -- have softened, partly because the auto market is heavily cyclical, with people purchasing new cars depending on consumer confidence and the strength of the economy and partly because consumers are increasingly considering alternative modes of transportation, such as ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft, electrified scooters or car-sharing services such as ZipCar. </p><p>Whether that will lead to a permanent decline in car ownership is unclear  -  the data is decidedly mixed.</p><p>The bigger challenge, says AlixPartners' Marian, is that the decline is occurring during a time when there's so much demand for investment into research and development.</p><p>That's creating what he calls a \"profit desert,\" as the auto industry deals more immediately with electric vehicles and, long-term, with autonomous vehicles, both of which require massive R&amp;D investments.</p><p>And federal policy during the Trump administration -- be it through trade uncertainty or uncertainty about when and if the federal government will weigh in on vehicle technologies --hasn't helped.</p><p>Mike Magner contributed to this report.</p><p>Source: CQ Magazine<br/>Copyright 2020 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

Now that the central bank has finally announced its plans to move forward, though, the real wait is just starting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After six years of indecision, the U.S. central bankannounced plans Mondayto build a real-time payment system that is meant to eventually link more than 10,000 banks and credit unions across the country.</p><p>The Fed's slow process was a reflection of the competing demands it faced, as well as the significance of its decision. Kansas City Fed President Esther George compared Monday's action to the birth in the 1970s of the automated clearing house network, which now accounts for roughly 15% of all U.S. payments.</p><p>\"The last time the Fed offered a new service, certainly of this magnitude, would have been some 40 years ago,\" she said during a question-and-answer session that was webcast by the Fed.</p><p>\"This is a very, very momentous decision,\" added Fed Gov. Lael Brainard.</p><p>But the Fed also said that it does not expect its real-time payment service to be available until 2023 or 2024, which means that the central bank is now back on the clock.</p><p>Below are five takeaways from the Fed's long-awaited announcement.</p><p>The dream of connecting every bank is still a long way off.</p><p>Two years ago, a task force convened by the Fed established a goal that by 2020, everyone in the U.S. should be able to receive fast, secure payments.</p><p>It is not clear whether that goal might have been achieved if the Fed had elected to defer to the private sector, rather than making the choice it announced Monday.</p><p>The Clearing House, the big bank-owned payments company that launched a real-time system in 2017, noted Monday that it currently reaches more than 51% of demand deposit accounts in the country. But that reach is mostly a result of the megabanks' large market share. Many smaller banks and credit unions have been reluctant to enroll in the private-sector-led service.</p><p>What is clear is that after the Fed's announcement, the task force's 2020 goal will not be met. And even 2023 seems unlikely.</p><p>While the Fed expects its real-time service to be available in four or five years, officials said that achieving nationwide reach will likely take longer.</p><p>The extended timeline drew barbs that the central bank's service, which is being dubbed \"FedNow,\" should instead be called \"Fed Five Years from Now.\"</p><p>Interoperability will be hard to achieve.</p><p>The Clearing House has warned in recent months that its system is not well suited to interoperate with another real-time payment network. And on Monday the Fed was noncommittal about the likelihood that the two systems will work well with each other.</p><p>\"Such interoperability is an important goal that we will pursue as standards, technology and industry practices change over time,\" Brainard said in a speech, \"although it is not yet clear whether it will be an initial feature.\"</p><p>Cary Whaley, who works on payments policy at the Independent Community Bankers of America, said that achieving interoperability will take time. But he argued that progress can occur in incremental steps if both the Fed and The Clearing House are willing to work together.</p><p>The ICBA has long advocated the Fed operating its own real-time payment system as a counterweight to the big banks' offering.</p><p>\"I think at the end of the day it's about having choice,\" said ICBA President and CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey. \"It's about having equal access to the system.\"</p><p>The Fed provided few details about payment security.</p><p>The central bank said Monday that the existence of multiple real-time services will allow banks to establish backup connections in case of an operational outage.</p><p>The central bank also said that it will be in a position to promote the development and implementation of industrywide fraud mitigation standards.</p><p>But officials said little about how the Fed's real-time system will address payment security.</p><p>A system with proper security features would eliminate the need for consumers to remember passwords when they make transactions across the internet, said Stephen Lange Ranzini, the CEO of University Bank in Ann Arbor, Mich.</p><p>Ranzini, a former member of a Fed-convened task force on payment security, called on the central bank to build a system where all data is encrypted end to end at all times. He also said that all access to data should be tightly controlled based on authentication, role, authority and the need to know.</p><p>There is still no requirement that banks accept real-time payments.</p><p>In many other countries, central banks have forced the adoption of real-time payments by imposing regulatory mandates on their nations' banks. The Fed chose not to do this.</p><p>Brainard said Monday that there are constraints on the Fed's legal authority that other central banks do not face.</p><p>\"Historically, the way that the Fed has brought accessibility and safety and efficiency to the payment system is by operating alongside of the private sector,\" she said.</p><p>But Aaron Klein, policy director of the Center on Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution, challenged the notion that the Fed lacks the legal authority to mandate real-time payments.</p><p>He criticized the Fed's announcement Monday, saying that low-income consumers will spend billions of dollars on bank overdraft fees and payday loans over the next five years as a result of the persistent time lag between when payments are initiated and when they are completed.</p><p>\"The banks that celebrate today's decision by the Fed are celebrating overdraft revenue,\" Klein said.</p><p>The Fed expects innovation on top of its system.</p><p>While the central bank made clear Monday that only depository institutions will have access to its real-time payment service, the announcement still drew applause from Big Tech.</p><p>\"This decision is a giant step forward, and history will look back at today's announcement as the generation's true payment milestone,\" Brian Peters, executive director of a trade group whose members include Amazon, Apple, Google, PayPal, Square and Stripe, said in an email.</p><p>Fed officials described their still-to-be-built payment system as infrastructure, on top of which private-sector companies will be able to innovate.</p><p>\"The FedNow service will provide a neutral foundation for innovation and competition,\" Brainard said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRUJNL-0000016c-63d5-d28b-ad7e-ebf741780000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRUJNL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRN-PCC1-F06X-W4VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305422</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1048\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Others are delaying plans to go public. Hot new technologies like Bitcoin have been struggling. With all the nervous chatter out there - Where is this going? What's next? - I called on <person><nameText>Marc Andreessen, </nameText></person>who has lived through a bubble or two (or three).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Andreessen, a prominent venture capitalist, has been at the epicenter of the technology business here for two decades. In the early 1990s, he was a co-founder of one of the first major web browsers, Netscape. He went on to start Ning, an early social site. Now, in addition to being voluble on Twitter, he sits on the boards of Facebook, eBay and Hewlett-Packard.</p><p>I got 28 minutes with him. But Mr. Andreessen speaks so quickly, it felt like an hour and a half.</p><p>Saying ''bubble'' to a venture capitalist around here is like saying ''homework'' to a teenager. They roll their eyes and try to shoo you away. So rather than ask if we are in the middle of another - ahem - bubble, I asked Mr. Andreessen why some young companies can't seem to raise all the money they want.</p><p>His answer: conditions ebb and flow. And right now, they are ebbing for some companies. But for others, capital is still available.</p><p>''We have not seen any pullback so far on private investment,'' Mr. Andreessen said. ''Actually, what we're seeing is more of the opposite right now. We're seeing a lot more institutional money - in particular from the hedge fund world - crossing over'' into tech investing.</p><p>But what about companies that can't find their way to the stock market, like Box and Square?</p><p>Mr. Andreessen pointed to 1997 and 1998, when the market for initial public stock offerings was briefly derailed by the Asian financial crisis. Before long, investor interest revved up again, and the Nasdaq stock market was flying high. (A few years later, of course, it came crashing down.)</p><p>So if a start-up can't go public just now, it's no big deal. ''The nature of the public market is that it is manic-depressive,'' Mr. Andreessen said. ''It gets excited, it gets depressed.''</p><p>Speaking of feeling down, I asked Mr. Andreessen a question I often hear from people outside Silicon Valley: Why can't other places build their own valley-style tech hubs? People in cities ranging from Dublin to Berlin to New York often ask what they are doing wrong.</p><p>Mr. Andreessen said new valleys will eventually emerge. But they won't be Silicon Valley copycats.</p><p>Over the past couple of years, venture firms have invested in start-ups in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and all over China. L.A., for example, is home to Snapchat, Tinder, Whisper, Oculus VR and Beats, some of the big tech stories of the year. Mr. Andreessen said another hot place is Atlanta, the home of Georgia Tech.</p><p>But he offers a caveat.</p><p>''My personal view is that Silicon Valley will continue to take a disproportionate share of the No. 1 positions in great new markets, and I think that's just a reflection that the fact that the valley works as well as it does,'' Mr. Andreessen said.</p><p>There is a caveat to his caveat.</p><p>In Mr. Andreessen's view, there shouldn't be 50 Silicon Valleys.</p><p>Instead, there should be 50 different kinds of Silicon Valley. For example, there could be Biotech Valley, a Stem Cell Valley, a 3-D Printing Valley or a Drone Valley. As he noted, there are huge regulatory hurdles in many of these fields.</p><p>If a city wanted to spur innovation around drones, for instance, it might have to remove any local legal barriers to flying unnamed aircraft.</p><p>So what kind of valley would <person><nameText>Marc Andreessen </nameText></person>build? He is a big believer in digital currencies like Bitcoin, as well as in virtual reality. He says enterprises like Bitcoin will change the world on the scale that web browsers did. And before long, virtual reality will be, well, reality.</p><p>Don't believe him? Mr. Andreessen recalled similar skepticism in May 1994 when he was showing media and telecommunications executives this bizarre development called a web browser.</p><p>''They pretty much told us we were out of minds and to go away,'' he said. Five years later, Netscape was sold to AOL for $4.2 billion.</p><p>Finally, I couldn't end my discussion without asking him about Twitter. Over the past several months Mr. Andreessen has become known for his long stream of tweets that have become known as the ''<person><nameText>Marc Andreessen </nameText></person>Tweetstorm.''</p><p>So Mr. Andreessen, why the long tweets?</p><p>''My view is that 140 characters doesn't make sense anymore,'' he said. ''If it was me, I'd immediately raise the limit to 300 or 400 characters.''</p><p>But if that doesn't happen, he's incredibly bullish on the service just the way it is.</p><p>''The counterargument is that there is magic to the limitation,'' he said, laying out a number of virtues around the limited character lengths. ''If Twitter doesn't adapt, I would not view them as being stupid. I just hope they change it because it would be a lot better for me.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-1761212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C79-WV61-DYR7-C1T9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International New York Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>May 19, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0008F2Y</classCode><className>NASDAQ OMX GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

We do have to watch what the effect of that is on some emerging markets, particularly ones that may have debt-sustainability issues, some that have large dollar debt outstanding. If you're talking about the risks around the system, then we are focused on that.\"</p><p>The warning follows a global stock market rout last week that has left key indices on course for their worst month since the financial crisis.</p><p>Investors have taken fright at a cocktail of factors including signs that trade tensions are fuelling a global economic slowdown, some disappointing earnings from big tech companies and a budget row between Italy and the EU. At the same time, increases in US interest rates have signalled the end of the flood of cheap money that has driven a near decade-long bull market for stocks.</p><p>That fear has buffeted emerging markets for much of the year, but in recent weeks the selling has engulfed developed markets too, despite continuing evidence that the American economy is in rude health. Figures on Friday showed that the world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.5% in the third quarter.</p><p>Wall Street's S&amp;P 500 index tumbled by 3.9% last week while the FTSE 100 lost 2.4% as world markets chalked up five straight weeks of decline - the longest losing streak since 2013. The FTSE is now below the peak it reached at the height of the dotcom bubble in 1999.</p><p>The recent declines mean the global bull market for stocks is already over, some observers argue. Analysts at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynchsaid their preferred gauge of global markets, the MSCI World Equal Weighted Index, was down more than 20% since its January 29 peak - the definition of an equity bear market.</p><p>Bailey, tipped in some quarters to succeed Mark Carney as the <person><nameText>governor of the Bank of England, </nameText></person>said that Britain's banking system was better equipped to handle shocks than it had been during the 2007-8 financial crisis.</p><p>\"We've got a stress test that encompasses not only a hard Brexit but quite a severe adjustment in the outside world, and in particular this emerging market world,\" Bailey said. \"Obviously you can layer onto that growing trade tensions, which would also be a factor that would come into play.</p><p>\"We've got a much more robustly capitalised banking system than we had last time around, thank goodness, which on our assessment is much more capable of withstanding these sorts of shocks.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-48651531</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKJ-8281-JCJY-G30M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"494\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 28, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001TWF</classCode><className>MERRILL LYNCH &amp;

As a result, the proportion of such drivers reached astonishing levels - up to and including public officials. Everyone else paid through the nose, via astronomical insurance premiums.</p><p>Car insurance, in fact, is one of the leading reasons middle-class people avoid living in Philadelphia, right up there with schools, crime and taxes. It remains to be seen whether the just-expanded \"Live Stop\" campaign, which aims to confiscate unlicensed or uninsured cars, will help improve things, although it's unquestionably an overdue step in the right direction.</p><p>The point, however, is that Philadelphia's auto woes illustrate government's necessary role in a well-functioning economy.</p><p>Unlike the problems of too much red tape and taxation, which stifle local entrepreneurs and also drive people out of town, in this case the answer isn't for the public sector to get out of the way.</p><p>Driving involves risk. Spreading and managing that risk is the role of insurance. As with any other risky activity - building skyscrapers or flying in airplanes, for example - if insurance becomes unavailable or unaffordable, the activity will be curtailed, and growth will slow.</p><p>The same is true of investing.</p><p>If the risks of buying stock or bonds can't be managed - or if those risks suddenly appear greater than previously thought - investment shrinks. What economists call the \"risk premium\" rises, as bond buyers demand higher interest rates and stock buyers bid less for shares.</p><p>Of course, stock and bond investors don't typically insure their portfolios as they do cars or homes. But investors do try to manage risk, with the help of a variety of publicly run or regulated institutions - the very institutions now at the center of the corporate-ethics storm.</p><p>Public accountants, corporate boards of directors, agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board were established during previous crisis periods specifically to serve as \"insurance\" - that is, to help limit and manage the risks investors take.</p><p>This is done not by promising in advance to reimburse losses, but rather by opening the windows of corporations so investors can see what they're getting into.</p><p>Transparency is the battle cry. Investors need accurate basic information about corporate revenue and earnings, assets and liabilities. Otherwise, there will eventually be fewer investors - and less money available to finance new and growing businesses.</p><p>That's really all there is to what's become known as the \"American model\" of capitalism - a model that seemed to be catching on internationally in the 1990s, but which is now catching grief from critics around the world.</p><p>A piece in the British newspaper The Guardian last week is typical: \"The scandals now hitting the headlines are not a case of one or two bad apples, but reveal systemic weaknesses in [the American] financial system and methods of corporate governance which need root-and-branch reform.\"</p><p>More ominous is the drop-off in investment from abroad. Foreign investors are putting less money into U.S. securities and businesses, a change that is causing the U.S. dollar to decline against the yen, euro and other currencies.</p><p>If that trend accelerates, Americans will see higher prices, higher interest rates and possibly an aborted economic recovery. We could see, on a national scale, a version of the stagnation Philadelphia has experienced for years, as investors take their money elsewhere.</p><p>The antidote is a kind of national Live Stop. The government needs to crack down on corporate scofflaws - the executives, directors, auditors and others who flouted or ignored reporting and disclosure rules. Regulatory agencies need to be beefed up or overhauled. Incentives for managers to play fast and loose, such as lavish stock-option plans, need to be rethought or restricted.</p><p>The goal is to restore trust. Not the mindless, euphoric trust that produced the big tech bubble of 1999; just the sense that some basic rules exist in the marketplace, and that they'll be fully and fairly enforced.</p><p>Contact Andrew Cassel at 215-854-5981 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Andrew.Cassel@phillynews.com\">Andrew.Cassel@phillynews.com</email>.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-0F4A5344CD9D36A6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">The Philadelphi KRDi</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:467G-0GP0-0190-X0RH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"726\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName> The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"11087\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2002 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC\u00a0 All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>July 8, 2002 Monday CITY-D EDITION</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000408</classCode><className>CORPORATE WRONGDOING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000198</classCode><className>BONDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000340</classCode><className>COMPANY EARNINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000011</classCode><className>ACCOUNTING STANDARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N926150GC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

This aversion is President Trump and his administration on full display this weekend as former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe actually confessed that he, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and a host of corrupt FBI and Department of Justice actors sought to unseat a sitting president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR: Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort. What I can say is the Deputy Attorney General was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confession. Where is the outrage about their treason? Where is the Republican Party and its leaders demanding they arrest McCabe and the rest of his cohorts who conspired to overthrow the President of the United States? McCabe's admission of the coup attempted by the corrupt deep state went without as much a follow-up question by CBS. Where is the national media? Left-wing, though it may be, it in demanding answers, accountability, and transparency for this aversion and outright sedition?</p><p>Judicial watch President, Tom Fitton, Radio Show Host, Tammy Bruce among our guest here tonight to discuss those questions and their answers. Former Vice President Joe Biden, over the weekend calling the United States embarrassing. As globalist foreign leaders and the radical Dems applaud their approval of his careless and outrageous remarks on foreign soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The America I see values basic human decency. Not snatching children from their parents or turning their back on refugees on our border. Americans know that's not right. The American people understand, please, because it makes us embarrassing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Well, Biden is the embarrassment. What should be embarrassing to Biden is that he can't even garner the support of his former president, President Barack Obama. Obama saying he will not endorse a Democrat for president even if Biden decides to run. We take up Biden's embarrassing trip overseas. Republican Strategist, Ed Rollins, Matt Schlapp joins us. And President Trump today in Miami issuing his strong support for Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.</p><p>The President's message clear and definitive. The United States will never be a socialist nation, we take up the President's address and much more here tonight. Our top story, former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe confessed there was in fact a deep state conspiracy among his cohorts in the Justice Department and FBI to remove President Trump from office. Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCCABE: Counting votes, or possible vote.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: The former acting FBI director told \"60 MINUTES\" the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein openly discussed how many cabinet members would support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President. But the FBI's former general counsel, James Baker who met contemporaneously with McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page about their conversations with Rosenstein testified the effort went further.</p><p>\"I had the impression the Deputy Attorney General had already discussed this with two members in the President's cabinet. And that they were on board with this concept already.\" On Twitter the President responded to McCabe on \"60 MINUTES,\" \"While, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He and Rod Rosenstein look like they were planning a very illegal act.\"</p><p>McCabe and others say the President's May 2017 firing of Director James Comey left the FBI and Justice Department in turmoil. And they concerned that the firing was designed to be synced the Russian probe and obstruct justice.</p><p>MCCABE: The Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire into the White House. He said, I never get search when I going to the White House. I think the General Counsel had a heart attack. When he got up off the floor he said, I -- that's a bridge too far.</p><p>HERRIDGE: But Baker who could face criminal penalties for lying to Congressional investigators testified \"My recollection is that there were discussions about it over longer period than the course of one meeting, a couple of days.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE: McCabe said Rosenstein initially resisted a Special Counsel because the Deputy Attorney General worried he might lose his job. A senior department official told Fox tonight the Special Counsel was appointed \"to ensure that the Russia investigation was truly independent and without bias.\" Something the official said that McCabe could not have accomplished. Lou?</p><p>DOBBS: Catherine, thanks very much. Catherine Herridge. Well, joining us tonight, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch. One of the country's most effective watchdog groups. And he's worked with the International Policy Forum, the Leadership Institute, Accuracy in Media, among others. Tom, good to have you with us. What we just heard from the folks at \"60 MINUTES\" over at CBS, although they didn't ask a follow-up question, it was an outright confession by McCabe that he was committing felonies and an attempt to overthrow the President of the United States along with a number of his colleagues. Your reaction when you heard it?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: Well, it's extraordinary. It confirms early reports last year that this discussion took place. You know, Lou, if there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt we'll be -- we'll be calling it a coup. But because you got -- I don't like the bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this and it's -- the target is President Trump, they don't care.</p><p>And America should realize this is how you can lose a Republic where you have appointees of the President and bureaucrats to answer to virtually no one talk about manipulating the law in order to overturn a presidential election and attack a president they don't like. They don't like for any substantial reason. They don't like him because they fired -- he fired his buddy, McCabe's buddy and Rosenstein's buddy, James Comey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: At the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein, by the way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON: Right. A fight about a personnel decision. And they're going to overthrow the presidency. And, you know, let's be clear here, Mueller is a successor to this coup attempt. He's -- the appointment flows out of all of these discussions and we should recognize that the effort to overthrow the President is continuing with Justice Department help through this out- of-control Mueller investigation.</p><p>DOBBS: And without so much as -- and effort, explanation, rationalization, this is -- we're watching McCabe basically saying he was doing it for the country's own good. Here's a man sworn to enforce the law, to enforce the constitution of the United States, to defend the United States committing subversions, in my opinion, sedition and treason. And those who want to say that we're not at war should reference the war on terror that we've been engaged in for 19 -- almost 19 years.</p><p>This is outrageous and we haven't heard a word from the leadership of the Republican Party about arresting these people. We haven't heard a word from the so-called establishment that is supposed to hold the tenants values of this -- of this great nation and primacy. They are just simply averting their eyes. It's appalling, it's disgusting, there should be outrage throughout the country in both parties across every part of this nation.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I agree. And the problem with the Justice Department is that Mueller is still running the Justice Department effectively. And so any effort to uncover what went on behind this investigation and this is what went on behind this investigation, runs into the Mueller juggernaut. And, you know, Attorney General Barr, he needs to step up and defend the President. You know, the argument for -- against Barr was will he stand up to President Trump?</p><p>And I think the test for Attorney General Barr is, will he stand up for President Trump and for the rule of law against these deep stators and the establishment who don't care about our constitution. You know, President Trump may survive this attack on him but maybe another President want. And we'll lose our Republic and we won't even know it came.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I guarantee he will survive these attacks. He's already demonstrated that he is stronger than the entire lot of these extraordinary venal, vicious actors in the Justice Department. What may not survive is his Justice Department and the FBI. And Tom Fitton, should they survive? Because they are the root of the corruption and the malignancy of the others wanted to subscribe to this administration.</p><p>When, in point of fact, they have been the perpetrators of wrongdoing from the months preceding the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p>FITTON: Well, my -- you know, I'm a small government conservative. I think all government agencies should be subject to scrutiny every year before any money is given to them. And given the corruption at the DOJ, I think we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: The problem with that is, the appropriators as well as the investigators are also deep state actors and have been working just as viciously, frankly, behind the scenes as the people in the Justice Department and the FBI. My god.</p><p>FITTON: You know, the problem with the FBI is the current leadership frankly, Mr. Ray has zero interest in reforming the organization.</p><p>DOBBS: Where is he?</p><p>FITTON: That's why --</p><p>DOBBS: I mean, we don't even hear from him.</p><p>FITTON: He is missing in action when it comes to standing and uncovering - - I -- uncovering the corruption and to a degree he said anything, Lou, he's been excusing the corruption.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. Exactly. Tom, it's always good to have you here. I wish we're talking in better circumstances. But, as you intimated at the outset, the Republic itself is at stake here.</p><p>FITTON: That's right.</p><p>DOBBS: And the silence is absolutely chilling. Thank you so much, Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON: Welcome.</p><p>DOBBS: And again, as always, and I mean it even when I don't say, thanks for everything that you and Judicial Watch do. Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON: You're welcome. Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, one of the most embarrassing figures in modern American political history. Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken his anti- American message overseas embarrassing the United States in front of our allies and many of his former colleagues in the Obama administration. It's a shadow government. We'll take that up and more right after this quick break. Ed Rollins joins me. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: A New York Times report today saying former President Obama is counseling the Dems' 2020 hopefuls but he will not be giving the New York Times assures us, anyone, anyone, not even Joe Biden, his endorsement. His former Vice President taking a page out of his old Obama playbook. Apologizing for America overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: The America I see values basic human decency. Not snatching children from their parents. It makes us an embarrassing in the example we're setting. Well, I should stop. As my mother would say, this too shall pass. We will be back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: I wouldn't bet on it. In any way, shape, or fashion, at least not led by one Joe Biden. He's just blown his chances for 2020 in all likelihood. Biden, it seems forgot one important lesson from his former boss. President Obama at least waited until he had been elected and was in office before slamming America overseas. Well, joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst Ed Rollins. Ed, great to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: What a day. Let's start with Biden, he just blew it, didn't he?</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, he certainly did something outrageous than anybody I've ever known. A former Vice President to go before this important meeting and condemn the America is just outrageous. You often do that if you're a presidential candidate in Iowa, or (INAUDIBLE) New Hampshire or somewhere. But to go before our allies and to basically take apart the administration's position is just outrageous.</p><p>DOBBS: When President Obama did that, his famous apology tour in Berlin in Cairo, he had been elected.</p><p>ROLLINS: He'd been elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: You know, there was a chance to make things right in 2012. Romney didn't make that happen. I think Biden can just kiss it goodbye, personally. I would like to turn to this extraordinary piece on \"60 MINUTES\" in which Andrew McCabe actually confessed to trying to overthrow the President of the United States, Ed. And where's the outrage from the Republican leadership? I mean, I think the whole country should be just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS: I have to tell you, from when I sat and watched it last night I was outraged because there's a conspiracy going on. First of all, the 25th Amendment is for a president to step aside if he has health issues or something else.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>ROLLINS: Or a Vice President to step in if the President is incapacitated. It is not about removing a president from office. And I think to a certain extent, you think the Justice Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: These guys were not only obviously corrupt, they were stupid beyond imagining for people who were supposedly trained in law and respectful of it.</p><p>ROLLINS: And the fact that before this, any evidence that basically still plotting and scheming to take out a President of the United States and talking to members of the cabinet according to him with the full support of the acting attorney general, I just found it appalling. It's so un- American, it's like --</p><p>DOBBS: So, where is the Republican Party? Why aren't the leaders of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, every republican governor, every Republican governor, every Republican in this country standing up and saying end the witch-hunt, end all of this non-sense, it's obviously a cabal that has been working and the conspiracy to overthrow the President of the United States or tacitly they are endorsing it with their silence.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, their silence is terrible. The reality is we are in a fight of our life. President Trump basically doing everything he promised to do, moving the ball forward. But the Democrats are really revved up and they're going to do everything they can to stop him. From lawsuits to what have you. And they're not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: -- in the land that will join this president on the basis of his declaration of a national emergency. I -- we know then that the corruption has absolutely grasped our judiciary system as well. We got every indication that that's happened. But for them to enjoin a president in a matter of national security would be an act against the Republic, the constitution itself.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, you and I have been around long enough to know that's going to happen. And at the end of the day it's going to end up being in the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court has to rule in the President's favor at the end of the day here. But it's going to go through the process. There's -- all of these political attorney generals and what have you who want to make (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS: But honorable, honest and judges who are not overwhelmed by their partisan prejudice would understand that that it could be absolutely litigated in our judiciary. Without enjoining until a decision by the high court. That would be the honorable thing to do.</p><p>ROLLINS: That's the absolute honoring thing to do. And I would -- I would hope the Supreme Court is stepping very quickly if they started out this process.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. I worry about this court and what more -- the more that we learned about Chief Justice John Roberts, I'm not saying when about, what will or will not occur in that high court.</p><p>ROLLINS: I'm hopeful in the end he will do the right thing.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. Well, we can all hope. But I'd rather have certainty.</p><p>ROLLINS: In the end. In the end. There is no certainty -- there's no certainty in life.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, there isn't. But in this constitution there should be absolute certainty. Ed Rollins, thanks much.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: We appreciate it. We'd like to hear your thoughts on all this. Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight. Coming up here next, Chicago Police, they want answers from actor, Jussie Smollett after their investigation into an alleged hate crime reverses. That and much more coming up next. We'll be talking with Washington Times' Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Before we go to break, let's take a look at the U.S. national debt as if we don't have enough problems already. $22 trillion and climbing. We're coming right back after this. Stay brave of heart, we'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump in Miami today for claiming the days of socialism in the western hemisphere are numbered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: If you choose this path, you have the opportunity to help forge a safe and prosperous future for all of the people of Venezuela. Or you can choose the second path, continuing to support Maduro. If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out. You will lose everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump also using his speech to continue to express his supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido. A reported hate crime in Chicago looking more and more like a hate hoax. Chicago Police say they no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim. And they are pushing for a follow-up interview which his attorney -- Smollett's attorneys have resisted. The police request -- imagine that, a request comes amid new reports that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault.</p><p>Both men have been questioned and released without charges. Reverend Al Sharpton, we want to point out, responding to the news. And Sharpton saying Smollett should face as he put it, \"accountability to the maximum\" if it's found the actor stage the attack. Joining us tonight, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times Columnist, Fox Business Contributor. Tammy, good to see you.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, everybody.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's start with Smollett and the hoax. I have to give Reverend Al Sharpton great credit for standing up which by the way all of the candidates who have been commenting on this, the Democratic candidates have not had the courage to do. Your thoughts.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes. The candidates seem to be wanting to pretend this never happened. They get away without law because then the media also steps away from it and stops discussing it. But Reverend Al Sharpton of course is very well known for promoting one of the original hoaxes, if you will with a young woman named Tawana Brawley who made some accusations against police officers which ended up being false.</p><p>So it's fascinating that he would actually take that position. So good for him if he has found, you know, the right direction. And maybe -- I don't know, maybe he's thinking that Mr. Smollett deserves a program on MSNBC like he has. Who knows what that end result should be.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you brought that to us with a sense of appropriate justice.</p><p>BRUCE: Absolutely. Hanging every day, every day.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's turn to Venezuela, the President today importantly going to Miami as the setting to announce his views and judgment and policies on the hemisphere and Venezuela in particular. Your thoughts?</p><p>BRUCE: Yes. Perfect of course. We know for South Florida it has a lot of people who are immigrants who have experienced in our lifetimes very recently, the impact of totalitarianism and tyrants. So when he --</p><p>DOBBS: And Venezuelans by the way.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, Venezuelans and Cubans. So when he's speaking it happens to be the right thing, of course it is the thing that the President believes in. But it also speaks to the Venezuelans that are already in South Florida that are coming to South Florida but speaking to that core of people in this region that understand the importance of freedom, this nation, capitalism and the value of the support of the American Presidents.</p><p>And so it's going to make I think a big different for people there and sends a very strong message back home about what his intentions are.</p><p>DOBBS: I think he had a couple of other audiences as well in mind as he spoke. And one of this of course the American people when he said this country will never be socialist. That was a loud straightforward challenge to everyone of the -- what seemed to be every one of the Democratic hopefuls so far. At least announced, this is not going to be an easy campaign for you because you've already gone to the left and lined up against this country and our traditions.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes. It's the first education they may be receiving about real life. These are -- especially young people, Miss Ocasio-Cortez obviously seems to not have any major education about the impact of socialism.</p><p>DOBBS: Or minor.</p><p>BRUCE: Or a minor education on the nape on how it destroys lives, on how it destroys countries and economies. So, this is going to be her first indication about courtesy of the President, about real life and what socialism does to people.</p><p>DOBBS: This could be an expensive tutorial for AOC if it moves into, as it appears, it is about to, into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes. This is -- it could be. And she won't understand this, I think, until 2020. The benefit of this education for the American people about what the Democratic Party is becoming, and how everybody is running on this kind of an issue.</p><p>The President stands as the bulwark against this framework and as a reminder about what -- how greatness really can be brought into our lives. And it's not through certainly that totalitarianism by any stretch.</p><p>DOBBS: And most to me, it's very encouraging to see the presidential tracking poll with the president's popularity. I had approval rising at 52 percent. I confess that I personally think it should be significantly higher, and I hope it soon will be.</p><p>BRUCE: It probably is, as a matter of fact. When you think about the --</p><p>DOBBS: I'd like to see it expressed in black-and-white.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, yes.</p><p>DOBBS: Like you, I have faith in the forgotten man and woman in this country. But this president, I think now, has turned a very important corner. I think the national left-wing media understands it. It is beginning to understand it. That's why they are not quite as free with their nonsense as they have been.</p><p>In other words, Jim Acosta is receding quite a bit, as his colleagues, I think, on the left, in that White House briefing room, for example, it's one of the barometers of this all.</p><p>BRUCE: That's good news.</p><p>DOBBS: Tammy, good to have you here.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS: Tammy Bruce, thanks. Up next, British lawmakers say Facebook is acting like gangsters with our personal information. We take that up. Now, the Europeans are doing something about it. Why in the world isn't the United States? Isn't privacy an even bigger right for Americans? We take that up with cyber expert, Morgan Wright. Stay with us, we'll be right back. Oh, Google, Facebook, gangsters.</p><p>DOBBS: Headlines tonight, Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, claims he has \"a lot of discretion on border wall funding from President Trump's national emergency declaration,\" despite receiving a direct order from the President of the United States to secure the border.</p><p>Shanahan says \"I'm not required to do anything.\" Well, he'd be required to do something, one would think, like pack his bags and get out of there. A North Carolina elections board, beginning deliberations over election fraud allegations, Republican Mark Harris leading in last month's ninth congressional district election.</p><p>The board consists of three Democrats, two Republicans, they will decide whether to certify a winner or order a new election, Harris, by the way, leading Democrat Dan McCready, by 905 votes, but again, the vote that may count as the 3-2 vote on the elections board.</p><p>A new report from the U.K. parliament, calling Facebook, digital gangsters, for failing to thwart attempts by Russia to influence elections, the report accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of contempt of parliament.</p><p>Joining me now, Morgan Wright, Former Senior Advisor in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, Former Law Enforcement Advisor to the Republican National Committee, Cyber Security Expert, Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, EXPERT, CYBERSECURITY: Hey, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Let me start with, first, the gangsters that Facebook and Google. Who knew that they were going to be declared gangsters first by the U.K., rather than the United States?</p><p>WRIGHT: Yes, I don't see Al Pacino playing Mark Zuckerberg in a movie, you know, about gangsters, but yes, you know. And Lou, we've talked about this before about why is the -- why is the E.U. ahead of us with things like the General Data Protection Regulations, privacy?</p><p>And I'll tell you, the only thing I can think of as it comes down to money, because there's a -- Facebook has figured out the Google playbook, which is, spend a lot of money, spend a lot of time here in D.C., on K Street, M Street, whatever all the streets are, and you know, get in there and lobby people, spread lots of money around.</p><p>And Lou, during the hearings, how many members of Congress did we see ponder to Mark Zuckerberg, hoping to relocate shit jobs in their district. I mean, this is one reason why you don't have it because everybody's hoping to get something from Zuckerberg.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, and -- but it reinforces the impression.</p><p>WRIGHT: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: That a half dozen of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have such concentrated economic and technological and political power, that they are almost now so large that it is impossible to rein them in. Is that fear well-placed?</p><p>WRIGHT: Yes. I mean, absolutely. And I'll tell you, Lou, you and I talked about this awhile back too, when we talked about how globalism is killing patriotism. And all of these companies have taken the advantage of the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) well guess what?</p><p>It's coming home to roost now, because now that these companies want to be global. Your subject to the E.U. regulations, the U.K. regulations, you know, Germany's regulations, all of these other places that actually place a premium on privacy, for too long self-regulation, they've tried it, it hasn't worked.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is the self-regulation go away. And you're going to see more government interventions starting overseas, and hopefully, it'll end up over here, not to put them out of business, but, man, we've got to put a check on the seemingly unchecked power that they have right now.</p><p>DOBBS: There is no countervailing influence in our economy, or our society, or our body politic to the awesome power of big tech. That's simply a fact, and to that, the power of Wall Street and Corporate America.</p><p>And right now, the middle class in this country, if they were not the champion, the President of the United States would be defenseless against an onslaught that had rolled back the middle class for 20 years, and which under this president, is once again, growing.</p><p>WRIGHT: Right. And look, you know, something interesting that came out of the U.K. report too, is they talked about -- even though Zuckerberg, in front of Congress, and sent his minions over there to say we don' sell any data, it's clear they've been selling data. It's true that they've been using apps to spy on the activities of users and their competitors.</p><p>Look, this is the modern version.</p><p>DOBBS: And even those who are not users.</p><p>WRIGHT: --have that power, right, absolutely. And the KGB only wished they would've had this power back in the day. You know, our NSA and FBI don't have near the power that Facebook, Google, Amazon. You know, these folks have to spy into the lives of us, but there are no consequences for it. At some point, there has to be stick because the carrot hasn't worked.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. This is a president who is keenly aware --</p><p>WRIGHT: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: -- that U.S. policies haven't worked. He is also confronted now by ZTE, as a favor to President Xi. He backed off of the consequences for ZTE, Huawei, now paying the consequences for its role in spying, but doing so, only within our court system, not as a result of a national security response from the part of the United States.</p><p>How much longer can we go without saying straightforwardly to the Chinese, there will be a response on national security terms if you continue to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from this country each year and carry out acts of espionage nonstop.</p><p>WRIGHT: Look, I think Gordon Chang's been on with before he talked about poor Chinese economically, I think they need to put -- they need to put the hammer down on Huawei. It's time to put Huawei and ZTE out of business.</p><p>And I'll tell you why, Lou, the upcoming 5G, Huawei is doing everything they can to get their technology into these countries, but you've Australia, New Zealand, Japan. The U.K. said it's going to take, you know -- they probably going to have to spend five years and $2-$3 billion to meet the U.K. standards.</p><p>The best way to stop this economic espionage is to quit lulling the government of China to subsidize the rail system, the electronic system, the communication systems to where it's all Chinese infrastructure. And there's no U.S. infrastructure in play. We can't -- it's not a fair fight.</p><p>So, I think they've got to put the hammer down on these guys. One of the ways to stop espionage is to keep their equipment out of our infrastructure.</p><p>DOBBS: And the -- and the administration to its credit is trying to do exactly that. Huawei, at the same time, is bragging they are now too big to stop. And this is -- this again, is advised rhetoric from the PLA and from President Xi, himself.</p><p>The Communist Party is now flaunting their economic and political and military power. The United States is -- has to simply respond, and hopefully, before it becomes a military response.</p><p>WRIGHT: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: But it looks as though we are absolutely vulnerable in cyberspace right now. Is that a correct impression?</p><p>WRIGHT: Yes, absolutely. Lou, we have -- from our power grid, to our nuclear plants, to you know -- the rail system transportation. A lot of things are still so vulnerable because we're so fragmented. We don't have --</p><p>Even though we might have an overall plan, we don't have an overall coherent ability to secure all the things we need to do, why, because the private sector owns 85 percent of the critical infrastructure that's out there.</p><p>The government can provide a lot of support, a lot of help, but were the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese? And even the North Koreans are exploiting. They're exploiting all of these gaps between the different infrastructures.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>WRIGHT: The lack of coherence among the security plans. And the old technology that's out there. We've got out-of-date machines that are still running windows that haven't been supported for five or six years.</p><p>DOBBS: What Morgan is not saying, that 85 percent that is in the private sector, is often run by CEOs and boards that are frankly, friendlier to Chinese policies than they are to the policies of the Trump administration and the U.S. government. And that's got to change, straightaway. I didn't put words in your mouth, did I, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT: Lou, you're always right. That's one lesson I've learned.</p><p>DOBBS: Morgan, thanks so much. I appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT: You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Good to see you, Morgan Wright.</p><p>Up next, New York Governor Bill -- New York Mayor, Bill de Blasio says AOC doesn't know what she is talking about. We take that up after the break with American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp. Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio putting freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her place after Amazon decided not to build its headquarters in Long Island City. Cortez claimed the failed deal would free up $4 billion in taxes incentives for the city to use elsewhere. The good mayor reminded her even a socialist understood this, at least one of the socialists did, reminding her the money would only be available after the city secured the Amazon jobs and revenue and that it wasn't in a budget somewhere.</p><p>Radical freshman congresswoman, there's a lot of those going around. Ilhan Omar scheduled to raise money in March for the Hamas link council on American-Islamic relations. Omar received $5,000 from them during a run for Congress. She since repeatedly made headlines for her anti-Semitic remarks most recently suggesting Republican support of Israel is bought and paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC. At some point anti-Semitic remarks result in being anti -- an anti-Semite it seems.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Matt Schlapp. He's the chairman of the American Conservative Union. Why is it that the Left is suddenly so reluctant to say what is obvious that they have an anti-Semitic strain within their party and on Capitol Hill and aren't dealing with it?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Well, I completely agree with you, Lou, but I asked -- I actually think it's more cynical than this. I think the Democratic Party has really shed its longtime support of the State of Israel. I think they're moving away from this policy point of view and I think it gives Donald Trump who has done everything he said he would do with getting rid of the Iran deal, moving the embassy a great chance with these voters not with the not with the Liberal leaders potentially of this community but with everyday voters who can see anti- Semitism when it's so clear.</p><p>DOBBS: Anti-Semitism, we saw reports today that the yellow vest in France you know, blaming them for a strain of anti-Semitism within France leaving out the entire ruling body and class in France that -- I mean there's anti- Semitism has been a huge issue in France. It is not only anti-Israel, it is pro-Palestinian, and the expression is found throughout the political structure of France. This looks like another gambit to lay off blame for what is a strengthening strain of anti-Semitism in France and indeed Europe.</p><p>SCHLAPP: That's right. And look, I think what's happening -- what's ironic, Lou, is what's happening in Israel is this once socialist country has really been embracing free markets and innovation and really has become a kindred soul in one of our closest allies to obviously to America and to our way of life into our values.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people that just hate everything about the idea of innovation of entrepreneurs or free markets of the little guy being able to go to market and take his ideas to the customers. And they are against every aspect of that and I love the fact that Israel in America and freedom-loving people including the people of South America, including the freedom lovers in Venezuela. We're working together to rid the world of this dreaded socialism.</p><p>DOBBS: Dreaded socialism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism and that really what I was asking you about. Socialism is as the President assured is this country will never be socialistic. What is in question tonight is whether or not one guy you know, is going to be the successor to Maduro. Will he or will he not and what is your sense from where you look?</p><p>SCHLAPP: It's a great question, Lou. And I worry I think it's a little bit of a jump ball right now. I think the President, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo we're trying to do everything they can to use power in influence to stand up for the Venezuelan people in this new president Mr. Guaido. And Maduro is a -- is a tin-pot dictator. And you know they have a lot of power at the end of their reigns. And we'll see if he's able to use that power. But I'm hopeful that the right side will win out in Venezuela.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, there's a lot of hope running around this country right now primarily because President Trump is indeed the leader of the free world. My question to you is why is the establishment in Washington D.C. not screaming for the arrest of Andrew McCabe and for all of his cohorts and the DOJ and the FBI? Why is it that there seems to be almost a satisfaction in the status quo no matter how rancid and corrupt in the swamp that is D.C.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Look, I'm disgusted by it and I guess there's only one person who can do something about it and that's Bill Barr. Is he either going to do this or he's not, and I'd be greatly disappointed if he doesn't. And I think --</p><p>DOBBS: Well, why the hell isn't the Republican Party's standing up and demanding his arrest? Why --</p><p>SCHLAPP: You know why.</p><p>DOBBS: I do not know why. I would not be asking you.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Well, I think the reason is because they don't want the controversy of actually taking the deep state on because they might be coming its next victim.</p><p>DOBBS: Then their doubtless wonders and why in the world should we tolerate these Koch brothers hired excuses for legislators and representatives. They represent nothing but Koch brothers, the Wall Street, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber, they are -- it's enough to make you sick.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Lou, if that's where the Republican Party stays, it will deserve to lose beyond the ash heap of history. We either going to represent the people or we're not and if we don't, we deserve to lose and we ought to get out of the way.</p><p>DOBBS: It's very simple. They either follow President Trump or they are going to be on the scrap heap of history. The problem is they could take the Republican with them. Matt, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Good to see you too.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, more on the dark political agenda of the deep state, their efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald Trump -- that's right -- to overthrow the U.S. government. Stay with us. We'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>DOBBS: Andrew McCabe, fired as acting director of the FBI last night on 60 Minutes confessed he was involved in an effort to remove well, President Trump from office and to overthrow the government of the United States. Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton says McCabe, the Department of Justice and the FBI were trying to overthrow the government and this republic.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT JUDICIAL WATCH: If there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt the media would be calling it a coup. But because you've got an elected bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this, and if the target is President Trump, they don't care. And Americans should realize this is how you can lose a republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: That's it for us tonight. We thank you for being with us. Tomorrow night, Congressman Mark Green, David Bossie, and Attorney Harmeet Dhillon among our guests tomorrow. We hope you'll join us. Thanks for being with us tonight. Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs. And again, thanks for being with us.

This aversion is President Trump and his administration on full display this weekend as former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe actually confessed that he, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and a host of corrupt FBI and Department of Justice actors sought to unseat a sitting president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR:  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.  What I can say is the Deputy Attorney General was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confession.  Where is the outrage about their treason?  Where is the Republican Party and its leaders demanding they arrest McCabe and the rest of his cohorts who conspired to overthrow the President of the United States?  McCabe's admission of the coup attempted by the corrupt deep state went without as much a follow-up question by CBS.  Where is the national media?  Left-wing, though it may be, it in demanding answers, accountability, and transparency for this aversion and outright sedition?</p><p>Judicial watch President, Tom Fitton, Radio Show Host, Tammy Bruce among our guest here tonight to discuss those questions and their answers.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, over the weekend calling the United States embarrassing.  As globalist foreign leaders and the radical Dems applaud their approval of his careless and outrageous remarks on foreign soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents or turning their back on refugees on our border.  Americans know that's not right.  The American people understand, please, because it makes us embarrassing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Biden is the embarrassment.  What should be embarrassing to Biden is that he can't even garner the support of his former president, President Barack Obama.  Obama saying he will not endorse a Democrat for president even if Biden decides to run.  We take up Biden's embarrassing trip overseas.  Republican Strategist, Ed Rollins, Matt Schlapp joins us.  And President Trump today in Miami issuing his strong support for Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.</p><p>The President's message clear and definitive.  The United States will never be a socialist nation, we take up the President's address and much more here tonight.  Our top story, former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe confessed there was in fact a deep state conspiracy among his cohorts in the Justice Department and FBI to remove President Trump from office.  Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCCABE:  Counting votes, or possible vote.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The former acting FBI director told \"60 MINUTES\" the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein openly discussed how many cabinet members would support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President.  But the FBI's former general counsel, James Baker who met contemporaneously with McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page about their conversations with Rosenstein testified the effort went further.</p><p>\"I had the impression the Deputy Attorney General had already discussed this with two members in the President's cabinet.  And that they were on board with this concept already.\"    On Twitter the President responded to McCabe on \"60 MINUTES,\" \"While, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.  He and Rod Rosenstein look like they were planning a very illegal act.\"</p><p>McCabe and others say the President's May 2017 firing of Director James Comey left the FBI and Justice Department in turmoil.  And they concerned that the firing was designed to be synced the Russian probe and obstruct justice.</p><p>MCCABE:  The Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire into the White House.  He said, I never get search when I going to the White House.  I think the General Counsel had a heart attack.  When he got up off the floor he said, I -- that's a bridge too far.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  But Baker who could face criminal penalties for lying to Congressional investigators testified \"My recollection is that there were discussions about it over longer period than the course of one meeting, a couple of days.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  McCabe said Rosenstein initially resisted a Special Counsel because the Deputy Attorney General worried he might lose his job.  A senior department official told Fox tonight the Special Counsel was appointed \"to ensure that the Russia investigation was truly independent and without bias.\"  Something the official said that McCabe could not have accomplished.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Catherine, thanks very much.  Catherine Herridge.  Well, joining us tonight, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch.  One of the country's most effective watchdog groups.  And he's worked with the International Policy Forum, the Leadership Institute, Accuracy in Media, among others.  Tom, good to have you with us.  What we just heard from the folks at \"60 MINUTES\" over at CBS, although they didn't ask a follow-up question, it was an outright confession by McCabe that he was committing felonies and an attempt to overthrow the President of the United States along with a number of his colleagues.  Your reaction when you heard it?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Well, it's extraordinary.  It confirms early reports last year that this discussion took place.  You know, Lou, if there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt we'll be -- we'll be calling it a coup.  But because you got -- I don't like the bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this and it's -- the target is President Trump, they don't care.</p><p>And America should realize this is how you can lose a Republic where you have appointees of the President and bureaucrats to answer to virtually no one talk about manipulating the law in order to overturn a presidential election and attack a president they don't like.  They don't like for any substantial reason.  They don't like him because they fired -- he fired his buddy, McCabe's buddy and Rosenstein's buddy, James Comey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  At the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein, by the way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON:  Right.  A fight about a personnel decision.  And they're going to overthrow the presidency.  And, you know, let's be clear here, Mueller is a successor to this coup attempt.  He's -- the appointment flows out of all of these discussions and we should recognize that the effort to overthrow the President is continuing with Justice Department help through this out-of-control Mueller investigation.</p><p>DOBBS:  And without so much as -- and effort, explanation, rationalization, this is -- we're watching McCabe basically saying he was doing it for the country's own good.  Here's a man sworn to enforce the law, to enforce the constitution of the United States, to defend the United States committing subversions, in my opinion, sedition and treason.  And those who want to say that we're not at war should reference the war on terror that we've been engaged in for 19 -- almost 19 years.</p><p>This is outrageous and we haven't heard a word from the leadership of the Republican Party about arresting these people.  We haven't heard a word from the so-called establishment that is supposed to hold the tenants values of this -- of this great nation and primacy.  They are just simply averting their eyes.  It's appalling, it's disgusting, there should be outrage throughout the country in both parties across every part of this nation.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I agree.  And the problem with the Justice Department is that Mueller is still running the Justice Department effectively.  And so any effort to uncover what went on behind this investigation and this is what went on behind this investigation, runs into the Mueller juggernaut.  And, you know, Attorney General Barr, he needs to step up and defend the President.  You know, the argument for -- against Barr was will he stand up to President Trump?</p><p>And I think the test for Attorney General Barr is, will he stand up for President Trump and for the rule of law against these deep stators and the establishment who don't care about our constitution.  You know, President Trump may survive this attack on him but maybe another President want.  And we'll lose our Republic and we won't even know it came.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I guarantee he will survive these attacks.  He's already demonstrated that he is stronger than the entire lot of these extraordinary venal, vicious actors in the Justice Department.  What may not survive is his Justice Department and the FBI.  And Tom Fitton, should they survive?  Because they are the root of the corruption and the malignancy of the others wanted to subscribe to this administration.</p><p>When, in point of fact, they have been the perpetrators of wrongdoing from the months preceding the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p>FITTON:  Well, my -- you know, I'm a small government conservative.  I think all government agencies should be subject to scrutiny every year before any money is given to them.  And given the corruption at the DOJ, I think we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The problem with that is, the appropriators as well as the investigators are also deep state actors and have been working just as viciously, frankly, behind the scenes as the people in the Justice Department and the FBI.  My god.</p><p>FITTON:  You know, the problem with the FBI is the current leadership frankly, Mr. Ray has zero interest in reforming the organization.</p><p>DOBBS:  Where is he?</p><p>FITTON:  That's why --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, we don't even hear from him.</p><p>FITTON:  He is missing in action when it comes to standing and uncovering -- I -- uncovering the corruption and to a degree he said anything, Lou, he's been excusing the corruption.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Exactly.  Tom, it's always good to have you here.  I wish we're talking in better circumstances.  But, as you intimated at the outset, the Republic itself is at stake here.</p><p>FITTON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the silence is absolutely chilling.  Thank you so much, Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON:  Welcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  And again, as always, and I mean it even when I don't say, thanks for everything that you and Judicial Watch do.  Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome.  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, one of the most embarrassing figures in modern American political history.  Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken his anti- American message overseas embarrassing the United States in front of our allies and many of his former colleagues in the Obama administration.  It's a shadow government.  We'll take that up and more right after this quick break.  Ed Rollins joins me.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A New York Times report today saying former President Obama is counseling the Dems' 2020 hopefuls but he will not be giving the New York Times assures us, anyone, anyone, not even Joe Biden, his endorsement.  His former Vice President taking a page out of his old Obama playbook.  Apologizing for America overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents.  It makes us an embarrassing in the example we're setting.  Well, I should stop.  As my mother would say, this too shall pass.  We will be back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  I wouldn't bet on it.  In any way, shape, or fashion, at least not led by one Joe Biden.  He's just blown his chances for 2020 in all likelihood.  Biden, it seems forgot one important lesson from his former boss.  President Obama at least waited until he had been elected and was in office before slamming America overseas.  Well, joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst Ed Rollins.  Ed, great to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  What a day.  Let's start with Biden, he just blew it, didn't he?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he certainly did something outrageous than anybody I've ever known.  A former Vice President to go before this important meeting and condemn the America is just outrageous.  You often do that if you're a presidential candidate in Iowa, or (INAUDIBLE) New Hampshire or somewhere.  But to go before our allies and to basically take apart the administration's position is just outrageous.</p><p>DOBBS:  When President Obama did that, his famous apology tour in Berlin in Cairo, he had been elected.</p><p>ROLLINS:  He'd been elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, there was a chance to make things right in 2012.  Romney didn't make that happen.  I think Biden can just kiss it goodbye, personally.  I would like to turn to this extraordinary piece on \"60 MINUTES\" in which Andrew McCabe actually confessed to trying to overthrow the President of the United States, Ed.  And where's the outrage from the Republican leadership?  I mean, I think the whole country should be just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  I have to tell you, from when I sat and watched it last night I was outraged because there's a conspiracy going on.  First of all, the 25th Amendment is for a president to step aside if he has health issues or something else.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Or a Vice President to step in if the President is incapacitated.  It is not about removing a president from office.  And I think to a certain extent, you think the Justice Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  These guys were not only obviously corrupt, they were stupid beyond imagining for people who were supposedly trained in law and respectful of it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the fact that before this, any evidence that basically still plotting and scheming to take out a President of the United States and talking to members of the cabinet according to him with the full support of the acting attorney general, I just found it appalling.  It's so un-American, it's like --</p><p>DOBBS:  So, where is the Republican Party?  Why aren't the leaders of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, every republican governor, every Republican governor, every Republican in this country standing up and saying end the witch-hunt, end all of this non-sense, it's obviously a cabal that has been working and the conspiracy to overthrow the President of the United States or tacitly they are endorsing it with their silence.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, their silence is terrible.  The reality is we are in a fight of our life.  President Trump basically doing everything he promised to do, moving the ball forward.  But the Democrats are really revved up and they're going to do everything they can to stop him.  From lawsuits to what have you.  And they're not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in the land that will join this president on the basis of his declaration of a national emergency.  I -- we know then that the corruption has absolutely grasped our judiciary system as well.  We got every indication that that's happened.  But for them to enjoin a president in a matter of national security would be an act against the Republic, the constitution itself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you and I have been around long enough to know that's going to happen.  And at the end of the day it's going to end up being in the Supreme Court.  And the Supreme Court has to rule in the President's favor at the end of the day here.  But it's going to go through the process.  There's -- all of these political attorney generals and what have you who want to make (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS:  But honorable, honest and judges who are not overwhelmed by their partisan prejudice would understand that that it could be absolutely litigated in our judiciary.  Without enjoining until a decision by the high court.  That would be the honorable thing to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the absolute honoring thing to do.  And I would -- I would hope the Supreme Court is stepping very quickly if they started out this process.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  I worry about this court and what more -- the more that we learned about Chief Justice John Roberts, I'm not saying when about, what will or will not occur in that high court.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I'm hopeful in the end he will do the right thing.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Well, we can all hope.  But I'd rather have certainty.</p><p>ROLLINS:  In the end.  In the end.  There is no certainty -- there's no certainty in life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there isn't.  But in this constitution there should be absolute certainty.  Ed Rollins, thanks much.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  We appreciate it.  We'd like to hear your thoughts on all this.  Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Coming up here next, Chicago Police, they want answers from actor, Jussie Smollett after their investigation into an alleged hate crime reverses.  That and much more coming up next.  We'll be talking with Washington Times' Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Before we go to break, let's take a look at the U.S. national debt as if we don't have enough problems already.  $22 trillion and climbing.  We're coming right back after this.  Stay brave of heart, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump in Miami today for claiming the days of socialism in the western hemisphere are numbered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If you choose this path, you have the opportunity to help forge a safe and prosperous future for all of the people of Venezuela.  Or you can choose the second path, continuing to support Maduro.  If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out.  You will lose everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump also using his speech to continue to express his supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.  A reported hate crime in Chicago looking more and more like a hate hoax.  Chicago Police say they no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim.  And they are pushing for a follow-up interview which his attorney -- Smollett's attorneys have resisted.  The police request -- imagine that, a request comes amid new reports that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault.</p><p>Both men have been questioned and released without charges.  Reverend Al Sharpton, we want to point out, responding to the news.  And Sharpton saying Smollett should face as he put it, \"accountability to the maximum\" if it's found the actor stage the attack.  Joining us tonight, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times Columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Tammy, good to see you.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, everybody.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Smollett and the hoax.  I have to give Reverend Al Sharpton great credit for standing up which by the way all of the candidates who have been commenting on this, the Democratic candidates have not had the courage to do.  Your thoughts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  The candidates seem to be wanting to pretend this never happened.  They get away without law because then the media also steps away from it and stops discussing it.  But Reverend Al Sharpton of course is very well known for promoting one of the original hoaxes, if you will with a young woman named Tawana Brawley who made some accusations against police officers which ended up being false.</p><p>So it's fascinating that he would actually take that position.  So good for him if he has found, you know, the right direction.  And maybe -- I don't know, maybe he's thinking that Mr. Smollett deserves a program on MSNBC like he has.  Who knows what that end result should be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you brought that to us with a sense of appropriate justice.</p><p>BRUCE:  Absolutely.  Hanging every day, every day.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's turn to Venezuela, the President today importantly going to Miami as the setting to announce his views and judgment and policies on the hemisphere and Venezuela in particular.  Your thoughts?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Perfect of course.  We know for South Florida it has a lot of people who are immigrants who have experienced in our lifetimes very recently, the impact of totalitarianism and tyrants.  So when he --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Venezuelans by the way.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, Venezuelans and Cubans.  So when he's speaking it happens to be the right thing, of course it is the thing that the President believes in.  But it also speaks to the Venezuelans that are already in South Florida that are coming to South Florida but speaking to that core of people in this region that understand the importance of freedom, this nation, capitalism and the value of the support of the American Presidents.</p><p>And so it's going to make I think a big different for people there and sends a very strong message back home about what his intentions are.</p><p>DOBBS:  I think he had a couple of other audiences as well in mind as he spoke.  And one of this of course the American people when he said this country will never be socialist.  That was a loud straightforward challenge to everyone of the -- what seemed to be every one of the Democratic hopefuls so far.  At least announced, this is not going to be an easy campaign for you because you've already gone to the left and lined up against this country and our traditions.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  It's the first education they may be receiving about real life.  These are -- especially young people, Miss Ocasio-Cortez obviously seems to not have any major education about the impact of socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Or minor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Or a minor education on the nape on how it destroys lives, on how it destroys countries and economies.  So, this is going to be her first indication about courtesy of the President, about real life and what socialism does to people.</p><p>DOBBS:  This could be an expensive tutorial for AOC if it moves into, as it appears, it is about to, into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  This is -- it could be.  And she won't understand this, I think, until 2020.  The benefit of this education for the American people about what the Democratic Party is becoming, and how everybody is running on this kind of an issue.</p><p>The President stands as the bulwark against this framework and as a reminder about what -- how greatness really can be brought into our lives.  And it's not through certainly that totalitarianism by any stretch.</p><p>DOBBS:  And most to me, it's very encouraging to see the presidential tracking poll with the president's popularity.  I had approval rising at 52 percent.  I confess that I personally think it should be significantly higher, and I hope it soon will be.</p><p>BRUCE:  It probably is, as a matter of fact.  When you think about the --</p><p>DOBBS:  I'd like to see it expressed in black-and-white.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Like you, I have faith in the forgotten man and woman in this country.  But this president, I think now, has turned a very important corner.  I think the national left-wing media understands it.  It is beginning to understand it.  That's why they are not quite as free with their nonsense as they have been.</p><p>In other words, Jim Acosta is receding quite a bit, as his colleagues, I think, on the left, in that White House briefing room, for example, it's one of the barometers of this all.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's good news.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy, good to have you here.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Up next, British lawmakers say Facebook is acting like gangsters with our personal information.  We take that up.  Now, the Europeans are doing something about it.  Why in the world isn't the United States?  Isn't privacy an even bigger right for Americans?  We take that up with cyber expert, Morgan Wright.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.  Oh, Google, Facebook, gangsters.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Headlines tonight, Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, claims he has \"a lot of discretion on border wall funding from President Trump's national emergency declaration,\" despite receiving a direct order from the President of the United States to secure the border.</p><p>Shanahan says \"I'm not required to do anything.\"  Well, he'd be required to do something, one would think, like pack his bags and get out of there.  A North Carolina elections board, beginning deliberations over election fraud allegations, Republican Mark Harris leading in last month's ninth congressional district election.</p><p>The board consists of three Democrats, two Republicans, they will decide whether to certify a winner or order a new election, Harris, by the way, leading Democrat Dan McCready, by 905 votes, but again, the vote that may count as the 3-2 vote on the elections board.</p><p>A new report from the U.K. parliament, calling Facebook, digital gangsters, for failing to thwart attempts by Russia to influence elections, the report accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of contempt of parliament.</p><p>Joining me now, Morgan Wright, Former Senior Advisor in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, Former Law Enforcement Advisor to the Republican National Committee, Cyber Security Expert, Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, EXPERT, CYBERSECURITY:  Hey, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me start with, first, the gangsters that Facebook and Google.  Who knew that they were going to be declared gangsters first by the U.K., rather than the United States?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, I don't see Al Pacino playing Mark Zuckerberg in a movie, you know, about gangsters, but yes, you know.  And Lou, we've talked about this before about why is the -- why is the E.U. ahead of us with things like the General Data Protection Regulations, privacy?</p><p>And I'll tell you, the only thing I can think of as it comes down to money, because there's a -- Facebook has figured out the Google playbook, which is, spend a lot of money, spend a lot of time here in D.C., on K Street, M Street, whatever all the streets are, and you know, get in there and lobby people, spread lots of money around.</p><p>And Lou, during the hearings, how many members of Congress did we see ponder to Mark Zuckerberg, hoping to relocate shit jobs in their district.  I mean, this is one reason why you don't have it because everybody's hoping to get something from Zuckerberg.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and -- but it reinforces the impression.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  That a half dozen of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have such concentrated economic and technological and political power, that they are almost now so large that it is impossible to rein them in.  Is that fear well-placed?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  And I'll tell you, Lou, you and I talked about this awhile back too, when we talked about how globalism is killing patriotism.  And all of these companies have taken the advantage of the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) well guess what?</p><p>It's coming home to roost now, because now that these companies want to be global.  Your subject to the E.U. regulations, the U.K. regulations, you know, Germany's regulations, all of these other places that actually place a premium on privacy, for too long self-regulation, they've tried it, it hasn't worked.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is the self-regulation go away.  And you're going to see more government interventions starting overseas, and hopefully, it'll end up over here, not to put them out of business, but, man, we've got to put a check on the seemingly unchecked power that they have right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  There is no countervailing influence in our economy, or our society, or our body politic to the awesome power of big tech.  That's simply a fact, and to that, the power of Wall Street and Corporate America.</p><p>And right now, the middle class in this country, if they were not the champion, the President of the United States would be defenseless against an onslaught that had rolled back the middle class for 20 years, and which under this president, is once again, growing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.  And look, you know, something interesting that came out of the U.K. report too, is they talked about -- even though Zuckerberg, in front of Congress, and sent his minions over there to say we don' sell any data, it's clear they've been selling data.  It's true that they've been using apps to spy on the activities of users and their competitors.</p><p>Look, this is the modern version.</p><p>DOBBS:  And even those who are not users.</p><p>WRIGHT:  --have that power, right, absolutely.  And the KGB only wished they would've had this power back in the day.  You know, our NSA and FBI don't have near the power that Facebook, Google, Amazon.  You know, these folks have to spy into the lives of us, but there are no consequences for it.  At some point, there has to be stick because the carrot hasn't worked.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  This is a president who is keenly aware --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- that U.S. policies haven't worked.  He is also confronted now by ZTE, as a favor to President Xi.  He backed off of the consequences for ZTE, Huawei, now paying the consequences for its role in spying, but doing so, only within our court system, not as a result of a national security response from the part of the United States.</p><p>How much longer can we go without saying straightforwardly to the Chinese, there will be a response on national security terms if you continue to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from this country each year and carry out acts of espionage nonstop.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, I think Gordon Chang's been on with before he talked about poor Chinese economically, I think they need to put -- they need to put the hammer down on Huawei.  It's time to put Huawei and ZTE out of business.</p><p>And I'll tell you why, Lou, the upcoming 5G, Huawei is doing everything they can to get their technology into these countries, but you've Australia, New Zealand, Japan.  The U.K. said it's going to take, you know -- they probably going to have to spend five years and $2-$3 billion to meet the U.K. standards.</p><p>The best way to stop this economic espionage is to quit lulling the government of China to subsidize the rail system, the electronic system, the communication systems to where it's all Chinese infrastructure.  And there's no U.S. infrastructure in play.  We can't -- it's not a fair fight.</p><p>So, I think they've got to put the hammer down on these guys.  One of the ways to stop espionage is to keep their equipment out of our infrastructure.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the -- and the administration to its credit is trying to do exactly that.  Huawei, at the same time, is bragging they are now too big to stop.  And this is -- this again, is advised rhetoric from the PLA and from President Xi, himself.</p><p>The Communist Party is now flaunting their economic and political and military power.  The United States is -- has to simply respond, and hopefully, before it becomes a military response.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  But it looks as though we are absolutely vulnerable in cyberspace right now.  Is that a correct impression?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, absolutely.  Lou, we have -- from our power grid, to our nuclear plants, to you know -- the rail system transportation.  A lot of things are still so vulnerable because we're so fragmented.  We don't have --</p><p>Even though we might have an overall plan, we don't have an overall coherent ability to secure all the things we need to do, why, because the private sector owns 85 percent of the critical infrastructure that's out there.</p><p>The government can provide a lot of support, a lot of help, but were the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese?  And even the North Koreans are exploiting.  They're exploiting all of these gaps between the different infrastructures.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>WRIGHT:  The lack of coherence among the security plans.  And the old technology that's out there.  We've got out-of-date machines that are still running windows that haven't been supported for five or six years.</p><p>DOBBS:  What Morgan is not saying, that 85 percent that is in the private sector, is often run by CEOs and boards that are frankly, friendlier to Chinese policies than they are to the policies of the Trump administration and the U.S. government.  And that's got to change, straightaway.  I didn't put words in your mouth, did I, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Lou, you're always right.  That's one lesson I've learned.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, thanks so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you, Morgan Wright.</p><p>Up next, New York Governor Bill -- New York Mayor, Bill de Blasio says AOC doesn't know what she is talking about.  We take that up after the break with American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio putting freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her place after Amazon decided not to build its headquarters in Long Island City.  Cortez claimed the failed deal would free up $4 billion in taxes incentives for the city to use elsewhere.  The good mayor reminded her even a socialist understood this, at least one of the socialists did, reminding her the money would only be available after the city secured the Amazon jobs and revenue and that it wasn't in a budget somewhere.</p><p>Radical freshman congresswoman, there's a lot of those going around.  Ilhan Omar scheduled to raise money in March for the Hamas link council on American-Islamic relations.  Omar received $5,000 from them during a run for Congress.  She since repeatedly made headlines for her anti-Semitic remarks most recently suggesting Republican support of Israel is bought and paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC.  At some point anti-Semitic remarks result in being anti -- an anti-Semite it seems.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Matt Schlapp.  He's the chairman of the American Conservative Union.  Why is it that the Left is suddenly so reluctant to say what is obvious that they have an anti-Semitic strain within their party and on Capitol Hill and aren't dealing with it?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, I completely agree with you, Lou, but I asked -- I actually think it's more cynical than this.  I think the Democratic Party has really shed its longtime support of the State of Israel.  I think they're moving away from this policy point of view and I think it gives Donald Trump who has done everything he said he would do with getting rid of the Iran deal, moving the embassy a great chance with these voters not with the not with the Liberal leaders potentially of this community but with everyday voters who can see anti-Semitism when it's so clear.</p><p>DOBBS:  Anti-Semitism, we saw reports today that the yellow vest in France you know, blaming them for a strain of anti-Semitism within France leaving out the entire ruling body and class in France that -- I mean there's anti-Semitism has been a huge issue in France.  It is not only anti-Israel, it is pro-Palestinian, and the expression is found throughout the political structure of France.  This looks like another gambit to lay off blame for what is a strengthening strain of anti-Semitism in France and indeed Europe.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.  And look, I think what's happening -- what's ironic, Lou, is what's happening in Israel is this once socialist country has really been embracing free markets and innovation and really has become a kindred soul in one of our closest allies to obviously to America and to our way of life into our values.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people that just hate everything about the idea of innovation of entrepreneurs or free markets of the little guy being able to go to market and take his ideas to the customers.  And they are against every aspect of that and I love the fact that Israel in America and freedom-loving people including the people of South America, including the freedom lovers in Venezuela.  We're working together to rid the world of this dreaded socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dreaded socialism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism and that really what I was asking you about.  Socialism is as the President assured is this country will never be socialistic.  What is in question tonight is whether or not one guy you know, is going to be the successor to Maduro.  Will he or will he not and what is your sense from where you look?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a great question, Lou.  And I worry I think it's a little bit of a jump ball right now.  I think the President, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo we're trying to do everything they can to use power in influence to stand up for the Venezuelan people in this new president Mr. Guaido.  And Maduro is a -- is a tin-pot dictator.  And you know they have a lot of power at the end of their reigns.  And we'll see if he's able to use that power.  But I'm hopeful that the right side will win out in Venezuela.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's a lot of hope running around this country right now primarily because President Trump is indeed the leader of the free world.  My question to you is why is the establishment in Washington D.C. not screaming for the arrest of Andrew McCabe and for all of his cohorts and the DOJ and the FBI?  Why is it that there seems to be almost a satisfaction in the status quo no matter how rancid and corrupt in the swamp that is D.C.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Look, I'm disgusted by it and I guess there's only one person who can do something about it and that's Bill Barr.  Is he either going to do this or he's not, and I'd be greatly disappointed if he doesn't.  And I think --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why the hell isn't the Republican Party's standing up and demanding his arrest?  Why --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You know why.</p><p>DOBBS:  I do not know why.  I would not be asking you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I think the reason is because they don't want the controversy of actually taking the deep state on because they might be coming its next victim.</p><p>DOBBS:  Then their doubtless wonders and why in the world should we tolerate these Koch brothers hired excuses for legislators and representatives.  They represent nothing but Koch brothers, the Wall Street, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber, they are -- it's enough to make you sick.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Lou, if that's where the Republican Party stays, it will deserve to lose beyond the ash heap of history.  We either going to represent the people or we're not and if we don't, we deserve to lose and we ought to get out of the way.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's very simple.  They either follow President Trump or they are going to be on the scrap heap of history.  The problem is they could take the Republican with them.  Matt, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Good to see you too.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the dark political agenda of the deep state, their efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald Trump -- that's right -- to overthrow the U.S. government.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Andrew McCabe, fired as acting director of the FBI last night on 60 Minutes confessed he was involved in an effort to remove well, President Trump from office and to overthrow the government of the United States.  Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton says McCabe, the Department of Justice and the FBI were trying to overthrow the government and this republic.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT JUDICIAL WATCH:  If there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt the media would be calling it a coup.  But because you've got an elected bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this, and if the target is President Trump, they don't care.  And Americans should realize this is how you can lose a republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Tomorrow night, Congressman Mark Green, David Bossie, and Attorney Harmeet Dhillon among our guests tomorrow.  We hope you'll join us.  Thanks for being with us tonight.  Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs.  And again, thanks for being with us.  Good night.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2183280215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8B-GB61-DY0W-4279-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

This aversion is President Trump and his administration on full display this weekend as former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe actually confessed that he, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and a host of corrupt FBI and Department of Justice actors sought to unseat a sitting president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR:  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.  What I can say is the Deputy Attorney General was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confession.  Where is the outrage about their treason?  Where is the Republican Party and its leaders demanding they arrest McCabe and the rest of his cohorts who conspired to overthrow the President of the United States?  McCabe's admission of the coup attempted by the corrupt deep state went without as much a follow-up question by CBS.  Where is the national media?  Left-wing, though it may be, it in demanding answers, accountability, and transparency for this aversion and outright sedition?</p><p>Judicial watch President, Tom Fitton, Radio Show Host, Tammy Bruce among our guest here tonight to discuss those questions and their answers.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, over the weekend calling the United States embarrassing.  As globalist foreign leaders and the radical Dems applaud their approval of his careless and outrageous remarks on foreign soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents or turning their back on refugees on our border.  Americans know that's not right.  The American people understand, please, because it makes us embarrassing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Biden is the embarrassment.  What should be embarrassing to Biden is that he can't even garner the support of his former president, President Barack Obama.  Obama saying he will not endorse a Democrat for president even if Biden decides to run.  We take up Biden's embarrassing trip overseas.  Republican Strategist, Ed Rollins, Matt Schlapp joins us.  And President Trump today in Miami issuing his strong support for Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.</p><p>The President's message clear and definitive.  The United States will never be a socialist nation, we take up the President's address and much more here tonight.  Our top story, former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe confessed there was in fact a deep state conspiracy among his cohorts in the Justice Department and FBI to remove President Trump from office.  Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCCABE:  Counting votes, or possible vote.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The former acting FBI director told \"60 MINUTES\" the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein openly discussed how many cabinet members would support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President.  But the FBI's former general counsel, James Baker who met contemporaneously with McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page about their conversations with Rosenstein testified the effort went further.</p><p>\"I had the impression the Deputy Attorney General had already discussed this with two members in the President's cabinet.  And that they were on board with this concept already.\"    On Twitter the President responded to McCabe on \"60 MINUTES,\" \"While, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.  He and Rod Rosenstein look like they were planning a very illegal act.\"</p><p>McCabe and others say the President's May 2017 firing of Director James Comey left the FBI and Justice Department in turmoil.  And they concerned that the firing was designed to be synced the Russian probe and obstruct justice.</p><p>MCCABE:  The Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire into the White House.  He said, I never get search when I going to the White House.  I think the General Counsel had a heart attack.  When he got up off the floor he said, I -- that's a bridge too far.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  But Baker who could face criminal penalties for lying to Congressional investigators testified \"My recollection is that there were discussions about it over longer period than the course of one meeting, a couple of days.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  McCabe said Rosenstein initially resisted a Special Counsel because the Deputy Attorney General worried he might lose his job.  A senior department official told Fox tonight the Special Counsel was appointed \"to ensure that the Russia investigation was truly independent and without bias.\"  Something the official said that McCabe could not have accomplished.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Catherine, thanks very much.  Catherine Herridge.  Well, joining us tonight, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch.  One of the country's most effective watchdog groups.  And he's worked with the International Policy Forum, the Leadership Institute, Accuracy in Media, among others.  Tom, good to have you with us.  What we just heard from the folks at \"60 MINUTES\" over at CBS, although they didn't ask a follow-up question, it was an outright confession by McCabe that he was committing felonies and an attempt to overthrow the President of the United States along with a number of his colleagues.  Your reaction when you heard it?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Well, it's extraordinary.  It confirms early reports last year that this discussion took place.  You know, Lou, if there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt we'll be -- we'll be calling it a coup.  But because you got -- I don't like the bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this and it's -- the target is President Trump, they don't care.</p><p>And America should realize this is how you can lose a Republic where you have appointees of the President and bureaucrats to answer to virtually no one talk about manipulating the law in order to overturn a presidential election and attack a president they don't like.  They don't like for any substantial reason.  They don't like him because they fired -- he fired his buddy, McCabe's buddy and Rosenstein's buddy, James Comey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  At the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein, by the way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON:  Right.  A fight about a personnel decision.  And they're going to overthrow the presidency.  And, you know, let's be clear here, Mueller is a successor to this coup attempt.  He's -- the appointment flows out of all of these discussions and we should recognize that the effort to overthrow the President is continuing with Justice Department help through this out-of-control Mueller investigation.</p><p>DOBBS:  And without so much as -- and effort, explanation, rationalization, this is -- we're watching McCabe basically saying he was doing it for the country's own good.  Here's a man sworn to enforce the law, to enforce the constitution of the United States, to defend the United States committing subversions, in my opinion, sedition and treason.  And those who want to say that we're not at war should reference the war on terror that we've been engaged in for 19 -- almost 19 years.</p><p>This is outrageous and we haven't heard a word from the leadership of the Republican Party about arresting these people.  We haven't heard a word from the so-called establishment that is supposed to hold the tenants values of this -- of this great nation and primacy.  They are just simply averting their eyes.  It's appalling, it's disgusting, there should be outrage throughout the country in both parties across every part of this nation.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I agree.  And the problem with the Justice Department is that Mueller is still running the Justice Department effectively.  And so any effort to uncover what went on behind this investigation and this is what went on behind this investigation, runs into the Mueller juggernaut.  And, you know, Attorney General Barr, he needs to step up and defend the President.  You know, the argument for -- against Barr was will he stand up to President Trump?</p><p>And I think the test for Attorney General Barr is, will he stand up for President Trump and for the rule of law against these deep stators and the establishment who don't care about our constitution.  You know, President Trump may survive this attack on him but maybe another President want.  And we'll lose our Republic and we won't even know it came.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I guarantee he will survive these attacks.  He's already demonstrated that he is stronger than the entire lot of these extraordinary venal, vicious actors in the Justice Department.  What may not survive is his Justice Department and the FBI.  And Tom Fitton, should they survive?  Because they are the root of the corruption and the malignancy of the others wanted to subscribe to this administration.</p><p>When, in point of fact, they have been the perpetrators of wrongdoing from the months preceding the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p>FITTON:  Well, my -- you know, I'm a small government conservative.  I think all government agencies should be subject to scrutiny every year before any money is given to them.  And given the corruption at the DOJ, I think we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The problem with that is, the appropriators as well as the investigators are also deep state actors and have been working just as viciously, frankly, behind the scenes as the people in the Justice Department and the FBI.  My god.</p><p>FITTON:  You know, the problem with the FBI is the current leadership frankly, Mr. Ray has zero interest in reforming the organization.</p><p>DOBBS:  Where is he?</p><p>FITTON:  That's why --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, we don't even hear from him.</p><p>FITTON:  He is missing in action when it comes to standing and uncovering -- I -- uncovering the corruption and to a degree he said anything, Lou, he's been excusing the corruption.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Exactly.  Tom, it's always good to have you here.  I wish we're talking in better circumstances.  But, as you intimated at the outset, the Republic itself is at stake here.</p><p>FITTON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the silence is absolutely chilling.  Thank you so much, Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON:  Welcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  And again, as always, and I mean it even when I don't say, thanks for everything that you and Judicial Watch do.  Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome.  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, one of the most embarrassing figures in modern American political history.  Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken his anti- American message overseas embarrassing the United States in front of our allies and many of his former colleagues in the Obama administration.  It's a shadow government.  We'll take that up and more right after this quick break.  Ed Rollins joins me.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A New York Times report today saying former President Obama is counseling the Dems' 2020 hopefuls but he will not be giving the New York Times assures us, anyone, anyone, not even Joe Biden, his endorsement.  His former Vice President taking a page out of his old Obama playbook.  Apologizing for America overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents.  It makes us an embarrassing in the example we're setting.  Well, I should stop.  As my mother would say, this too shall pass.  We will be back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  I wouldn't bet on it.  In any way, shape, or fashion, at least not led by one Joe Biden.  He's just blown his chances for 2020 in all likelihood.  Biden, it seems forgot one important lesson from his former boss.  President Obama at least waited until he had been elected and was in office before slamming America overseas.  Well, joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst Ed Rollins.  Ed, great to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  What a day.  Let's start with Biden, he just blew it, didn't he?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he certainly did something outrageous than anybody I've ever known.  A former Vice President to go before this important meeting and condemn the America is just outrageous.  You often do that if you're a presidential candidate in Iowa, or (INAUDIBLE) New Hampshire or somewhere.  But to go before our allies and to basically take apart the administration's position is just outrageous.</p><p>DOBBS:  When President Obama did that, his famous apology tour in Berlin in Cairo, he had been elected.</p><p>ROLLINS:  He'd been elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, there was a chance to make things right in 2012.  Romney didn't make that happen.  I think Biden can just kiss it goodbye, personally.  I would like to turn to this extraordinary piece on \"60 MINUTES\" in which Andrew McCabe actually confessed to trying to overthrow the President of the United States, Ed.  And where's the outrage from the Republican leadership?  I mean, I think the whole country should be just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  I have to tell you, from when I sat and watched it last night I was outraged because there's a conspiracy going on.  First of all, the 25th Amendment is for a president to step aside if he has health issues or something else.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Or a Vice President to step in if the President is incapacitated.  It is not about removing a president from office.  And I think to a certain extent, you think the Justice Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  These guys were not only obviously corrupt, they were stupid beyond imagining for people who were supposedly trained in law and respectful of it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the fact that before this, any evidence that basically still plotting and scheming to take out a President of the United States and talking to members of the cabinet according to him with the full support of the acting attorney general, I just found it appalling.  It's so un-American, it's like --</p><p>DOBBS:  So, where is the Republican Party?  Why aren't the leaders of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, every republican governor, every Republican governor, every Republican in this country standing up and saying end the witch-hunt, end all of this non-sense, it's obviously a cabal that has been working and the conspiracy to overthrow the President of the United States or tacitly they are endorsing it with their silence.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, their silence is terrible.  The reality is we are in a fight of our life.  President Trump basically doing everything he promised to do, moving the ball forward.  But the Democrats are really revved up and they're going to do everything they can to stop him.  From lawsuits to what have you.  And they're not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in the land that will join this president on the basis of his declaration of a national emergency.  I -- we know then that the corruption has absolutely grasped our judiciary system as well.  We got every indication that that's happened.  But for them to enjoin a president in a matter of national security would be an act against the Republic, the constitution itself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you and I have been around long enough to know that's going to happen.  And at the end of the day it's going to end up being in the Supreme Court.  And the Supreme Court has to rule in the President's favor at the end of the day here.  But it's going to go through the process.  There's -- all of these political attorney generals and what have you who want to make (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS:  But honorable, honest and judges who are not overwhelmed by their partisan prejudice would understand that that it could be absolutely litigated in our judiciary.  Without enjoining until a decision by the high court.  That would be the honorable thing to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the absolute honoring thing to do.  And I would -- I would hope the Supreme Court is stepping very quickly if they started out this process.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  I worry about this court and what more -- the more that we learned about Chief Justice John Roberts, I'm not saying when about, what will or will not occur in that high court.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I'm hopeful in the end he will do the right thing.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Well, we can all hope.  But I'd rather have certainty.</p><p>ROLLINS:  In the end.  In the end.  There is no certainty -- there's no certainty in life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there isn't.  But in this constitution there should be absolute certainty.  Ed Rollins, thanks much.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  We appreciate it.  We'd like to hear your thoughts on all this.  Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Coming up here next, Chicago Police, they want answers from actor, Jussie Smollett after their investigation into an alleged hate crime reverses.  That and much more coming up next.  We'll be talking with Washington Times' Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Before we go to break, let's take a look at the U.S. national debt as if we don't have enough problems already.  $22 trillion and climbing.  We're coming right back after this.  Stay brave of heart, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump in Miami today for claiming the days of socialism in the western hemisphere are numbered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If you choose this path, you have the opportunity to help forge a safe and prosperous future for all of the people of Venezuela.  Or you can choose the second path, continuing to support Maduro.  If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out.  You will lose everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump also using his speech to continue to express his supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.  A reported hate crime in Chicago looking more and more like a hate hoax.  Chicago Police say they no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim.  And they are pushing for a follow-up interview which his attorney -- Smollett's attorneys have resisted.  The police request -- imagine that, a request comes amid new reports that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault.</p><p>Both men have been questioned and released without charges.  Reverend Al Sharpton, we want to point out, responding to the news.  And Sharpton saying Smollett should face as he put it, \"accountability to the maximum\" if it's found the actor stage the attack.  Joining us tonight, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times Columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Tammy, good to see you.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, everybody.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Smollett and the hoax.  I have to give Reverend Al Sharpton great credit for standing up which by the way all of the candidates who have been commenting on this, the Democratic candidates have not had the courage to do.  Your thoughts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  The candidates seem to be wanting to pretend this never happened.  They get away without law because then the media also steps away from it and stops discussing it.  But Reverend Al Sharpton of course is very well known for promoting one of the original hoaxes, if you will with a young woman named Tawana Brawley who made some accusations against police officers which ended up being false.</p><p>So it's fascinating that he would actually take that position.  So good for him if he has found, you know, the right direction.  And maybe -- I don't know, maybe he's thinking that Mr. Smollett deserves a program on MSNBC like he has.  Who knows what that end result should be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you brought that to us with a sense of appropriate justice.</p><p>BRUCE:  Absolutely.  Hanging every day, every day.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's turn to Venezuela, the President today importantly going to Miami as the setting to announce his views and judgment and policies on the hemisphere and Venezuela in particular.  Your thoughts?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Perfect of course.  We know for South Florida it has a lot of people who are immigrants who have experienced in our lifetimes very recently, the impact of totalitarianism and tyrants.  So when he --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Venezuelans by the way.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, Venezuelans and Cubans.  So when he's speaking it happens to be the right thing, of course it is the thing that the President believes in.  But it also speaks to the Venezuelans that are already in South Florida that are coming to South Florida but speaking to that core of people in this region that understand the importance of freedom, this nation, capitalism and the value of the support of the American Presidents.</p><p>And so it's going to make I think a big different for people there and sends a very strong message back home about what his intentions are.</p><p>DOBBS:  I think he had a couple of other audiences as well in mind as he spoke.  And one of this of course the American people when he said this country will never be socialist.  That was a loud straightforward challenge to everyone of the -- what seemed to be every one of the Democratic hopefuls so far.  At least announced, this is not going to be an easy campaign for you because you've already gone to the left and lined up against this country and our traditions.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  It's the first education they may be receiving about real life.  These are -- especially young people, Miss Ocasio-Cortez obviously seems to not have any major education about the impact of socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Or minor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Or a minor education on the nape on how it destroys lives, on how it destroys countries and economies.  So, this is going to be her first indication about courtesy of the President, about real life and what socialism does to people.</p><p>DOBBS:  This could be an expensive tutorial for AOC if it moves into, as it appears, it is about to, into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  This is -- it could be.  And she won't understand this, I think, until 2020.  The benefit of this education for the American people about what the Democratic Party is becoming, and how everybody is running on this kind of an issue.</p><p>The President stands as the bulwark against this framework and as a reminder about what -- how greatness really can be brought into our lives.  And it's not through certainly that totalitarianism by any stretch.</p><p>DOBBS:  And most to me, it's very encouraging to see the presidential tracking poll with the president's popularity.  I had approval rising at 52 percent.  I confess that I personally think it should be significantly higher, and I hope it soon will be.</p><p>BRUCE:  It probably is, as a matter of fact.  When you think about the --</p><p>DOBBS:  I'd like to see it expressed in black-and-white.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Like you, I have faith in the forgotten man and woman in this country.  But this president, I think now, has turned a very important corner.  I think the national left-wing media understands it.  It is beginning to understand it.  That's why they are not quite as free with their nonsense as they have been.</p><p>In other words, Jim Acosta is receding quite a bit, as his colleagues, I think, on the left, in that White House briefing room, for example, it's one of the barometers of this all.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's good news.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy, good to have you here.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Up next, British lawmakers say Facebook is acting like gangsters with our personal information.  We take that up.  Now, the Europeans are doing something about it.  Why in the world isn't the United States?  Isn't privacy an even bigger right for Americans?  We take that up with cyber expert, Morgan Wright.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.  Oh, Google, Facebook, gangsters.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Headlines tonight, Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, claims he has \"a lot of discretion on border wall funding from President Trump's national emergency declaration,\" despite receiving a direct order from the President of the United States to secure the border.</p><p>Shanahan says \"I'm not required to do anything.\"  Well, he'd be required to do something, one would think, like pack his bags and get out of there.  A North Carolina elections board, beginning deliberations over election fraud allegations, Republican Mark Harris leading in last month's ninth congressional district election.</p><p>The board consists of three Democrats, two Republicans, they will decide whether to certify a winner or order a new election, Harris, by the way, leading Democrat Dan McCready, by 905 votes, but again, the vote that may count as the 3-2 vote on the elections board.</p><p>A new report from the U.K. parliament, calling Facebook, digital gangsters, for failing to thwart attempts by Russia to influence elections, the report accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of contempt of parliament.</p><p>Joining me now, Morgan Wright, Former Senior Advisor in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, Former Law Enforcement Advisor to the Republican National Committee, Cyber Security Expert, Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, EXPERT, CYBERSECURITY:  Hey, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me start with, first, the gangsters that Facebook and Google.  Who knew that they were going to be declared gangsters first by the U.K., rather than the United States?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, I don't see Al Pacino playing Mark Zuckerberg in a movie, you know, about gangsters, but yes, you know.  And Lou, we've talked about this before about why is the -- why is the E.U. ahead of us with things like the General Data Protection Regulations, privacy?</p><p>And I'll tell you, the only thing I can think of as it comes down to money, because there's a -- Facebook has figured out the Google playbook, which is, spend a lot of money, spend a lot of time here in D.C., on K Street, M Street, whatever all the streets are, and you know, get in there and lobby people, spread lots of money around.</p><p>And Lou, during the hearings, how many members of Congress did we see ponder to Mark Zuckerberg, hoping to relocate shit jobs in their district.  I mean, this is one reason why you don't have it because everybody's hoping to get something from Zuckerberg.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and -- but it reinforces the impression.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  That a half dozen of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have such concentrated economic and technological and political power, that they are almost now so large that it is impossible to rein them in.  Is that fear well-placed?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  And I'll tell you, Lou, you and I talked about this awhile back too, when we talked about how globalism is killing patriotism.  And all of these companies have taken the advantage of the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) well guess what?</p><p>It's coming home to roost now, because now that these companies want to be global.  Your subject to the E.U. regulations, the U.K. regulations, you know, Germany's regulations, all of these other places that actually place a premium on privacy, for too long self-regulation, they've tried it, it hasn't worked.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is the self-regulation go away.  And you're going to see more government interventions starting overseas, and hopefully, it'll end up over here, not to put them out of business, but, man, we've got to put a check on the seemingly unchecked power that they have right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  There is no countervailing influence in our economy, or our society, or our body politic to the awesome power of big tech.  That's simply a fact, and to that, the power of Wall Street and Corporate America.</p><p>And right now, the middle class in this country, if they were not the champion, the President of the United States would be defenseless against an onslaught that had rolled back the middle class for 20 years, and which under this president, is once again, growing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.  And look, you know, something interesting that came out of the U.K. report too, is they talked about -- even though Zuckerberg, in front of Congress, and sent his minions over there to say we don' sell any data, it's clear they've been selling data.  It's true that they've been using apps to spy on the activities of users and their competitors.</p><p>Look, this is the modern version.</p><p>DOBBS:  And even those who are not users.</p><p>WRIGHT:  --have that power, right, absolutely.  And the KGB only wished they would've had this power back in the day.  You know, our NSA and FBI don't have near the power that Facebook, Google, Amazon.  You know, these folks have to spy into the lives of us, but there are no consequences for it.  At some point, there has to be stick because the carrot hasn't worked.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  This is a president who is keenly aware --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- that U.S. policies haven't worked.  He is also confronted now by ZTE, as a favor to President Xi.  He backed off of the consequences for ZTE, Huawei, now paying the consequences for its role in spying, but doing so, only within our court system, not as a result of a national security response from the part of the United States.</p><p>How much longer can we go without saying straightforwardly to the Chinese, there will be a response on national security terms if you continue to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from this country each year and carry out acts of espionage nonstop.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, I think Gordon Chang's been on with before he talked about poor Chinese economically, I think they need to put -- they need to put the hammer down on Huawei.  It's time to put Huawei and ZTE out of business.</p><p>And I'll tell you why, Lou, the upcoming 5G, Huawei is doing everything they can to get their technology into these countries, but you've Australia, New Zealand, Japan.  The U.K. said it's going to take, you know -- they probably going to have to spend five years and $2-$3 billion to meet the U.K. standards.</p><p>The best way to stop this economic espionage is to quit lulling the government of China to subsidize the rail system, the electronic system, the communication systems to where it's all Chinese infrastructure.  And there's no U.S. infrastructure in play.  We can't -- it's not a fair fight.</p><p>So, I think they've got to put the hammer down on these guys.  One of the ways to stop espionage is to keep their equipment out of our infrastructure.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the -- and the administration to its credit is trying to do exactly that.  Huawei, at the same time, is bragging they are now too big to stop.  And this is -- this again, is advised rhetoric from the PLA and from President Xi, himself.</p><p>The Communist Party is now flaunting their economic and political and military power.  The United States is -- has to simply respond, and hopefully, before it becomes a military response.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  But it looks as though we are absolutely vulnerable in cyberspace right now.  Is that a correct impression?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, absolutely.  Lou, we have -- from our power grid, to our nuclear plants, to you know -- the rail system transportation.  A lot of things are still so vulnerable because we're so fragmented.  We don't have --</p><p>Even though we might have an overall plan, we don't have an overall coherent ability to secure all the things we need to do, why, because the private sector owns 85 percent of the critical infrastructure that's out there.</p><p>The government can provide a lot of support, a lot of help, but were the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese?  And even the North Koreans are exploiting.  They're exploiting all of these gaps between the different infrastructures.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>WRIGHT:  The lack of coherence among the security plans.  And the old technology that's out there.  We've got out-of-date machines that are still running windows that haven't been supported for five or six years.</p><p>DOBBS:  What Morgan is not saying, that 85 percent that is in the private sector, is often run by CEOs and boards that are frankly, friendlier to Chinese policies than they are to the policies of the Trump administration and the U.S. government.  And that's got to change, straightaway.  I didn't put words in your mouth, did I, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Lou, you're always right.  That's one lesson I've learned.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, thanks so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you, Morgan Wright.</p><p>Up next, New York Governor Bill -- New York Mayor, Bill de Blasio says AOC doesn't know what she is talking about.  We take that up after the break with American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio putting freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her place after Amazon decided not to build its headquarters in Long Island City.  Cortez claimed the failed deal would free up $4 billion in taxes incentives for the city to use elsewhere.  The good mayor reminded her even a socialist understood this, at least one of the socialists did, reminding her the money would only be available after the city secured the Amazon jobs and revenue and that it wasn't in a budget somewhere.</p><p>Radical freshman congresswoman, there's a lot of those going around.  Ilhan Omar scheduled to raise money in March for the Hamas link council on American-Islamic relations.  Omar received $5,000 from them during a run for Congress.  She since repeatedly made headlines for her anti-Semitic remarks most recently suggesting Republican support of Israel is bought and paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC.  At some point anti-Semitic remarks result in being anti -- an anti-Semite it seems.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Matt Schlapp.  He's the chairman of the American Conservative Union.  Why is it that the Left is suddenly so reluctant to say what is obvious that they have an anti-Semitic strain within their party and on Capitol Hill and aren't dealing with it?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, I completely agree with you, Lou, but I asked -- I actually think it's more cynical than this.  I think the Democratic Party has really shed its longtime support of the State of Israel.  I think they're moving away from this policy point of view and I think it gives Donald Trump who has done everything he said he would do with getting rid of the Iran deal, moving the embassy a great chance with these voters not with the not with the Liberal leaders potentially of this community but with everyday voters who can see anti-Semitism when it's so clear.</p><p>DOBBS:  Anti-Semitism, we saw reports today that the yellow vest in France you know, blaming them for a strain of anti-Semitism within France leaving out the entire ruling body and class in France that -- I mean there's anti-Semitism has been a huge issue in France.  It is not only anti-Israel, it is pro-Palestinian, and the expression is found throughout the political structure of France.  This looks like another gambit to lay off blame for what is a strengthening strain of anti-Semitism in France and indeed Europe.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.  And look, I think what's happening -- what's ironic, Lou, is what's happening in Israel is this once socialist country has really been embracing free markets and innovation and really has become a kindred soul in one of our closest allies to obviously to America and to our way of life into our values.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people that just hate everything about the idea of innovation of entrepreneurs or free markets of the little guy being able to go to market and take his ideas to the customers.  And they are against every aspect of that and I love the fact that Israel in America and freedom-loving people including the people of South America, including the freedom lovers in Venezuela.  We're working together to rid the world of this dreaded socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dreaded socialism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism and that really what I was asking you about.  Socialism is as the President assured is this country will never be socialistic.  What is in question tonight is whether or not one guy you know, is going to be the successor to Maduro.  Will he or will he not and what is your sense from where you look?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a great question, Lou.  And I worry I think it's a little bit of a jump ball right now.  I think the President, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo we're trying to do everything they can to use power in influence to stand up for the Venezuelan people in this new president Mr. Guaido.  And Maduro is a -- is a tin-pot dictator.  And you know they have a lot of power at the end of their reigns.  And we'll see if he's able to use that power.  But I'm hopeful that the right side will win out in Venezuela.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's a lot of hope running around this country right now primarily because President Trump is indeed the leader of the free world.  My question to you is why is the establishment in Washington D.C. not screaming for the arrest of Andrew McCabe and for all of his cohorts and the DOJ and the FBI?  Why is it that there seems to be almost a satisfaction in the status quo no matter how rancid and corrupt in the swamp that is D.C.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Look, I'm disgusted by it and I guess there's only one person who can do something about it and that's Bill Barr.  Is he either going to do this or he's not, and I'd be greatly disappointed if he doesn't.  And I think --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why the hell isn't the Republican Party's standing up and demanding his arrest?  Why --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You know why.</p><p>DOBBS:  I do not know why.  I would not be asking you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I think the reason is because they don't want the controversy of actually taking the deep state on because they might be coming its next victim.</p><p>DOBBS:  Then their doubtless wonders and why in the world should we tolerate these Koch brothers hired excuses for legislators and representatives.  They represent nothing but Koch brothers, the Wall Street, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber, they are -- it's enough to make you sick.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Lou, if that's where the Republican Party stays, it will deserve to lose beyond the ash heap of history.  We either going to represent the people or we're not and if we don't, we deserve to lose and we ought to get out of the way.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's very simple.  They either follow President Trump or they are going to be on the scrap heap of history.  The problem is they could take the Republican with them.  Matt, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Good to see you too.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the dark political agenda of the deep state, their efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald Trump -- that's right -- to overthrow the U.S. government.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Andrew McCabe, fired as acting director of the FBI last night on 60 Minutes confessed he was involved in an effort to remove well, President Trump from office and to overthrow the government of the United States.  Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton says McCabe, the Department of Justice and the FBI were trying to overthrow the government and this republic.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT JUDICIAL WATCH:  If there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt the media would be calling it a coup.  But because you've got an elected bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this, and if the target is President Trump, they don't care.  And Americans should realize this is how you can lose a republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Tomorrow night, Congressman Mark Green, David Bossie, and Attorney Harmeet Dhillon among our guests tomorrow.  We hope you'll join us.  Thanks for being with us tonight.  Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs.  And again, thanks for being with us.  Good night.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2183280215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2T-RYV1-DY0W-42BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

This aversion is President Trump and his administration on full display this weekend as former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe actually confessed that he, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and a host of corrupt FBI and Department of Justice actors sought to unseat a sitting president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR:  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.  What I can say is the Deputy Attorney General was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confession.  Where is the outrage about their treason?  Where is the Republican Party and its leaders demanding they arrest McCabe and the rest of his cohorts who conspired to overthrow the President of the United States?  McCabe's admission of the coup attempted by the corrupt deep state went without as much a follow-up question by CBS.  Where is the national media?  Left-wing, though it may be, it in demanding answers, accountability, and transparency for this aversion and outright sedition?</p><p>Judicial watch President, Tom Fitton, Radio Show Host, Tammy Bruce among our guest here tonight to discuss those questions and their answers.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, over the weekend calling the United States embarrassing.  As globalist foreign leaders and the radical Dems applaud their approval of his careless and outrageous remarks on foreign soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents or turning their back on refugees on our border.  Americans know that's not right.  The American people understand, please, because it makes us embarrassing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Biden is the embarrassment.  What should be embarrassing to Biden is that he can't even garner the support of his former president, President Barack Obama.  Obama saying he will not endorse a Democrat for president even if Biden decides to run.  We take up Biden's embarrassing trip overseas.  Republican Strategist, Ed Rollins, Matt Schlapp joins us.  And President Trump today in Miami issuing his strong support for Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.</p><p>The President's message clear and definitive.  The United States will never be a socialist nation, we take up the President's address and much more here tonight.  Our top story, former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe confessed there was in fact a deep state conspiracy among his cohorts in the Justice Department and FBI to remove President Trump from office.  Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCCABE:  Counting votes, or possible vote.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The former acting FBI director told \"60 MINUTES\" the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein openly discussed how many cabinet members would support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President.  But the FBI's former general counsel, James Baker who met contemporaneously with McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page about their conversations with Rosenstein testified the effort went further.</p><p>\"I had the impression the Deputy Attorney General had already discussed this with two members in the President's cabinet.  And that they were on board with this concept already.\"    On Twitter the President responded to McCabe on \"60 MINUTES,\" \"While, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.  He and Rod Rosenstein look like they were planning a very illegal act.\"</p><p>McCabe and others say the President's May 2017 firing of Director James Comey left the FBI and Justice Department in turmoil.  And they concerned that the firing was designed to be synced the Russian probe and obstruct justice.</p><p>MCCABE:  The Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire into the White House.  He said, I never get search when I going to the White House.  I think the General Counsel had a heart attack.  When he got up off the floor he said, I -- that's a bridge too far.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  But Baker who could face criminal penalties for lying to Congressional investigators testified \"My recollection is that there were discussions about it over longer period than the course of one meeting, a couple of days.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  McCabe said Rosenstein initially resisted a Special Counsel because the Deputy Attorney General worried he might lose his job.  A senior department official told Fox tonight the Special Counsel was appointed \"to ensure that the Russia investigation was truly independent and without bias.\"  Something the official said that McCabe could not have accomplished.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Catherine, thanks very much.  Catherine Herridge.  Well, joining us tonight, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch.  One of the country's most effective watchdog groups.  And he's worked with the International Policy Forum, the Leadership Institute, Accuracy in Media, among others.  Tom, good to have you with us.  What we just heard from the folks at \"60 MINUTES\" over at CBS, although they didn't ask a follow-up question, it was an outright confession by McCabe that he was committing felonies and an attempt to overthrow the President of the United States along with a number of his colleagues.  Your reaction when you heard it?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Well, it's extraordinary.  It confirms early reports last year that this discussion took place.  You know, Lou, if there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt we'll be -- we'll be calling it a coup.  But because you got -- I don't like the bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this and it's -- the target is President Trump, they don't care.</p><p>And America should realize this is how you can lose a Republic where you have appointees of the President and bureaucrats to answer to virtually no one talk about manipulating the law in order to overturn a presidential election and attack a president they don't like.  They don't like for any substantial reason.  They don't like him because they fired -- he fired his buddy, McCabe's buddy and Rosenstein's buddy, James Comey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  At the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein, by the way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON:  Right.  A fight about a personnel decision.  And they're going to overthrow the presidency.  And, you know, let's be clear here, Mueller is a successor to this coup attempt.  He's -- the appointment flows out of all of these discussions and we should recognize that the effort to overthrow the President is continuing with Justice Department help through this out-of-control Mueller investigation.</p><p>DOBBS:  And without so much as -- and effort, explanation, rationalization, this is -- we're watching McCabe basically saying he was doing it for the country's own good.  Here's a man sworn to enforce the law, to enforce the constitution of the United States, to defend the United States committing subversions, in my opinion, sedition and treason.  And those who want to say that we're not at war should reference the war on terror that we've been engaged in for 19 -- almost 19 years.</p><p>This is outrageous and we haven't heard a word from the leadership of the Republican Party about arresting these people.  We haven't heard a word from the so-called establishment that is supposed to hold the tenants values of this -- of this great nation and primacy.  They are just simply averting their eyes.  It's appalling, it's disgusting, there should be outrage throughout the country in both parties across every part of this nation.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I agree.  And the problem with the Justice Department is that Mueller is still running the Justice Department effectively.  And so any effort to uncover what went on behind this investigation and this is what went on behind this investigation, runs into the Mueller juggernaut.  And, you know, Attorney General Barr, he needs to step up and defend the President.  You know, the argument for -- against Barr was will he stand up to President Trump?</p><p>And I think the test for Attorney General Barr is, will he stand up for President Trump and for the rule of law against these deep stators and the establishment who don't care about our constitution.  You know, President Trump may survive this attack on him but maybe another President want.  And we'll lose our Republic and we won't even know it came.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I guarantee he will survive these attacks.  He's already demonstrated that he is stronger than the entire lot of these extraordinary venal, vicious actors in the Justice Department.  What may not survive is his Justice Department and the FBI.  And Tom Fitton, should they survive?  Because they are the root of the corruption and the malignancy of the others wanted to subscribe to this administration.</p><p>When, in point of fact, they have been the perpetrators of wrongdoing from the months preceding the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p>FITTON:  Well, my -- you know, I'm a small government conservative.  I think all government agencies should be subject to scrutiny every year before any money is given to them.  And given the corruption at the DOJ, I think we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The problem with that is, the appropriators as well as the investigators are also deep state actors and have been working just as viciously, frankly, behind the scenes as the people in the Justice Department and the FBI.  My god.</p><p>FITTON:  You know, the problem with the FBI is the current leadership frankly, Mr. Ray has zero interest in reforming the organization.</p><p>DOBBS:  Where is he?</p><p>FITTON:  That's why --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, we don't even hear from him.</p><p>FITTON:  He is missing in action when it comes to standing and uncovering -- I -- uncovering the corruption and to a degree he said anything, Lou, he's been excusing the corruption.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Exactly.  Tom, it's always good to have you here.  I wish we're talking in better circumstances.  But, as you intimated at the outset, the Republic itself is at stake here.</p><p>FITTON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the silence is absolutely chilling.  Thank you so much, Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON:  Welcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  And again, as always, and I mean it even when I don't say, thanks for everything that you and Judicial Watch do.  Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome.  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, one of the most embarrassing figures in modern American political history.  Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken his anti- American message overseas embarrassing the United States in front of our allies and many of his former colleagues in the Obama administration.  It's a shadow government.  We'll take that up and more right after this quick break.  Ed Rollins joins me.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A New York Times report today saying former President Obama is counseling the Dems' 2020 hopefuls but he will not be giving the New York Times assures us, anyone, anyone, not even Joe Biden, his endorsement.  His former Vice President taking a page out of his old Obama playbook.  Apologizing for America overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents.  It makes us an embarrassing in the example we're setting.  Well, I should stop.  As my mother would say, this too shall pass.  We will be back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  I wouldn't bet on it.  In any way, shape, or fashion, at least not led by one Joe Biden.  He's just blown his chances for 2020 in all likelihood.  Biden, it seems forgot one important lesson from his former boss.  President Obama at least waited until he had been elected and was in office before slamming America overseas.  Well, joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst Ed Rollins.  Ed, great to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  What a day.  Let's start with Biden, he just blew it, didn't he?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he certainly did something outrageous than anybody I've ever known.  A former Vice President to go before this important meeting and condemn the America is just outrageous.  You often do that if you're a presidential candidate in Iowa, or (INAUDIBLE) New Hampshire or somewhere.  But to go before our allies and to basically take apart the administration's position is just outrageous.</p><p>DOBBS:  When President Obama did that, his famous apology tour in Berlin in Cairo, he had been elected.</p><p>ROLLINS:  He'd been elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, there was a chance to make things right in 2012.  Romney didn't make that happen.  I think Biden can just kiss it goodbye, personally.  I would like to turn to this extraordinary piece on \"60 MINUTES\" in which Andrew McCabe actually confessed to trying to overthrow the President of the United States, Ed.  And where's the outrage from the Republican leadership?  I mean, I think the whole country should be just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  I have to tell you, from when I sat and watched it last night I was outraged because there's a conspiracy going on.  First of all, the 25th Amendment is for a president to step aside if he has health issues or something else.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Or a Vice President to step in if the President is incapacitated.  It is not about removing a president from office.  And I think to a certain extent, you think the Justice Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  These guys were not only obviously corrupt, they were stupid beyond imagining for people who were supposedly trained in law and respectful of it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the fact that before this, any evidence that basically still plotting and scheming to take out a President of the United States and talking to members of the cabinet according to him with the full support of the acting attorney general, I just found it appalling.  It's so un-American, it's like --</p><p>DOBBS:  So, where is the Republican Party?  Why aren't the leaders of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, every republican governor, every Republican governor, every Republican in this country standing up and saying end the witch-hunt, end all of this non-sense, it's obviously a cabal that has been working and the conspiracy to overthrow the President of the United States or tacitly they are endorsing it with their silence.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, their silence is terrible.  The reality is we are in a fight of our life.  President Trump basically doing everything he promised to do, moving the ball forward.  But the Democrats are really revved up and they're going to do everything they can to stop him.  From lawsuits to what have you.  And they're not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in the land that will join this president on the basis of his declaration of a national emergency.  I -- we know then that the corruption has absolutely grasped our judiciary system as well.  We got every indication that that's happened.  But for them to enjoin a president in a matter of national security would be an act against the Republic, the constitution itself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you and I have been around long enough to know that's going to happen.  And at the end of the day it's going to end up being in the Supreme Court.  And the Supreme Court has to rule in the President's favor at the end of the day here.  But it's going to go through the process.  There's -- all of these political attorney generals and what have you who want to make (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS:  But honorable, honest and judges who are not overwhelmed by their partisan prejudice would understand that that it could be absolutely litigated in our judiciary.  Without enjoining until a decision by the high court.  That would be the honorable thing to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the absolute honoring thing to do.  And I would -- I would hope the Supreme Court is stepping very quickly if they started out this process.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  I worry about this court and what more -- the more that we learned about Chief Justice John Roberts, I'm not saying when about, what will or will not occur in that high court.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I'm hopeful in the end he will do the right thing.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Well, we can all hope.  But I'd rather have certainty.</p><p>ROLLINS:  In the end.  In the end.  There is no certainty -- there's no certainty in life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there isn't.  But in this constitution there should be absolute certainty.  Ed Rollins, thanks much.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  We appreciate it.  We'd like to hear your thoughts on all this.  Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Coming up here next, Chicago Police, they want answers from actor, Jussie Smollett after their investigation into an alleged hate crime reverses.  That and much more coming up next.  We'll be talking with Washington Times' Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Before we go to break, let's take a look at the U.S. national debt as if we don't have enough problems already.  $22 trillion and climbing.  We're coming right back after this.  Stay brave of heart, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump in Miami today for claiming the days of socialism in the western hemisphere are numbered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If you choose this path, you have the opportunity to help forge a safe and prosperous future for all of the people of Venezuela.  Or you can choose the second path, continuing to support Maduro.  If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out.  You will lose everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump also using his speech to continue to express his supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.  A reported hate crime in Chicago looking more and more like a hate hoax.  Chicago Police say they no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim.  And they are pushing for a follow-up interview which his attorney -- Smollett's attorneys have resisted.  The police request -- imagine that, a request comes amid new reports that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault.</p><p>Both men have been questioned and released without charges.  Reverend Al Sharpton, we want to point out, responding to the news.  And Sharpton saying Smollett should face as he put it, \"accountability to the maximum\" if it's found the actor stage the attack.  Joining us tonight, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times Columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Tammy, good to see you.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, everybody.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Smollett and the hoax.  I have to give Reverend Al Sharpton great credit for standing up which by the way all of the candidates who have been commenting on this, the Democratic candidates have not had the courage to do.  Your thoughts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  The candidates seem to be wanting to pretend this never happened.  They get away without law because then the media also steps away from it and stops discussing it.  But Reverend Al Sharpton of course is very well known for promoting one of the original hoaxes, if you will with a young woman named Tawana Brawley who made some accusations against police officers which ended up being false.</p><p>So it's fascinating that he would actually take that position.  So good for him if he has found, you know, the right direction.  And maybe -- I don't know, maybe he's thinking that Mr. Smollett deserves a program on MSNBC like he has.  Who knows what that end result should be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you brought that to us with a sense of appropriate justice.</p><p>BRUCE:  Absolutely.  Hanging every day, every day.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's turn to Venezuela, the President today importantly going to Miami as the setting to announce his views and judgment and policies on the hemisphere and Venezuela in particular.  Your thoughts?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Perfect of course.  We know for South Florida it has a lot of people who are immigrants who have experienced in our lifetimes very recently, the impact of totalitarianism and tyrants.  So when he --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Venezuelans by the way.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, Venezuelans and Cubans.  So when he's speaking it happens to be the right thing, of course it is the thing that the President believes in.  But it also speaks to the Venezuelans that are already in South Florida that are coming to South Florida but speaking to that core of people in this region that understand the importance of freedom, this nation, capitalism and the value of the support of the American Presidents.</p><p>And so it's going to make I think a big different for people there and sends a very strong message back home about what his intentions are.</p><p>DOBBS:  I think he had a couple of other audiences as well in mind as he spoke.  And one of this of course the American people when he said this country will never be socialist.  That was a loud straightforward challenge to everyone of the -- what seemed to be every one of the Democratic hopefuls so far.  At least announced, this is not going to be an easy campaign for you because you've already gone to the left and lined up against this country and our traditions.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  It's the first education they may be receiving about real life.  These are -- especially young people, Miss Ocasio-Cortez obviously seems to not have any major education about the impact of socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Or minor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Or a minor education on the nape on how it destroys lives, on how it destroys countries and economies.  So, this is going to be her first indication about courtesy of the President, about real life and what socialism does to people.</p><p>DOBBS:  This could be an expensive tutorial for AOC if it moves into, as it appears, it is about to, into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  This is -- it could be.  And she won't understand this, I think, until 2020.  The benefit of this education for the American people about what the Democratic Party is becoming, and how everybody is running on this kind of an issue.</p><p>The President stands as the bulwark against this framework and as a reminder about what -- how greatness really can be brought into our lives.  And it's not through certainly that totalitarianism by any stretch.</p><p>DOBBS:  And most to me, it's very encouraging to see the presidential tracking poll with the president's popularity.  I had approval rising at 52 percent.  I confess that I personally think it should be significantly higher, and I hope it soon will be.</p><p>BRUCE:  It probably is, as a matter of fact.  When you think about the --</p><p>DOBBS:  I'd like to see it expressed in black-and-white.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Like you, I have faith in the forgotten man and woman in this country.  But this president, I think now, has turned a very important corner.  I think the national left-wing media understands it.  It is beginning to understand it.  That's why they are not quite as free with their nonsense as they have been.</p><p>In other words, Jim Acosta is receding quite a bit, as his colleagues, I think, on the left, in that White House briefing room, for example, it's one of the barometers of this all.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's good news.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy, good to have you here.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Up next, British lawmakers say Facebook is acting like gangsters with our personal information.  We take that up.  Now, the Europeans are doing something about it.  Why in the world isn't the United States?  Isn't privacy an even bigger right for Americans?  We take that up with cyber expert, Morgan Wright.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.  Oh, Google, Facebook, gangsters.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Headlines tonight, Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, claims he has \"a lot of discretion on border wall funding from President Trump's national emergency declaration,\" despite receiving a direct order from the President of the United States to secure the border.</p><p>Shanahan says \"I'm not required to do anything.\"  Well, he'd be required to do something, one would think, like pack his bags and get out of there.  A North Carolina elections board, beginning deliberations over election fraud allegations, Republican Mark Harris leading in last month's ninth congressional district election.</p><p>The board consists of three Democrats, two Republicans, they will decide whether to certify a winner or order a new election, Harris, by the way, leading Democrat Dan McCready, by 905 votes, but again, the vote that may count as the 3-2 vote on the elections board.</p><p>A new report from the U.K. parliament, calling Facebook, digital gangsters, for failing to thwart attempts by Russia to influence elections, the report accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of contempt of parliament.</p><p>Joining me now, Morgan Wright, Former Senior Advisor in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, Former Law Enforcement Advisor to the Republican National Committee, Cyber Security Expert, Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, EXPERT, CYBERSECURITY:  Hey, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me start with, first, the gangsters that Facebook and Google.  Who knew that they were going to be declared gangsters first by the U.K., rather than the United States?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, I don't see Al Pacino playing Mark Zuckerberg in a movie, you know, about gangsters, but yes, you know.  And Lou, we've talked about this before about why is the -- why is the E.U. ahead of us with things like the General Data Protection Regulations, privacy?</p><p>And I'll tell you, the only thing I can think of as it comes down to money, because there's a -- Facebook has figured out the Google playbook, which is, spend a lot of money, spend a lot of time here in D.C., on K Street, M Street, whatever all the streets are, and you know, get in there and lobby people, spread lots of money around.</p><p>And Lou, during the hearings, how many members of Congress did we see ponder to Mark Zuckerberg, hoping to relocate shit jobs in their district.  I mean, this is one reason why you don't have it because everybody's hoping to get something from Zuckerberg.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and -- but it reinforces the impression.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  That a half dozen of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have such concentrated economic and technological and political power, that they are almost now so large that it is impossible to rein them in.  Is that fear well-placed?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  And I'll tell you, Lou, you and I talked about this awhile back too, when we talked about how globalism is killing patriotism.  And all of these companies have taken the advantage of the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) well guess what?</p><p>It's coming home to roost now, because now that these companies want to be global.  Your subject to the E.U. regulations, the U.K. regulations, you know, Germany's regulations, all of these other places that actually place a premium on privacy, for too long self-regulation, they've tried it, it hasn't worked.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is the self-regulation go away.  And you're going to see more government interventions starting overseas, and hopefully, it'll end up over here, not to put them out of business, but, man, we've got to put a check on the seemingly unchecked power that they have right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  There is no countervailing influence in our economy, or our society, or our body politic to the awesome power of big tech.  That's simply a fact, and to that, the power of Wall Street and Corporate America.</p><p>And right now, the middle class in this country, if they were not the champion, the President of the United States would be defenseless against an onslaught that had rolled back the middle class for 20 years, and which under this president, is once again, growing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.  And look, you know, something interesting that came out of the U.K. report too, is they talked about -- even though Zuckerberg, in front of Congress, and sent his minions over there to say we don' sell any data, it's clear they've been selling data.  It's true that they've been using apps to spy on the activities of users and their competitors.</p><p>Look, this is the modern version.</p><p>DOBBS:  And even those who are not users.</p><p>WRIGHT:  --have that power, right, absolutely.  And the KGB only wished they would've had this power back in the day.  You know, our NSA and FBI don't have near the power that Facebook, Google, Amazon.  You know, these folks have to spy into the lives of us, but there are no consequences for it.  At some point, there has to be stick because the carrot hasn't worked.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  This is a president who is keenly aware --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- that U.S. policies haven't worked.  He is also confronted now by ZTE, as a favor to President Xi.  He backed off of the consequences for ZTE, Huawei, now paying the consequences for its role in spying, but doing so, only within our court system, not as a result of a national security response from the part of the United States.</p><p>How much longer can we go without saying straightforwardly to the Chinese, there will be a response on national security terms if you continue to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from this country each year and carry out acts of espionage nonstop.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, I think Gordon Chang's been on with before he talked about poor Chinese economically, I think they need to put -- they need to put the hammer down on Huawei.  It's time to put Huawei and ZTE out of business.</p><p>And I'll tell you why, Lou, the upcoming 5G, Huawei is doing everything they can to get their technology into these countries, but you've Australia, New Zealand, Japan.  The U.K. said it's going to take, you know -- they probably going to have to spend five years and $2-$3 billion to meet the U.K. standards.</p><p>The best way to stop this economic espionage is to quit lulling the government of China to subsidize the rail system, the electronic system, the communication systems to where it's all Chinese infrastructure.  And there's no U.S. infrastructure in play.  We can't -- it's not a fair fight.</p><p>So, I think they've got to put the hammer down on these guys.  One of the ways to stop espionage is to keep their equipment out of our infrastructure.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the -- and the administration to its credit is trying to do exactly that.  Huawei, at the same time, is bragging they are now too big to stop.  And this is -- this again, is advised rhetoric from the PLA and from President Xi, himself.</p><p>The Communist Party is now flaunting their economic and political and military power.  The United States is -- has to simply respond, and hopefully, before it becomes a military response.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  But it looks as though we are absolutely vulnerable in cyberspace right now.  Is that a correct impression?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, absolutely.  Lou, we have -- from our power grid, to our nuclear plants, to you know -- the rail system transportation.  A lot of things are still so vulnerable because we're so fragmented.  We don't have --</p><p>Even though we might have an overall plan, we don't have an overall coherent ability to secure all the things we need to do, why, because the private sector owns 85 percent of the critical infrastructure that's out there.</p><p>The government can provide a lot of support, a lot of help, but were the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese?  And even the North Koreans are exploiting.  They're exploiting all of these gaps between the different infrastructures.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>WRIGHT:  The lack of coherence among the security plans.  And the old technology that's out there.  We've got out-of-date machines that are still running windows that haven't been supported for five or six years.</p><p>DOBBS:  What Morgan is not saying, that 85 percent that is in the private sector, is often run by CEOs and boards that are frankly, friendlier to Chinese policies than they are to the policies of the Trump administration and the U.S. government.  And that's got to change, straightaway.  I didn't put words in your mouth, did I, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Lou, you're always right.  That's one lesson I've learned.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, thanks so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you, Morgan Wright.</p><p>Up next, New York Governor Bill -- New York Mayor, Bill de Blasio says AOC doesn't know what she is talking about.  We take that up after the break with American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio putting freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her place after Amazon decided not to build its headquarters in Long Island City.  Cortez claimed the failed deal would free up $4 billion in taxes incentives for the city to use elsewhere.  The good mayor reminded her even a socialist understood this, at least one of the socialists did, reminding her the money would only be available after the city secured the Amazon jobs and revenue and that it wasn't in a budget somewhere.</p><p>Radical freshman congresswoman, there's a lot of those going around.  Ilhan Omar scheduled to raise money in March for the Hamas link council on American-Islamic relations.  Omar received $5,000 from them during a run for Congress.  She since repeatedly made headlines for her anti-Semitic remarks most recently suggesting Republican support of Israel is bought and paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC.  At some point anti-Semitic remarks result in being anti -- an anti-Semite it seems.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Matt Schlapp.  He's the chairman of the American Conservative Union.  Why is it that the Left is suddenly so reluctant to say what is obvious that they have an anti-Semitic strain within their party and on Capitol Hill and aren't dealing with it?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, I completely agree with you, Lou, but I asked -- I actually think it's more cynical than this.  I think the Democratic Party has really shed its longtime support of the State of Israel.  I think they're moving away from this policy point of view and I think it gives Donald Trump who has done everything he said he would do with getting rid of the Iran deal, moving the embassy a great chance with these voters not with the not with the Liberal leaders potentially of this community but with everyday voters who can see anti-Semitism when it's so clear.</p><p>DOBBS:  Anti-Semitism, we saw reports today that the yellow vest in France you know, blaming them for a strain of anti-Semitism within France leaving out the entire ruling body and class in France that -- I mean there's anti-Semitism has been a huge issue in France.  It is not only anti-Israel, it is pro-Palestinian, and the expression is found throughout the political structure of France.  This looks like another gambit to lay off blame for what is a strengthening strain of anti-Semitism in France and indeed Europe.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.  And look, I think what's happening -- what's ironic, Lou, is what's happening in Israel is this once socialist country has really been embracing free markets and innovation and really has become a kindred soul in one of our closest allies to obviously to America and to our way of life into our values.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people that just hate everything about the idea of innovation of entrepreneurs or free markets of the little guy being able to go to market and take his ideas to the customers.  And they are against every aspect of that and I love the fact that Israel in America and freedom-loving people including the people of South America, including the freedom lovers in Venezuela.  We're working together to rid the world of this dreaded socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dreaded socialism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism and that really what I was asking you about.  Socialism is as the President assured is this country will never be socialistic.  What is in question tonight is whether or not one guy you know, is going to be the successor to Maduro.  Will he or will he not and what is your sense from where you look?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a great question, Lou.  And I worry I think it's a little bit of a jump ball right now.  I think the President, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo we're trying to do everything they can to use power in influence to stand up for the Venezuelan people in this new president Mr. Guaido.  And Maduro is a -- is a tin-pot dictator.  And you know they have a lot of power at the end of their reigns.  And we'll see if he's able to use that power.  But I'm hopeful that the right side will win out in Venezuela.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's a lot of hope running around this country right now primarily because President Trump is indeed the leader of the free world.  My question to you is why is the establishment in Washington D.C. not screaming for the arrest of Andrew McCabe and for all of his cohorts and the DOJ and the FBI?  Why is it that there seems to be almost a satisfaction in the status quo no matter how rancid and corrupt in the swamp that is D.C.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Look, I'm disgusted by it and I guess there's only one person who can do something about it and that's Bill Barr.  Is he either going to do this or he's not, and I'd be greatly disappointed if he doesn't.  And I think --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why the hell isn't the Republican Party's standing up and demanding his arrest?  Why --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You know why.</p><p>DOBBS:  I do not know why.  I would not be asking you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I think the reason is because they don't want the controversy of actually taking the deep state on because they might be coming its next victim.</p><p>DOBBS:  Then their doubtless wonders and why in the world should we tolerate these Koch brothers hired excuses for legislators and representatives.  They represent nothing but Koch brothers, the Wall Street, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber, they are -- it's enough to make you sick.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Lou, if that's where the Republican Party stays, it will deserve to lose beyond the ash heap of history.  We either going to represent the people or we're not and if we don't, we deserve to lose and we ought to get out of the way.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's very simple.  They either follow President Trump or they are going to be on the scrap heap of history.  The problem is they could take the Republican with them.  Matt, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Good to see you too.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the dark political agenda of the deep state, their efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald Trump -- that's right -- to overthrow the U.S. government.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Andrew McCabe, fired as acting director of the FBI last night on 60 Minutes confessed he was involved in an effort to remove well, President Trump from office and to overthrow the government of the United States.  Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton says McCabe, the Department of Justice and the FBI were trying to overthrow the government and this republic.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT JUDICIAL WATCH:  If there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt the media would be calling it a coup.  But because you've got an elected bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this, and if the target is President Trump, they don't care.  And Americans should realize this is how you can lose a republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Tomorrow night, Congressman Mark Green, David Bossie, and Attorney Harmeet Dhillon among our guests tomorrow.  We hope you'll join us.  Thanks for being with us tonight.  Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs.  And again, thanks for being with us.

This aversion is President Trump and his administration on full display this weekend as former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe actually confessed that he, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and a host of corrupt FBI and Department of Justice actors sought to unseat a sitting president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR:  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.  What I can say is the Deputy Attorney General was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confession.  Where is the outrage about their treason?  Where is the Republican Party and its leaders demanding they arrest McCabe and the rest of his cohorts who conspired to overthrow the President of the United States?  McCabe's admission of the coup attempted by the corrupt deep state went without as much a follow-up question by CBS.  Where is the national media?  Left-wing, though it may be, it in demanding answers, accountability, and transparency for this aversion and outright sedition?</p><p>Judicial watch President, Tom Fitton, Radio Show Host, Tammy Bruce among our guest here tonight to discuss those questions and their answers.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, over the weekend calling the United States embarrassing.  As globalist foreign leaders and the radical Dems applaud their approval of his careless and outrageous remarks on foreign soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents or turning their back on refugees on our border.  Americans know that's not right.  The American people understand, please, because it makes us embarrassing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Biden is the embarrassment.  What should be embarrassing to Biden is that he can't even garner the support of his former president, President Barack Obama.  Obama saying he will not endorse a Democrat for president even if Biden decides to run.  We take up Biden's embarrassing trip overseas.  Republican Strategist, Ed Rollins, Matt Schlapp joins us.  And President Trump today in Miami issuing his strong support for Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.</p><p>The President's message clear and definitive.  The United States will never be a socialist nation, we take up the President's address and much more here tonight.  Our top story, former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe confessed there was in fact a deep state conspiracy among his cohorts in the Justice Department and FBI to remove President Trump from office.  Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCCABE:  Counting votes, or possible vote.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The former acting FBI director told \"60 MINUTES\" the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein openly discussed how many cabinet members would support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President.  But the FBI's former general counsel, James Baker who met contemporaneously with McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page about their conversations with Rosenstein testified the effort went further.</p><p>\"I had the impression the Deputy Attorney General had already discussed this with two members in the President's cabinet.  And that they were on board with this concept already.\"    On Twitter the President responded to McCabe on \"60 MINUTES,\" \"While, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.  He and Rod Rosenstein look like they were planning a very illegal act.\"</p><p>McCabe and others say the President's May 2017 firing of Director James Comey left the FBI and Justice Department in turmoil.  And they concerned that the firing was designed to be synced the Russian probe and obstruct justice.</p><p>MCCABE:  The Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire into the White House.  He said, I never get search when I going to the White House.  I think the General Counsel had a heart attack.  When he got up off the floor he said, I -- that's a bridge too far.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  But Baker who could face criminal penalties for lying to Congressional investigators testified \"My recollection is that there were discussions about it over longer period than the course of one meeting, a couple of days.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  McCabe said Rosenstein initially resisted a Special Counsel because the Deputy Attorney General worried he might lose his job.  A senior department official told Fox tonight the Special Counsel was appointed \"to ensure that the Russia investigation was truly independent and without bias.\"  Something the official said that McCabe could not have accomplished.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Catherine, thanks very much.  Catherine Herridge.  Well, joining us tonight, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch.  One of the country's most effective watchdog groups.  And he's worked with the International Policy Forum, the Leadership Institute, Accuracy in Media, among others.  Tom, good to have you with us.  What we just heard from the folks at \"60 MINUTES\" over at CBS, although they didn't ask a follow-up question, it was an outright confession by McCabe that he was committing felonies and an attempt to overthrow the President of the United States along with a number of his colleagues.  Your reaction when you heard it?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Well, it's extraordinary.  It confirms early reports last year that this discussion took place.  You know, Lou, if there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt we'll be -- we'll be calling it a coup.  But because you got -- I don't like the bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this and it's -- the target is President Trump, they don't care.</p><p>And America should realize this is how you can lose a Republic where you have appointees of the President and bureaucrats to answer to virtually no one talk about manipulating the law in order to overturn a presidential election and attack a president they don't like.  They don't like for any substantial reason.  They don't like him because they fired -- he fired his buddy, McCabe's buddy and Rosenstein's buddy, James Comey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  At the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein, by the way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON:  Right.  A fight about a personnel decision.  And they're going to overthrow the presidency.  And, you know, let's be clear here, Mueller is a successor to this coup attempt.  He's -- the appointment flows out of all of these discussions and we should recognize that the effort to overthrow the President is continuing with Justice Department help through this out-of-control Mueller investigation.</p><p>DOBBS:  And without so much as -- and effort, explanation, rationalization, this is -- we're watching McCabe basically saying he was doing it for the country's own good.  Here's a man sworn to enforce the law, to enforce the constitution of the United States, to defend the United States committing subversions, in my opinion, sedition and treason.  And those who want to say that we're not at war should reference the war on terror that we've been engaged in for 19 -- almost 19 years.</p><p>This is outrageous and we haven't heard a word from the leadership of the Republican Party about arresting these people.  We haven't heard a word from the so-called establishment that is supposed to hold the tenants values of this -- of this great nation and primacy.  They are just simply averting their eyes.  It's appalling, it's disgusting, there should be outrage throughout the country in both parties across every part of this nation.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I agree.  And the problem with the Justice Department is that Mueller is still running the Justice Department effectively.  And so any effort to uncover what went on behind this investigation and this is what went on behind this investigation, runs into the Mueller juggernaut.  And, you know, Attorney General Barr, he needs to step up and defend the President.  You know, the argument for -- against Barr was will he stand up to President Trump?</p><p>And I think the test for Attorney General Barr is, will he stand up for President Trump and for the rule of law against these deep stators and the establishment who don't care about our constitution.  You know, President Trump may survive this attack on him but maybe another President want.  And we'll lose our Republic and we won't even know it came.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I guarantee he will survive these attacks.  He's already demonstrated that he is stronger than the entire lot of these extraordinary venal, vicious actors in the Justice Department.  What may not survive is his Justice Department and the FBI.  And Tom Fitton, should they survive?  Because they are the root of the corruption and the malignancy of the others wanted to subscribe to this administration.</p><p>When, in point of fact, they have been the perpetrators of wrongdoing from the months preceding the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p>FITTON:  Well, my -- you know, I'm a small government conservative.  I think all government agencies should be subject to scrutiny every year before any money is given to them.  And given the corruption at the DOJ, I think we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The problem with that is, the appropriators as well as the investigators are also deep state actors and have been working just as viciously, frankly, behind the scenes as the people in the Justice Department and the FBI.  My god.</p><p>FITTON:  You know, the problem with the FBI is the current leadership frankly, Mr. Ray has zero interest in reforming the organization.</p><p>DOBBS:  Where is he?</p><p>FITTON:  That's why --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, we don't even hear from him.</p><p>FITTON:  He is missing in action when it comes to standing and uncovering -- I -- uncovering the corruption and to a degree he said anything, Lou, he's been excusing the corruption.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Exactly.  Tom, it's always good to have you here.  I wish we're talking in better circumstances.  But, as you intimated at the outset, the Republic itself is at stake here.</p><p>FITTON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the silence is absolutely chilling.  Thank you so much, Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON:  Welcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  And again, as always, and I mean it even when I don't say, thanks for everything that you and Judicial Watch do.  Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome.  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, one of the most embarrassing figures in modern American political history.  Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken his anti- American message overseas embarrassing the United States in front of our allies and many of his former colleagues in the Obama administration.  It's a shadow government.  We'll take that up and more right after this quick break.  Ed Rollins joins me.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A New York Times report today saying former President Obama is counseling the Dems' 2020 hopefuls but he will not be giving the New York Times assures us, anyone, anyone, not even Joe Biden, his endorsement.  His former Vice President taking a page out of his old Obama playbook.  Apologizing for America overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents.  It makes us an embarrassing in the example we're setting.  Well, I should stop.  As my mother would say, this too shall pass.  We will be back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  I wouldn't bet on it.  In any way, shape, or fashion, at least not led by one Joe Biden.  He's just blown his chances for 2020 in all likelihood.  Biden, it seems forgot one important lesson from his former boss.  President Obama at least waited until he had been elected and was in office before slamming America overseas.  Well, joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst Ed Rollins.  Ed, great to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  What a day.  Let's start with Biden, he just blew it, didn't he?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he certainly did something outrageous than anybody I've ever known.  A former Vice President to go before this important meeting and condemn the America is just outrageous.  You often do that if you're a presidential candidate in Iowa, or (INAUDIBLE) New Hampshire or somewhere.  But to go before our allies and to basically take apart the administration's position is just outrageous.</p><p>DOBBS:  When President Obama did that, his famous apology tour in Berlin in Cairo, he had been elected.</p><p>ROLLINS:  He'd been elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, there was a chance to make things right in 2012.  Romney didn't make that happen.  I think Biden can just kiss it goodbye, personally.  I would like to turn to this extraordinary piece on \"60 MINUTES\" in which Andrew McCabe actually confessed to trying to overthrow the President of the United States, Ed.  And where's the outrage from the Republican leadership?  I mean, I think the whole country should be just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  I have to tell you, from when I sat and watched it last night I was outraged because there's a conspiracy going on.  First of all, the 25th Amendment is for a president to step aside if he has health issues or something else.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Or a Vice President to step in if the President is incapacitated.  It is not about removing a president from office.  And I think to a certain extent, you think the Justice Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  These guys were not only obviously corrupt, they were stupid beyond imagining for people who were supposedly trained in law and respectful of it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the fact that before this, any evidence that basically still plotting and scheming to take out a President of the United States and talking to members of the cabinet according to him with the full support of the acting attorney general, I just found it appalling.  It's so un-American, it's like --</p><p>DOBBS:  So, where is the Republican Party?  Why aren't the leaders of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, every republican governor, every Republican governor, every Republican in this country standing up and saying end the witch-hunt, end all of this non-sense, it's obviously a cabal that has been working and the conspiracy to overthrow the President of the United States or tacitly they are endorsing it with their silence.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, their silence is terrible.  The reality is we are in a fight of our life.  President Trump basically doing everything he promised to do, moving the ball forward.  But the Democrats are really revved up and they're going to do everything they can to stop him.  From lawsuits to what have you.  And they're not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in the land that will join this president on the basis of his declaration of a national emergency.  I -- we know then that the corruption has absolutely grasped our judiciary system as well.  We got every indication that that's happened.  But for them to enjoin a president in a matter of national security would be an act against the Republic, the constitution itself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you and I have been around long enough to know that's going to happen.  And at the end of the day it's going to end up being in the Supreme Court.  And the Supreme Court has to rule in the President's favor at the end of the day here.  But it's going to go through the process.  There's -- all of these political attorney generals and what have you who want to make (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS:  But honorable, honest and judges who are not overwhelmed by their partisan prejudice would understand that that it could be absolutely litigated in our judiciary.  Without enjoining until a decision by the high court.  That would be the honorable thing to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the absolute honoring thing to do.  And I would -- I would hope the Supreme Court is stepping very quickly if they started out this process.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  I worry about this court and what more -- the more that we learned about Chief Justice John Roberts, I'm not saying when about, what will or will not occur in that high court.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I'm hopeful in the end he will do the right thing.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Well, we can all hope.  But I'd rather have certainty.</p><p>ROLLINS:  In the end.  In the end.  There is no certainty -- there's no certainty in life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there isn't.  But in this constitution there should be absolute certainty.  Ed Rollins, thanks much.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  We appreciate it.  We'd like to hear your thoughts on all this.  Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Coming up here next, Chicago Police, they want answers from actor, Jussie Smollett after their investigation into an alleged hate crime reverses.  That and much more coming up next.  We'll be talking with Washington Times' Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Before we go to break, let's take a look at the U.S. national debt as if we don't have enough problems already.  $22 trillion and climbing.  We're coming right back after this.  Stay brave of heart, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump in Miami today for claiming the days of socialism in the western hemisphere are numbered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If you choose this path, you have the opportunity to help forge a safe and prosperous future for all of the people of Venezuela.  Or you can choose the second path, continuing to support Maduro.  If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out.  You will lose everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump also using his speech to continue to express his supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.  A reported hate crime in Chicago looking more and more like a hate hoax.  Chicago Police say they no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim.  And they are pushing for a follow-up interview which his attorney -- Smollett's attorneys have resisted.  The police request -- imagine that, a request comes amid new reports that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault.</p><p>Both men have been questioned and released without charges.  Reverend Al Sharpton, we want to point out, responding to the news.  And Sharpton saying Smollett should face as he put it, \"accountability to the maximum\" if it's found the actor stage the attack.  Joining us tonight, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times Columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Tammy, good to see you.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, everybody.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Smollett and the hoax.  I have to give Reverend Al Sharpton great credit for standing up which by the way all of the candidates who have been commenting on this, the Democratic candidates have not had the courage to do.  Your thoughts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  The candidates seem to be wanting to pretend this never happened.  They get away without law because then the media also steps away from it and stops discussing it.  But Reverend Al Sharpton of course is very well known for promoting one of the original hoaxes, if you will with a young woman named Tawana Brawley who made some accusations against police officers which ended up being false.</p><p>So it's fascinating that he would actually take that position.  So good for him if he has found, you know, the right direction.  And maybe -- I don't know, maybe he's thinking that Mr. Smollett deserves a program on MSNBC like he has.  Who knows what that end result should be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you brought that to us with a sense of appropriate justice.</p><p>BRUCE:  Absolutely.  Hanging every day, every day.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's turn to Venezuela, the President today importantly going to Miami as the setting to announce his views and judgment and policies on the hemisphere and Venezuela in particular.  Your thoughts?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Perfect of course.  We know for South Florida it has a lot of people who are immigrants who have experienced in our lifetimes very recently, the impact of totalitarianism and tyrants.  So when he --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Venezuelans by the way.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, Venezuelans and Cubans.  So when he's speaking it happens to be the right thing, of course it is the thing that the President believes in.  But it also speaks to the Venezuelans that are already in South Florida that are coming to South Florida but speaking to that core of people in this region that understand the importance of freedom, this nation, capitalism and the value of the support of the American Presidents.</p><p>And so it's going to make I think a big different for people there and sends a very strong message back home about what his intentions are.</p><p>DOBBS:  I think he had a couple of other audiences as well in mind as he spoke.  And one of this of course the American people when he said this country will never be socialist.  That was a loud straightforward challenge to everyone of the -- what seemed to be every one of the Democratic hopefuls so far.  At least announced, this is not going to be an easy campaign for you because you've already gone to the left and lined up against this country and our traditions.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  It's the first education they may be receiving about real life.  These are -- especially young people, Miss Ocasio-Cortez obviously seems to not have any major education about the impact of socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Or minor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Or a minor education on the nape on how it destroys lives, on how it destroys countries and economies.  So, this is going to be her first indication about courtesy of the President, about real life and what socialism does to people.</p><p>DOBBS:  This could be an expensive tutorial for AOC if it moves into, as it appears, it is about to, into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  This is -- it could be.  And she won't understand this, I think, until 2020.  The benefit of this education for the American people about what the Democratic Party is becoming, and how everybody is running on this kind of an issue.</p><p>The President stands as the bulwark against this framework and as a reminder about what -- how greatness really can be brought into our lives.  And it's not through certainly that totalitarianism by any stretch.</p><p>DOBBS:  And most to me, it's very encouraging to see the presidential tracking poll with the president's popularity.  I had approval rising at 52 percent.  I confess that I personally think it should be significantly higher, and I hope it soon will be.</p><p>BRUCE:  It probably is, as a matter of fact.  When you think about the --</p><p>DOBBS:  I'd like to see it expressed in black-and-white.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Like you, I have faith in the forgotten man and woman in this country.  But this president, I think now, has turned a very important corner.  I think the national left-wing media understands it.  It is beginning to understand it.  That's why they are not quite as free with their nonsense as they have been.</p><p>In other words, Jim Acosta is receding quite a bit, as his colleagues, I think, on the left, in that White House briefing room, for example, it's one of the barometers of this all.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's good news.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy, good to have you here.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Up next, British lawmakers say Facebook is acting like gangsters with our personal information.  We take that up.  Now, the Europeans are doing something about it.  Why in the world isn't the United States?  Isn't privacy an even bigger right for Americans?  We take that up with cyber expert, Morgan Wright.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.  Oh, Google, Facebook, gangsters.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Headlines tonight, Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, claims he has \"a lot of discretion on border wall funding from President Trump's national emergency declaration,\" despite receiving a direct order from the President of the United States to secure the border.</p><p>Shanahan says \"I'm not required to do anything.\"  Well, he'd be required to do something, one would think, like pack his bags and get out of there.  A North Carolina elections board, beginning deliberations over election fraud allegations, Republican Mark Harris leading in last month's ninth congressional district election.</p><p>The board consists of three Democrats, two Republicans, they will decide whether to certify a winner or order a new election, Harris, by the way, leading Democrat Dan McCready, by 905 votes, but again, the vote that may count as the 3-2 vote on the elections board.</p><p>A new report from the U.K. parliament, calling Facebook, digital gangsters, for failing to thwart attempts by Russia to influence elections, the report accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of contempt of parliament.</p><p>Joining me now, Morgan Wright, Former Senior Advisor in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, Former Law Enforcement Advisor to the Republican National Committee, Cyber Security Expert, Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, EXPERT, CYBERSECURITY:  Hey, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me start with, first, the gangsters that Facebook and Google.  Who knew that they were going to be declared gangsters first by the U.K., rather than the United States?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, I don't see Al Pacino playing Mark Zuckerberg in a movie, you know, about gangsters, but yes, you know.  And Lou, we've talked about this before about why is the -- why is the E.U. ahead of us with things like the General Data Protection Regulations, privacy?</p><p>And I'll tell you, the only thing I can think of as it comes down to money, because there's a -- Facebook has figured out the Google playbook, which is, spend a lot of money, spend a lot of time here in D.C., on K Street, M Street, whatever all the streets are, and you know, get in there and lobby people, spread lots of money around.</p><p>And Lou, during the hearings, how many members of Congress did we see ponder to Mark Zuckerberg, hoping to relocate shit jobs in their district.  I mean, this is one reason why you don't have it because everybody's hoping to get something from Zuckerberg.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and -- but it reinforces the impression.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  That a half dozen of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have such concentrated economic and technological and political power, that they are almost now so large that it is impossible to rein them in.  Is that fear well-placed?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  And I'll tell you, Lou, you and I talked about this awhile back too, when we talked about how globalism is killing patriotism.  And all of these companies have taken the advantage of the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) well guess what?</p><p>It's coming home to roost now, because now that these companies want to be global.  Your subject to the E.U. regulations, the U.K. regulations, you know, Germany's regulations, all of these other places that actually place a premium on privacy, for too long self-regulation, they've tried it, it hasn't worked.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is the self-regulation go away.  And you're going to see more government interventions starting overseas, and hopefully, it'll end up over here, not to put them out of business, but, man, we've got to put a check on the seemingly unchecked power that they have right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  There is no countervailing influence in our economy, or our society, or our body politic to the awesome power of big tech.  That's simply a fact, and to that, the power of Wall Street and Corporate America.</p><p>And right now, the middle class in this country, if they were not the champion, the President of the United States would be defenseless against an onslaught that had rolled back the middle class for 20 years, and which under this president, is once again, growing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.  And look, you know, something interesting that came out of the U.K. report too, is they talked about -- even though Zuckerberg, in front of Congress, and sent his minions over there to say we don' sell any data, it's clear they've been selling data.  It's true that they've been using apps to spy on the activities of users and their competitors.</p><p>Look, this is the modern version.</p><p>DOBBS:  And even those who are not users.</p><p>WRIGHT:  --have that power, right, absolutely.  And the KGB only wished they would've had this power back in the day.  You know, our NSA and FBI don't have near the power that Facebook, Google, Amazon.  You know, these folks have to spy into the lives of us, but there are no consequences for it.  At some point, there has to be stick because the carrot hasn't worked.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  This is a president who is keenly aware --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- that U.S. policies haven't worked.  He is also confronted now by ZTE, as a favor to President Xi.  He backed off of the consequences for ZTE, Huawei, now paying the consequences for its role in spying, but doing so, only within our court system, not as a result of a national security response from the part of the United States.</p><p>How much longer can we go without saying straightforwardly to the Chinese, there will be a response on national security terms if you continue to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from this country each year and carry out acts of espionage nonstop.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, I think Gordon Chang's been on with before he talked about poor Chinese economically, I think they need to put -- they need to put the hammer down on Huawei.  It's time to put Huawei and ZTE out of business.</p><p>And I'll tell you why, Lou, the upcoming 5G, Huawei is doing everything they can to get their technology into these countries, but you've Australia, New Zealand, Japan.  The U.K. said it's going to take, you know -- they probably going to have to spend five years and $2-$3 billion to meet the U.K. standards.</p><p>The best way to stop this economic espionage is to quit lulling the government of China to subsidize the rail system, the electronic system, the communication systems to where it's all Chinese infrastructure.  And there's no U.S. infrastructure in play.  We can't -- it's not a fair fight.</p><p>So, I think they've got to put the hammer down on these guys.  One of the ways to stop espionage is to keep their equipment out of our infrastructure.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the -- and the administration to its credit is trying to do exactly that.  Huawei, at the same time, is bragging they are now too big to stop.  And this is -- this again, is advised rhetoric from the PLA and from President Xi, himself.</p><p>The Communist Party is now flaunting their economic and political and military power.  The United States is -- has to simply respond, and hopefully, before it becomes a military response.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  But it looks as though we are absolutely vulnerable in cyberspace right now.  Is that a correct impression?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, absolutely.  Lou, we have -- from our power grid, to our nuclear plants, to you know -- the rail system transportation.  A lot of things are still so vulnerable because we're so fragmented.  We don't have --</p><p>Even though we might have an overall plan, we don't have an overall coherent ability to secure all the things we need to do, why, because the private sector owns 85 percent of the critical infrastructure that's out there.</p><p>The government can provide a lot of support, a lot of help, but were the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese?  And even the North Koreans are exploiting.  They're exploiting all of these gaps between the different infrastructures.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>WRIGHT:  The lack of coherence among the security plans.  And the old technology that's out there.  We've got out-of-date machines that are still running windows that haven't been supported for five or six years.</p><p>DOBBS:  What Morgan is not saying, that 85 percent that is in the private sector, is often run by CEOs and boards that are frankly, friendlier to Chinese policies than they are to the policies of the Trump administration and the U.S. government.  And that's got to change, straightaway.  I didn't put words in your mouth, did I, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Lou, you're always right.  That's one lesson I've learned.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, thanks so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you, Morgan Wright.</p><p>Up next, New York Governor Bill -- New York Mayor, Bill de Blasio says AOC doesn't know what she is talking about.  We take that up after the break with American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio putting freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her place after Amazon decided not to build its headquarters in Long Island City.  Cortez claimed the failed deal would free up $4 billion in taxes incentives for the city to use elsewhere.  The good mayor reminded her even a socialist understood this, at least one of the socialists did, reminding her the money would only be available after the city secured the Amazon jobs and revenue and that it wasn't in a budget somewhere.</p><p>Radical freshman congresswoman, there's a lot of those going around.  Ilhan Omar scheduled to raise money in March for the Hamas link council on American-Islamic relations.  Omar received $5,000 from them during a run for Congress.  She since repeatedly made headlines for her anti-Semitic remarks most recently suggesting Republican support of Israel is bought and paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC.  At some point anti-Semitic remarks result in being anti -- an anti-Semite it seems.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Matt Schlapp.  He's the chairman of the American Conservative Union.  Why is it that the Left is suddenly so reluctant to say what is obvious that they have an anti-Semitic strain within their party and on Capitol Hill and aren't dealing with it?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, I completely agree with you, Lou, but I asked -- I actually think it's more cynical than this.  I think the Democratic Party has really shed its longtime support of the State of Israel.  I think they're moving away from this policy point of view and I think it gives Donald Trump who has done everything he said he would do with getting rid of the Iran deal, moving the embassy a great chance with these voters not with the not with the Liberal leaders potentially of this community but with everyday voters who can see anti-Semitism when it's so clear.</p><p>DOBBS:  Anti-Semitism, we saw reports today that the yellow vest in France you know, blaming them for a strain of anti-Semitism within France leaving out the entire ruling body and class in France that -- I mean there's anti-Semitism has been a huge issue in France.  It is not only anti-Israel, it is pro-Palestinian, and the expression is found throughout the political structure of France.  This looks like another gambit to lay off blame for what is a strengthening strain of anti-Semitism in France and indeed Europe.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.  And look, I think what's happening -- what's ironic, Lou, is what's happening in Israel is this once socialist country has really been embracing free markets and innovation and really has become a kindred soul in one of our closest allies to obviously to America and to our way of life into our values.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people that just hate everything about the idea of innovation of entrepreneurs or free markets of the little guy being able to go to market and take his ideas to the customers.  And they are against every aspect of that and I love the fact that Israel in America and freedom-loving people including the people of South America, including the freedom lovers in Venezuela.  We're working together to rid the world of this dreaded socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dreaded socialism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism and that really what I was asking you about.  Socialism is as the President assured is this country will never be socialistic.  What is in question tonight is whether or not one guy you know, is going to be the successor to Maduro.  Will he or will he not and what is your sense from where you look?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a great question, Lou.  And I worry I think it's a little bit of a jump ball right now.  I think the President, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo we're trying to do everything they can to use power in influence to stand up for the Venezuelan people in this new president Mr. Guaido.  And Maduro is a -- is a tin-pot dictator.  And you know they have a lot of power at the end of their reigns.  And we'll see if he's able to use that power.  But I'm hopeful that the right side will win out in Venezuela.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's a lot of hope running around this country right now primarily because President Trump is indeed the leader of the free world.  My question to you is why is the establishment in Washington D.C. not screaming for the arrest of Andrew McCabe and for all of his cohorts and the DOJ and the FBI?  Why is it that there seems to be almost a satisfaction in the status quo no matter how rancid and corrupt in the swamp that is D.C.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Look, I'm disgusted by it and I guess there's only one person who can do something about it and that's Bill Barr.  Is he either going to do this or he's not, and I'd be greatly disappointed if he doesn't.  And I think --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why the hell isn't the Republican Party's standing up and demanding his arrest?  Why --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You know why.</p><p>DOBBS:  I do not know why.  I would not be asking you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I think the reason is because they don't want the controversy of actually taking the deep state on because they might be coming its next victim.</p><p>DOBBS:  Then their doubtless wonders and why in the world should we tolerate these Koch brothers hired excuses for legislators and representatives.  They represent nothing but Koch brothers, the Wall Street, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber, they are -- it's enough to make you sick.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Lou, if that's where the Republican Party stays, it will deserve to lose beyond the ash heap of history.  We either going to represent the people or we're not and if we don't, we deserve to lose and we ought to get out of the way.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's very simple.  They either follow President Trump or they are going to be on the scrap heap of history.  The problem is they could take the Republican with them.  Matt, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Good to see you too.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the dark political agenda of the deep state, their efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald Trump -- that's right -- to overthrow the U.S. government.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Andrew McCabe, fired as acting director of the FBI last night on 60 Minutes confessed he was involved in an effort to remove well, President Trump from office and to overthrow the government of the United States.  Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton says McCabe, the Department of Justice and the FBI were trying to overthrow the government and this republic.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT JUDICIAL WATCH:  If there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt the media would be calling it a coup.  But because you've got an elected bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this, and if the target is President Trump, they don't care.  And Americans should realize this is how you can lose a republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Tomorrow night, Congressman Mark Green, David Bossie, and Attorney Harmeet Dhillon among our guests tomorrow.  We hope you'll join us.  Thanks for being with us tonight.  Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs.  And again, thanks for being with us.  Good night.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2183280215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VG5-1901-JBHT-D06K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

This aversion is President Trump and his administration on full display this weekend as former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe actually confessed that he, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and a host of corrupt FBI and Department of Justice actors sought to unseat a sitting president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR:  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.  What I can say is the Deputy Attorney General was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confession.  Where is the outrage about their treason?  Where is the Republican Party and its leaders demanding they arrest McCabe and the rest of his cohorts who conspired to overthrow the President of the United States?  McCabe's admission of the coup attempted by the corrupt deep state went without as much a follow-up question by CBS.  Where is the national media?  Left-wing, though it may be, it in demanding answers, accountability, and transparency for this aversion and outright sedition?</p><p>Judicial watch President, Tom Fitton, Radio Show Host, Tammy Bruce among our guest here tonight to discuss those questions and their answers.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, over the weekend calling the United States embarrassing.  As globalist foreign leaders and the radical Dems applaud their approval of his careless and outrageous remarks on foreign soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents or turning their back on refugees on our border.  Americans know that's not right.  The American people understand, please, because it makes us embarrassing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Biden is the embarrassment.  What should be embarrassing to Biden is that he can't even garner the support of his former president, President Barack Obama.  Obama saying he will not endorse a Democrat for president even if Biden decides to run.  We take up Biden's embarrassing trip overseas.  Republican Strategist, Ed Rollins, Matt Schlapp joins us.  And President Trump today in Miami issuing his strong support for Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.</p><p>The President's message clear and definitive.  The United States will never be a socialist nation, we take up the President's address and much more here tonight.  Our top story, former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe confessed there was in fact a deep state conspiracy among his cohorts in the Justice Department and FBI to remove President Trump from office.  Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCCABE:  Counting votes, or possible vote.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The former acting FBI director told \"60 MINUTES\" the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein openly discussed how many cabinet members would support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President.  But the FBI's former general counsel, James Baker who met contemporaneously with McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page about their conversations with Rosenstein testified the effort went further.</p><p>\"I had the impression the Deputy Attorney General had already discussed this with two members in the President's cabinet.  And that they were on board with this concept already.\"    On Twitter the President responded to McCabe on \"60 MINUTES,\" \"While, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.  He and Rod Rosenstein look like they were planning a very illegal act.\"</p><p>McCabe and others say the President's May 2017 firing of Director James Comey left the FBI and Justice Department in turmoil.  And they concerned that the firing was designed to be synced the Russian probe and obstruct justice.</p><p>MCCABE:  The Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire into the White House.  He said, I never get search when I going to the White House.  I think the General Counsel had a heart attack.  When he got up off the floor he said, I -- that's a bridge too far.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  But Baker who could face criminal penalties for lying to Congressional investigators testified \"My recollection is that there were discussions about it over longer period than the course of one meeting, a couple of days.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  McCabe said Rosenstein initially resisted a Special Counsel because the Deputy Attorney General worried he might lose his job.  A senior department official told Fox tonight the Special Counsel was appointed \"to ensure that the Russia investigation was truly independent and without bias.\"  Something the official said that McCabe could not have accomplished.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Catherine, thanks very much.  Catherine Herridge.  Well, joining us tonight, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch.  One of the country's most effective watchdog groups.  And he's worked with the International Policy Forum, the Leadership Institute, Accuracy in Media, among others.  Tom, good to have you with us.  What we just heard from the folks at \"60 MINUTES\" over at CBS, although they didn't ask a follow-up question, it was an outright confession by McCabe that he was committing felonies and an attempt to overthrow the President of the United States along with a number of his colleagues.  Your reaction when you heard it?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Well, it's extraordinary.  It confirms early reports last year that this discussion took place.  You know, Lou, if there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt we'll be -- we'll be calling it a coup.  But because you got -- I don't like the bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this and it's -- the target is President Trump, they don't care.</p><p>And America should realize this is how you can lose a Republic where you have appointees of the President and bureaucrats to answer to virtually no one talk about manipulating the law in order to overturn a presidential election and attack a president they don't like.  They don't like for any substantial reason.  They don't like him because they fired -- he fired his buddy, McCabe's buddy and Rosenstein's buddy, James Comey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  At the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein, by the way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON:  Right.  A fight about a personnel decision.  And they're going to overthrow the presidency.  And, you know, let's be clear here, Mueller is a successor to this coup attempt.  He's -- the appointment flows out of all of these discussions and we should recognize that the effort to overthrow the President is continuing with Justice Department help through this out-of-control Mueller investigation.</p><p>DOBBS:  And without so much as -- and effort, explanation, rationalization, this is -- we're watching McCabe basically saying he was doing it for the country's own good.  Here's a man sworn to enforce the law, to enforce the constitution of the United States, to defend the United States committing subversions, in my opinion, sedition and treason.  And those who want to say that we're not at war should reference the war on terror that we've been engaged in for 19 -- almost 19 years.</p><p>This is outrageous and we haven't heard a word from the leadership of the Republican Party about arresting these people.  We haven't heard a word from the so-called establishment that is supposed to hold the tenants values of this -- of this great nation and primacy.  They are just simply averting their eyes.  It's appalling, it's disgusting, there should be outrage throughout the country in both parties across every part of this nation.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I agree.  And the problem with the Justice Department is that Mueller is still running the Justice Department effectively.  And so any effort to uncover what went on behind this investigation and this is what went on behind this investigation, runs into the Mueller juggernaut.  And, you know, Attorney General Barr, he needs to step up and defend the President.  You know, the argument for -- against Barr was will he stand up to President Trump?</p><p>And I think the test for Attorney General Barr is, will he stand up for President Trump and for the rule of law against these deep stators and the establishment who don't care about our constitution.  You know, President Trump may survive this attack on him but maybe another President want.  And we'll lose our Republic and we won't even know it came.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I guarantee he will survive these attacks.  He's already demonstrated that he is stronger than the entire lot of these extraordinary venal, vicious actors in the Justice Department.  What may not survive is his Justice Department and the FBI.  And Tom Fitton, should they survive?  Because they are the root of the corruption and the malignancy of the others wanted to subscribe to this administration.</p><p>When, in point of fact, they have been the perpetrators of wrongdoing from the months preceding the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p>FITTON:  Well, my -- you know, I'm a small government conservative.  I think all government agencies should be subject to scrutiny every year before any money is given to them.  And given the corruption at the DOJ, I think we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The problem with that is, the appropriators as well as the investigators are also deep state actors and have been working just as viciously, frankly, behind the scenes as the people in the Justice Department and the FBI.  My god.</p><p>FITTON:  You know, the problem with the FBI is the current leadership frankly, Mr. Ray has zero interest in reforming the organization.</p><p>DOBBS:  Where is he?</p><p>FITTON:  That's why --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, we don't even hear from him.</p><p>FITTON:  He is missing in action when it comes to standing and uncovering -- I -- uncovering the corruption and to a degree he said anything, Lou, he's been excusing the corruption.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Exactly.  Tom, it's always good to have you here.  I wish we're talking in better circumstances.  But, as you intimated at the outset, the Republic itself is at stake here.</p><p>FITTON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the silence is absolutely chilling.  Thank you so much, Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON:  Welcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  And again, as always, and I mean it even when I don't say, thanks for everything that you and Judicial Watch do.  Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome.  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, one of the most embarrassing figures in modern American political history.  Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken his anti- American message overseas embarrassing the United States in front of our allies and many of his former colleagues in the Obama administration.  It's a shadow government.  We'll take that up and more right after this quick break.  Ed Rollins joins me.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A New York Times report today saying former President Obama is counseling the Dems' 2020 hopefuls but he will not be giving the New York Times assures us, anyone, anyone, not even Joe Biden, his endorsement.  His former Vice President taking a page out of his old Obama playbook.  Apologizing for America overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents.  It makes us an embarrassing in the example we're setting.  Well, I should stop.  As my mother would say, this too shall pass.  We will be back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  I wouldn't bet on it.  In any way, shape, or fashion, at least not led by one Joe Biden.  He's just blown his chances for 2020 in all likelihood.  Biden, it seems forgot one important lesson from his former boss.  President Obama at least waited until he had been elected and was in office before slamming America overseas.  Well, joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst Ed Rollins.  Ed, great to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  What a day.  Let's start with Biden, he just blew it, didn't he?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he certainly did something outrageous than anybody I've ever known.  A former Vice President to go before this important meeting and condemn the America is just outrageous.  You often do that if you're a presidential candidate in Iowa, or (INAUDIBLE) New Hampshire or somewhere.  But to go before our allies and to basically take apart the administration's position is just outrageous.</p><p>DOBBS:  When President Obama did that, his famous apology tour in Berlin in Cairo, he had been elected.</p><p>ROLLINS:  He'd been elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, there was a chance to make things right in 2012.  Romney didn't make that happen.  I think Biden can just kiss it goodbye, personally.  I would like to turn to this extraordinary piece on \"60 MINUTES\" in which Andrew McCabe actually confessed to trying to overthrow the President of the United States, Ed.  And where's the outrage from the Republican leadership?  I mean, I think the whole country should be just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  I have to tell you, from when I sat and watched it last night I was outraged because there's a conspiracy going on.  First of all, the 25th Amendment is for a president to step aside if he has health issues or something else.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Or a Vice President to step in if the President is incapacitated.  It is not about removing a president from office.  And I think to a certain extent, you think the Justice Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  These guys were not only obviously corrupt, they were stupid beyond imagining for people who were supposedly trained in law and respectful of it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the fact that before this, any evidence that basically still plotting and scheming to take out a President of the United States and talking to members of the cabinet according to him with the full support of the acting attorney general, I just found it appalling.  It's so un-American, it's like --</p><p>DOBBS:  So, where is the Republican Party?  Why aren't the leaders of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, every republican governor, every Republican governor, every Republican in this country standing up and saying end the witch-hunt, end all of this non-sense, it's obviously a cabal that has been working and the conspiracy to overthrow the President of the United States or tacitly they are endorsing it with their silence.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, their silence is terrible.  The reality is we are in a fight of our life.  President Trump basically doing everything he promised to do, moving the ball forward.  But the Democrats are really revved up and they're going to do everything they can to stop him.  From lawsuits to what have you.  And they're not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in the land that will join this president on the basis of his declaration of a national emergency.  I -- we know then that the corruption has absolutely grasped our judiciary system as well.  We got every indication that that's happened.  But for them to enjoin a president in a matter of national security would be an act against the Republic, the constitution itself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you and I have been around long enough to know that's going to happen.  And at the end of the day it's going to end up being in the Supreme Court.  And the Supreme Court has to rule in the President's favor at the end of the day here.  But it's going to go through the process.  There's -- all of these political attorney generals and what have you who want to make (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS:  But honorable, honest and judges who are not overwhelmed by their partisan prejudice would understand that that it could be absolutely litigated in our judiciary.  Without enjoining until a decision by the high court.  That would be the honorable thing to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the absolute honoring thing to do.  And I would -- I would hope the Supreme Court is stepping very quickly if they started out this process.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  I worry about this court and what more -- the more that we learned about Chief Justice John Roberts, I'm not saying when about, what will or will not occur in that high court.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I'm hopeful in the end he will do the right thing.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Well, we can all hope.  But I'd rather have certainty.</p><p>ROLLINS:  In the end.  In the end.  There is no certainty -- there's no certainty in life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there isn't.  But in this constitution there should be absolute certainty.  Ed Rollins, thanks much.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  We appreciate it.  We'd like to hear your thoughts on all this.  Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Coming up here next, Chicago Police, they want answers from actor, Jussie Smollett after their investigation into an alleged hate crime reverses.  That and much more coming up next.  We'll be talking with Washington Times' Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Before we go to break, let's take a look at the U.S. national debt as if we don't have enough problems already.  $22 trillion and climbing.  We're coming right back after this.  Stay brave of heart, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump in Miami today for claiming the days of socialism in the western hemisphere are numbered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If you choose this path, you have the opportunity to help forge a safe and prosperous future for all of the people of Venezuela.  Or you can choose the second path, continuing to support Maduro.  If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out.  You will lose everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump also using his speech to continue to express his supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.  A reported hate crime in Chicago looking more and more like a hate hoax.  Chicago Police say they no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim.  And they are pushing for a follow-up interview which his attorney -- Smollett's attorneys have resisted.  The police request -- imagine that, a request comes amid new reports that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault.</p><p>Both men have been questioned and released without charges.  Reverend Al Sharpton, we want to point out, responding to the news.  And Sharpton saying Smollett should face as he put it, \"accountability to the maximum\" if it's found the actor stage the attack.  Joining us tonight, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times Columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Tammy, good to see you.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, everybody.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Smollett and the hoax.  I have to give Reverend Al Sharpton great credit for standing up which by the way all of the candidates who have been commenting on this, the Democratic candidates have not had the courage to do.  Your thoughts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  The candidates seem to be wanting to pretend this never happened.  They get away without law because then the media also steps away from it and stops discussing it.  But Reverend Al Sharpton of course is very well known for promoting one of the original hoaxes, if you will with a young woman named Tawana Brawley who made some accusations against police officers which ended up being false.</p><p>So it's fascinating that he would actually take that position.  So good for him if he has found, you know, the right direction.  And maybe -- I don't know, maybe he's thinking that Mr. Smollett deserves a program on MSNBC like he has.  Who knows what that end result should be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you brought that to us with a sense of appropriate justice.</p><p>BRUCE:  Absolutely.  Hanging every day, every day.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's turn to Venezuela, the President today importantly going to Miami as the setting to announce his views and judgment and policies on the hemisphere and Venezuela in particular.  Your thoughts?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Perfect of course.  We know for South Florida it has a lot of people who are immigrants who have experienced in our lifetimes very recently, the impact of totalitarianism and tyrants.  So when he --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Venezuelans by the way.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, Venezuelans and Cubans.  So when he's speaking it happens to be the right thing, of course it is the thing that the President believes in.  But it also speaks to the Venezuelans that are already in South Florida that are coming to South Florida but speaking to that core of people in this region that understand the importance of freedom, this nation, capitalism and the value of the support of the American Presidents.</p><p>And so it's going to make I think a big different for people there and sends a very strong message back home about what his intentions are.</p><p>DOBBS:  I think he had a couple of other audiences as well in mind as he spoke.  And one of this of course the American people when he said this country will never be socialist.  That was a loud straightforward challenge to everyone of the -- what seemed to be every one of the Democratic hopefuls so far.  At least announced, this is not going to be an easy campaign for you because you've already gone to the left and lined up against this country and our traditions.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  It's the first education they may be receiving about real life.  These are -- especially young people, Miss Ocasio-Cortez obviously seems to not have any major education about the impact of socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Or minor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Or a minor education on the nape on how it destroys lives, on how it destroys countries and economies.  So, this is going to be her first indication about courtesy of the President, about real life and what socialism does to people.</p><p>DOBBS:  This could be an expensive tutorial for AOC if it moves into, as it appears, it is about to, into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  This is -- it could be.  And she won't understand this, I think, until 2020.  The benefit of this education for the American people about what the Democratic Party is becoming, and how everybody is running on this kind of an issue.</p><p>The President stands as the bulwark against this framework and as a reminder about what -- how greatness really can be brought into our lives.  And it's not through certainly that totalitarianism by any stretch.</p><p>DOBBS:  And most to me, it's very encouraging to see the presidential tracking poll with the president's popularity.  I had approval rising at 52 percent.  I confess that I personally think it should be significantly higher, and I hope it soon will be.</p><p>BRUCE:  It probably is, as a matter of fact.  When you think about the --</p><p>DOBBS:  I'd like to see it expressed in black-and-white.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Like you, I have faith in the forgotten man and woman in this country.  But this president, I think now, has turned a very important corner.  I think the national left-wing media understands it.  It is beginning to understand it.  That's why they are not quite as free with their nonsense as they have been.</p><p>In other words, Jim Acosta is receding quite a bit, as his colleagues, I think, on the left, in that White House briefing room, for example, it's one of the barometers of this all.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's good news.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy, good to have you here.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Up next, British lawmakers say Facebook is acting like gangsters with our personal information.  We take that up.  Now, the Europeans are doing something about it.  Why in the world isn't the United States?  Isn't privacy an even bigger right for Americans?  We take that up with cyber expert, Morgan Wright.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.  Oh, Google, Facebook, gangsters.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Headlines tonight, Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, claims he has \"a lot of discretion on border wall funding from President Trump's national emergency declaration,\" despite receiving a direct order from the President of the United States to secure the border.</p><p>Shanahan says \"I'm not required to do anything.\"  Well, he'd be required to do something, one would think, like pack his bags and get out of there.  A North Carolina elections board, beginning deliberations over election fraud allegations, Republican Mark Harris leading in last month's ninth congressional district election.</p><p>The board consists of three Democrats, two Republicans, they will decide whether to certify a winner or order a new election, Harris, by the way, leading Democrat Dan McCready, by 905 votes, but again, the vote that may count as the 3-2 vote on the elections board.</p><p>A new report from the U.K. parliament, calling Facebook, digital gangsters, for failing to thwart attempts by Russia to influence elections, the report accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of contempt of parliament.</p><p>Joining me now, Morgan Wright, Former Senior Advisor in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, Former Law Enforcement Advisor to the Republican National Committee, Cyber Security Expert, Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, EXPERT, CYBERSECURITY:  Hey, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me start with, first, the gangsters that Facebook and Google.  Who knew that they were going to be declared gangsters first by the U.K., rather than the United States?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, I don't see Al Pacino playing Mark Zuckerberg in a movie, you know, about gangsters, but yes, you know.  And Lou, we've talked about this before about why is the -- why is the E.U. ahead of us with things like the General Data Protection Regulations, privacy?</p><p>And I'll tell you, the only thing I can think of as it comes down to money, because there's a -- Facebook has figured out the Google playbook, which is, spend a lot of money, spend a lot of time here in D.C., on K Street, M Street, whatever all the streets are, and you know, get in there and lobby people, spread lots of money around.</p><p>And Lou, during the hearings, how many members of Congress did we see ponder to Mark Zuckerberg, hoping to relocate shit jobs in their district.  I mean, this is one reason why you don't have it because everybody's hoping to get something from Zuckerberg.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and -- but it reinforces the impression.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  That a half dozen of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have such concentrated economic and technological and political power, that they are almost now so large that it is impossible to rein them in.  Is that fear well-placed?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  And I'll tell you, Lou, you and I talked about this awhile back too, when we talked about how globalism is killing patriotism.  And all of these companies have taken the advantage of the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) well guess what?</p><p>It's coming home to roost now, because now that these companies want to be global.  Your subject to the E.U. regulations, the U.K. regulations, you know, Germany's regulations, all of these other places that actually place a premium on privacy, for too long self-regulation, they've tried it, it hasn't worked.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is the self-regulation go away.  And you're going to see more government interventions starting overseas, and hopefully, it'll end up over here, not to put them out of business, but, man, we've got to put a check on the seemingly unchecked power that they have right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  There is no countervailing influence in our economy, or our society, or our body politic to the awesome power of big tech.  That's simply a fact, and to that, the power of Wall Street and Corporate America.</p><p>And right now, the middle class in this country, if they were not the champion, the President of the United States would be defenseless against an onslaught that had rolled back the middle class for 20 years, and which under this president, is once again, growing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.  And look, you know, something interesting that came out of the U.K. report too, is they talked about -- even though Zuckerberg, in front of Congress, and sent his minions over there to say we don' sell any data, it's clear they've been selling data.  It's true that they've been using apps to spy on the activities of users and their competitors.</p><p>Look, this is the modern version.</p><p>DOBBS:  And even those who are not users.</p><p>WRIGHT:  --have that power, right, absolutely.  And the KGB only wished they would've had this power back in the day.  You know, our NSA and FBI don't have near the power that Facebook, Google, Amazon.  You know, these folks have to spy into the lives of us, but there are no consequences for it.  At some point, there has to be stick because the carrot hasn't worked.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  This is a president who is keenly aware --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- that U.S. policies haven't worked.  He is also confronted now by ZTE, as a favor to President Xi.  He backed off of the consequences for ZTE, Huawei, now paying the consequences for its role in spying, but doing so, only within our court system, not as a result of a national security response from the part of the United States.</p><p>How much longer can we go without saying straightforwardly to the Chinese, there will be a response on national security terms if you continue to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from this country each year and carry out acts of espionage nonstop.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, I think Gordon Chang's been on with before he talked about poor Chinese economically, I think they need to put -- they need to put the hammer down on Huawei.  It's time to put Huawei and ZTE out of business.</p><p>And I'll tell you why, Lou, the upcoming 5G, Huawei is doing everything they can to get their technology into these countries, but you've Australia, New Zealand, Japan.  The U.K. said it's going to take, you know -- they probably going to have to spend five years and $2-$3 billion to meet the U.K. standards.</p><p>The best way to stop this economic espionage is to quit lulling the government of China to subsidize the rail system, the electronic system, the communication systems to where it's all Chinese infrastructure.  And there's no U.S. infrastructure in play.  We can't -- it's not a fair fight.</p><p>So, I think they've got to put the hammer down on these guys.  One of the ways to stop espionage is to keep their equipment out of our infrastructure.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the -- and the administration to its credit is trying to do exactly that.  Huawei, at the same time, is bragging they are now too big to stop.  And this is -- this again, is advised rhetoric from the PLA and from President Xi, himself.</p><p>The Communist Party is now flaunting their economic and political and military power.  The United States is -- has to simply respond, and hopefully, before it becomes a military response.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  But it looks as though we are absolutely vulnerable in cyberspace right now.  Is that a correct impression?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, absolutely.  Lou, we have -- from our power grid, to our nuclear plants, to you know -- the rail system transportation.  A lot of things are still so vulnerable because we're so fragmented.  We don't have --</p><p>Even though we might have an overall plan, we don't have an overall coherent ability to secure all the things we need to do, why, because the private sector owns 85 percent of the critical infrastructure that's out there.</p><p>The government can provide a lot of support, a lot of help, but were the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese?  And even the North Koreans are exploiting.  They're exploiting all of these gaps between the different infrastructures.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>WRIGHT:  The lack of coherence among the security plans.  And the old technology that's out there.  We've got out-of-date machines that are still running windows that haven't been supported for five or six years.</p><p>DOBBS:  What Morgan is not saying, that 85 percent that is in the private sector, is often run by CEOs and boards that are frankly, friendlier to Chinese policies than they are to the policies of the Trump administration and the U.S. government.  And that's got to change, straightaway.  I didn't put words in your mouth, did I, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Lou, you're always right.  That's one lesson I've learned.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, thanks so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you, Morgan Wright.</p><p>Up next, New York Governor Bill -- New York Mayor, Bill de Blasio says AOC doesn't know what she is talking about.  We take that up after the break with American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio putting freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her place after Amazon decided not to build its headquarters in Long Island City.  Cortez claimed the failed deal would free up $4 billion in taxes incentives for the city to use elsewhere.  The good mayor reminded her even a socialist understood this, at least one of the socialists did, reminding her the money would only be available after the city secured the Amazon jobs and revenue and that it wasn't in a budget somewhere.</p><p>Radical freshman congresswoman, there's a lot of those going around.  Ilhan Omar scheduled to raise money in March for the Hamas link council on American-Islamic relations.  Omar received $5,000 from them during a run for Congress.  She since repeatedly made headlines for her anti-Semitic remarks most recently suggesting Republican support of Israel is bought and paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC.  At some point anti-Semitic remarks result in being anti -- an anti-Semite it seems.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Matt Schlapp.  He's the chairman of the American Conservative Union.  Why is it that the Left is suddenly so reluctant to say what is obvious that they have an anti-Semitic strain within their party and on Capitol Hill and aren't dealing with it?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, I completely agree with you, Lou, but I asked -- I actually think it's more cynical than this.  I think the Democratic Party has really shed its longtime support of the State of Israel.  I think they're moving away from this policy point of view and I think it gives Donald Trump who has done everything he said he would do with getting rid of the Iran deal, moving the embassy a great chance with these voters not with the not with the Liberal leaders potentially of this community but with everyday voters who can see anti-Semitism when it's so clear.</p><p>DOBBS:  Anti-Semitism, we saw reports today that the yellow vest in France you know, blaming them for a strain of anti-Semitism within France leaving out the entire ruling body and class in France that -- I mean there's anti-Semitism has been a huge issue in France.  It is not only anti-Israel, it is pro-Palestinian, and the expression is found throughout the political structure of France.  This looks like another gambit to lay off blame for what is a strengthening strain of anti-Semitism in France and indeed Europe.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.  And look, I think what's happening -- what's ironic, Lou, is what's happening in Israel is this once socialist country has really been embracing free markets and innovation and really has become a kindred soul in one of our closest allies to obviously to America and to our way of life into our values.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people that just hate everything about the idea of innovation of entrepreneurs or free markets of the little guy being able to go to market and take his ideas to the customers.  And they are against every aspect of that and I love the fact that Israel in America and freedom-loving people including the people of South America, including the freedom lovers in Venezuela.  We're working together to rid the world of this dreaded socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dreaded socialism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism and that really what I was asking you about.  Socialism is as the President assured is this country will never be socialistic.  What is in question tonight is whether or not one guy you know, is going to be the successor to Maduro.  Will he or will he not and what is your sense from where you look?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a great question, Lou.  And I worry I think it's a little bit of a jump ball right now.  I think the President, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo we're trying to do everything they can to use power in influence to stand up for the Venezuelan people in this new president Mr. Guaido.  And Maduro is a -- is a tin-pot dictator.  And you know they have a lot of power at the end of their reigns.  And we'll see if he's able to use that power.  But I'm hopeful that the right side will win out in Venezuela.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's a lot of hope running around this country right now primarily because President Trump is indeed the leader of the free world.  My question to you is why is the establishment in Washington D.C. not screaming for the arrest of Andrew McCabe and for all of his cohorts and the DOJ and the FBI?  Why is it that there seems to be almost a satisfaction in the status quo no matter how rancid and corrupt in the swamp that is D.C.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Look, I'm disgusted by it and I guess there's only one person who can do something about it and that's Bill Barr.  Is he either going to do this or he's not, and I'd be greatly disappointed if he doesn't.  And I think --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why the hell isn't the Republican Party's standing up and demanding his arrest?  Why --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You know why.</p><p>DOBBS:  I do not know why.  I would not be asking you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I think the reason is because they don't want the controversy of actually taking the deep state on because they might be coming its next victim.</p><p>DOBBS:  Then their doubtless wonders and why in the world should we tolerate these Koch brothers hired excuses for legislators and representatives.  They represent nothing but Koch brothers, the Wall Street, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber, they are -- it's enough to make you sick.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Lou, if that's where the Republican Party stays, it will deserve to lose beyond the ash heap of history.  We either going to represent the people or we're not and if we don't, we deserve to lose and we ought to get out of the way.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's very simple.  They either follow President Trump or they are going to be on the scrap heap of history.  The problem is they could take the Republican with them.  Matt, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Good to see you too.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the dark political agenda of the deep state, their efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald Trump -- that's right -- to overthrow the U.S. government.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Andrew McCabe, fired as acting director of the FBI last night on 60 Minutes confessed he was involved in an effort to remove well, President Trump from office and to overthrow the government of the United States.  Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton says McCabe, the Department of Justice and the FBI were trying to overthrow the government and this republic.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT JUDICIAL WATCH:  If there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt the media would be calling it a coup.  But because you've got an elected bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this, and if the target is President Trump, they don't care.  And Americans should realize this is how you can lose a republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Tomorrow night, Congressman Mark Green, David Bossie, and Attorney Harmeet Dhillon among our guests tomorrow.  We hope you'll join us.  Thanks for being with us tonight.  Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs.  And again, thanks for being with us.  Good night.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2183280011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9V-1SM1-JBHT-D34M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

This aversion is President Trump and his administration on full display this weekend as former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe actually confessed that he, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and a host of corrupt FBI and Department of Justice actors sought to unseat a sitting president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR:  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.  What I can say is the Deputy Attorney General was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confession.  Where is the outrage about their treason?  Where is the Republican Party and its leaders demanding they arrest McCabe and the rest of his cohorts who conspired to overthrow the President of the United States?  McCabe's admission of the coup attempted by the corrupt deep state went without as much a follow-up question by CBS.  Where is the national media?  Left-wing, though it may be, it in demanding answers, accountability, and transparency for this aversion and outright sedition?</p><p>Judicial watch President, Tom Fitton, Radio Show Host, Tammy Bruce among our guest here tonight to discuss those questions and their answers.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, over the weekend calling the United States embarrassing.  As globalist foreign leaders and the radical Dems applaud their approval of his careless and outrageous remarks on foreign soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents or turning their back on refugees on our border.  Americans know that's not right.  The American people understand, please, because it makes us embarrassing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Biden is the embarrassment.  What should be embarrassing to Biden is that he can't even garner the support of his former president, President Barack Obama.  Obama saying he will not endorse a Democrat for president even if Biden decides to run.  We take up Biden's embarrassing trip overseas.  Republican Strategist, Ed Rollins, Matt Schlapp joins us.  And President Trump today in Miami issuing his strong support for Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.</p><p>The President's message clear and definitive.  The United States will never be a socialist nation, we take up the President's address and much more here tonight.  Our top story, former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe confessed there was in fact a deep state conspiracy among his cohorts in the Justice Department and FBI to remove President Trump from office.  Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCCABE:  Counting votes, or possible vote.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The former acting FBI director told \"60 MINUTES\" the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein openly discussed how many cabinet members would support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President.  But the FBI's former general counsel, James Baker who met contemporaneously with McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page about their conversations with Rosenstein testified the effort went further.</p><p>\"I had the impression the Deputy Attorney General had already discussed this with two members in the President's cabinet.  And that they were on board with this concept already.\"    On Twitter the President responded to McCabe on \"60 MINUTES,\" \"While, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.  He and Rod Rosenstein look like they were planning a very illegal act.\"</p><p>McCabe and others say the President's May 2017 firing of Director James Comey left the FBI and Justice Department in turmoil.  And they concerned that the firing was designed to be synced the Russian probe and obstruct justice.</p><p>MCCABE:  The Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire into the White House.  He said, I never get search when I going to the White House.  I think the General Counsel had a heart attack.  When he got up off the floor he said, I -- that's a bridge too far.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  But Baker who could face criminal penalties for lying to Congressional investigators testified \"My recollection is that there were discussions about it over longer period than the course of one meeting, a couple of days.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  McCabe said Rosenstein initially resisted a Special Counsel because the Deputy Attorney General worried he might lose his job.  A senior department official told Fox tonight the Special Counsel was appointed \"to ensure that the Russia investigation was truly independent and without bias.\"  Something the official said that McCabe could not have accomplished.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Catherine, thanks very much.  Catherine Herridge.  Well, joining us tonight, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch.  One of the country's most effective watchdog groups.  And he's worked with the International Policy Forum, the Leadership Institute, Accuracy in Media, among others.  Tom, good to have you with us.  What we just heard from the folks at \"60 MINUTES\" over at CBS, although they didn't ask a follow-up question, it was an outright confession by McCabe that he was committing felonies and an attempt to overthrow the President of the United States along with a number of his colleagues.  Your reaction when you heard it?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Well, it's extraordinary.  It confirms early reports last year that this discussion took place.  You know, Lou, if there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt we'll be -- we'll be calling it a coup.  But because you got -- I don't like the bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this and it's -- the target is President Trump, they don't care.</p><p>And America should realize this is how you can lose a Republic where you have appointees of the President and bureaucrats to answer to virtually no one talk about manipulating the law in order to overturn a presidential election and attack a president they don't like.  They don't like for any substantial reason.  They don't like him because they fired -- he fired his buddy, McCabe's buddy and Rosenstein's buddy, James Comey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  At the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein, by the way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON:  Right.  A fight about a personnel decision.  And they're going to overthrow the presidency.  And, you know, let's be clear here, Mueller is a successor to this coup attempt.  He's -- the appointment flows out of all of these discussions and we should recognize that the effort to overthrow the President is continuing with Justice Department help through this out-of-control Mueller investigation.</p><p>DOBBS:  And without so much as -- and effort, explanation, rationalization, this is -- we're watching McCabe basically saying he was doing it for the country's own good.  Here's a man sworn to enforce the law, to enforce the constitution of the United States, to defend the United States committing subversions, in my opinion, sedition and treason.  And those who want to say that we're not at war should reference the war on terror that we've been engaged in for 19 -- almost 19 years.</p><p>This is outrageous and we haven't heard a word from the leadership of the Republican Party about arresting these people.  We haven't heard a word from the so-called establishment that is supposed to hold the tenants values of this -- of this great nation and primacy.  They are just simply averting their eyes.  It's appalling, it's disgusting, there should be outrage throughout the country in both parties across every part of this nation.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I agree.  And the problem with the Justice Department is that Mueller is still running the Justice Department effectively.  And so any effort to uncover what went on behind this investigation and this is what went on behind this investigation, runs into the Mueller juggernaut.  And, you know, Attorney General Barr, he needs to step up and defend the President.  You know, the argument for -- against Barr was will he stand up to President Trump?</p><p>And I think the test for Attorney General Barr is, will he stand up for President Trump and for the rule of law against these deep stators and the establishment who don't care about our constitution.  You know, President Trump may survive this attack on him but maybe another President want.  And we'll lose our Republic and we won't even know it came.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I guarantee he will survive these attacks.  He's already demonstrated that he is stronger than the entire lot of these extraordinary venal, vicious actors in the Justice Department.  What may not survive is his Justice Department and the FBI.  And Tom Fitton, should they survive?  Because they are the root of the corruption and the malignancy of the others wanted to subscribe to this administration.</p><p>When, in point of fact, they have been the perpetrators of wrongdoing from the months preceding the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p>FITTON:  Well, my -- you know, I'm a small government conservative.  I think all government agencies should be subject to scrutiny every year before any money is given to them.  And given the corruption at the DOJ, I think we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The problem with that is, the appropriators as well as the investigators are also deep state actors and have been working just as viciously, frankly, behind the scenes as the people in the Justice Department and the FBI.  My god.</p><p>FITTON:  You know, the problem with the FBI is the current leadership frankly, Mr. Ray has zero interest in reforming the organization.</p><p>DOBBS:  Where is he?</p><p>FITTON:  That's why --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, we don't even hear from him.</p><p>FITTON:  He is missing in action when it comes to standing and uncovering -- I -- uncovering the corruption and to a degree he said anything, Lou, he's been excusing the corruption.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Exactly.  Tom, it's always good to have you here.  I wish we're talking in better circumstances.  But, as you intimated at the outset, the Republic itself is at stake here.</p><p>FITTON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the silence is absolutely chilling.  Thank you so much, Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON:  Welcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  And again, as always, and I mean it even when I don't say, thanks for everything that you and Judicial Watch do.  Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome.  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, one of the most embarrassing figures in modern American political history.  Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken his anti- American message overseas embarrassing the United States in front of our allies and many of his former colleagues in the Obama administration.  It's a shadow government.  We'll take that up and more right after this quick break.  Ed Rollins joins me.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A New York Times report today saying former President Obama is counseling the Dems' 2020 hopefuls but he will not be giving the New York Times assures us, anyone, anyone, not even Joe Biden, his endorsement.  His former Vice President taking a page out of his old Obama playbook.  Apologizing for America overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents.  It makes us an embarrassing in the example we're setting.  Well, I should stop.  As my mother would say, this too shall pass.  We will be back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  I wouldn't bet on it.  In any way, shape, or fashion, at least not led by one Joe Biden.  He's just blown his chances for 2020 in all likelihood.  Biden, it seems forgot one important lesson from his former boss.  President Obama at least waited until he had been elected and was in office before slamming America overseas.  Well, joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst Ed Rollins.  Ed, great to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  What a day.  Let's start with Biden, he just blew it, didn't he?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he certainly did something outrageous than anybody I've ever known.  A former Vice President to go before this important meeting and condemn the America is just outrageous.  You often do that if you're a presidential candidate in Iowa, or (INAUDIBLE) New Hampshire or somewhere.  But to go before our allies and to basically take apart the administration's position is just outrageous.</p><p>DOBBS:  When President Obama did that, his famous apology tour in Berlin in Cairo, he had been elected.</p><p>ROLLINS:  He'd been elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, there was a chance to make things right in 2012.  Romney didn't make that happen.  I think Biden can just kiss it goodbye, personally.  I would like to turn to this extraordinary piece on \"60 MINUTES\" in which Andrew McCabe actually confessed to trying to overthrow the President of the United States, Ed.  And where's the outrage from the Republican leadership?  I mean, I think the whole country should be just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  I have to tell you, from when I sat and watched it last night I was outraged because there's a conspiracy going on.  First of all, the 25th Amendment is for a president to step aside if he has health issues or something else.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Or a Vice President to step in if the President is incapacitated.  It is not about removing a president from office.  And I think to a certain extent, you think the Justice Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  These guys were not only obviously corrupt, they were stupid beyond imagining for people who were supposedly trained in law and respectful of it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the fact that before this, any evidence that basically still plotting and scheming to take out a President of the United States and talking to members of the cabinet according to him with the full support of the acting attorney general, I just found it appalling.  It's so un-American, it's like --</p><p>DOBBS:  So, where is the Republican Party?  Why aren't the leaders of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, every republican governor, every Republican governor, every Republican in this country standing up and saying end the witch-hunt, end all of this non-sense, it's obviously a cabal that has been working and the conspiracy to overthrow the President of the United States or tacitly they are endorsing it with their silence.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, their silence is terrible.  The reality is we are in a fight of our life.  President Trump basically doing everything he promised to do, moving the ball forward.  But the Democrats are really revved up and they're going to do everything they can to stop him.  From lawsuits to what have you.  And they're not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in the land that will join this president on the basis of his declaration of a national emergency.  I -- we know then that the corruption has absolutely grasped our judiciary system as well.  We got every indication that that's happened.  But for them to enjoin a president in a matter of national security would be an act against the Republic, the constitution itself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you and I have been around long enough to know that's going to happen.  And at the end of the day it's going to end up being in the Supreme Court.  And the Supreme Court has to rule in the President's favor at the end of the day here.  But it's going to go through the process.  There's -- all of these political attorney generals and what have you who want to make (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS:  But honorable, honest and judges who are not overwhelmed by their partisan prejudice would understand that that it could be absolutely litigated in our judiciary.  Without enjoining until a decision by the high court.  That would be the honorable thing to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the absolute honoring thing to do.  And I would -- I would hope the Supreme Court is stepping very quickly if they started out this process.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  I worry about this court and what more -- the more that we learned about Chief Justice John Roberts, I'm not saying when about, what will or will not occur in that high court.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I'm hopeful in the end he will do the right thing.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Well, we can all hope.  But I'd rather have certainty.</p><p>ROLLINS:  In the end.  In the end.  There is no certainty -- there's no certainty in life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there isn't.  But in this constitution there should be absolute certainty.  Ed Rollins, thanks much.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  We appreciate it.  We'd like to hear your thoughts on all this.  Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Coming up here next, Chicago Police, they want answers from actor, Jussie Smollett after their investigation into an alleged hate crime reverses.  That and much more coming up next.  We'll be talking with Washington Times' Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Before we go to break, let's take a look at the U.S. national debt as if we don't have enough problems already.  $22 trillion and climbing.  We're coming right back after this.  Stay brave of heart, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump in Miami today for claiming the days of socialism in the western hemisphere are numbered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If you choose this path, you have the opportunity to help forge a safe and prosperous future for all of the people of Venezuela.  Or you can choose the second path, continuing to support Maduro.  If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out.  You will lose everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump also using his speech to continue to express his supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.  A reported hate crime in Chicago looking more and more like a hate hoax.  Chicago Police say they no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim.  And they are pushing for a follow-up interview which his attorney -- Smollett's attorneys have resisted.  The police request -- imagine that, a request comes amid new reports that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault.</p><p>Both men have been questioned and released without charges.  Reverend Al Sharpton, we want to point out, responding to the news.  And Sharpton saying Smollett should face as he put it, \"accountability to the maximum\" if it's found the actor stage the attack.  Joining us tonight, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times Columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Tammy, good to see you.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, everybody.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Smollett and the hoax.  I have to give Reverend Al Sharpton great credit for standing up which by the way all of the candidates who have been commenting on this, the Democratic candidates have not had the courage to do.  Your thoughts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  The candidates seem to be wanting to pretend this never happened.  They get away without law because then the media also steps away from it and stops discussing it.  But Reverend Al Sharpton of course is very well known for promoting one of the original hoaxes, if you will with a young woman named Tawana Brawley who made some accusations against police officers which ended up being false.</p><p>So it's fascinating that he would actually take that position.  So good for him if he has found, you know, the right direction.  And maybe -- I don't know, maybe he's thinking that Mr. Smollett deserves a program on MSNBC like he has.  Who knows what that end result should be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you brought that to us with a sense of appropriate justice.</p><p>BRUCE:  Absolutely.  Hanging every day, every day.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's turn to Venezuela, the President today importantly going to Miami as the setting to announce his views and judgment and policies on the hemisphere and Venezuela in particular.  Your thoughts?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Perfect of course.  We know for South Florida it has a lot of people who are immigrants who have experienced in our lifetimes very recently, the impact of totalitarianism and tyrants.  So when he --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Venezuelans by the way.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, Venezuelans and Cubans.  So when he's speaking it happens to be the right thing, of course it is the thing that the President believes in.  But it also speaks to the Venezuelans that are already in South Florida that are coming to South Florida but speaking to that core of people in this region that understand the importance of freedom, this nation, capitalism and the value of the support of the American Presidents.</p><p>And so it's going to make I think a big different for people there and sends a very strong message back home about what his intentions are.</p><p>DOBBS:  I think he had a couple of other audiences as well in mind as he spoke.  And one of this of course the American people when he said this country will never be socialist.  That was a loud straightforward challenge to everyone of the -- what seemed to be every one of the Democratic hopefuls so far.  At least announced, this is not going to be an easy campaign for you because you've already gone to the left and lined up against this country and our traditions.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  It's the first education they may be receiving about real life.  These are -- especially young people, Miss Ocasio-Cortez obviously seems to not have any major education about the impact of socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Or minor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Or a minor education on the nape on how it destroys lives, on how it destroys countries and economies.  So, this is going to be her first indication about courtesy of the President, about real life and what socialism does to people.</p><p>DOBBS:  This could be an expensive tutorial for AOC if it moves into, as it appears, it is about to, into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  This is -- it could be.  And she won't understand this, I think, until 2020.  The benefit of this education for the American people about what the Democratic Party is becoming, and how everybody is running on this kind of an issue.</p><p>The President stands as the bulwark against this framework and as a reminder about what -- how greatness really can be brought into our lives.  And it's not through certainly that totalitarianism by any stretch.</p><p>DOBBS:  And most to me, it's very encouraging to see the presidential tracking poll with the president's popularity.  I had approval rising at 52 percent.  I confess that I personally think it should be significantly higher, and I hope it soon will be.</p><p>BRUCE:  It probably is, as a matter of fact.  When you think about the --</p><p>DOBBS:  I'd like to see it expressed in black-and-white.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Like you, I have faith in the forgotten man and woman in this country.  But this president, I think now, has turned a very important corner.  I think the national left-wing media understands it.  It is beginning to understand it.  That's why they are not quite as free with their nonsense as they have been.</p><p>In other words, Jim Acosta is receding quite a bit, as his colleagues, I think, on the left, in that White House briefing room, for example, it's one of the barometers of this all.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's good news.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy, good to have you here.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Up next, British lawmakers say Facebook is acting like gangsters with our personal information.  We take that up.  Now, the Europeans are doing something about it.  Why in the world isn't the United States?  Isn't privacy an even bigger right for Americans?  We take that up with cyber expert, Morgan Wright.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.  Oh, Google, Facebook, gangsters.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Headlines tonight, Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, claims he has \"a lot of discretion on border wall funding from President Trump's national emergency declaration,\" despite receiving a direct order from the President of the United States to secure the border.</p><p>Shanahan says \"I'm not required to do anything.\"  Well, he'd be required to do something, one would think, like pack his bags and get out of there.  A North Carolina elections board, beginning deliberations over election fraud allegations, Republican Mark Harris leading in last month's ninth congressional district election.</p><p>The board consists of three Democrats, two Republicans, they will decide whether to certify a winner or order a new election, Harris, by the way, leading Democrat Dan McCready, by 905 votes, but again, the vote that may count as the 3-2 vote on the elections board.</p><p>A new report from the U.K. parliament, calling Facebook, digital gangsters, for failing to thwart attempts by Russia to influence elections, the report accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of contempt of parliament.</p><p>Joining me now, Morgan Wright, Former Senior Advisor in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, Former Law Enforcement Advisor to the Republican National Committee, Cyber Security Expert, Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, EXPERT, CYBERSECURITY:  Hey, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me start with, first, the gangsters that Facebook and Google.  Who knew that they were going to be declared gangsters first by the U.K., rather than the United States?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, I don't see Al Pacino playing Mark Zuckerberg in a movie, you know, about gangsters, but yes, you know.  And Lou, we've talked about this before about why is the -- why is the E.U. ahead of us with things like the General Data Protection Regulations, privacy?</p><p>And I'll tell you, the only thing I can think of as it comes down to money, because there's a -- Facebook has figured out the Google playbook, which is, spend a lot of money, spend a lot of time here in D.C., on K Street, M Street, whatever all the streets are, and you know, get in there and lobby people, spread lots of money around.</p><p>And Lou, during the hearings, how many members of Congress did we see ponder to Mark Zuckerberg, hoping to relocate shit jobs in their district.  I mean, this is one reason why you don't have it because everybody's hoping to get something from Zuckerberg.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and -- but it reinforces the impression.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  That a half dozen of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have such concentrated economic and technological and political power, that they are almost now so large that it is impossible to rein them in.  Is that fear well-placed?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  And I'll tell you, Lou, you and I talked about this awhile back too, when we talked about how globalism is killing patriotism.  And all of these companies have taken the advantage of the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) well guess what?</p><p>It's coming home to roost now, because now that these companies want to be global.  Your subject to the E.U. regulations, the U.K. regulations, you know, Germany's regulations, all of these other places that actually place a premium on privacy, for too long self-regulation, they've tried it, it hasn't worked.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is the self-regulation go away.  And you're going to see more government interventions starting overseas, and hopefully, it'll end up over here, not to put them out of business, but, man, we've got to put a check on the seemingly unchecked power that they have right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  There is no countervailing influence in our economy, or our society, or our body politic to the awesome power of big tech.  That's simply a fact, and to that, the power of Wall Street and Corporate America.</p><p>And right now, the middle class in this country, if they were not the champion, the President of the United States would be defenseless against an onslaught that had rolled back the middle class for 20 years, and which under this president, is once again, growing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.  And look, you know, something interesting that came out of the U.K. report too, is they talked about -- even though Zuckerberg, in front of Congress, and sent his minions over there to say we don' sell any data, it's clear they've been selling data.  It's true that they've been using apps to spy on the activities of users and their competitors.</p><p>Look, this is the modern version.</p><p>DOBBS:  And even those who are not users.</p><p>WRIGHT:  --have that power, right, absolutely.  And the KGB only wished they would've had this power back in the day.  You know, our NSA and FBI don't have near the power that Facebook, Google, Amazon.  You know, these folks have to spy into the lives of us, but there are no consequences for it.  At some point, there has to be stick because the carrot hasn't worked.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  This is a president who is keenly aware --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- that U.S. policies haven't worked.  He is also confronted now by ZTE, as a favor to President Xi.  He backed off of the consequences for ZTE, Huawei, now paying the consequences for its role in spying, but doing so, only within our court system, not as a result of a national security response from the part of the United States.</p><p>How much longer can we go without saying straightforwardly to the Chinese, there will be a response on national security terms if you continue to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from this country each year and carry out acts of espionage nonstop.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, I think Gordon Chang's been on with before he talked about poor Chinese economically, I think they need to put -- they need to put the hammer down on Huawei.  It's time to put Huawei and ZTE out of business.</p><p>And I'll tell you why, Lou, the upcoming 5G, Huawei is doing everything they can to get their technology into these countries, but you've Australia, New Zealand, Japan.  The U.K. said it's going to take, you know -- they probably going to have to spend five years and $2-$3 billion to meet the U.K. standards.</p><p>The best way to stop this economic espionage is to quit lulling the government of China to subsidize the rail system, the electronic system, the communication systems to where it's all Chinese infrastructure.  And there's no U.S. infrastructure in play.  We can't -- it's not a fair fight.</p><p>So, I think they've got to put the hammer down on these guys.  One of the ways to stop espionage is to keep their equipment out of our infrastructure.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the -- and the administration to its credit is trying to do exactly that.  Huawei, at the same time, is bragging they are now too big to stop.  And this is -- this again, is advised rhetoric from the PLA and from President Xi, himself.</p><p>The Communist Party is now flaunting their economic and political and military power.  The United States is -- has to simply respond, and hopefully, before it becomes a military response.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  But it looks as though we are absolutely vulnerable in cyberspace right now.  Is that a correct impression?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, absolutely.  Lou, we have -- from our power grid, to our nuclear plants, to you know -- the rail system transportation.  A lot of things are still so vulnerable because we're so fragmented.  We don't have --</p><p>Even though we might have an overall plan, we don't have an overall coherent ability to secure all the things we need to do, why, because the private sector owns 85 percent of the critical infrastructure that's out there.</p><p>The government can provide a lot of support, a lot of help, but were the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese?  And even the North Koreans are exploiting.  They're exploiting all of these gaps between the different infrastructures.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>WRIGHT:  The lack of coherence among the security plans.  And the old technology that's out there.  We've got out-of-date machines that are still running windows that haven't been supported for five or six years.</p><p>DOBBS:  What Morgan is not saying, that 85 percent that is in the private sector, is often run by CEOs and boards that are frankly, friendlier to Chinese policies than they are to the policies of the Trump administration and the U.S. government.  And that's got to change, straightaway.  I didn't put words in your mouth, did I, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Lou, you're always right.  That's one lesson I've learned.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, thanks so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you, Morgan Wright.</p><p>Up next, New York Governor Bill -- New York Mayor, Bill de Blasio says AOC doesn't know what she is talking about.  We take that up after the break with American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio putting freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her place after Amazon decided not to build its headquarters in Long Island City.  Cortez claimed the failed deal would free up $4 billion in taxes incentives for the city to use elsewhere.  The good mayor reminded her even a socialist understood this, at least one of the socialists did, reminding her the money would only be available after the city secured the Amazon jobs and revenue and that it wasn't in a budget somewhere.</p><p>Radical freshman congresswoman, there's a lot of those going around.  Ilhan Omar scheduled to raise money in March for the Hamas link council on American-Islamic relations.  Omar received $5,000 from them during a run for Congress.  She since repeatedly made headlines for her anti-Semitic remarks most recently suggesting Republican support of Israel is bought and paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC.  At some point anti-Semitic remarks result in being anti -- an anti-Semite it seems.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Matt Schlapp.  He's the chairman of the American Conservative Union.  Why is it that the Left is suddenly so reluctant to say what is obvious that they have an anti-Semitic strain within their party and on Capitol Hill and aren't dealing with it?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, I completely agree with you, Lou, but I asked -- I actually think it's more cynical than this.  I think the Democratic Party has really shed its longtime support of the State of Israel.  I think they're moving away from this policy point of view and I think it gives Donald Trump who has done everything he said he would do with getting rid of the Iran deal, moving the embassy a great chance with these voters not with the not with the Liberal leaders potentially of this community but with everyday voters who can see anti-Semitism when it's so clear.</p><p>DOBBS:  Anti-Semitism, we saw reports today that the yellow vest in France you know, blaming them for a strain of anti-Semitism within France leaving out the entire ruling body and class in France that -- I mean there's anti-Semitism has been a huge issue in France.  It is not only anti-Israel, it is pro-Palestinian, and the expression is found throughout the political structure of France.  This looks like another gambit to lay off blame for what is a strengthening strain of anti-Semitism in France and indeed Europe.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.  And look, I think what's happening -- what's ironic, Lou, is what's happening in Israel is this once socialist country has really been embracing free markets and innovation and really has become a kindred soul in one of our closest allies to obviously to America and to our way of life into our values.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people that just hate everything about the idea of innovation of entrepreneurs or free markets of the little guy being able to go to market and take his ideas to the customers.  And they are against every aspect of that and I love the fact that Israel in America and freedom-loving people including the people of South America, including the freedom lovers in Venezuela.  We're working together to rid the world of this dreaded socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dreaded socialism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism and that really what I was asking you about.  Socialism is as the President assured is this country will never be socialistic.  What is in question tonight is whether or not one guy you know, is going to be the successor to Maduro.  Will he or will he not and what is your sense from where you look?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a great question, Lou.  And I worry I think it's a little bit of a jump ball right now.  I think the President, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo we're trying to do everything they can to use power in influence to stand up for the Venezuelan people in this new president Mr. Guaido.  And Maduro is a -- is a tin-pot dictator.  And you know they have a lot of power at the end of their reigns.  And we'll see if he's able to use that power.  But I'm hopeful that the right side will win out in Venezuela.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's a lot of hope running around this country right now primarily because President Trump is indeed the leader of the free world.  My question to you is why is the establishment in Washington D.C. not screaming for the arrest of Andrew McCabe and for all of his cohorts and the DOJ and the FBI?  Why is it that there seems to be almost a satisfaction in the status quo no matter how rancid and corrupt in the swamp that is D.C.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Look, I'm disgusted by it and I guess there's only one person who can do something about it and that's Bill Barr.  Is he either going to do this or he's not, and I'd be greatly disappointed if he doesn't.  And I think --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why the hell isn't the Republican Party's standing up and demanding his arrest?  Why --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You know why.</p><p>DOBBS:  I do not know why.  I would not be asking you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I think the reason is because they don't want the controversy of actually taking the deep state on because they might be coming its next victim.</p><p>DOBBS:  Then their doubtless wonders and why in the world should we tolerate these Koch brothers hired excuses for legislators and representatives.  They represent nothing but Koch brothers, the Wall Street, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber, they are -- it's enough to make you sick.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Lou, if that's where the Republican Party stays, it will deserve to lose beyond the ash heap of history.  We either going to represent the people or we're not and if we don't, we deserve to lose and we ought to get out of the way.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's very simple.  They either follow President Trump or they are going to be on the scrap heap of history.  The problem is they could take the Republican with them.  Matt, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Good to see you too.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the dark political agenda of the deep state, their efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald Trump -- that's right -- to overthrow the U.S. government.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Andrew McCabe, fired as acting director of the FBI last night on 60 Minutes confessed he was involved in an effort to remove well, President Trump from office and to overthrow the government of the United States.  Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton says McCabe, the Department of Justice and the FBI were trying to overthrow the government and this republic.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT JUDICIAL WATCH:  If there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt the media would be calling it a coup.  But because you've got an elected bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this, and if the target is President Trump, they don't care.  And Americans should realize this is how you can lose a republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Tomorrow night, Congressman Mark Green, David Bossie, and Attorney Harmeet Dhillon among our guests tomorrow.  We hope you'll join us.  Thanks for being with us tonight.  Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs.  And again, thanks for being with us.  Good night.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2183280215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9Y-5J11-DY0W-42WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

This aversion is President Trump and his administration on full display this weekend as former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe actually confessed that he, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and a host of corrupt FBI and Department of Justice actors sought to unseat a sitting president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR:  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.  What I can say is the Deputy Attorney General was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confession.  Where is the outrage about their treason?  Where is the Republican Party and its leaders demanding they arrest McCabe and the rest of his cohorts who conspired to overthrow the President of the United States?  McCabe's admission of the coup attempted by the corrupt deep state went without as much a follow-up question by CBS.  Where is the national media?  Left-wing, though it may be, it in demanding answers, accountability, and transparency for this aversion and outright sedition?</p><p>Judicial watch President, Tom Fitton, Radio Show Host, Tammy Bruce among our guest here tonight to discuss those questions and their answers.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, over the weekend calling the United States embarrassing.  As globalist foreign leaders and the radical Dems applaud their approval of his careless and outrageous remarks on foreign soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents or turning their back on refugees on our border.  Americans know that's not right.  The American people understand, please, because it makes us embarrassing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Biden is the embarrassment.  What should be embarrassing to Biden is that he can't even garner the support of his former president, President Barack Obama.  Obama saying he will not endorse a Democrat for president even if Biden decides to run.  We take up Biden's embarrassing trip overseas.  Republican Strategist, Ed Rollins, Matt Schlapp joins us.  And President Trump today in Miami issuing his strong support for Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.</p><p>The President's message clear and definitive.  The United States will never be a socialist nation, we take up the President's address and much more here tonight.  Our top story, former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe confessed there was in fact a deep state conspiracy among his cohorts in the Justice Department and FBI to remove President Trump from office.  Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCCABE:  Counting votes, or possible vote.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The former acting FBI director told \"60 MINUTES\" the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein openly discussed how many cabinet members would support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President.  But the FBI's former general counsel, James Baker who met contemporaneously with McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page about their conversations with Rosenstein testified the effort went further.</p><p>\"I had the impression the Deputy Attorney General had already discussed this with two members in the President's cabinet.  And that they were on board with this concept already.\"    On Twitter the President responded to McCabe on \"60 MINUTES,\" \"While, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.  He and Rod Rosenstein look like they were planning a very illegal act.\"</p><p>McCabe and others say the President's May 2017 firing of Director James Comey left the FBI and Justice Department in turmoil.  And they concerned that the firing was designed to be synced the Russian probe and obstruct justice.</p><p>MCCABE:  The Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire into the White House.  He said, I never get search when I going to the White House.  I think the General Counsel had a heart attack.  When he got up off the floor he said, I -- that's a bridge too far.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  But Baker who could face criminal penalties for lying to Congressional investigators testified \"My recollection is that there were discussions about it over longer period than the course of one meeting, a couple of days.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  McCabe said Rosenstein initially resisted a Special Counsel because the Deputy Attorney General worried he might lose his job.  A senior department official told Fox tonight the Special Counsel was appointed \"to ensure that the Russia investigation was truly independent and without bias.\"  Something the official said that McCabe could not have accomplished.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Catherine, thanks very much.  Catherine Herridge.  Well, joining us tonight, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch.  One of the country's most effective watchdog groups.  And he's worked with the International Policy Forum, the Leadership Institute, Accuracy in Media, among others.  Tom, good to have you with us.  What we just heard from the folks at \"60 MINUTES\" over at CBS, although they didn't ask a follow-up question, it was an outright confession by McCabe that he was committing felonies and an attempt to overthrow the President of the United States along with a number of his colleagues.  Your reaction when you heard it?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Well, it's extraordinary.  It confirms early reports last year that this discussion took place.  You know, Lou, if there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt we'll be -- we'll be calling it a coup.  But because you got -- I don't like the bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this and it's -- the target is President Trump, they don't care.</p><p>And America should realize this is how you can lose a Republic where you have appointees of the President and bureaucrats to answer to virtually no one talk about manipulating the law in order to overturn a presidential election and attack a president they don't like.  They don't like for any substantial reason.  They don't like him because they fired -- he fired his buddy, McCabe's buddy and Rosenstein's buddy, James Comey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  At the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein, by the way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON:  Right.  A fight about a personnel decision.  And they're going to overthrow the presidency.  And, you know, let's be clear here, Mueller is a successor to this coup attempt.  He's -- the appointment flows out of all of these discussions and we should recognize that the effort to overthrow the President is continuing with Justice Department help through this out-of-control Mueller investigation.</p><p>DOBBS:  And without so much as -- and effort, explanation, rationalization, this is -- we're watching McCabe basically saying he was doing it for the country's own good.  Here's a man sworn to enforce the law, to enforce the constitution of the United States, to defend the United States committing subversions, in my opinion, sedition and treason.  And those who want to say that we're not at war should reference the war on terror that we've been engaged in for 19 -- almost 19 years.</p><p>This is outrageous and we haven't heard a word from the leadership of the Republican Party about arresting these people.  We haven't heard a word from the so-called establishment that is supposed to hold the tenants values of this -- of this great nation and primacy.  They are just simply averting their eyes.  It's appalling, it's disgusting, there should be outrage throughout the country in both parties across every part of this nation.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I agree.  And the problem with the Justice Department is that Mueller is still running the Justice Department effectively.  And so any effort to uncover what went on behind this investigation and this is what went on behind this investigation, runs into the Mueller juggernaut.  And, you know, Attorney General Barr, he needs to step up and defend the President.  You know, the argument for -- against Barr was will he stand up to President Trump?</p><p>And I think the test for Attorney General Barr is, will he stand up for President Trump and for the rule of law against these deep stators and the establishment who don't care about our constitution.  You know, President Trump may survive this attack on him but maybe another President want.  And we'll lose our Republic and we won't even know it came.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I guarantee he will survive these attacks.  He's already demonstrated that he is stronger than the entire lot of these extraordinary venal, vicious actors in the Justice Department.  What may not survive is his Justice Department and the FBI.  And Tom Fitton, should they survive?  Because they are the root of the corruption and the malignancy of the others wanted to subscribe to this administration.</p><p>When, in point of fact, they have been the perpetrators of wrongdoing from the months preceding the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p>FITTON:  Well, my -- you know, I'm a small government conservative.  I think all government agencies should be subject to scrutiny every year before any money is given to them.  And given the corruption at the DOJ, I think we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The problem with that is, the appropriators as well as the investigators are also deep state actors and have been working just as viciously, frankly, behind the scenes as the people in the Justice Department and the FBI.  My god.</p><p>FITTON:  You know, the problem with the FBI is the current leadership frankly, Mr. Ray has zero interest in reforming the organization.</p><p>DOBBS:  Where is he?</p><p>FITTON:  That's why --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, we don't even hear from him.</p><p>FITTON:  He is missing in action when it comes to standing and uncovering -- I -- uncovering the corruption and to a degree he said anything, Lou, he's been excusing the corruption.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Exactly.  Tom, it's always good to have you here.  I wish we're talking in better circumstances.  But, as you intimated at the outset, the Republic itself is at stake here.</p><p>FITTON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the silence is absolutely chilling.  Thank you so much, Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON:  Welcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  And again, as always, and I mean it even when I don't say, thanks for everything that you and Judicial Watch do.  Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome.  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, one of the most embarrassing figures in modern American political history.  Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken his anti- American message overseas embarrassing the United States in front of our allies and many of his former colleagues in the Obama administration.  It's a shadow government.  We'll take that up and more right after this quick break.  Ed Rollins joins me.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A New York Times report today saying former President Obama is counseling the Dems' 2020 hopefuls but he will not be giving the New York Times assures us, anyone, anyone, not even Joe Biden, his endorsement.  His former Vice President taking a page out of his old Obama playbook.  Apologizing for America overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents.  It makes us an embarrassing in the example we're setting.  Well, I should stop.  As my mother would say, this too shall pass.  We will be back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  I wouldn't bet on it.  In any way, shape, or fashion, at least not led by one Joe Biden.  He's just blown his chances for 2020 in all likelihood.  Biden, it seems forgot one important lesson from his former boss.  President Obama at least waited until he had been elected and was in office before slamming America overseas.  Well, joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst Ed Rollins.  Ed, great to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  What a day.  Let's start with Biden, he just blew it, didn't he?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he certainly did something outrageous than anybody I've ever known.  A former Vice President to go before this important meeting and condemn the America is just outrageous.  You often do that if you're a presidential candidate in Iowa, or (INAUDIBLE) New Hampshire or somewhere.  But to go before our allies and to basically take apart the administration's position is just outrageous.</p><p>DOBBS:  When President Obama did that, his famous apology tour in Berlin in Cairo, he had been elected.</p><p>ROLLINS:  He'd been elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, there was a chance to make things right in 2012.  Romney didn't make that happen.  I think Biden can just kiss it goodbye, personally.  I would like to turn to this extraordinary piece on \"60 MINUTES\" in which Andrew McCabe actually confessed to trying to overthrow the President of the United States, Ed.  And where's the outrage from the Republican leadership?  I mean, I think the whole country should be just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  I have to tell you, from when I sat and watched it last night I was outraged because there's a conspiracy going on.  First of all, the 25th Amendment is for a president to step aside if he has health issues or something else.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Or a Vice President to step in if the President is incapacitated.  It is not about removing a president from office.  And I think to a certain extent, you think the Justice Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  These guys were not only obviously corrupt, they were stupid beyond imagining for people who were supposedly trained in law and respectful of it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the fact that before this, any evidence that basically still plotting and scheming to take out a President of the United States and talking to members of the cabinet according to him with the full support of the acting attorney general, I just found it appalling.  It's so un-American, it's like --</p><p>DOBBS:  So, where is the Republican Party?  Why aren't the leaders of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, every republican governor, every Republican governor, every Republican in this country standing up and saying end the witch-hunt, end all of this non-sense, it's obviously a cabal that has been working and the conspiracy to overthrow the President of the United States or tacitly they are endorsing it with their silence.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, their silence is terrible.  The reality is we are in a fight of our life.  President Trump basically doing everything he promised to do, moving the ball forward.  But the Democrats are really revved up and they're going to do everything they can to stop him.  From lawsuits to what have you.  And they're not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in the land that will join this president on the basis of his declaration of a national emergency.  I -- we know then that the corruption has absolutely grasped our judiciary system as well.  We got every indication that that's happened.  But for them to enjoin a president in a matter of national security would be an act against the Republic, the constitution itself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you and I have been around long enough to know that's going to happen.  And at the end of the day it's going to end up being in the Supreme Court.  And the Supreme Court has to rule in the President's favor at the end of the day here.  But it's going to go through the process.  There's -- all of these political attorney generals and what have you who want to make (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS:  But honorable, honest and judges who are not overwhelmed by their partisan prejudice would understand that that it could be absolutely litigated in our judiciary.  Without enjoining until a decision by the high court.  That would be the honorable thing to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the absolute honoring thing to do.  And I would -- I would hope the Supreme Court is stepping very quickly if they started out this process.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  I worry about this court and what more -- the more that we learned about Chief Justice John Roberts, I'm not saying when about, what will or will not occur in that high court.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I'm hopeful in the end he will do the right thing.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Well, we can all hope.  But I'd rather have certainty.</p><p>ROLLINS:  In the end.  In the end.  There is no certainty -- there's no certainty in life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there isn't.  But in this constitution there should be absolute certainty.  Ed Rollins, thanks much.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  We appreciate it.  We'd like to hear your thoughts on all this.  Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Coming up here next, Chicago Police, they want answers from actor, Jussie Smollett after their investigation into an alleged hate crime reverses.  That and much more coming up next.  We'll be talking with Washington Times' Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Before we go to break, let's take a look at the U.S. national debt as if we don't have enough problems already.  $22 trillion and climbing.  We're coming right back after this.  Stay brave of heart, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump in Miami today for claiming the days of socialism in the western hemisphere are numbered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If you choose this path, you have the opportunity to help forge a safe and prosperous future for all of the people of Venezuela.  Or you can choose the second path, continuing to support Maduro.  If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out.  You will lose everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump also using his speech to continue to express his supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.  A reported hate crime in Chicago looking more and more like a hate hoax.  Chicago Police say they no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim.  And they are pushing for a follow-up interview which his attorney -- Smollett's attorneys have resisted.  The police request -- imagine that, a request comes amid new reports that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault.</p><p>Both men have been questioned and released without charges.  Reverend Al Sharpton, we want to point out, responding to the news.  And Sharpton saying Smollett should face as he put it, \"accountability to the maximum\" if it's found the actor stage the attack.  Joining us tonight, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times Columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Tammy, good to see you.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, everybody.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Smollett and the hoax.  I have to give Reverend Al Sharpton great credit for standing up which by the way all of the candidates who have been commenting on this, the Democratic candidates have not had the courage to do.  Your thoughts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  The candidates seem to be wanting to pretend this never happened.  They get away without law because then the media also steps away from it and stops discussing it.  But Reverend Al Sharpton of course is very well known for promoting one of the original hoaxes, if you will with a young woman named Tawana Brawley who made some accusations against police officers which ended up being false.</p><p>So it's fascinating that he would actually take that position.  So good for him if he has found, you know, the right direction.  And maybe -- I don't know, maybe he's thinking that Mr. Smollett deserves a program on MSNBC like he has.  Who knows what that end result should be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you brought that to us with a sense of appropriate justice.</p><p>BRUCE:  Absolutely.  Hanging every day, every day.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's turn to Venezuela, the President today importantly going to Miami as the setting to announce his views and judgment and policies on the hemisphere and Venezuela in particular.  Your thoughts?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Perfect of course.  We know for South Florida it has a lot of people who are immigrants who have experienced in our lifetimes very recently, the impact of totalitarianism and tyrants.  So when he --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Venezuelans by the way.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, Venezuelans and Cubans.  So when he's speaking it happens to be the right thing, of course it is the thing that the President believes in.  But it also speaks to the Venezuelans that are already in South Florida that are coming to South Florida but speaking to that core of people in this region that understand the importance of freedom, this nation, capitalism and the value of the support of the American Presidents.</p><p>And so it's going to make I think a big different for people there and sends a very strong message back home about what his intentions are.</p><p>DOBBS:  I think he had a couple of other audiences as well in mind as he spoke.  And one of this of course the American people when he said this country will never be socialist.  That was a loud straightforward challenge to everyone of the -- what seemed to be every one of the Democratic hopefuls so far.  At least announced, this is not going to be an easy campaign for you because you've already gone to the left and lined up against this country and our traditions.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  It's the first education they may be receiving about real life.  These are -- especially young people, Miss Ocasio-Cortez obviously seems to not have any major education about the impact of socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Or minor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Or a minor education on the nape on how it destroys lives, on how it destroys countries and economies.  So, this is going to be her first indication about courtesy of the President, about real life and what socialism does to people.</p><p>DOBBS:  This could be an expensive tutorial for AOC if it moves into, as it appears, it is about to, into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  This is -- it could be.  And she won't understand this, I think, until 2020.  The benefit of this education for the American people about what the Democratic Party is becoming, and how everybody is running on this kind of an issue.</p><p>The President stands as the bulwark against this framework and as a reminder about what -- how greatness really can be brought into our lives.  And it's not through certainly that totalitarianism by any stretch.</p><p>DOBBS:  And most to me, it's very encouraging to see the presidential tracking poll with the president's popularity.  I had approval rising at 52 percent.  I confess that I personally think it should be significantly higher, and I hope it soon will be.</p><p>BRUCE:  It probably is, as a matter of fact.  When you think about the --</p><p>DOBBS:  I'd like to see it expressed in black-and-white.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Like you, I have faith in the forgotten man and woman in this country.  But this president, I think now, has turned a very important corner.  I think the national left-wing media understands it.  It is beginning to understand it.  That's why they are not quite as free with their nonsense as they have been.</p><p>In other words, Jim Acosta is receding quite a bit, as his colleagues, I think, on the left, in that White House briefing room, for example, it's one of the barometers of this all.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's good news.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy, good to have you here.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Up next, British lawmakers say Facebook is acting like gangsters with our personal information.  We take that up.  Now, the Europeans are doing something about it.  Why in the world isn't the United States?  Isn't privacy an even bigger right for Americans?  We take that up with cyber expert, Morgan Wright.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.  Oh, Google, Facebook, gangsters.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Headlines tonight, Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, claims he has \"a lot of discretion on border wall funding from President Trump's national emergency declaration,\" despite receiving a direct order from the President of the United States to secure the border.</p><p>Shanahan says \"I'm not required to do anything.\"  Well, he'd be required to do something, one would think, like pack his bags and get out of there.  A North Carolina elections board, beginning deliberations over election fraud allegations, Republican Mark Harris leading in last month's ninth congressional district election.</p><p>The board consists of three Democrats, two Republicans, they will decide whether to certify a winner or order a new election, Harris, by the way, leading Democrat Dan McCready, by 905 votes, but again, the vote that may count as the 3-2 vote on the elections board.</p><p>A new report from the U.K. parliament, calling Facebook, digital gangsters, for failing to thwart attempts by Russia to influence elections, the report accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of contempt of parliament.</p><p>Joining me now, Morgan Wright, Former Senior Advisor in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, Former Law Enforcement Advisor to the Republican National Committee, Cyber Security Expert, Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, EXPERT, CYBERSECURITY:  Hey, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me start with, first, the gangsters that Facebook and Google.  Who knew that they were going to be declared gangsters first by the U.K., rather than the United States?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, I don't see Al Pacino playing Mark Zuckerberg in a movie, you know, about gangsters, but yes, you know.  And Lou, we've talked about this before about why is the -- why is the E.U. ahead of us with things like the General Data Protection Regulations, privacy?</p><p>And I'll tell you, the only thing I can think of as it comes down to money, because there's a -- Facebook has figured out the Google playbook, which is, spend a lot of money, spend a lot of time here in D.C., on K Street, M Street, whatever all the streets are, and you know, get in there and lobby people, spread lots of money around.</p><p>And Lou, during the hearings, how many members of Congress did we see ponder to Mark Zuckerberg, hoping to relocate shit jobs in their district.  I mean, this is one reason why you don't have it because everybody's hoping to get something from Zuckerberg.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and -- but it reinforces the impression.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  That a half dozen of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have such concentrated economic and technological and political power, that they are almost now so large that it is impossible to rein them in.  Is that fear well-placed?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  And I'll tell you, Lou, you and I talked about this awhile back too, when we talked about how globalism is killing patriotism.  And all of these companies have taken the advantage of the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) well guess what?</p><p>It's coming home to roost now, because now that these companies want to be global.  Your subject to the E.U. regulations, the U.K. regulations, you know, Germany's regulations, all of these other places that actually place a premium on privacy, for too long self-regulation, they've tried it, it hasn't worked.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is the self-regulation go away.  And you're going to see more government interventions starting overseas, and hopefully, it'll end up over here, not to put them out of business, but, man, we've got to put a check on the seemingly unchecked power that they have right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  There is no countervailing influence in our economy, or our society, or our body politic to the awesome power of big tech.  That's simply a fact, and to that, the power of Wall Street and Corporate America.</p><p>And right now, the middle class in this country, if they were not the champion, the President of the United States would be defenseless against an onslaught that had rolled back the middle class for 20 years, and which under this president, is once again, growing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.  And look, you know, something interesting that came out of the U.K. report too, is they talked about -- even though Zuckerberg, in front of Congress, and sent his minions over there to say we don' sell any data, it's clear they've been selling data.  It's true that they've been using apps to spy on the activities of users and their competitors.</p><p>Look, this is the modern version.</p><p>DOBBS:  And even those who are not users.</p><p>WRIGHT:  --have that power, right, absolutely.  And the KGB only wished they would've had this power back in the day.  You know, our NSA and FBI don't have near the power that Facebook, Google, Amazon.  You know, these folks have to spy into the lives of us, but there are no consequences for it.  At some point, there has to be stick because the carrot hasn't worked.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  This is a president who is keenly aware --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- that U.S. policies haven't worked.  He is also confronted now by ZTE, as a favor to President Xi.  He backed off of the consequences for ZTE, Huawei, now paying the consequences for its role in spying, but doing so, only within our court system, not as a result of a national security response from the part of the United States.</p><p>How much longer can we go without saying straightforwardly to the Chinese, there will be a response on national security terms if you continue to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from this country each year and carry out acts of espionage nonstop.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, I think Gordon Chang's been on with before he talked about poor Chinese economically, I think they need to put -- they need to put the hammer down on Huawei.  It's time to put Huawei and ZTE out of business.</p><p>And I'll tell you why, Lou, the upcoming 5G, Huawei is doing everything they can to get their technology into these countries, but you've Australia, New Zealand, Japan.  The U.K. said it's going to take, you know -- they probably going to have to spend five years and $2-$3 billion to meet the U.K. standards.</p><p>The best way to stop this economic espionage is to quit lulling the government of China to subsidize the rail system, the electronic system, the communication systems to where it's all Chinese infrastructure.  And there's no U.S. infrastructure in play.  We can't -- it's not a fair fight.</p><p>So, I think they've got to put the hammer down on these guys.  One of the ways to stop espionage is to keep their equipment out of our infrastructure.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the -- and the administration to its credit is trying to do exactly that.  Huawei, at the same time, is bragging they are now too big to stop.  And this is -- this again, is advised rhetoric from the PLA and from President Xi, himself.</p><p>The Communist Party is now flaunting their economic and political and military power.  The United States is -- has to simply respond, and hopefully, before it becomes a military response.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  But it looks as though we are absolutely vulnerable in cyberspace right now.  Is that a correct impression?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, absolutely.  Lou, we have -- from our power grid, to our nuclear plants, to you know -- the rail system transportation.  A lot of things are still so vulnerable because we're so fragmented.  We don't have --</p><p>Even though we might have an overall plan, we don't have an overall coherent ability to secure all the things we need to do, why, because the private sector owns 85 percent of the critical infrastructure that's out there.</p><p>The government can provide a lot of support, a lot of help, but were the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese?  And even the North Koreans are exploiting.  They're exploiting all of these gaps between the different infrastructures.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>WRIGHT:  The lack of coherence among the security plans.  And the old technology that's out there.  We've got out-of-date machines that are still running windows that haven't been supported for five or six years.</p><p>DOBBS:  What Morgan is not saying, that 85 percent that is in the private sector, is often run by CEOs and boards that are frankly, friendlier to Chinese policies than they are to the policies of the Trump administration and the U.S. government.  And that's got to change, straightaway.  I didn't put words in your mouth, did I, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Lou, you're always right.  That's one lesson I've learned.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, thanks so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you, Morgan Wright.</p><p>Up next, New York Governor Bill -- New York Mayor, Bill de Blasio says AOC doesn't know what she is talking about.  We take that up after the break with American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio putting freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her place after Amazon decided not to build its headquarters in Long Island City.  Cortez claimed the failed deal would free up $4 billion in taxes incentives for the city to use elsewhere.  The good mayor reminded her even a socialist understood this, at least one of the socialists did, reminding her the money would only be available after the city secured the Amazon jobs and revenue and that it wasn't in a budget somewhere.</p><p>Radical freshman congresswoman, there's a lot of those going around.  Ilhan Omar scheduled to raise money in March for the Hamas link council on American-Islamic relations.  Omar received $5,000 from them during a run for Congress.  She since repeatedly made headlines for her anti-Semitic remarks most recently suggesting Republican support of Israel is bought and paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC.  At some point anti-Semitic remarks result in being anti -- an anti-Semite it seems.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Matt Schlapp.  He's the chairman of the American Conservative Union.  Why is it that the Left is suddenly so reluctant to say what is obvious that they have an anti-Semitic strain within their party and on Capitol Hill and aren't dealing with it?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, I completely agree with you, Lou, but I asked -- I actually think it's more cynical than this.  I think the Democratic Party has really shed its longtime support of the State of Israel.  I think they're moving away from this policy point of view and I think it gives Donald Trump who has done everything he said he would do with getting rid of the Iran deal, moving the embassy a great chance with these voters not with the not with the Liberal leaders potentially of this community but with everyday voters who can see anti-Semitism when it's so clear.</p><p>DOBBS:  Anti-Semitism, we saw reports today that the yellow vest in France you know, blaming them for a strain of anti-Semitism within France leaving out the entire ruling body and class in France that -- I mean there's anti-Semitism has been a huge issue in France.  It is not only anti-Israel, it is pro-Palestinian, and the expression is found throughout the political structure of France.  This looks like another gambit to lay off blame for what is a strengthening strain of anti-Semitism in France and indeed Europe.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.  And look, I think what's happening -- what's ironic, Lou, is what's happening in Israel is this once socialist country has really been embracing free markets and innovation and really has become a kindred soul in one of our closest allies to obviously to America and to our way of life into our values.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people that just hate everything about the idea of innovation of entrepreneurs or free markets of the little guy being able to go to market and take his ideas to the customers.  And they are against every aspect of that and I love the fact that Israel in America and freedom-loving people including the people of South America, including the freedom lovers in Venezuela.  We're working together to rid the world of this dreaded socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dreaded socialism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism and that really what I was asking you about.  Socialism is as the President assured is this country will never be socialistic.  What is in question tonight is whether or not one guy you know, is going to be the successor to Maduro.  Will he or will he not and what is your sense from where you look?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a great question, Lou.  And I worry I think it's a little bit of a jump ball right now.  I think the President, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo we're trying to do everything they can to use power in influence to stand up for the Venezuelan people in this new president Mr. Guaido.  And Maduro is a -- is a tin-pot dictator.  And you know they have a lot of power at the end of their reigns.  And we'll see if he's able to use that power.  But I'm hopeful that the right side will win out in Venezuela.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's a lot of hope running around this country right now primarily because President Trump is indeed the leader of the free world.  My question to you is why is the establishment in Washington D.C. not screaming for the arrest of Andrew McCabe and for all of his cohorts and the DOJ and the FBI?  Why is it that there seems to be almost a satisfaction in the status quo no matter how rancid and corrupt in the swamp that is D.C.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Look, I'm disgusted by it and I guess there's only one person who can do something about it and that's Bill Barr.  Is he either going to do this or he's not, and I'd be greatly disappointed if he doesn't.  And I think --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why the hell isn't the Republican Party's standing up and demanding his arrest?  Why --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You know why.</p><p>DOBBS:  I do not know why.  I would not be asking you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I think the reason is because they don't want the controversy of actually taking the deep state on because they might be coming its next victim.</p><p>DOBBS:  Then their doubtless wonders and why in the world should we tolerate these Koch brothers hired excuses for legislators and representatives.  They represent nothing but Koch brothers, the Wall Street, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber, they are -- it's enough to make you sick.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Lou, if that's where the Republican Party stays, it will deserve to lose beyond the ash heap of history.  We either going to represent the people or we're not and if we don't, we deserve to lose and we ought to get out of the way.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's very simple.  They either follow President Trump or they are going to be on the scrap heap of history.  The problem is they could take the Republican with them.  Matt, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Good to see you too.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the dark political agenda of the deep state, their efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald Trump -- that's right -- to overthrow the U.S. government.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Andrew McCabe, fired as acting director of the FBI last night on 60 Minutes confessed he was involved in an effort to remove well, President Trump from office and to overthrow the government of the United States.  Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton says McCabe, the Department of Justice and the FBI were trying to overthrow the government and this republic.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT JUDICIAL WATCH:  If there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt the media would be calling it a coup.  But because you've got an elected bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this, and if the target is President Trump, they don't care.  And Americans should realize this is how you can lose a republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Tomorrow night, Congressman Mark Green, David Bossie, and Attorney Harmeet Dhillon among our guests tomorrow.  We hope you'll join us.  Thanks for being with us tonight.  Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs.  And again, thanks for being with us.  Good night.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2183277937</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8B-GB61-DY0W-4276-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

This aversion is President Trump and his administration on full display this weekend as former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe actually confessed that he, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and a host of corrupt FBI and Department of Justice actors sought to unseat a sitting president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR:  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.  What I can say is the Deputy Attorney General was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confession.  Where is the outrage about their treason?  Where is the Republican Party and its leaders demanding they arrest McCabe and the rest of his cohorts who conspired to overthrow the President of the United States?  McCabe's admission of the coup attempted by the corrupt deep state went without as much a follow-up question by CBS.  Where is the national media?  Left-wing, though it may be, it in demanding answers, accountability, and transparency for this aversion and outright sedition?</p><p>Judicial watch President, Tom Fitton, Radio Show Host, Tammy Bruce among our guest here tonight to discuss those questions and their answers.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, over the weekend calling the United States embarrassing.  As globalist foreign leaders and the radical Dems applaud their approval of his careless and outrageous remarks on foreign soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents or turning their back on refugees on our border.  Americans know that's not right.  The American people understand, please, because it makes us embarrassing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Biden is the embarrassment.  What should be embarrassing to Biden is that he can't even garner the support of his former president, President Barack Obama.  Obama saying he will not endorse a Democrat for president even if Biden decides to run.  We take up Biden's embarrassing trip overseas.  Republican Strategist, Ed Rollins, Matt Schlapp joins us.  And President Trump today in Miami issuing his strong support for Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.</p><p>The President's message clear and definitive.  The United States will never be a socialist nation, we take up the President's address and much more here tonight.  Our top story, former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe confessed there was in fact a deep state conspiracy among his cohorts in the Justice Department and FBI to remove President Trump from office.  Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCCABE:  Counting votes, or possible vote.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The former acting FBI director told \"60 MINUTES\" the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein openly discussed how many cabinet members would support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President.  But the FBI's former general counsel, James Baker who met contemporaneously with McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page about their conversations with Rosenstein testified the effort went further.</p><p>\"I had the impression the Deputy Attorney General had already discussed this with two members in the President's cabinet.  And that they were on board with this concept already.\"    On Twitter the President responded to McCabe on \"60 MINUTES,\" \"While, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.  He and Rod Rosenstein look like they were planning a very illegal act.\"</p><p>McCabe and others say the President's May 2017 firing of Director James Comey left the FBI and Justice Department in turmoil.  And they concerned that the firing was designed to be synced the Russian probe and obstruct justice.</p><p>MCCABE:  The Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire into the White House.  He said, I never get search when I going to the White House.  I think the General Counsel had a heart attack.  When he got up off the floor he said, I -- that's a bridge too far.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  But Baker who could face criminal penalties for lying to Congressional investigators testified \"My recollection is that there were discussions about it over longer period than the course of one meeting, a couple of days.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  McCabe said Rosenstein initially resisted a Special Counsel because the Deputy Attorney General worried he might lose his job.  A senior department official told Fox tonight the Special Counsel was appointed \"to ensure that the Russia investigation was truly independent and without bias.\"  Something the official said that McCabe could not have accomplished.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Catherine, thanks very much.  Catherine Herridge.  Well, joining us tonight, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch.  One of the country's most effective watchdog groups.  And he's worked with the International Policy Forum, the Leadership Institute, Accuracy in Media, among others.  Tom, good to have you with us.  What we just heard from the folks at \"60 MINUTES\" over at CBS, although they didn't ask a follow-up question, it was an outright confession by McCabe that he was committing felonies and an attempt to overthrow the President of the United States along with a number of his colleagues.  Your reaction when you heard it?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Well, it's extraordinary.  It confirms early reports last year that this discussion took place.  You know, Lou, if there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt we'll be -- we'll be calling it a coup.  But because you got -- I don't like the bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this and it's -- the target is President Trump, they don't care.</p><p>And America should realize this is how you can lose a Republic where you have appointees of the President and bureaucrats to answer to virtually no one talk about manipulating the law in order to overturn a presidential election and attack a president they don't like.  They don't like for any substantial reason.  They don't like him because they fired -- he fired his buddy, McCabe's buddy and Rosenstein's buddy, James Comey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  At the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein, by the way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON:  Right.  A fight about a personnel decision.  And they're going to overthrow the presidency.  And, you know, let's be clear here, Mueller is a successor to this coup attempt.  He's -- the appointment flows out of all of these discussions and we should recognize that the effort to overthrow the President is continuing with Justice Department help through this out-of-control Mueller investigation.</p><p>DOBBS:  And without so much as -- and effort, explanation, rationalization, this is -- we're watching McCabe basically saying he was doing it for the country's own good.  Here's a man sworn to enforce the law, to enforce the constitution of the United States, to defend the United States committing subversions, in my opinion, sedition and treason.  And those who want to say that we're not at war should reference the war on terror that we've been engaged in for 19 -- almost 19 years.</p><p>This is outrageous and we haven't heard a word from the leadership of the Republican Party about arresting these people.  We haven't heard a word from the so-called establishment that is supposed to hold the tenants values of this -- of this great nation and primacy.  They are just simply averting their eyes.  It's appalling, it's disgusting, there should be outrage throughout the country in both parties across every part of this nation.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I agree.  And the problem with the Justice Department is that Mueller is still running the Justice Department effectively.  And so any effort to uncover what went on behind this investigation and this is what went on behind this investigation, runs into the Mueller juggernaut.  And, you know, Attorney General Barr, he needs to step up and defend the President.  You know, the argument for -- against Barr was will he stand up to President Trump?</p><p>And I think the test for Attorney General Barr is, will he stand up for President Trump and for the rule of law against these deep stators and the establishment who don't care about our constitution.  You know, President Trump may survive this attack on him but maybe another President want.  And we'll lose our Republic and we won't even know it came.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I guarantee he will survive these attacks.  He's already demonstrated that he is stronger than the entire lot of these extraordinary venal, vicious actors in the Justice Department.  What may not survive is his Justice Department and the FBI.  And Tom Fitton, should they survive?  Because they are the root of the corruption and the malignancy of the others wanted to subscribe to this administration.</p><p>When, in point of fact, they have been the perpetrators of wrongdoing from the months preceding the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p>FITTON:  Well, my -- you know, I'm a small government conservative.  I think all government agencies should be subject to scrutiny every year before any money is given to them.  And given the corruption at the DOJ, I think we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The problem with that is, the appropriators as well as the investigators are also deep state actors and have been working just as viciously, frankly, behind the scenes as the people in the Justice Department and the FBI.  My god.</p><p>FITTON:  You know, the problem with the FBI is the current leadership frankly, Mr. Ray has zero interest in reforming the organization.</p><p>DOBBS:  Where is he?</p><p>FITTON:  That's why --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, we don't even hear from him.</p><p>FITTON:  He is missing in action when it comes to standing and uncovering -- I -- uncovering the corruption and to a degree he said anything, Lou, he's been excusing the corruption.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Exactly.  Tom, it's always good to have you here.  I wish we're talking in better circumstances.  But, as you intimated at the outset, the Republic itself is at stake here.</p><p>FITTON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the silence is absolutely chilling.  Thank you so much, Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON:  Welcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  And again, as always, and I mean it even when I don't say, thanks for everything that you and Judicial Watch do.  Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome.  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, one of the most embarrassing figures in modern American political history.  Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken his anti- American message overseas embarrassing the United States in front of our allies and many of his former colleagues in the Obama administration.  It's a shadow government.  We'll take that up and more right after this quick break.  Ed Rollins joins me.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A New York Times report today saying former President Obama is counseling the Dems' 2020 hopefuls but he will not be giving the New York Times assures us, anyone, anyone, not even Joe Biden, his endorsement.  His former Vice President taking a page out of his old Obama playbook.  Apologizing for America overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents.  It makes us an embarrassing in the example we're setting.  Well, I should stop.  As my mother would say, this too shall pass.  We will be back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  I wouldn't bet on it.  In any way, shape, or fashion, at least not led by one Joe Biden.  He's just blown his chances for 2020 in all likelihood.  Biden, it seems forgot one important lesson from his former boss.  President Obama at least waited until he had been elected and was in office before slamming America overseas.  Well, joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst Ed Rollins.  Ed, great to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  What a day.  Let's start with Biden, he just blew it, didn't he?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he certainly did something outrageous than anybody I've ever known.  A former Vice President to go before this important meeting and condemn the America is just outrageous.  You often do that if you're a presidential candidate in Iowa, or (INAUDIBLE) New Hampshire or somewhere.  But to go before our allies and to basically take apart the administration's position is just outrageous.</p><p>DOBBS:  When President Obama did that, his famous apology tour in Berlin in Cairo, he had been elected.</p><p>ROLLINS:  He'd been elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, there was a chance to make things right in 2012.  Romney didn't make that happen.  I think Biden can just kiss it goodbye, personally.  I would like to turn to this extraordinary piece on \"60 MINUTES\" in which Andrew McCabe actually confessed to trying to overthrow the President of the United States, Ed.  And where's the outrage from the Republican leadership?  I mean, I think the whole country should be just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  I have to tell you, from when I sat and watched it last night I was outraged because there's a conspiracy going on.  First of all, the 25th Amendment is for a president to step aside if he has health issues or something else.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Or a Vice President to step in if the President is incapacitated.  It is not about removing a president from office.  And I think to a certain extent, you think the Justice Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  These guys were not only obviously corrupt, they were stupid beyond imagining for people who were supposedly trained in law and respectful of it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the fact that before this, any evidence that basically still plotting and scheming to take out a President of the United States and talking to members of the cabinet according to him with the full support of the acting attorney general, I just found it appalling.  It's so un-American, it's like --</p><p>DOBBS:  So, where is the Republican Party?  Why aren't the leaders of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, every republican governor, every Republican governor, every Republican in this country standing up and saying end the witch-hunt, end all of this non-sense, it's obviously a cabal that has been working and the conspiracy to overthrow the President of the United States or tacitly they are endorsing it with their silence.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, their silence is terrible.  The reality is we are in a fight of our life.  President Trump basically doing everything he promised to do, moving the ball forward.  But the Democrats are really revved up and they're going to do everything they can to stop him.  From lawsuits to what have you.  And they're not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in the land that will join this president on the basis of his declaration of a national emergency.  I -- we know then that the corruption has absolutely grasped our judiciary system as well.  We got every indication that that's happened.  But for them to enjoin a president in a matter of national security would be an act against the Republic, the constitution itself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you and I have been around long enough to know that's going to happen.  And at the end of the day it's going to end up being in the Supreme Court.  And the Supreme Court has to rule in the President's favor at the end of the day here.  But it's going to go through the process.  There's -- all of these political attorney generals and what have you who want to make (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS:  But honorable, honest and judges who are not overwhelmed by their partisan prejudice would understand that that it could be absolutely litigated in our judiciary.  Without enjoining until a decision by the high court.  That would be the honorable thing to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the absolute honoring thing to do.  And I would -- I would hope the Supreme Court is stepping very quickly if they started out this process.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  I worry about this court and what more -- the more that we learned about Chief Justice John Roberts, I'm not saying when about, what will or will not occur in that high court.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I'm hopeful in the end he will do the right thing.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Well, we can all hope.  But I'd rather have certainty.</p><p>ROLLINS:  In the end.  In the end.  There is no certainty -- there's no certainty in life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there isn't.  But in this constitution there should be absolute certainty.  Ed Rollins, thanks much.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  We appreciate it.  We'd like to hear your thoughts on all this.  Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Coming up here next, Chicago Police, they want answers from actor, Jussie Smollett after their investigation into an alleged hate crime reverses.  That and much more coming up next.  We'll be talking with Washington Times' Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Before we go to break, let's take a look at the U.S. national debt as if we don't have enough problems already.  $22 trillion and climbing.  We're coming right back after this.  Stay brave of heart, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump in Miami today for claiming the days of socialism in the western hemisphere are numbered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If you choose this path, you have the opportunity to help forge a safe and prosperous future for all of the people of Venezuela.  Or you can choose the second path, continuing to support Maduro.  If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out.  You will lose everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump also using his speech to continue to express his supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.  A reported hate crime in Chicago looking more and more like a hate hoax.  Chicago Police say they no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim.  And they are pushing for a follow-up interview which his attorney -- Smollett's attorneys have resisted.  The police request -- imagine that, a request comes amid new reports that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault.</p><p>Both men have been questioned and released without charges.  Reverend Al Sharpton, we want to point out, responding to the news.  And Sharpton saying Smollett should face as he put it, \"accountability to the maximum\" if it's found the actor stage the attack.  Joining us tonight, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times Columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Tammy, good to see you.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, everybody.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Smollett and the hoax.  I have to give Reverend Al Sharpton great credit for standing up which by the way all of the candidates who have been commenting on this, the Democratic candidates have not had the courage to do.  Your thoughts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  The candidates seem to be wanting to pretend this never happened.  They get away without law because then the media also steps away from it and stops discussing it.  But Reverend Al Sharpton of course is very well known for promoting one of the original hoaxes, if you will with a young woman named Tawana Brawley who made some accusations against police officers which ended up being false.</p><p>So it's fascinating that he would actually take that position.  So good for him if he has found, you know, the right direction.  And maybe -- I don't know, maybe he's thinking that Mr. Smollett deserves a program on MSNBC like he has.  Who knows what that end result should be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you brought that to us with a sense of appropriate justice.</p><p>BRUCE:  Absolutely.  Hanging every day, every day.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's turn to Venezuela, the President today importantly going to Miami as the setting to announce his views and judgment and policies on the hemisphere and Venezuela in particular.  Your thoughts?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Perfect of course.  We know for South Florida it has a lot of people who are immigrants who have experienced in our lifetimes very recently, the impact of totalitarianism and tyrants.  So when he --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Venezuelans by the way.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, Venezuelans and Cubans.  So when he's speaking it happens to be the right thing, of course it is the thing that the President believes in.  But it also speaks to the Venezuelans that are already in South Florida that are coming to South Florida but speaking to that core of people in this region that understand the importance of freedom, this nation, capitalism and the value of the support of the American Presidents.</p><p>And so it's going to make I think a big different for people there and sends a very strong message back home about what his intentions are.</p><p>DOBBS:  I think he had a couple of other audiences as well in mind as he spoke.  And one of this of course the American people when he said this country will never be socialist.  That was a loud straightforward challenge to everyone of the -- what seemed to be every one of the Democratic hopefuls so far.  At least announced, this is not going to be an easy campaign for you because you've already gone to the left and lined up against this country and our traditions.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  It's the first education they may be receiving about real life.  These are -- especially young people, Miss Ocasio-Cortez obviously seems to not have any major education about the impact of socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Or minor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Or a minor education on the nape on how it destroys lives, on how it destroys countries and economies.  So, this is going to be her first indication about courtesy of the President, about real life and what socialism does to people.</p><p>DOBBS:  This could be an expensive tutorial for AOC if it moves into, as it appears, it is about to, into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  This is -- it could be.  And she won't understand this, I think, until 2020.  The benefit of this education for the American people about what the Democratic Party is becoming, and how everybody is running on this kind of an issue.</p><p>The President stands as the bulwark against this framework and as a reminder about what -- how greatness really can be brought into our lives.  And it's not through certainly that totalitarianism by any stretch.</p><p>DOBBS:  And most to me, it's very encouraging to see the presidential tracking poll with the president's popularity.  I had approval rising at 52 percent.  I confess that I personally think it should be significantly higher, and I hope it soon will be.</p><p>BRUCE:  It probably is, as a matter of fact.  When you think about the --</p><p>DOBBS:  I'd like to see it expressed in black-and-white.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Like you, I have faith in the forgotten man and woman in this country.  But this president, I think now, has turned a very important corner.  I think the national left-wing media understands it.  It is beginning to understand it.  That's why they are not quite as free with their nonsense as they have been.</p><p>In other words, Jim Acosta is receding quite a bit, as his colleagues, I think, on the left, in that White House briefing room, for example, it's one of the barometers of this all.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's good news.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy, good to have you here.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Up next, British lawmakers say Facebook is acting like gangsters with our personal information.  We take that up.  Now, the Europeans are doing something about it.  Why in the world isn't the United States?  Isn't privacy an even bigger right for Americans?  We take that up with cyber expert, Morgan Wright.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.  Oh, Google, Facebook, gangsters.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Headlines tonight, Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, claims he has \"a lot of discretion on border wall funding from President Trump's national emergency declaration,\" despite receiving a direct order from the President of the United States to secure the border.</p><p>Shanahan says \"I'm not required to do anything.\"  Well, he'd be required to do something, one would think, like pack his bags and get out of there.  A North Carolina elections board, beginning deliberations over election fraud allegations, Republican Mark Harris leading in last month's ninth congressional district election.</p><p>The board consists of three Democrats, two Republicans, they will decide whether to certify a winner or order a new election, Harris, by the way, leading Democrat Dan McCready, by 905 votes, but again, the vote that may count as the 3-2 vote on the elections board.</p><p>A new report from the U.K. parliament, calling Facebook, digital gangsters, for failing to thwart attempts by Russia to influence elections, the report accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of contempt of parliament.</p><p>Joining me now, Morgan Wright, Former Senior Advisor in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, Former Law Enforcement Advisor to the Republican National Committee, Cyber Security Expert, Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, EXPERT, CYBERSECURITY:  Hey, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me start with, first, the gangsters that Facebook and Google.  Who knew that they were going to be declared gangsters first by the U.K., rather than the United States?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, I don't see Al Pacino playing Mark Zuckerberg in a movie, you know, about gangsters, but yes, you know.  And Lou, we've talked about this before about why is the -- why is the E.U. ahead of us with things like the General Data Protection Regulations, privacy?</p><p>And I'll tell you, the only thing I can think of as it comes down to money, because there's a -- Facebook has figured out the Google playbook, which is, spend a lot of money, spend a lot of time here in D.C., on K Street, M Street, whatever all the streets are, and you know, get in there and lobby people, spread lots of money around.</p><p>And Lou, during the hearings, how many members of Congress did we see ponder to Mark Zuckerberg, hoping to relocate shit jobs in their district.  I mean, this is one reason why you don't have it because everybody's hoping to get something from Zuckerberg.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and -- but it reinforces the impression.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  That a half dozen of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have such concentrated economic and technological and political power, that they are almost now so large that it is impossible to rein them in.  Is that fear well-placed?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  And I'll tell you, Lou, you and I talked about this awhile back too, when we talked about how globalism is killing patriotism.  And all of these companies have taken the advantage of the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) well guess what?</p><p>It's coming home to roost now, because now that these companies want to be global.  Your subject to the E.U. regulations, the U.K. regulations, you know, Germany's regulations, all of these other places that actually place a premium on privacy, for too long self-regulation, they've tried it, it hasn't worked.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is the self-regulation go away.  And you're going to see more government interventions starting overseas, and hopefully, it'll end up over here, not to put them out of business, but, man, we've got to put a check on the seemingly unchecked power that they have right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  There is no countervailing influence in our economy, or our society, or our body politic to the awesome power of big tech.  That's simply a fact, and to that, the power of Wall Street and Corporate America.</p><p>And right now, the middle class in this country, if they were not the champion, the President of the United States would be defenseless against an onslaught that had rolled back the middle class for 20 years, and which under this president, is once again, growing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.  And look, you know, something interesting that came out of the U.K. report too, is they talked about -- even though Zuckerberg, in front of Congress, and sent his minions over there to say we don' sell any data, it's clear they've been selling data.  It's true that they've been using apps to spy on the activities of users and their competitors.</p><p>Look, this is the modern version.</p><p>DOBBS:  And even those who are not users.</p><p>WRIGHT:  --have that power, right, absolutely.  And the KGB only wished they would've had this power back in the day.  You know, our NSA and FBI don't have near the power that Facebook, Google, Amazon.  You know, these folks have to spy into the lives of us, but there are no consequences for it.  At some point, there has to be stick because the carrot hasn't worked.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  This is a president who is keenly aware --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- that U.S. policies haven't worked.  He is also confronted now by ZTE, as a favor to President Xi.  He backed off of the consequences for ZTE, Huawei, now paying the consequences for its role in spying, but doing so, only within our court system, not as a result of a national security response from the part of the United States.</p><p>How much longer can we go without saying straightforwardly to the Chinese, there will be a response on national security terms if you continue to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from this country each year and carry out acts of espionage nonstop.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, I think Gordon Chang's been on with before he talked about poor Chinese economically, I think they need to put -- they need to put the hammer down on Huawei.  It's time to put Huawei and ZTE out of business.</p><p>And I'll tell you why, Lou, the upcoming 5G, Huawei is doing everything they can to get their technology into these countries, but you've Australia, New Zealand, Japan.  The U.K. said it's going to take, you know -- they probably going to have to spend five years and $2-$3 billion to meet the U.K. standards.</p><p>The best way to stop this economic espionage is to quit lulling the government of China to subsidize the rail system, the electronic system, the communication systems to where it's all Chinese infrastructure.  And there's no U.S. infrastructure in play.  We can't -- it's not a fair fight.</p><p>So, I think they've got to put the hammer down on these guys.  One of the ways to stop espionage is to keep their equipment out of our infrastructure.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the -- and the administration to its credit is trying to do exactly that.  Huawei, at the same time, is bragging they are now too big to stop.  And this is -- this again, is advised rhetoric from the PLA and from President Xi, himself.</p><p>The Communist Party is now flaunting their economic and political and military power.  The United States is -- has to simply respond, and hopefully, before it becomes a military response.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  But it looks as though we are absolutely vulnerable in cyberspace right now.  Is that a correct impression?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, absolutely.  Lou, we have -- from our power grid, to our nuclear plants, to you know -- the rail system transportation.  A lot of things are still so vulnerable because we're so fragmented.  We don't have --</p><p>Even though we might have an overall plan, we don't have an overall coherent ability to secure all the things we need to do, why, because the private sector owns 85 percent of the critical infrastructure that's out there.</p><p>The government can provide a lot of support, a lot of help, but were the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese?  And even the North Koreans are exploiting.  They're exploiting all of these gaps between the different infrastructures.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>WRIGHT:  The lack of coherence among the security plans.  And the old technology that's out there.  We've got out-of-date machines that are still running windows that haven't been supported for five or six years.</p><p>DOBBS:  What Morgan is not saying, that 85 percent that is in the private sector, is often run by CEOs and boards that are frankly, friendlier to Chinese policies than they are to the policies of the Trump administration and the U.S. government.  And that's got to change, straightaway.  I didn't put words in your mouth, did I, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Lou, you're always right.  That's one lesson I've learned.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, thanks so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you, Morgan Wright.</p><p>Up next, New York Governor Bill -- New York Mayor, Bill de Blasio says AOC doesn't know what she is talking about.  We take that up after the break with American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio putting freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her place after Amazon decided not to build its headquarters in Long Island City.  Cortez claimed the failed deal would free up $4 billion in taxes incentives for the city to use elsewhere.  The good mayor reminded her even a socialist understood this, at least one of the socialists did, reminding her the money would only be available after the city secured the Amazon jobs and revenue and that it wasn't in a budget somewhere.</p><p>Radical freshman congresswoman, there's a lot of those going around.  Ilhan Omar scheduled to raise money in March for the Hamas link council on American-Islamic relations.  Omar received $5,000 from them during a run for Congress.  She since repeatedly made headlines for her anti-Semitic remarks most recently suggesting Republican support of Israel is bought and paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC.  At some point anti-Semitic remarks result in being anti -- an anti-Semite it seems.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Matt Schlapp.  He's the chairman of the American Conservative Union.  Why is it that the Left is suddenly so reluctant to say what is obvious that they have an anti-Semitic strain within their party and on Capitol Hill and aren't dealing with it?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, I completely agree with you, Lou, but I asked -- I actually think it's more cynical than this.  I think the Democratic Party has really shed its longtime support of the State of Israel.  I think they're moving away from this policy point of view and I think it gives Donald Trump who has done everything he said he would do with getting rid of the Iran deal, moving the embassy a great chance with these voters not with the not with the Liberal leaders potentially of this community but with everyday voters who can see anti-Semitism when it's so clear.</p><p>DOBBS:  Anti-Semitism, we saw reports today that the yellow vest in France you know, blaming them for a strain of anti-Semitism within France leaving out the entire ruling body and class in France that -- I mean there's anti-Semitism has been a huge issue in France.  It is not only anti-Israel, it is pro-Palestinian, and the expression is found throughout the political structure of France.  This looks like another gambit to lay off blame for what is a strengthening strain of anti-Semitism in France and indeed Europe.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.  And look, I think what's happening -- what's ironic, Lou, is what's happening in Israel is this once socialist country has really been embracing free markets and innovation and really has become a kindred soul in one of our closest allies to obviously to America and to our way of life into our values.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people that just hate everything about the idea of innovation of entrepreneurs or free markets of the little guy being able to go to market and take his ideas to the customers.  And they are against every aspect of that and I love the fact that Israel in America and freedom-loving people including the people of South America, including the freedom lovers in Venezuela.  We're working together to rid the world of this dreaded socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dreaded socialism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism and that really what I was asking you about.  Socialism is as the President assured is this country will never be socialistic.  What is in question tonight is whether or not one guy you know, is going to be the successor to Maduro.  Will he or will he not and what is your sense from where you look?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a great question, Lou.  And I worry I think it's a little bit of a jump ball right now.  I think the President, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo we're trying to do everything they can to use power in influence to stand up for the Venezuelan people in this new president Mr. Guaido.  And Maduro is a -- is a tin-pot dictator.  And you know they have a lot of power at the end of their reigns.  And we'll see if he's able to use that power.  But I'm hopeful that the right side will win out in Venezuela.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's a lot of hope running around this country right now primarily because President Trump is indeed the leader of the free world.  My question to you is why is the establishment in Washington D.C. not screaming for the arrest of Andrew McCabe and for all of his cohorts and the DOJ and the FBI?  Why is it that there seems to be almost a satisfaction in the status quo no matter how rancid and corrupt in the swamp that is D.C.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Look, I'm disgusted by it and I guess there's only one person who can do something about it and that's Bill Barr.  Is he either going to do this or he's not, and I'd be greatly disappointed if he doesn't.  And I think --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why the hell isn't the Republican Party's standing up and demanding his arrest?  Why --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You know why.</p><p>DOBBS:  I do not know why.  I would not be asking you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I think the reason is because they don't want the controversy of actually taking the deep state on because they might be coming its next victim.</p><p>DOBBS:  Then their doubtless wonders and why in the world should we tolerate these Koch brothers hired excuses for legislators and representatives.  They represent nothing but Koch brothers, the Wall Street, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber, they are -- it's enough to make you sick.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Lou, if that's where the Republican Party stays, it will deserve to lose beyond the ash heap of history.  We either going to represent the people or we're not and if we don't, we deserve to lose and we ought to get out of the way.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's very simple.  They either follow President Trump or they are going to be on the scrap heap of history.  The problem is they could take the Republican with them.  Matt, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Good to see you too.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the dark political agenda of the deep state, their efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald Trump -- that's right -- to overthrow the U.S. government.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Andrew McCabe, fired as acting director of the FBI last night on 60 Minutes confessed he was involved in an effort to remove well, President Trump from office and to overthrow the government of the United States.  Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton says McCabe, the Department of Justice and the FBI were trying to overthrow the government and this republic.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT JUDICIAL WATCH:  If there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt the media would be calling it a coup.  But because you've got an elected bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this, and if the target is President Trump, they don't care.  And Americans should realize this is how you can lose a republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Tomorrow night, Congressman Mark Green, David Bossie, and Attorney Harmeet Dhillon among our guests tomorrow.  We hope you'll join us.  Thanks for being with us tonight.  Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs.  And again, thanks for being with us.

This aversion is President Trump and his administration on full display this weekend as former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe actually confessed that he, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and a host of corrupt FBI and Department of Justice actors sought to unseat a sitting president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR:  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.  What I can say is the Deputy Attorney General was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confession.  Where is the outrage about their treason?  Where is the Republican Party and its leaders demanding they arrest McCabe and the rest of his cohorts who conspired to overthrow the President of the United States?  McCabe's admission of the coup attempted by the corrupt deep state went without as much a follow-up question by CBS.  Where is the national media?  Left-wing, though it may be, it in demanding answers, accountability, and transparency for this aversion and outright sedition?</p><p>Judicial watch President, Tom Fitton, Radio Show Host, Tammy Bruce among our guest here tonight to discuss those questions and their answers.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, over the weekend calling the United States embarrassing.  As globalist foreign leaders and the radical Dems applaud their approval of his careless and outrageous remarks on foreign soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents or turning their back on refugees on our border.  Americans know that's not right.  The American people understand, please, because it makes us embarrassing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Biden is the embarrassment.  What should be embarrassing to Biden is that he can't even garner the support of his former president, President Barack Obama.  Obama saying he will not endorse a Democrat for president even if Biden decides to run.  We take up Biden's embarrassing trip overseas.  Republican Strategist, Ed Rollins, Matt Schlapp joins us.  And President Trump today in Miami issuing his strong support for Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.</p><p>The President's message clear and definitive.  The United States will never be a socialist nation, we take up the President's address and much more here tonight.  Our top story, former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe confessed there was in fact a deep state conspiracy among his cohorts in the Justice Department and FBI to remove President Trump from office.  Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCCABE:  Counting votes, or possible vote.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The former acting FBI director told \"60 MINUTES\" the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein openly discussed how many cabinet members would support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President.  But the FBI's former general counsel, James Baker who met contemporaneously with McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page about their conversations with Rosenstein testified the effort went further.</p><p>\"I had the impression the Deputy Attorney General had already discussed this with two members in the President's cabinet.  And that they were on board with this concept already.\"    On Twitter the President responded to McCabe on \"60 MINUTES,\" \"While, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.  He and Rod Rosenstein look like they were planning a very illegal act.\"</p><p>McCabe and others say the President's May 2017 firing of Director James Comey left the FBI and Justice Department in turmoil.  And they concerned that the firing was designed to be synced the Russian probe and obstruct justice.</p><p>MCCABE:  The Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire into the White House.  He said, I never get search when I going to the White House.  I think the General Counsel had a heart attack.  When he got up off the floor he said, I -- that's a bridge too far.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  But Baker who could face criminal penalties for lying to Congressional investigators testified \"My recollection is that there were discussions about it over longer period than the course of one meeting, a couple of days.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  McCabe said Rosenstein initially resisted a Special Counsel because the Deputy Attorney General worried he might lose his job.  A senior department official told Fox tonight the Special Counsel was appointed \"to ensure that the Russia investigation was truly independent and without bias.\"  Something the official said that McCabe could not have accomplished.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Catherine, thanks very much.  Catherine Herridge.  Well, joining us tonight, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch.  One of the country's most effective watchdog groups.  And he's worked with the International Policy Forum, the Leadership Institute, Accuracy in Media, among others.  Tom, good to have you with us.  What we just heard from the folks at \"60 MINUTES\" over at CBS, although they didn't ask a follow-up question, it was an outright confession by McCabe that he was committing felonies and an attempt to overthrow the President of the United States along with a number of his colleagues.  Your reaction when you heard it?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Well, it's extraordinary.  It confirms early reports last year that this discussion took place.  You know, Lou, if there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt we'll be -- we'll be calling it a coup.  But because you got -- I don't like the bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this and it's -- the target is President Trump, they don't care.</p><p>And America should realize this is how you can lose a Republic where you have appointees of the President and bureaucrats to answer to virtually no one talk about manipulating the law in order to overturn a presidential election and attack a president they don't like.  They don't like for any substantial reason.  They don't like him because they fired -- he fired his buddy, McCabe's buddy and Rosenstein's buddy, James Comey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  At the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein, by the way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON:  Right.  A fight about a personnel decision.  And they're going to overthrow the presidency.  And, you know, let's be clear here, Mueller is a successor to this coup attempt.  He's -- the appointment flows out of all of these discussions and we should recognize that the effort to overthrow the President is continuing with Justice Department help through this out-of-control Mueller investigation.</p><p>DOBBS:  And without so much as -- and effort, explanation, rationalization, this is -- we're watching McCabe basically saying he was doing it for the country's own good.  Here's a man sworn to enforce the law, to enforce the constitution of the United States, to defend the United States committing subversions, in my opinion, sedition and treason.  And those who want to say that we're not at war should reference the war on terror that we've been engaged in for 19 -- almost 19 years.</p><p>This is outrageous and we haven't heard a word from the leadership of the Republican Party about arresting these people.  We haven't heard a word from the so-called establishment that is supposed to hold the tenants values of this -- of this great nation and primacy.  They are just simply averting their eyes.  It's appalling, it's disgusting, there should be outrage throughout the country in both parties across every part of this nation.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I agree.  And the problem with the Justice Department is that Mueller is still running the Justice Department effectively.  And so any effort to uncover what went on behind this investigation and this is what went on behind this investigation, runs into the Mueller juggernaut.  And, you know, Attorney General Barr, he needs to step up and defend the President.  You know, the argument for -- against Barr was will he stand up to President Trump?</p><p>And I think the test for Attorney General Barr is, will he stand up for President Trump and for the rule of law against these deep stators and the establishment who don't care about our constitution.  You know, President Trump may survive this attack on him but maybe another President want.  And we'll lose our Republic and we won't even know it came.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I guarantee he will survive these attacks.  He's already demonstrated that he is stronger than the entire lot of these extraordinary venal, vicious actors in the Justice Department.  What may not survive is his Justice Department and the FBI.  And Tom Fitton, should they survive?  Because they are the root of the corruption and the malignancy of the others wanted to subscribe to this administration.</p><p>When, in point of fact, they have been the perpetrators of wrongdoing from the months preceding the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p>FITTON:  Well, my -- you know, I'm a small government conservative.  I think all government agencies should be subject to scrutiny every year before any money is given to them.  And given the corruption at the DOJ, I think we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The problem with that is, the appropriators as well as the investigators are also deep state actors and have been working just as viciously, frankly, behind the scenes as the people in the Justice Department and the FBI.  My god.</p><p>FITTON:  You know, the problem with the FBI is the current leadership frankly, Mr. Ray has zero interest in reforming the organization.</p><p>DOBBS:  Where is he?</p><p>FITTON:  That's why --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, we don't even hear from him.</p><p>FITTON:  He is missing in action when it comes to standing and uncovering -- I -- uncovering the corruption and to a degree he said anything, Lou, he's been excusing the corruption.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Exactly.  Tom, it's always good to have you here.  I wish we're talking in better circumstances.  But, as you intimated at the outset, the Republic itself is at stake here.</p><p>FITTON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the silence is absolutely chilling.  Thank you so much, Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON:  Welcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  And again, as always, and I mean it even when I don't say, thanks for everything that you and Judicial Watch do.  Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome.  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, one of the most embarrassing figures in modern American political history.  Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken his anti- American message overseas embarrassing the United States in front of our allies and many of his former colleagues in the Obama administration.  It's a shadow government.  We'll take that up and more right after this quick break.  Ed Rollins joins me.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A New York Times report today saying former President Obama is counseling the Dems' 2020 hopefuls but he will not be giving the New York Times assures us, anyone, anyone, not even Joe Biden, his endorsement.  His former Vice President taking a page out of his old Obama playbook.  Apologizing for America overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents.  It makes us an embarrassing in the example we're setting.  Well, I should stop.  As my mother would say, this too shall pass.  We will be back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  I wouldn't bet on it.  In any way, shape, or fashion, at least not led by one Joe Biden.  He's just blown his chances for 2020 in all likelihood.  Biden, it seems forgot one important lesson from his former boss.  President Obama at least waited until he had been elected and was in office before slamming America overseas.  Well, joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst Ed Rollins.  Ed, great to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  What a day.  Let's start with Biden, he just blew it, didn't he?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he certainly did something outrageous than anybody I've ever known.  A former Vice President to go before this important meeting and condemn the America is just outrageous.  You often do that if you're a presidential candidate in Iowa, or (INAUDIBLE) New Hampshire or somewhere.  But to go before our allies and to basically take apart the administration's position is just outrageous.</p><p>DOBBS:  When President Obama did that, his famous apology tour in Berlin in Cairo, he had been elected.</p><p>ROLLINS:  He'd been elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, there was a chance to make things right in 2012.  Romney didn't make that happen.  I think Biden can just kiss it goodbye, personally.  I would like to turn to this extraordinary piece on \"60 MINUTES\" in which Andrew McCabe actually confessed to trying to overthrow the President of the United States, Ed.  And where's the outrage from the Republican leadership?  I mean, I think the whole country should be just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  I have to tell you, from when I sat and watched it last night I was outraged because there's a conspiracy going on.  First of all, the 25th Amendment is for a president to step aside if he has health issues or something else.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Or a Vice President to step in if the President is incapacitated.  It is not about removing a president from office.  And I think to a certain extent, you think the Justice Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  These guys were not only obviously corrupt, they were stupid beyond imagining for people who were supposedly trained in law and respectful of it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the fact that before this, any evidence that basically still plotting and scheming to take out a President of the United States and talking to members of the cabinet according to him with the full support of the acting attorney general, I just found it appalling.  It's so un-American, it's like --</p><p>DOBBS:  So, where is the Republican Party?  Why aren't the leaders of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, every republican governor, every Republican governor, every Republican in this country standing up and saying end the witch-hunt, end all of this non-sense, it's obviously a cabal that has been working and the conspiracy to overthrow the President of the United States or tacitly they are endorsing it with their silence.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, their silence is terrible.  The reality is we are in a fight of our life.  President Trump basically doing everything he promised to do, moving the ball forward.  But the Democrats are really revved up and they're going to do everything they can to stop him.  From lawsuits to what have you.  And they're not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in the land that will join this president on the basis of his declaration of a national emergency.  I -- we know then that the corruption has absolutely grasped our judiciary system as well.  We got every indication that that's happened.  But for them to enjoin a president in a matter of national security would be an act against the Republic, the constitution itself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you and I have been around long enough to know that's going to happen.  And at the end of the day it's going to end up being in the Supreme Court.  And the Supreme Court has to rule in the President's favor at the end of the day here.  But it's going to go through the process.  There's -- all of these political attorney generals and what have you who want to make (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS:  But honorable, honest and judges who are not overwhelmed by their partisan prejudice would understand that that it could be absolutely litigated in our judiciary.  Without enjoining until a decision by the high court.  That would be the honorable thing to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the absolute honoring thing to do.  And I would -- I would hope the Supreme Court is stepping very quickly if they started out this process.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  I worry about this court and what more -- the more that we learned about Chief Justice John Roberts, I'm not saying when about, what will or will not occur in that high court.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I'm hopeful in the end he will do the right thing.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Well, we can all hope.  But I'd rather have certainty.</p><p>ROLLINS:  In the end.  In the end.  There is no certainty -- there's no certainty in life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there isn't.  But in this constitution there should be absolute certainty.  Ed Rollins, thanks much.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  We appreciate it.  We'd like to hear your thoughts on all this.  Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Coming up here next, Chicago Police, they want answers from actor, Jussie Smollett after their investigation into an alleged hate crime reverses.  That and much more coming up next.  We'll be talking with Washington Times' Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Before we go to break, let's take a look at the U.S. national debt as if we don't have enough problems already.  $22 trillion and climbing.  We're coming right back after this.  Stay brave of heart, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump in Miami today for claiming the days of socialism in the western hemisphere are numbered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If you choose this path, you have the opportunity to help forge a safe and prosperous future for all of the people of Venezuela.  Or you can choose the second path, continuing to support Maduro.  If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out.  You will lose everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump also using his speech to continue to express his supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.  A reported hate crime in Chicago looking more and more like a hate hoax.  Chicago Police say they no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim.  And they are pushing for a follow-up interview which his attorney -- Smollett's attorneys have resisted.  The police request -- imagine that, a request comes amid new reports that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault.</p><p>Both men have been questioned and released without charges.  Reverend Al Sharpton, we want to point out, responding to the news.  And Sharpton saying Smollett should face as he put it, \"accountability to the maximum\" if it's found the actor stage the attack.  Joining us tonight, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times Columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Tammy, good to see you.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, everybody.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Smollett and the hoax.  I have to give Reverend Al Sharpton great credit for standing up which by the way all of the candidates who have been commenting on this, the Democratic candidates have not had the courage to do.  Your thoughts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  The candidates seem to be wanting to pretend this never happened.  They get away without law because then the media also steps away from it and stops discussing it.  But Reverend Al Sharpton of course is very well known for promoting one of the original hoaxes, if you will with a young woman named Tawana Brawley who made some accusations against police officers which ended up being false.</p><p>So it's fascinating that he would actually take that position.  So good for him if he has found, you know, the right direction.  And maybe -- I don't know, maybe he's thinking that Mr. Smollett deserves a program on MSNBC like he has.  Who knows what that end result should be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you brought that to us with a sense of appropriate justice.</p><p>BRUCE:  Absolutely.  Hanging every day, every day.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's turn to Venezuela, the President today importantly going to Miami as the setting to announce his views and judgment and policies on the hemisphere and Venezuela in particular.  Your thoughts?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Perfect of course.  We know for South Florida it has a lot of people who are immigrants who have experienced in our lifetimes very recently, the impact of totalitarianism and tyrants.  So when he --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Venezuelans by the way.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, Venezuelans and Cubans.  So when he's speaking it happens to be the right thing, of course it is the thing that the President believes in.  But it also speaks to the Venezuelans that are already in South Florida that are coming to South Florida but speaking to that core of people in this region that understand the importance of freedom, this nation, capitalism and the value of the support of the American Presidents.</p><p>And so it's going to make I think a big different for people there and sends a very strong message back home about what his intentions are.</p><p>DOBBS:  I think he had a couple of other audiences as well in mind as he spoke.  And one of this of course the American people when he said this country will never be socialist.  That was a loud straightforward challenge to everyone of the -- what seemed to be every one of the Democratic hopefuls so far.  At least announced, this is not going to be an easy campaign for you because you've already gone to the left and lined up against this country and our traditions.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  It's the first education they may be receiving about real life.  These are -- especially young people, Miss Ocasio-Cortez obviously seems to not have any major education about the impact of socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Or minor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Or a minor education on the nape on how it destroys lives, on how it destroys countries and economies.  So, this is going to be her first indication about courtesy of the President, about real life and what socialism does to people.</p><p>DOBBS:  This could be an expensive tutorial for AOC if it moves into, as it appears, it is about to, into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  This is -- it could be.  And she won't understand this, I think, until 2020.  The benefit of this education for the American people about what the Democratic Party is becoming, and how everybody is running on this kind of an issue.</p><p>The President stands as the bulwark against this framework and as a reminder about what -- how greatness really can be brought into our lives.  And it's not through certainly that totalitarianism by any stretch.</p><p>DOBBS:  And most to me, it's very encouraging to see the presidential tracking poll with the president's popularity.  I had approval rising at 52 percent.  I confess that I personally think it should be significantly higher, and I hope it soon will be.</p><p>BRUCE:  It probably is, as a matter of fact.  When you think about the --</p><p>DOBBS:  I'd like to see it expressed in black-and-white.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Like you, I have faith in the forgotten man and woman in this country.  But this president, I think now, has turned a very important corner.  I think the national left-wing media understands it.  It is beginning to understand it.  That's why they are not quite as free with their nonsense as they have been.</p><p>In other words, Jim Acosta is receding quite a bit, as his colleagues, I think, on the left, in that White House briefing room, for example, it's one of the barometers of this all.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's good news.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy, good to have you here.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Up next, British lawmakers say Facebook is acting like gangsters with our personal information.  We take that up.  Now, the Europeans are doing something about it.  Why in the world isn't the United States?  Isn't privacy an even bigger right for Americans?  We take that up with cyber expert, Morgan Wright.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.  Oh, Google, Facebook, gangsters.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Headlines tonight, Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, claims he has \"a lot of discretion on border wall funding from President Trump's national emergency declaration,\" despite receiving a direct order from the President of the United States to secure the border.</p><p>Shanahan says \"I'm not required to do anything.\"  Well, he'd be required to do something, one would think, like pack his bags and get out of there.  A North Carolina elections board, beginning deliberations over election fraud allegations, Republican Mark Harris leading in last month's ninth congressional district election.</p><p>The board consists of three Democrats, two Republicans, they will decide whether to certify a winner or order a new election, Harris, by the way, leading Democrat Dan McCready, by 905 votes, but again, the vote that may count as the 3-2 vote on the elections board.</p><p>A new report from the U.K. parliament, calling Facebook, digital gangsters, for failing to thwart attempts by Russia to influence elections, the report accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of contempt of parliament.</p><p>Joining me now, Morgan Wright, Former Senior Advisor in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, Former Law Enforcement Advisor to the Republican National Committee, Cyber Security Expert, Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, EXPERT, CYBERSECURITY:  Hey, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me start with, first, the gangsters that Facebook and Google.  Who knew that they were going to be declared gangsters first by the U.K., rather than the United States?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, I don't see Al Pacino playing Mark Zuckerberg in a movie, you know, about gangsters, but yes, you know.  And Lou, we've talked about this before about why is the -- why is the E.U. ahead of us with things like the General Data Protection Regulations, privacy?</p><p>And I'll tell you, the only thing I can think of as it comes down to money, because there's a -- Facebook has figured out the Google playbook, which is, spend a lot of money, spend a lot of time here in D.C., on K Street, M Street, whatever all the streets are, and you know, get in there and lobby people, spread lots of money around.</p><p>And Lou, during the hearings, how many members of Congress did we see ponder to Mark Zuckerberg, hoping to relocate shit jobs in their district.  I mean, this is one reason why you don't have it because everybody's hoping to get something from Zuckerberg.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and -- but it reinforces the impression.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  That a half dozen of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have such concentrated economic and technological and political power, that they are almost now so large that it is impossible to rein them in.  Is that fear well-placed?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  And I'll tell you, Lou, you and I talked about this awhile back too, when we talked about how globalism is killing patriotism.  And all of these companies have taken the advantage of the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) well guess what?</p><p>It's coming home to roost now, because now that these companies want to be global.  Your subject to the E.U. regulations, the U.K. regulations, you know, Germany's regulations, all of these other places that actually place a premium on privacy, for too long self-regulation, they've tried it, it hasn't worked.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is the self-regulation go away.  And you're going to see more government interventions starting overseas, and hopefully, it'll end up over here, not to put them out of business, but, man, we've got to put a check on the seemingly unchecked power that they have right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  There is no countervailing influence in our economy, or our society, or our body politic to the awesome power of big tech.  That's simply a fact, and to that, the power of Wall Street and Corporate America.</p><p>And right now, the middle class in this country, if they were not the champion, the President of the United States would be defenseless against an onslaught that had rolled back the middle class for 20 years, and which under this president, is once again, growing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.  And look, you know, something interesting that came out of the U.K. report too, is they talked about -- even though Zuckerberg, in front of Congress, and sent his minions over there to say we don' sell any data, it's clear they've been selling data.  It's true that they've been using apps to spy on the activities of users and their competitors.</p><p>Look, this is the modern version.</p><p>DOBBS:  And even those who are not users.</p><p>WRIGHT:  --have that power, right, absolutely.  And the KGB only wished they would've had this power back in the day.  You know, our NSA and FBI don't have near the power that Facebook, Google, Amazon.  You know, these folks have to spy into the lives of us, but there are no consequences for it.  At some point, there has to be stick because the carrot hasn't worked.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  This is a president who is keenly aware --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- that U.S. policies haven't worked.  He is also confronted now by ZTE, as a favor to President Xi.  He backed off of the consequences for ZTE, Huawei, now paying the consequences for its role in spying, but doing so, only within our court system, not as a result of a national security response from the part of the United States.</p><p>How much longer can we go without saying straightforwardly to the Chinese, there will be a response on national security terms if you continue to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from this country each year and carry out acts of espionage nonstop.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, I think Gordon Chang's been on with before he talked about poor Chinese economically, I think they need to put -- they need to put the hammer down on Huawei.  It's time to put Huawei and ZTE out of business.</p><p>And I'll tell you why, Lou, the upcoming 5G, Huawei is doing everything they can to get their technology into these countries, but you've Australia, New Zealand, Japan.  The U.K. said it's going to take, you know -- they probably going to have to spend five years and $2-$3 billion to meet the U.K. standards.</p><p>The best way to stop this economic espionage is to quit lulling the government of China to subsidize the rail system, the electronic system, the communication systems to where it's all Chinese infrastructure.  And there's no U.S. infrastructure in play.  We can't -- it's not a fair fight.</p><p>So, I think they've got to put the hammer down on these guys.  One of the ways to stop espionage is to keep their equipment out of our infrastructure.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the -- and the administration to its credit is trying to do exactly that.  Huawei, at the same time, is bragging they are now too big to stop.  And this is -- this again, is advised rhetoric from the PLA and from President Xi, himself.</p><p>The Communist Party is now flaunting their economic and political and military power.  The United States is -- has to simply respond, and hopefully, before it becomes a military response.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  But it looks as though we are absolutely vulnerable in cyberspace right now.  Is that a correct impression?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, absolutely.  Lou, we have -- from our power grid, to our nuclear plants, to you know -- the rail system transportation.  A lot of things are still so vulnerable because we're so fragmented.  We don't have --</p><p>Even though we might have an overall plan, we don't have an overall coherent ability to secure all the things we need to do, why, because the private sector owns 85 percent of the critical infrastructure that's out there.</p><p>The government can provide a lot of support, a lot of help, but were the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese?  And even the North Koreans are exploiting.  They're exploiting all of these gaps between the different infrastructures.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>WRIGHT:  The lack of coherence among the security plans.  And the old technology that's out there.  We've got out-of-date machines that are still running windows that haven't been supported for five or six years.</p><p>DOBBS:  What Morgan is not saying, that 85 percent that is in the private sector, is often run by CEOs and boards that are frankly, friendlier to Chinese policies than they are to the policies of the Trump administration and the U.S. government.  And that's got to change, straightaway.  I didn't put words in your mouth, did I, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Lou, you're always right.  That's one lesson I've learned.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, thanks so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you, Morgan Wright.</p><p>Up next, New York Governor Bill -- New York Mayor, Bill de Blasio says AOC doesn't know what she is talking about.  We take that up after the break with American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio putting freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her place after Amazon decided not to build its headquarters in Long Island City.  Cortez claimed the failed deal would free up $4 billion in taxes incentives for the city to use elsewhere.  The good mayor reminded her even a socialist understood this, at least one of the socialists did, reminding her the money would only be available after the city secured the Amazon jobs and revenue and that it wasn't in a budget somewhere.</p><p>Radical freshman congresswoman, there's a lot of those going around.  Ilhan Omar scheduled to raise money in March for the Hamas link council on American-Islamic relations.  Omar received $5,000 from them during a run for Congress.  She since repeatedly made headlines for her anti-Semitic remarks most recently suggesting Republican support of Israel is bought and paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC.  At some point anti-Semitic remarks result in being anti -- an anti-Semite it seems.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Matt Schlapp.  He's the chairman of the American Conservative Union.  Why is it that the Left is suddenly so reluctant to say what is obvious that they have an anti-Semitic strain within their party and on Capitol Hill and aren't dealing with it?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, I completely agree with you, Lou, but I asked -- I actually think it's more cynical than this.  I think the Democratic Party has really shed its longtime support of the State of Israel.  I think they're moving away from this policy point of view and I think it gives Donald Trump who has done everything he said he would do with getting rid of the Iran deal, moving the embassy a great chance with these voters not with the not with the Liberal leaders potentially of this community but with everyday voters who can see anti-Semitism when it's so clear.</p><p>DOBBS:  Anti-Semitism, we saw reports today that the yellow vest in France you know, blaming them for a strain of anti-Semitism within France leaving out the entire ruling body and class in France that -- I mean there's anti-Semitism has been a huge issue in France.  It is not only anti-Israel, it is pro-Palestinian, and the expression is found throughout the political structure of France.  This looks like another gambit to lay off blame for what is a strengthening strain of anti-Semitism in France and indeed Europe.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.  And look, I think what's happening -- what's ironic, Lou, is what's happening in Israel is this once socialist country has really been embracing free markets and innovation and really has become a kindred soul in one of our closest allies to obviously to America and to our way of life into our values.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people that just hate everything about the idea of innovation of entrepreneurs or free markets of the little guy being able to go to market and take his ideas to the customers.  And they are against every aspect of that and I love the fact that Israel in America and freedom-loving people including the people of South America, including the freedom lovers in Venezuela.  We're working together to rid the world of this dreaded socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dreaded socialism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism and that really what I was asking you about.  Socialism is as the President assured is this country will never be socialistic.  What is in question tonight is whether or not one guy you know, is going to be the successor to Maduro.  Will he or will he not and what is your sense from where you look?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a great question, Lou.  And I worry I think it's a little bit of a jump ball right now.  I think the President, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo we're trying to do everything they can to use power in influence to stand up for the Venezuelan people in this new president Mr. Guaido.  And Maduro is a -- is a tin-pot dictator.  And you know they have a lot of power at the end of their reigns.  And we'll see if he's able to use that power.  But I'm hopeful that the right side will win out in Venezuela.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's a lot of hope running around this country right now primarily because President Trump is indeed the leader of the free world.  My question to you is why is the establishment in Washington D.C. not screaming for the arrest of Andrew McCabe and for all of his cohorts and the DOJ and the FBI?  Why is it that there seems to be almost a satisfaction in the status quo no matter how rancid and corrupt in the swamp that is D.C.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Look, I'm disgusted by it and I guess there's only one person who can do something about it and that's Bill Barr.  Is he either going to do this or he's not, and I'd be greatly disappointed if he doesn't.  And I think --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why the hell isn't the Republican Party's standing up and demanding his arrest?  Why --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You know why.</p><p>DOBBS:  I do not know why.  I would not be asking you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I think the reason is because they don't want the controversy of actually taking the deep state on because they might be coming its next victim.</p><p>DOBBS:  Then their doubtless wonders and why in the world should we tolerate these Koch brothers hired excuses for legislators and representatives.  They represent nothing but Koch brothers, the Wall Street, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber, they are -- it's enough to make you sick.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Lou, if that's where the Republican Party stays, it will deserve to lose beyond the ash heap of history.  We either going to represent the people or we're not and if we don't, we deserve to lose and we ought to get out of the way.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's very simple.  They either follow President Trump or they are going to be on the scrap heap of history.  The problem is they could take the Republican with them.  Matt, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Good to see you too.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the dark political agenda of the deep state, their efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald Trump -- that's right -- to overthrow the U.S. government.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Andrew McCabe, fired as acting director of the FBI last night on 60 Minutes confessed he was involved in an effort to remove well, President Trump from office and to overthrow the government of the United States.  Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton says McCabe, the Department of Justice and the FBI were trying to overthrow the government and this republic.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT JUDICIAL WATCH:  If there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt the media would be calling it a coup.  But because you've got an elected bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this, and if the target is President Trump, they don't care.  And Americans should realize this is how you can lose a republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Tomorrow night, Congressman Mark Green, David Bossie, and Attorney Harmeet Dhillon among our guests tomorrow.  We hope you'll join us.  Thanks for being with us tonight.  Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs.  And again, thanks for being with us.  Good night.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2183280011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2T-RYV1-DY0W-42BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

This aversion is President Trump and his administration on full display this weekend as former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe actually confessed that he, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and a host of corrupt FBI and Department of Justice actors sought to unseat a sitting president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR:  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.  What I can say is the Deputy Attorney General was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confession.  Where is the outrage about their treason?  Where is the Republican Party and its leaders demanding they arrest McCabe and the rest of his cohorts who conspired to overthrow the President of the United States?  McCabe's admission of the coup attempted by the corrupt deep state went without as much a follow-up question by CBS.  Where is the national media?  Left-wing, though it may be, it in demanding answers, accountability, and transparency for this aversion and outright sedition?</p><p>Judicial watch President, Tom Fitton, Radio Show Host, Tammy Bruce among our guest here tonight to discuss those questions and their answers.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, over the weekend calling the United States embarrassing.  As globalist foreign leaders and the radical Dems applaud their approval of his careless and outrageous remarks on foreign soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents or turning their back on refugees on our border.  Americans know that's not right.  The American people understand, please, because it makes us embarrassing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Biden is the embarrassment.  What should be embarrassing to Biden is that he can't even garner the support of his former president, President Barack Obama.  Obama saying he will not endorse a Democrat for president even if Biden decides to run.  We take up Biden's embarrassing trip overseas.  Republican Strategist, Ed Rollins, Matt Schlapp joins us.  And President Trump today in Miami issuing his strong support for Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.</p><p>The President's message clear and definitive.  The United States will never be a socialist nation, we take up the President's address and much more here tonight.  Our top story, former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe confessed there was in fact a deep state conspiracy among his cohorts in the Justice Department and FBI to remove President Trump from office.  Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCCABE:  Counting votes, or possible vote.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The former acting FBI director told \"60 MINUTES\" the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein openly discussed how many cabinet members would support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President.  But the FBI's former general counsel, James Baker who met contemporaneously with McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page about their conversations with Rosenstein testified the effort went further.</p><p>\"I had the impression the Deputy Attorney General had already discussed this with two members in the President's cabinet.  And that they were on board with this concept already.\"    On Twitter the President responded to McCabe on \"60 MINUTES,\" \"While, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.  He and Rod Rosenstein look like they were planning a very illegal act.\"</p><p>McCabe and others say the President's May 2017 firing of Director James Comey left the FBI and Justice Department in turmoil.  And they concerned that the firing was designed to be synced the Russian probe and obstruct justice.</p><p>MCCABE:  The Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire into the White House.  He said, I never get search when I going to the White House.  I think the General Counsel had a heart attack.  When he got up off the floor he said, I -- that's a bridge too far.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  But Baker who could face criminal penalties for lying to Congressional investigators testified \"My recollection is that there were discussions about it over longer period than the course of one meeting, a couple of days.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  McCabe said Rosenstein initially resisted a Special Counsel because the Deputy Attorney General worried he might lose his job.  A senior department official told Fox tonight the Special Counsel was appointed \"to ensure that the Russia investigation was truly independent and without bias.\"  Something the official said that McCabe could not have accomplished.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Catherine, thanks very much.  Catherine Herridge.  Well, joining us tonight, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch.  One of the country's most effective watchdog groups.  And he's worked with the International Policy Forum, the Leadership Institute, Accuracy in Media, among others.  Tom, good to have you with us.  What we just heard from the folks at \"60 MINUTES\" over at CBS, although they didn't ask a follow-up question, it was an outright confession by McCabe that he was committing felonies and an attempt to overthrow the President of the United States along with a number of his colleagues.  Your reaction when you heard it?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Well, it's extraordinary.  It confirms early reports last year that this discussion took place.  You know, Lou, if there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt we'll be -- we'll be calling it a coup.  But because you got -- I don't like the bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this and it's -- the target is President Trump, they don't care.</p><p>And America should realize this is how you can lose a Republic where you have appointees of the President and bureaucrats to answer to virtually no one talk about manipulating the law in order to overturn a presidential election and attack a president they don't like.  They don't like for any substantial reason.  They don't like him because they fired -- he fired his buddy, McCabe's buddy and Rosenstein's buddy, James Comey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  At the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein, by the way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON:  Right.  A fight about a personnel decision.  And they're going to overthrow the presidency.  And, you know, let's be clear here, Mueller is a successor to this coup attempt.  He's -- the appointment flows out of all of these discussions and we should recognize that the effort to overthrow the President is continuing with Justice Department help through this out-of-control Mueller investigation.</p><p>DOBBS:  And without so much as -- and effort, explanation, rationalization, this is -- we're watching McCabe basically saying he was doing it for the country's own good.  Here's a man sworn to enforce the law, to enforce the constitution of the United States, to defend the United States committing subversions, in my opinion, sedition and treason.  And those who want to say that we're not at war should reference the war on terror that we've been engaged in for 19 -- almost 19 years.</p><p>This is outrageous and we haven't heard a word from the leadership of the Republican Party about arresting these people.  We haven't heard a word from the so-called establishment that is supposed to hold the tenants values of this -- of this great nation and primacy.  They are just simply averting their eyes.  It's appalling, it's disgusting, there should be outrage throughout the country in both parties across every part of this nation.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I agree.  And the problem with the Justice Department is that Mueller is still running the Justice Department effectively.  And so any effort to uncover what went on behind this investigation and this is what went on behind this investigation, runs into the Mueller juggernaut.  And, you know, Attorney General Barr, he needs to step up and defend the President.  You know, the argument for -- against Barr was will he stand up to President Trump?</p><p>And I think the test for Attorney General Barr is, will he stand up for President Trump and for the rule of law against these deep stators and the establishment who don't care about our constitution.  You know, President Trump may survive this attack on him but maybe another President want.  And we'll lose our Republic and we won't even know it came.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I guarantee he will survive these attacks.  He's already demonstrated that he is stronger than the entire lot of these extraordinary venal, vicious actors in the Justice Department.  What may not survive is his Justice Department and the FBI.  And Tom Fitton, should they survive?  Because they are the root of the corruption and the malignancy of the others wanted to subscribe to this administration.</p><p>When, in point of fact, they have been the perpetrators of wrongdoing from the months preceding the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p>FITTON:  Well, my -- you know, I'm a small government conservative.  I think all government agencies should be subject to scrutiny every year before any money is given to them.  And given the corruption at the DOJ, I think we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The problem with that is, the appropriators as well as the investigators are also deep state actors and have been working just as viciously, frankly, behind the scenes as the people in the Justice Department and the FBI.  My god.</p><p>FITTON:  You know, the problem with the FBI is the current leadership frankly, Mr. Ray has zero interest in reforming the organization.</p><p>DOBBS:  Where is he?</p><p>FITTON:  That's why --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, we don't even hear from him.</p><p>FITTON:  He is missing in action when it comes to standing and uncovering -- I -- uncovering the corruption and to a degree he said anything, Lou, he's been excusing the corruption.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Exactly.  Tom, it's always good to have you here.  I wish we're talking in better circumstances.  But, as you intimated at the outset, the Republic itself is at stake here.</p><p>FITTON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the silence is absolutely chilling.  Thank you so much, Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON:  Welcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  And again, as always, and I mean it even when I don't say, thanks for everything that you and Judicial Watch do.  Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome.  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, one of the most embarrassing figures in modern American political history.  Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken his anti- American message overseas embarrassing the United States in front of our allies and many of his former colleagues in the Obama administration.  It's a shadow government.  We'll take that up and more right after this quick break.  Ed Rollins joins me.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A New York Times report today saying former President Obama is counseling the Dems' 2020 hopefuls but he will not be giving the New York Times assures us, anyone, anyone, not even Joe Biden, his endorsement.  His former Vice President taking a page out of his old Obama playbook.  Apologizing for America overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents.  It makes us an embarrassing in the example we're setting.  Well, I should stop.  As my mother would say, this too shall pass.  We will be back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  I wouldn't bet on it.  In any way, shape, or fashion, at least not led by one Joe Biden.  He's just blown his chances for 2020 in all likelihood.  Biden, it seems forgot one important lesson from his former boss.  President Obama at least waited until he had been elected and was in office before slamming America overseas.  Well, joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst Ed Rollins.  Ed, great to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  What a day.  Let's start with Biden, he just blew it, didn't he?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he certainly did something outrageous than anybody I've ever known.  A former Vice President to go before this important meeting and condemn the America is just outrageous.  You often do that if you're a presidential candidate in Iowa, or (INAUDIBLE) New Hampshire or somewhere.  But to go before our allies and to basically take apart the administration's position is just outrageous.</p><p>DOBBS:  When President Obama did that, his famous apology tour in Berlin in Cairo, he had been elected.</p><p>ROLLINS:  He'd been elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, there was a chance to make things right in 2012.  Romney didn't make that happen.  I think Biden can just kiss it goodbye, personally.  I would like to turn to this extraordinary piece on \"60 MINUTES\" in which Andrew McCabe actually confessed to trying to overthrow the President of the United States, Ed.  And where's the outrage from the Republican leadership?  I mean, I think the whole country should be just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  I have to tell you, from when I sat and watched it last night I was outraged because there's a conspiracy going on.  First of all, the 25th Amendment is for a president to step aside if he has health issues or something else.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Or a Vice President to step in if the President is incapacitated.  It is not about removing a president from office.  And I think to a certain extent, you think the Justice Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  These guys were not only obviously corrupt, they were stupid beyond imagining for people who were supposedly trained in law and respectful of it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the fact that before this, any evidence that basically still plotting and scheming to take out a President of the United States and talking to members of the cabinet according to him with the full support of the acting attorney general, I just found it appalling.  It's so un-American, it's like --</p><p>DOBBS:  So, where is the Republican Party?  Why aren't the leaders of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, every republican governor, every Republican governor, every Republican in this country standing up and saying end the witch-hunt, end all of this non-sense, it's obviously a cabal that has been working and the conspiracy to overthrow the President of the United States or tacitly they are endorsing it with their silence.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, their silence is terrible.  The reality is we are in a fight of our life.  President Trump basically doing everything he promised to do, moving the ball forward.  But the Democrats are really revved up and they're going to do everything they can to stop him.  From lawsuits to what have you.  And they're not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in the land that will join this president on the basis of his declaration of a national emergency.  I -- we know then that the corruption has absolutely grasped our judiciary system as well.  We got every indication that that's happened.  But for them to enjoin a president in a matter of national security would be an act against the Republic, the constitution itself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you and I have been around long enough to know that's going to happen.  And at the end of the day it's going to end up being in the Supreme Court.  And the Supreme Court has to rule in the President's favor at the end of the day here.  But it's going to go through the process.  There's -- all of these political attorney generals and what have you who want to make (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS:  But honorable, honest and judges who are not overwhelmed by their partisan prejudice would understand that that it could be absolutely litigated in our judiciary.  Without enjoining until a decision by the high court.  That would be the honorable thing to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the absolute honoring thing to do.  And I would -- I would hope the Supreme Court is stepping very quickly if they started out this process.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  I worry about this court and what more -- the more that we learned about Chief Justice John Roberts, I'm not saying when about, what will or will not occur in that high court.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I'm hopeful in the end he will do the right thing.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Well, we can all hope.  But I'd rather have certainty.</p><p>ROLLINS:  In the end.  In the end.  There is no certainty -- there's no certainty in life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there isn't.  But in this constitution there should be absolute certainty.  Ed Rollins, thanks much.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  We appreciate it.  We'd like to hear your thoughts on all this.  Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Coming up here next, Chicago Police, they want answers from actor, Jussie Smollett after their investigation into an alleged hate crime reverses.  That and much more coming up next.  We'll be talking with Washington Times' Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Before we go to break, let's take a look at the U.S. national debt as if we don't have enough problems already.  $22 trillion and climbing.  We're coming right back after this.  Stay brave of heart, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump in Miami today for claiming the days of socialism in the western hemisphere are numbered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If you choose this path, you have the opportunity to help forge a safe and prosperous future for all of the people of Venezuela.  Or you can choose the second path, continuing to support Maduro.  If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out.  You will lose everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump also using his speech to continue to express his supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.  A reported hate crime in Chicago looking more and more like a hate hoax.  Chicago Police say they no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim.  And they are pushing for a follow-up interview which his attorney -- Smollett's attorneys have resisted.  The police request -- imagine that, a request comes amid new reports that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault.</p><p>Both men have been questioned and released without charges.  Reverend Al Sharpton, we want to point out, responding to the news.  And Sharpton saying Smollett should face as he put it, \"accountability to the maximum\" if it's found the actor stage the attack.  Joining us tonight, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times Columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Tammy, good to see you.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, everybody.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Smollett and the hoax.  I have to give Reverend Al Sharpton great credit for standing up which by the way all of the candidates who have been commenting on this, the Democratic candidates have not had the courage to do.  Your thoughts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  The candidates seem to be wanting to pretend this never happened.  They get away without law because then the media also steps away from it and stops discussing it.  But Reverend Al Sharpton of course is very well known for promoting one of the original hoaxes, if you will with a young woman named Tawana Brawley who made some accusations against police officers which ended up being false.</p><p>So it's fascinating that he would actually take that position.  So good for him if he has found, you know, the right direction.  And maybe -- I don't know, maybe he's thinking that Mr. Smollett deserves a program on MSNBC like he has.  Who knows what that end result should be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you brought that to us with a sense of appropriate justice.</p><p>BRUCE:  Absolutely.  Hanging every day, every day.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's turn to Venezuela, the President today importantly going to Miami as the setting to announce his views and judgment and policies on the hemisphere and Venezuela in particular.  Your thoughts?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Perfect of course.  We know for South Florida it has a lot of people who are immigrants who have experienced in our lifetimes very recently, the impact of totalitarianism and tyrants.  So when he --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Venezuelans by the way.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, Venezuelans and Cubans.  So when he's speaking it happens to be the right thing, of course it is the thing that the President believes in.  But it also speaks to the Venezuelans that are already in South Florida that are coming to South Florida but speaking to that core of people in this region that understand the importance of freedom, this nation, capitalism and the value of the support of the American Presidents.</p><p>And so it's going to make I think a big different for people there and sends a very strong message back home about what his intentions are.</p><p>DOBBS:  I think he had a couple of other audiences as well in mind as he spoke.  And one of this of course the American people when he said this country will never be socialist.  That was a loud straightforward challenge to everyone of the -- what seemed to be every one of the Democratic hopefuls so far.  At least announced, this is not going to be an easy campaign for you because you've already gone to the left and lined up against this country and our traditions.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  It's the first education they may be receiving about real life.  These are -- especially young people, Miss Ocasio-Cortez obviously seems to not have any major education about the impact of socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Or minor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Or a minor education on the nape on how it destroys lives, on how it destroys countries and economies.  So, this is going to be her first indication about courtesy of the President, about real life and what socialism does to people.</p><p>DOBBS:  This could be an expensive tutorial for AOC if it moves into, as it appears, it is about to, into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  This is -- it could be.  And she won't understand this, I think, until 2020.  The benefit of this education for the American people about what the Democratic Party is becoming, and how everybody is running on this kind of an issue.</p><p>The President stands as the bulwark against this framework and as a reminder about what -- how greatness really can be brought into our lives.  And it's not through certainly that totalitarianism by any stretch.</p><p>DOBBS:  And most to me, it's very encouraging to see the presidential tracking poll with the president's popularity.  I had approval rising at 52 percent.  I confess that I personally think it should be significantly higher, and I hope it soon will be.</p><p>BRUCE:  It probably is, as a matter of fact.  When you think about the --</p><p>DOBBS:  I'd like to see it expressed in black-and-white.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Like you, I have faith in the forgotten man and woman in this country.  But this president, I think now, has turned a very important corner.  I think the national left-wing media understands it.  It is beginning to understand it.  That's why they are not quite as free with their nonsense as they have been.</p><p>In other words, Jim Acosta is receding quite a bit, as his colleagues, I think, on the left, in that White House briefing room, for example, it's one of the barometers of this all.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's good news.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy, good to have you here.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Up next, British lawmakers say Facebook is acting like gangsters with our personal information.  We take that up.  Now, the Europeans are doing something about it.  Why in the world isn't the United States?  Isn't privacy an even bigger right for Americans?  We take that up with cyber expert, Morgan Wright.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.  Oh, Google, Facebook, gangsters.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Headlines tonight, Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, claims he has \"a lot of discretion on border wall funding from President Trump's national emergency declaration,\" despite receiving a direct order from the President of the United States to secure the border.</p><p>Shanahan says \"I'm not required to do anything.\"  Well, he'd be required to do something, one would think, like pack his bags and get out of there.  A North Carolina elections board, beginning deliberations over election fraud allegations, Republican Mark Harris leading in last month's ninth congressional district election.</p><p>The board consists of three Democrats, two Republicans, they will decide whether to certify a winner or order a new election, Harris, by the way, leading Democrat Dan McCready, by 905 votes, but again, the vote that may count as the 3-2 vote on the elections board.</p><p>A new report from the U.K. parliament, calling Facebook, digital gangsters, for failing to thwart attempts by Russia to influence elections, the report accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of contempt of parliament.</p><p>Joining me now, Morgan Wright, Former Senior Advisor in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, Former Law Enforcement Advisor to the Republican National Committee, Cyber Security Expert, Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, EXPERT, CYBERSECURITY:  Hey, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me start with, first, the gangsters that Facebook and Google.  Who knew that they were going to be declared gangsters first by the U.K., rather than the United States?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, I don't see Al Pacino playing Mark Zuckerberg in a movie, you know, about gangsters, but yes, you know.  And Lou, we've talked about this before about why is the -- why is the E.U. ahead of us with things like the General Data Protection Regulations, privacy?</p><p>And I'll tell you, the only thing I can think of as it comes down to money, because there's a -- Facebook has figured out the Google playbook, which is, spend a lot of money, spend a lot of time here in D.C., on K Street, M Street, whatever all the streets are, and you know, get in there and lobby people, spread lots of money around.</p><p>And Lou, during the hearings, how many members of Congress did we see ponder to Mark Zuckerberg, hoping to relocate shit jobs in their district.  I mean, this is one reason why you don't have it because everybody's hoping to get something from Zuckerberg.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and -- but it reinforces the impression.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  That a half dozen of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have such concentrated economic and technological and political power, that they are almost now so large that it is impossible to rein them in.  Is that fear well-placed?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  And I'll tell you, Lou, you and I talked about this awhile back too, when we talked about how globalism is killing patriotism.  And all of these companies have taken the advantage of the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) well guess what?</p><p>It's coming home to roost now, because now that these companies want to be global.  Your subject to the E.U. regulations, the U.K. regulations, you know, Germany's regulations, all of these other places that actually place a premium on privacy, for too long self-regulation, they've tried it, it hasn't worked.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is the self-regulation go away.  And you're going to see more government interventions starting overseas, and hopefully, it'll end up over here, not to put them out of business, but, man, we've got to put a check on the seemingly unchecked power that they have right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  There is no countervailing influence in our economy, or our society, or our body politic to the awesome power of big tech.  That's simply a fact, and to that, the power of Wall Street and Corporate America.</p><p>And right now, the middle class in this country, if they were not the champion, the President of the United States would be defenseless against an onslaught that had rolled back the middle class for 20 years, and which under this president, is once again, growing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.  And look, you know, something interesting that came out of the U.K. report too, is they talked about -- even though Zuckerberg, in front of Congress, and sent his minions over there to say we don' sell any data, it's clear they've been selling data.  It's true that they've been using apps to spy on the activities of users and their competitors.</p><p>Look, this is the modern version.</p><p>DOBBS:  And even those who are not users.</p><p>WRIGHT:  --have that power, right, absolutely.  And the KGB only wished they would've had this power back in the day.  You know, our NSA and FBI don't have near the power that Facebook, Google, Amazon.  You know, these folks have to spy into the lives of us, but there are no consequences for it.  At some point, there has to be stick because the carrot hasn't worked.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  This is a president who is keenly aware --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- that U.S. policies haven't worked.  He is also confronted now by ZTE, as a favor to President Xi.  He backed off of the consequences for ZTE, Huawei, now paying the consequences for its role in spying, but doing so, only within our court system, not as a result of a national security response from the part of the United States.</p><p>How much longer can we go without saying straightforwardly to the Chinese, there will be a response on national security terms if you continue to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from this country each year and carry out acts of espionage nonstop.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, I think Gordon Chang's been on with before he talked about poor Chinese economically, I think they need to put -- they need to put the hammer down on Huawei.  It's time to put Huawei and ZTE out of business.</p><p>And I'll tell you why, Lou, the upcoming 5G, Huawei is doing everything they can to get their technology into these countries, but you've Australia, New Zealand, Japan.  The U.K. said it's going to take, you know -- they probably going to have to spend five years and $2-$3 billion to meet the U.K. standards.</p><p>The best way to stop this economic espionage is to quit lulling the government of China to subsidize the rail system, the electronic system, the communication systems to where it's all Chinese infrastructure.  And there's no U.S. infrastructure in play.  We can't -- it's not a fair fight.</p><p>So, I think they've got to put the hammer down on these guys.  One of the ways to stop espionage is to keep their equipment out of our infrastructure.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the -- and the administration to its credit is trying to do exactly that.  Huawei, at the same time, is bragging they are now too big to stop.  And this is -- this again, is advised rhetoric from the PLA and from President Xi, himself.</p><p>The Communist Party is now flaunting their economic and political and military power.  The United States is -- has to simply respond, and hopefully, before it becomes a military response.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  But it looks as though we are absolutely vulnerable in cyberspace right now.  Is that a correct impression?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, absolutely.  Lou, we have -- from our power grid, to our nuclear plants, to you know -- the rail system transportation.  A lot of things are still so vulnerable because we're so fragmented.  We don't have --</p><p>Even though we might have an overall plan, we don't have an overall coherent ability to secure all the things we need to do, why, because the private sector owns 85 percent of the critical infrastructure that's out there.</p><p>The government can provide a lot of support, a lot of help, but were the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese?  And even the North Koreans are exploiting.  They're exploiting all of these gaps between the different infrastructures.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>WRIGHT:  The lack of coherence among the security plans.  And the old technology that's out there.  We've got out-of-date machines that are still running windows that haven't been supported for five or six years.</p><p>DOBBS:  What Morgan is not saying, that 85 percent that is in the private sector, is often run by CEOs and boards that are frankly, friendlier to Chinese policies than they are to the policies of the Trump administration and the U.S. government.  And that's got to change, straightaway.  I didn't put words in your mouth, did I, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Lou, you're always right.  That's one lesson I've learned.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, thanks so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you, Morgan Wright.</p><p>Up next, New York Governor Bill -- New York Mayor, Bill de Blasio says AOC doesn't know what she is talking about.  We take that up after the break with American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio putting freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her place after Amazon decided not to build its headquarters in Long Island City.  Cortez claimed the failed deal would free up $4 billion in taxes incentives for the city to use elsewhere.  The good mayor reminded her even a socialist understood this, at least one of the socialists did, reminding her the money would only be available after the city secured the Amazon jobs and revenue and that it wasn't in a budget somewhere.</p><p>Radical freshman congresswoman, there's a lot of those going around.  Ilhan Omar scheduled to raise money in March for the Hamas link council on American-Islamic relations.  Omar received $5,000 from them during a run for Congress.  She since repeatedly made headlines for her anti-Semitic remarks most recently suggesting Republican support of Israel is bought and paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC.  At some point anti-Semitic remarks result in being anti -- an anti-Semite it seems.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Matt Schlapp.  He's the chairman of the American Conservative Union.  Why is it that the Left is suddenly so reluctant to say what is obvious that they have an anti-Semitic strain within their party and on Capitol Hill and aren't dealing with it?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, I completely agree with you, Lou, but I asked -- I actually think it's more cynical than this.  I think the Democratic Party has really shed its longtime support of the State of Israel.  I think they're moving away from this policy point of view and I think it gives Donald Trump who has done everything he said he would do with getting rid of the Iran deal, moving the embassy a great chance with these voters not with the not with the Liberal leaders potentially of this community but with everyday voters who can see anti-Semitism when it's so clear.</p><p>DOBBS:  Anti-Semitism, we saw reports today that the yellow vest in France you know, blaming them for a strain of anti-Semitism within France leaving out the entire ruling body and class in France that -- I mean there's anti-Semitism has been a huge issue in France.  It is not only anti-Israel, it is pro-Palestinian, and the expression is found throughout the political structure of France.  This looks like another gambit to lay off blame for what is a strengthening strain of anti-Semitism in France and indeed Europe.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.  And look, I think what's happening -- what's ironic, Lou, is what's happening in Israel is this once socialist country has really been embracing free markets and innovation and really has become a kindred soul in one of our closest allies to obviously to America and to our way of life into our values.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people that just hate everything about the idea of innovation of entrepreneurs or free markets of the little guy being able to go to market and take his ideas to the customers.  And they are against every aspect of that and I love the fact that Israel in America and freedom-loving people including the people of South America, including the freedom lovers in Venezuela.  We're working together to rid the world of this dreaded socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dreaded socialism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism and that really what I was asking you about.  Socialism is as the President assured is this country will never be socialistic.  What is in question tonight is whether or not one guy you know, is going to be the successor to Maduro.  Will he or will he not and what is your sense from where you look?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a great question, Lou.  And I worry I think it's a little bit of a jump ball right now.  I think the President, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo we're trying to do everything they can to use power in influence to stand up for the Venezuelan people in this new president Mr. Guaido.  And Maduro is a -- is a tin-pot dictator.  And you know they have a lot of power at the end of their reigns.  And we'll see if he's able to use that power.  But I'm hopeful that the right side will win out in Venezuela.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's a lot of hope running around this country right now primarily because President Trump is indeed the leader of the free world.  My question to you is why is the establishment in Washington D.C. not screaming for the arrest of Andrew McCabe and for all of his cohorts and the DOJ and the FBI?  Why is it that there seems to be almost a satisfaction in the status quo no matter how rancid and corrupt in the swamp that is D.C.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Look, I'm disgusted by it and I guess there's only one person who can do something about it and that's Bill Barr.  Is he either going to do this or he's not, and I'd be greatly disappointed if he doesn't.  And I think --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why the hell isn't the Republican Party's standing up and demanding his arrest?  Why --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You know why.</p><p>DOBBS:  I do not know why.  I would not be asking you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I think the reason is because they don't want the controversy of actually taking the deep state on because they might be coming its next victim.</p><p>DOBBS:  Then their doubtless wonders and why in the world should we tolerate these Koch brothers hired excuses for legislators and representatives.  They represent nothing but Koch brothers, the Wall Street, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber, they are -- it's enough to make you sick.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Lou, if that's where the Republican Party stays, it will deserve to lose beyond the ash heap of history.  We either going to represent the people or we're not and if we don't, we deserve to lose and we ought to get out of the way.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's very simple.  They either follow President Trump or they are going to be on the scrap heap of history.  The problem is they could take the Republican with them.  Matt, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Good to see you too.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the dark political agenda of the deep state, their efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald Trump -- that's right -- to overthrow the U.S. government.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Andrew McCabe, fired as acting director of the FBI last night on 60 Minutes confessed he was involved in an effort to remove well, President Trump from office and to overthrow the government of the United States.  Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton says McCabe, the Department of Justice and the FBI were trying to overthrow the government and this republic.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT JUDICIAL WATCH:  If there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt the media would be calling it a coup.  But because you've got an elected bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this, and if the target is President Trump, they don't care.  And Americans should realize this is how you can lose a republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Tomorrow night, Congressman Mark Green, David Bossie, and Attorney Harmeet Dhillon among our guests tomorrow.  We hope you'll join us.  Thanks for being with us tonight.  Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs.  And again, thanks for being with us.  Good night.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2183277937</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VG5-1901-JBHT-D036-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

This aversion is President Trump and his administration on full display this weekend as former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe actually confessed that he, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and a host of corrupt FBI and Department of Justice actors sought to unseat a sitting president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR:  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.  What I can say is the Deputy Attorney General was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confession.  Where is the outrage about their treason?  Where is the Republican Party and its leaders demanding they arrest McCabe and the rest of his cohorts who conspired to overthrow the President of the United States?  McCabe's admission of the coup attempted by the corrupt deep state went without as much a follow-up question by CBS.  Where is the national media?  Left-wing, though it may be, it in demanding answers, accountability, and transparency for this aversion and outright sedition?</p><p>Judicial watch President, Tom Fitton, Radio Show Host, Tammy Bruce among our guest here tonight to discuss those questions and their answers.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, over the weekend calling the United States embarrassing.  As globalist foreign leaders and the radical Dems applaud their approval of his careless and outrageous remarks on foreign soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents or turning their back on refugees on our border.  Americans know that's not right.  The American people understand, please, because it makes us embarrassing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Biden is the embarrassment.  What should be embarrassing to Biden is that he can't even garner the support of his former president, President Barack Obama.  Obama saying he will not endorse a Democrat for president even if Biden decides to run.  We take up Biden's embarrassing trip overseas.  Republican Strategist, Ed Rollins, Matt Schlapp joins us.  And President Trump today in Miami issuing his strong support for Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.</p><p>The President's message clear and definitive.  The United States will never be a socialist nation, we take up the President's address and much more here tonight.  Our top story, former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe confessed there was in fact a deep state conspiracy among his cohorts in the Justice Department and FBI to remove President Trump from office.  Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCCABE:  Counting votes, or possible vote.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The former acting FBI director told \"60 MINUTES\" the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein openly discussed how many cabinet members would support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President.  But the FBI's former general counsel, James Baker who met contemporaneously with McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page about their conversations with Rosenstein testified the effort went further.</p><p>\"I had the impression the Deputy Attorney General had already discussed this with two members in the President's cabinet.  And that they were on board with this concept already.\"    On Twitter the President responded to McCabe on \"60 MINUTES,\" \"While, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.  He and Rod Rosenstein look like they were planning a very illegal act.\"</p><p>McCabe and others say the President's May 2017 firing of Director James Comey left the FBI and Justice Department in turmoil.  And they concerned that the firing was designed to be synced the Russian probe and obstruct justice.</p><p>MCCABE:  The Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire into the White House.  He said, I never get search when I going to the White House.  I think the General Counsel had a heart attack.  When he got up off the floor he said, I -- that's a bridge too far.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  But Baker who could face criminal penalties for lying to Congressional investigators testified \"My recollection is that there were discussions about it over longer period than the course of one meeting, a couple of days.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  McCabe said Rosenstein initially resisted a Special Counsel because the Deputy Attorney General worried he might lose his job.  A senior department official told Fox tonight the Special Counsel was appointed \"to ensure that the Russia investigation was truly independent and without bias.\"  Something the official said that McCabe could not have accomplished.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Catherine, thanks very much.  Catherine Herridge.  Well, joining us tonight, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch.  One of the country's most effective watchdog groups.  And he's worked with the International Policy Forum, the Leadership Institute, Accuracy in Media, among others.  Tom, good to have you with us.  What we just heard from the folks at \"60 MINUTES\" over at CBS, although they didn't ask a follow-up question, it was an outright confession by McCabe that he was committing felonies and an attempt to overthrow the President of the United States along with a number of his colleagues.  Your reaction when you heard it?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Well, it's extraordinary.  It confirms early reports last year that this discussion took place.  You know, Lou, if there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt we'll be -- we'll be calling it a coup.  But because you got -- I don't like the bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this and it's -- the target is President Trump, they don't care.</p><p>And America should realize this is how you can lose a Republic where you have appointees of the President and bureaucrats to answer to virtually no one talk about manipulating the law in order to overturn a presidential election and attack a president they don't like.  They don't like for any substantial reason.  They don't like him because they fired -- he fired his buddy, McCabe's buddy and Rosenstein's buddy, James Comey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  At the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein, by the way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON:  Right.  A fight about a personnel decision.  And they're going to overthrow the presidency.  And, you know, let's be clear here, Mueller is a successor to this coup attempt.  He's -- the appointment flows out of all of these discussions and we should recognize that the effort to overthrow the President is continuing with Justice Department help through this out-of-control Mueller investigation.</p><p>DOBBS:  And without so much as -- and effort, explanation, rationalization, this is -- we're watching McCabe basically saying he was doing it for the country's own good.  Here's a man sworn to enforce the law, to enforce the constitution of the United States, to defend the United States committing subversions, in my opinion, sedition and treason.  And those who want to say that we're not at war should reference the war on terror that we've been engaged in for 19 -- almost 19 years.</p><p>This is outrageous and we haven't heard a word from the leadership of the Republican Party about arresting these people.  We haven't heard a word from the so-called establishment that is supposed to hold the tenants values of this -- of this great nation and primacy.  They are just simply averting their eyes.  It's appalling, it's disgusting, there should be outrage throughout the country in both parties across every part of this nation.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I agree.  And the problem with the Justice Department is that Mueller is still running the Justice Department effectively.  And so any effort to uncover what went on behind this investigation and this is what went on behind this investigation, runs into the Mueller juggernaut.  And, you know, Attorney General Barr, he needs to step up and defend the President.  You know, the argument for -- against Barr was will he stand up to President Trump?</p><p>And I think the test for Attorney General Barr is, will he stand up for President Trump and for the rule of law against these deep stators and the establishment who don't care about our constitution.  You know, President Trump may survive this attack on him but maybe another President want.  And we'll lose our Republic and we won't even know it came.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I guarantee he will survive these attacks.  He's already demonstrated that he is stronger than the entire lot of these extraordinary venal, vicious actors in the Justice Department.  What may not survive is his Justice Department and the FBI.  And Tom Fitton, should they survive?  Because they are the root of the corruption and the malignancy of the others wanted to subscribe to this administration.</p><p>When, in point of fact, they have been the perpetrators of wrongdoing from the months preceding the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p>FITTON:  Well, my -- you know, I'm a small government conservative.  I think all government agencies should be subject to scrutiny every year before any money is given to them.  And given the corruption at the DOJ, I think we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The problem with that is, the appropriators as well as the investigators are also deep state actors and have been working just as viciously, frankly, behind the scenes as the people in the Justice Department and the FBI.  My god.</p><p>FITTON:  You know, the problem with the FBI is the current leadership frankly, Mr. Ray has zero interest in reforming the organization.</p><p>DOBBS:  Where is he?</p><p>FITTON:  That's why --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, we don't even hear from him.</p><p>FITTON:  He is missing in action when it comes to standing and uncovering -- I -- uncovering the corruption and to a degree he said anything, Lou, he's been excusing the corruption.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Exactly.  Tom, it's always good to have you here.  I wish we're talking in better circumstances.  But, as you intimated at the outset, the Republic itself is at stake here.</p><p>FITTON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the silence is absolutely chilling.  Thank you so much, Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON:  Welcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  And again, as always, and I mean it even when I don't say, thanks for everything that you and Judicial Watch do.  Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome.  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, one of the most embarrassing figures in modern American political history.  Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken his anti- American message overseas embarrassing the United States in front of our allies and many of his former colleagues in the Obama administration.  It's a shadow government.  We'll take that up and more right after this quick break.  Ed Rollins joins me.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A New York Times report today saying former President Obama is counseling the Dems' 2020 hopefuls but he will not be giving the New York Times assures us, anyone, anyone, not even Joe Biden, his endorsement.  His former Vice President taking a page out of his old Obama playbook.  Apologizing for America overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents.  It makes us an embarrassing in the example we're setting.  Well, I should stop.  As my mother would say, this too shall pass.  We will be back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  I wouldn't bet on it.  In any way, shape, or fashion, at least not led by one Joe Biden.  He's just blown his chances for 2020 in all likelihood.  Biden, it seems forgot one important lesson from his former boss.  President Obama at least waited until he had been elected and was in office before slamming America overseas.  Well, joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst Ed Rollins.  Ed, great to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  What a day.  Let's start with Biden, he just blew it, didn't he?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he certainly did something outrageous than anybody I've ever known.  A former Vice President to go before this important meeting and condemn the America is just outrageous.  You often do that if you're a presidential candidate in Iowa, or (INAUDIBLE) New Hampshire or somewhere.  But to go before our allies and to basically take apart the administration's position is just outrageous.</p><p>DOBBS:  When President Obama did that, his famous apology tour in Berlin in Cairo, he had been elected.</p><p>ROLLINS:  He'd been elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, there was a chance to make things right in 2012.  Romney didn't make that happen.  I think Biden can just kiss it goodbye, personally.  I would like to turn to this extraordinary piece on \"60 MINUTES\" in which Andrew McCabe actually confessed to trying to overthrow the President of the United States, Ed.  And where's the outrage from the Republican leadership?  I mean, I think the whole country should be just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  I have to tell you, from when I sat and watched it last night I was outraged because there's a conspiracy going on.  First of all, the 25th Amendment is for a president to step aside if he has health issues or something else.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Or a Vice President to step in if the President is incapacitated.  It is not about removing a president from office.  And I think to a certain extent, you think the Justice Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  These guys were not only obviously corrupt, they were stupid beyond imagining for people who were supposedly trained in law and respectful of it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the fact that before this, any evidence that basically still plotting and scheming to take out a President of the United States and talking to members of the cabinet according to him with the full support of the acting attorney general, I just found it appalling.  It's so un-American, it's like --</p><p>DOBBS:  So, where is the Republican Party?  Why aren't the leaders of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, every republican governor, every Republican governor, every Republican in this country standing up and saying end the witch-hunt, end all of this non-sense, it's obviously a cabal that has been working and the conspiracy to overthrow the President of the United States or tacitly they are endorsing it with their silence.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, their silence is terrible.  The reality is we are in a fight of our life.  President Trump basically doing everything he promised to do, moving the ball forward.  But the Democrats are really revved up and they're going to do everything they can to stop him.  From lawsuits to what have you.  And they're not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in the land that will join this president on the basis of his declaration of a national emergency.  I -- we know then that the corruption has absolutely grasped our judiciary system as well.  We got every indication that that's happened.  But for them to enjoin a president in a matter of national security would be an act against the Republic, the constitution itself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you and I have been around long enough to know that's going to happen.  And at the end of the day it's going to end up being in the Supreme Court.  And the Supreme Court has to rule in the President's favor at the end of the day here.  But it's going to go through the process.  There's -- all of these political attorney generals and what have you who want to make (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS:  But honorable, honest and judges who are not overwhelmed by their partisan prejudice would understand that that it could be absolutely litigated in our judiciary.  Without enjoining until a decision by the high court.  That would be the honorable thing to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the absolute honoring thing to do.  And I would -- I would hope the Supreme Court is stepping very quickly if they started out this process.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  I worry about this court and what more -- the more that we learned about Chief Justice John Roberts, I'm not saying when about, what will or will not occur in that high court.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I'm hopeful in the end he will do the right thing.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Well, we can all hope.  But I'd rather have certainty.</p><p>ROLLINS:  In the end.  In the end.  There is no certainty -- there's no certainty in life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there isn't.  But in this constitution there should be absolute certainty.  Ed Rollins, thanks much.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  We appreciate it.  We'd like to hear your thoughts on all this.  Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Coming up here next, Chicago Police, they want answers from actor, Jussie Smollett after their investigation into an alleged hate crime reverses.  That and much more coming up next.  We'll be talking with Washington Times' Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Before we go to break, let's take a look at the U.S. national debt as if we don't have enough problems already.  $22 trillion and climbing.  We're coming right back after this.  Stay brave of heart, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump in Miami today for claiming the days of socialism in the western hemisphere are numbered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If you choose this path, you have the opportunity to help forge a safe and prosperous future for all of the people of Venezuela.  Or you can choose the second path, continuing to support Maduro.  If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out.  You will lose everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump also using his speech to continue to express his supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.  A reported hate crime in Chicago looking more and more like a hate hoax.  Chicago Police say they no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim.  And they are pushing for a follow-up interview which his attorney -- Smollett's attorneys have resisted.  The police request -- imagine that, a request comes amid new reports that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault.</p><p>Both men have been questioned and released without charges.  Reverend Al Sharpton, we want to point out, responding to the news.  And Sharpton saying Smollett should face as he put it, \"accountability to the maximum\" if it's found the actor stage the attack.  Joining us tonight, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times Columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Tammy, good to see you.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, everybody.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Smollett and the hoax.  I have to give Reverend Al Sharpton great credit for standing up which by the way all of the candidates who have been commenting on this, the Democratic candidates have not had the courage to do.  Your thoughts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  The candidates seem to be wanting to pretend this never happened.  They get away without law because then the media also steps away from it and stops discussing it.  But Reverend Al Sharpton of course is very well known for promoting one of the original hoaxes, if you will with a young woman named Tawana Brawley who made some accusations against police officers which ended up being false.</p><p>So it's fascinating that he would actually take that position.  So good for him if he has found, you know, the right direction.  And maybe -- I don't know, maybe he's thinking that Mr. Smollett deserves a program on MSNBC like he has.  Who knows what that end result should be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you brought that to us with a sense of appropriate justice.</p><p>BRUCE:  Absolutely.  Hanging every day, every day.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's turn to Venezuela, the President today importantly going to Miami as the setting to announce his views and judgment and policies on the hemisphere and Venezuela in particular.  Your thoughts?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Perfect of course.  We know for South Florida it has a lot of people who are immigrants who have experienced in our lifetimes very recently, the impact of totalitarianism and tyrants.  So when he --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Venezuelans by the way.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, Venezuelans and Cubans.  So when he's speaking it happens to be the right thing, of course it is the thing that the President believes in.  But it also speaks to the Venezuelans that are already in South Florida that are coming to South Florida but speaking to that core of people in this region that understand the importance of freedom, this nation, capitalism and the value of the support of the American Presidents.</p><p>And so it's going to make I think a big different for people there and sends a very strong message back home about what his intentions are.</p><p>DOBBS:  I think he had a couple of other audiences as well in mind as he spoke.  And one of this of course the American people when he said this country will never be socialist.  That was a loud straightforward challenge to everyone of the -- what seemed to be every one of the Democratic hopefuls so far.  At least announced, this is not going to be an easy campaign for you because you've already gone to the left and lined up against this country and our traditions.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  It's the first education they may be receiving about real life.  These are -- especially young people, Miss Ocasio-Cortez obviously seems to not have any major education about the impact of socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Or minor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Or a minor education on the nape on how it destroys lives, on how it destroys countries and economies.  So, this is going to be her first indication about courtesy of the President, about real life and what socialism does to people.</p><p>DOBBS:  This could be an expensive tutorial for AOC if it moves into, as it appears, it is about to, into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  This is -- it could be.  And she won't understand this, I think, until 2020.  The benefit of this education for the American people about what the Democratic Party is becoming, and how everybody is running on this kind of an issue.</p><p>The President stands as the bulwark against this framework and as a reminder about what -- how greatness really can be brought into our lives.  And it's not through certainly that totalitarianism by any stretch.</p><p>DOBBS:  And most to me, it's very encouraging to see the presidential tracking poll with the president's popularity.  I had approval rising at 52 percent.  I confess that I personally think it should be significantly higher, and I hope it soon will be.</p><p>BRUCE:  It probably is, as a matter of fact.  When you think about the --</p><p>DOBBS:  I'd like to see it expressed in black-and-white.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Like you, I have faith in the forgotten man and woman in this country.  But this president, I think now, has turned a very important corner.  I think the national left-wing media understands it.  It is beginning to understand it.  That's why they are not quite as free with their nonsense as they have been.</p><p>In other words, Jim Acosta is receding quite a bit, as his colleagues, I think, on the left, in that White House briefing room, for example, it's one of the barometers of this all.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's good news.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy, good to have you here.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Up next, British lawmakers say Facebook is acting like gangsters with our personal information.  We take that up.  Now, the Europeans are doing something about it.  Why in the world isn't the United States?  Isn't privacy an even bigger right for Americans?  We take that up with cyber expert, Morgan Wright.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.  Oh, Google, Facebook, gangsters.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Headlines tonight, Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, claims he has \"a lot of discretion on border wall funding from President Trump's national emergency declaration,\" despite receiving a direct order from the President of the United States to secure the border.</p><p>Shanahan says \"I'm not required to do anything.\"  Well, he'd be required to do something, one would think, like pack his bags and get out of there.  A North Carolina elections board, beginning deliberations over election fraud allegations, Republican Mark Harris leading in last month's ninth congressional district election.</p><p>The board consists of three Democrats, two Republicans, they will decide whether to certify a winner or order a new election, Harris, by the way, leading Democrat Dan McCready, by 905 votes, but again, the vote that may count as the 3-2 vote on the elections board.</p><p>A new report from the U.K. parliament, calling Facebook, digital gangsters, for failing to thwart attempts by Russia to influence elections, the report accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of contempt of parliament.</p><p>Joining me now, Morgan Wright, Former Senior Advisor in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, Former Law Enforcement Advisor to the Republican National Committee, Cyber Security Expert, Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, EXPERT, CYBERSECURITY:  Hey, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me start with, first, the gangsters that Facebook and Google.  Who knew that they were going to be declared gangsters first by the U.K., rather than the United States?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, I don't see Al Pacino playing Mark Zuckerberg in a movie, you know, about gangsters, but yes, you know.  And Lou, we've talked about this before about why is the -- why is the E.U. ahead of us with things like the General Data Protection Regulations, privacy?</p><p>And I'll tell you, the only thing I can think of as it comes down to money, because there's a -- Facebook has figured out the Google playbook, which is, spend a lot of money, spend a lot of time here in D.C., on K Street, M Street, whatever all the streets are, and you know, get in there and lobby people, spread lots of money around.</p><p>And Lou, during the hearings, how many members of Congress did we see ponder to Mark Zuckerberg, hoping to relocate shit jobs in their district.  I mean, this is one reason why you don't have it because everybody's hoping to get something from Zuckerberg.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and -- but it reinforces the impression.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  That a half dozen of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have such concentrated economic and technological and political power, that they are almost now so large that it is impossible to rein them in.  Is that fear well-placed?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  And I'll tell you, Lou, you and I talked about this awhile back too, when we talked about how globalism is killing patriotism.  And all of these companies have taken the advantage of the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) well guess what?</p><p>It's coming home to roost now, because now that these companies want to be global.  Your subject to the E.U. regulations, the U.K. regulations, you know, Germany's regulations, all of these other places that actually place a premium on privacy, for too long self-regulation, they've tried it, it hasn't worked.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is the self-regulation go away.  And you're going to see more government interventions starting overseas, and hopefully, it'll end up over here, not to put them out of business, but, man, we've got to put a check on the seemingly unchecked power that they have right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  There is no countervailing influence in our economy, or our society, or our body politic to the awesome power of big tech.  That's simply a fact, and to that, the power of Wall Street and Corporate America.</p><p>And right now, the middle class in this country, if they were not the champion, the President of the United States would be defenseless against an onslaught that had rolled back the middle class for 20 years, and which under this president, is once again, growing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.  And look, you know, something interesting that came out of the U.K. report too, is they talked about -- even though Zuckerberg, in front of Congress, and sent his minions over there to say we don' sell any data, it's clear they've been selling data.  It's true that they've been using apps to spy on the activities of users and their competitors.</p><p>Look, this is the modern version.</p><p>DOBBS:  And even those who are not users.</p><p>WRIGHT:  --have that power, right, absolutely.  And the KGB only wished they would've had this power back in the day.  You know, our NSA and FBI don't have near the power that Facebook, Google, Amazon.  You know, these folks have to spy into the lives of us, but there are no consequences for it.  At some point, there has to be stick because the carrot hasn't worked.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  This is a president who is keenly aware --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- that U.S. policies haven't worked.  He is also confronted now by ZTE, as a favor to President Xi.  He backed off of the consequences for ZTE, Huawei, now paying the consequences for its role in spying, but doing so, only within our court system, not as a result of a national security response from the part of the United States.</p><p>How much longer can we go without saying straightforwardly to the Chinese, there will be a response on national security terms if you continue to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from this country each year and carry out acts of espionage nonstop.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, I think Gordon Chang's been on with before he talked about poor Chinese economically, I think they need to put -- they need to put the hammer down on Huawei.  It's time to put Huawei and ZTE out of business.</p><p>And I'll tell you why, Lou, the upcoming 5G, Huawei is doing everything they can to get their technology into these countries, but you've Australia, New Zealand, Japan.  The U.K. said it's going to take, you know -- they probably going to have to spend five years and $2-$3 billion to meet the U.K. standards.</p><p>The best way to stop this economic espionage is to quit lulling the government of China to subsidize the rail system, the electronic system, the communication systems to where it's all Chinese infrastructure.  And there's no U.S. infrastructure in play.  We can't -- it's not a fair fight.</p><p>So, I think they've got to put the hammer down on these guys.  One of the ways to stop espionage is to keep their equipment out of our infrastructure.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the -- and the administration to its credit is trying to do exactly that.  Huawei, at the same time, is bragging they are now too big to stop.  And this is -- this again, is advised rhetoric from the PLA and from President Xi, himself.</p><p>The Communist Party is now flaunting their economic and political and military power.  The United States is -- has to simply respond, and hopefully, before it becomes a military response.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  But it looks as though we are absolutely vulnerable in cyberspace right now.  Is that a correct impression?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, absolutely.  Lou, we have -- from our power grid, to our nuclear plants, to you know -- the rail system transportation.  A lot of things are still so vulnerable because we're so fragmented.  We don't have --</p><p>Even though we might have an overall plan, we don't have an overall coherent ability to secure all the things we need to do, why, because the private sector owns 85 percent of the critical infrastructure that's out there.</p><p>The government can provide a lot of support, a lot of help, but were the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese?  And even the North Koreans are exploiting.  They're exploiting all of these gaps between the different infrastructures.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>WRIGHT:  The lack of coherence among the security plans.  And the old technology that's out there.  We've got out-of-date machines that are still running windows that haven't been supported for five or six years.</p><p>DOBBS:  What Morgan is not saying, that 85 percent that is in the private sector, is often run by CEOs and boards that are frankly, friendlier to Chinese policies than they are to the policies of the Trump administration and the U.S. government.  And that's got to change, straightaway.  I didn't put words in your mouth, did I, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Lou, you're always right.  That's one lesson I've learned.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, thanks so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you, Morgan Wright.</p><p>Up next, New York Governor Bill -- New York Mayor, Bill de Blasio says AOC doesn't know what she is talking about.  We take that up after the break with American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio putting freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her place after Amazon decided not to build its headquarters in Long Island City.  Cortez claimed the failed deal would free up $4 billion in taxes incentives for the city to use elsewhere.  The good mayor reminded her even a socialist understood this, at least one of the socialists did, reminding her the money would only be available after the city secured the Amazon jobs and revenue and that it wasn't in a budget somewhere.</p><p>Radical freshman congresswoman, there's a lot of those going around.  Ilhan Omar scheduled to raise money in March for the Hamas link council on American-Islamic relations.  Omar received $5,000 from them during a run for Congress.  She since repeatedly made headlines for her anti-Semitic remarks most recently suggesting Republican support of Israel is bought and paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC.  At some point anti-Semitic remarks result in being anti -- an anti-Semite it seems.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Matt Schlapp.  He's the chairman of the American Conservative Union.  Why is it that the Left is suddenly so reluctant to say what is obvious that they have an anti-Semitic strain within their party and on Capitol Hill and aren't dealing with it?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, I completely agree with you, Lou, but I asked -- I actually think it's more cynical than this.  I think the Democratic Party has really shed its longtime support of the State of Israel.  I think they're moving away from this policy point of view and I think it gives Donald Trump who has done everything he said he would do with getting rid of the Iran deal, moving the embassy a great chance with these voters not with the not with the Liberal leaders potentially of this community but with everyday voters who can see anti-Semitism when it's so clear.</p><p>DOBBS:  Anti-Semitism, we saw reports today that the yellow vest in France you know, blaming them for a strain of anti-Semitism within France leaving out the entire ruling body and class in France that -- I mean there's anti-Semitism has been a huge issue in France.  It is not only anti-Israel, it is pro-Palestinian, and the expression is found throughout the political structure of France.  This looks like another gambit to lay off blame for what is a strengthening strain of anti-Semitism in France and indeed Europe.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.  And look, I think what's happening -- what's ironic, Lou, is what's happening in Israel is this once socialist country has really been embracing free markets and innovation and really has become a kindred soul in one of our closest allies to obviously to America and to our way of life into our values.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people that just hate everything about the idea of innovation of entrepreneurs or free markets of the little guy being able to go to market and take his ideas to the customers.  And they are against every aspect of that and I love the fact that Israel in America and freedom-loving people including the people of South America, including the freedom lovers in Venezuela.  We're working together to rid the world of this dreaded socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dreaded socialism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism and that really what I was asking you about.  Socialism is as the President assured is this country will never be socialistic.  What is in question tonight is whether or not one guy you know, is going to be the successor to Maduro.  Will he or will he not and what is your sense from where you look?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a great question, Lou.  And I worry I think it's a little bit of a jump ball right now.  I think the President, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo we're trying to do everything they can to use power in influence to stand up for the Venezuelan people in this new president Mr. Guaido.  And Maduro is a -- is a tin-pot dictator.  And you know they have a lot of power at the end of their reigns.  And we'll see if he's able to use that power.  But I'm hopeful that the right side will win out in Venezuela.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's a lot of hope running around this country right now primarily because President Trump is indeed the leader of the free world.  My question to you is why is the establishment in Washington D.C. not screaming for the arrest of Andrew McCabe and for all of his cohorts and the DOJ and the FBI?  Why is it that there seems to be almost a satisfaction in the status quo no matter how rancid and corrupt in the swamp that is D.C.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Look, I'm disgusted by it and I guess there's only one person who can do something about it and that's Bill Barr.  Is he either going to do this or he's not, and I'd be greatly disappointed if he doesn't.  And I think --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why the hell isn't the Republican Party's standing up and demanding his arrest?  Why --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You know why.</p><p>DOBBS:  I do not know why.  I would not be asking you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I think the reason is because they don't want the controversy of actually taking the deep state on because they might be coming its next victim.</p><p>DOBBS:  Then their doubtless wonders and why in the world should we tolerate these Koch brothers hired excuses for legislators and representatives.  They represent nothing but Koch brothers, the Wall Street, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber, they are -- it's enough to make you sick.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Lou, if that's where the Republican Party stays, it will deserve to lose beyond the ash heap of history.  We either going to represent the people or we're not and if we don't, we deserve to lose and we ought to get out of the way.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's very simple.  They either follow President Trump or they are going to be on the scrap heap of history.  The problem is they could take the Republican with them.  Matt, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Good to see you too.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the dark political agenda of the deep state, their efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald Trump -- that's right -- to overthrow the U.S. government.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Andrew McCabe, fired as acting director of the FBI last night on 60 Minutes confessed he was involved in an effort to remove well, President Trump from office and to overthrow the government of the United States.  Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton says McCabe, the Department of Justice and the FBI were trying to overthrow the government and this republic.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT JUDICIAL WATCH:  If there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt the media would be calling it a coup.  But because you've got an elected bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this, and if the target is President Trump, they don't care.  And Americans should realize this is how you can lose a republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Tomorrow night, Congressman Mark Green, David Bossie, and Attorney Harmeet Dhillon among our guests tomorrow.  We hope you'll join us.  Thanks for being with us tonight.  Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs.  And again, thanks for being with us.  Good night.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2183277937</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB8-DDC1-DY0W-41TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

This aversion is President Trump and his administration on full display this weekend as former FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe actually confessed that he, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and a host of corrupt FBI and Department of Justice actors sought to unseat a sitting president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR:  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.  What I can say is the Deputy Attorney General was definitely very concerned about the President, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a confession.  Where is the outrage about their treason?  Where is the Republican Party and its leaders demanding they arrest McCabe and the rest of his cohorts who conspired to overthrow the President of the United States?  McCabe's admission of the coup attempted by the corrupt deep state went without as much a follow-up question by CBS.  Where is the national media?  Left-wing, though it may be, it in demanding answers, accountability, and transparency for this aversion and outright sedition?</p><p>Judicial watch President, Tom Fitton, Radio Show Host, Tammy Bruce among our guest here tonight to discuss those questions and their answers.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, over the weekend calling the United States embarrassing.  As globalist foreign leaders and the radical Dems applaud their approval of his careless and outrageous remarks on foreign soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents or turning their back on refugees on our border.  Americans know that's not right.  The American people understand, please, because it makes us embarrassing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, Biden is the embarrassment.  What should be embarrassing to Biden is that he can't even garner the support of his former president, President Barack Obama.  Obama saying he will not endorse a Democrat for president even if Biden decides to run.  We take up Biden's embarrassing trip overseas.  Republican Strategist, Ed Rollins, Matt Schlapp joins us.  And President Trump today in Miami issuing his strong support for Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.</p><p>The President's message clear and definitive.  The United States will never be a socialist nation, we take up the President's address and much more here tonight.  Our top story, former acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe confessed there was in fact a deep state conspiracy among his cohorts in the Justice Department and FBI to remove President Trump from office.  Fox Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge with the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCCABE:  Counting votes, or possible vote.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The former acting FBI director told \"60 MINUTES\" the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein openly discussed how many cabinet members would support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President.  But the FBI's former general counsel, James Baker who met contemporaneously with McCabe and FBI lawyer Lisa Page about their conversations with Rosenstein testified the effort went further.</p><p>\"I had the impression the Deputy Attorney General had already discussed this with two members in the President's cabinet.  And that they were on board with this concept already.\"    On Twitter the President responded to McCabe on \"60 MINUTES,\" \"While, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.  He and Rod Rosenstein look like they were planning a very illegal act.\"</p><p>McCabe and others say the President's May 2017 firing of Director James Comey left the FBI and Justice Department in turmoil.  And they concerned that the firing was designed to be synced the Russian probe and obstruct justice.</p><p>MCCABE:  The Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire into the White House.  He said, I never get search when I going to the White House.  I think the General Counsel had a heart attack.  When he got up off the floor he said, I -- that's a bridge too far.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  But Baker who could face criminal penalties for lying to Congressional investigators testified \"My recollection is that there were discussions about it over longer period than the course of one meeting, a couple of days.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  McCabe said Rosenstein initially resisted a Special Counsel because the Deputy Attorney General worried he might lose his job.  A senior department official told Fox tonight the Special Counsel was appointed \"to ensure that the Russia investigation was truly independent and without bias.\"  Something the official said that McCabe could not have accomplished.  Lou?</p><p>DOBBS:  Catherine, thanks very much.  Catherine Herridge.  Well, joining us tonight, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch.  One of the country's most effective watchdog groups.  And he's worked with the International Policy Forum, the Leadership Institute, Accuracy in Media, among others.  Tom, good to have you with us.  What we just heard from the folks at \"60 MINUTES\" over at CBS, although they didn't ask a follow-up question, it was an outright confession by McCabe that he was committing felonies and an attempt to overthrow the President of the United States along with a number of his colleagues.  Your reaction when you heard it?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH:  Well, it's extraordinary.  It confirms early reports last year that this discussion took place.  You know, Lou, if there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt we'll be -- we'll be calling it a coup.  But because you got -- I don't like the bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this and it's -- the target is President Trump, they don't care.</p><p>And America should realize this is how you can lose a Republic where you have appointees of the President and bureaucrats to answer to virtually no one talk about manipulating the law in order to overturn a presidential election and attack a president they don't like.  They don't like for any substantial reason.  They don't like him because they fired -- he fired his buddy, McCabe's buddy and Rosenstein's buddy, James Comey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  At the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein, by the way.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FITTON:  Right.  A fight about a personnel decision.  And they're going to overthrow the presidency.  And, you know, let's be clear here, Mueller is a successor to this coup attempt.  He's -- the appointment flows out of all of these discussions and we should recognize that the effort to overthrow the President is continuing with Justice Department help through this out-of-control Mueller investigation.</p><p>DOBBS:  And without so much as -- and effort, explanation, rationalization, this is -- we're watching McCabe basically saying he was doing it for the country's own good.  Here's a man sworn to enforce the law, to enforce the constitution of the United States, to defend the United States committing subversions, in my opinion, sedition and treason.  And those who want to say that we're not at war should reference the war on terror that we've been engaged in for 19 -- almost 19 years.</p><p>This is outrageous and we haven't heard a word from the leadership of the Republican Party about arresting these people.  We haven't heard a word from the so-called establishment that is supposed to hold the tenants values of this -- of this great nation and primacy.  They are just simply averting their eyes.  It's appalling, it's disgusting, there should be outrage throughout the country in both parties across every part of this nation.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I agree.  And the problem with the Justice Department is that Mueller is still running the Justice Department effectively.  And so any effort to uncover what went on behind this investigation and this is what went on behind this investigation, runs into the Mueller juggernaut.  And, you know, Attorney General Barr, he needs to step up and defend the President.  You know, the argument for -- against Barr was will he stand up to President Trump?</p><p>And I think the test for Attorney General Barr is, will he stand up for President Trump and for the rule of law against these deep stators and the establishment who don't care about our constitution.  You know, President Trump may survive this attack on him but maybe another President want.  And we'll lose our Republic and we won't even know it came.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, I guarantee he will survive these attacks.  He's already demonstrated that he is stronger than the entire lot of these extraordinary venal, vicious actors in the Justice Department.  What may not survive is his Justice Department and the FBI.  And Tom Fitton, should they survive?  Because they are the root of the corruption and the malignancy of the others wanted to subscribe to this administration.</p><p>When, in point of fact, they have been the perpetrators of wrongdoing from the months preceding the presidency of Donald Trump.</p><p>FITTON:  Well, my -- you know, I'm a small government conservative.  I think all government agencies should be subject to scrutiny every year before any money is given to them.  And given the corruption at the DOJ, I think we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  The problem with that is, the appropriators as well as the investigators are also deep state actors and have been working just as viciously, frankly, behind the scenes as the people in the Justice Department and the FBI.  My god.</p><p>FITTON:  You know, the problem with the FBI is the current leadership frankly, Mr. Ray has zero interest in reforming the organization.</p><p>DOBBS:  Where is he?</p><p>FITTON:  That's why --</p><p>DOBBS:  I mean, we don't even hear from him.</p><p>FITTON:  He is missing in action when it comes to standing and uncovering -- I -- uncovering the corruption and to a degree he said anything, Lou, he's been excusing the corruption.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Exactly.  Tom, it's always good to have you here.  I wish we're talking in better circumstances.  But, as you intimated at the outset, the Republic itself is at stake here.</p><p>FITTON:  That's right.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the silence is absolutely chilling.  Thank you so much, Tom Fitton.</p><p>FITTON:  Welcome.</p><p>DOBBS:  And again, as always, and I mean it even when I don't say, thanks for everything that you and Judicial Watch do.  Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON:  You're welcome.  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, one of the most embarrassing figures in modern American political history.  Former Vice President Joe Biden has taken his anti- American message overseas embarrassing the United States in front of our allies and many of his former colleagues in the Obama administration.  It's a shadow government.  We'll take that up and more right after this quick break.  Ed Rollins joins me.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  A New York Times report today saying former President Obama is counseling the Dems' 2020 hopefuls but he will not be giving the New York Times assures us, anyone, anyone, not even Joe Biden, his endorsement.  His former Vice President taking a page out of his old Obama playbook.  Apologizing for America overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  The America I see values basic human decency.  Not snatching children from their parents.  It makes us an embarrassing in the example we're setting.  Well, I should stop.  As my mother would say, this too shall pass.  We will be back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  I wouldn't bet on it.  In any way, shape, or fashion, at least not led by one Joe Biden.  He's just blown his chances for 2020 in all likelihood.  Biden, it seems forgot one important lesson from his former boss.  President Obama at least waited until he had been elected and was in office before slamming America overseas.  Well, joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Fox Business Political Analyst Ed Rollins.  Ed, great to have you with us.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  What a day.  Let's start with Biden, he just blew it, didn't he?</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, he certainly did something outrageous than anybody I've ever known.  A former Vice President to go before this important meeting and condemn the America is just outrageous.  You often do that if you're a presidential candidate in Iowa, or (INAUDIBLE) New Hampshire or somewhere.  But to go before our allies and to basically take apart the administration's position is just outrageous.</p><p>DOBBS:  When President Obama did that, his famous apology tour in Berlin in Cairo, he had been elected.</p><p>ROLLINS:  He'd been elected.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  You know, there was a chance to make things right in 2012.  Romney didn't make that happen.  I think Biden can just kiss it goodbye, personally.  I would like to turn to this extraordinary piece on \"60 MINUTES\" in which Andrew McCabe actually confessed to trying to overthrow the President of the United States, Ed.  And where's the outrage from the Republican leadership?  I mean, I think the whole country should be just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS:  I have to tell you, from when I sat and watched it last night I was outraged because there's a conspiracy going on.  First of all, the 25th Amendment is for a president to step aside if he has health issues or something else.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Or a Vice President to step in if the President is incapacitated.  It is not about removing a president from office.  And I think to a certain extent, you think the Justice Department --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  These guys were not only obviously corrupt, they were stupid beyond imagining for people who were supposedly trained in law and respectful of it.</p><p>ROLLINS:  And the fact that before this, any evidence that basically still plotting and scheming to take out a President of the United States and talking to members of the cabinet according to him with the full support of the acting attorney general, I just found it appalling.  It's so un-American, it's like --</p><p>DOBBS:  So, where is the Republican Party?  Why aren't the leaders of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, every republican governor, every Republican governor, every Republican in this country standing up and saying end the witch-hunt, end all of this non-sense, it's obviously a cabal that has been working and the conspiracy to overthrow the President of the United States or tacitly they are endorsing it with their silence.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, their silence is terrible.  The reality is we are in a fight of our life.  President Trump basically doing everything he promised to do, moving the ball forward.  But the Democrats are really revved up and they're going to do everything they can to stop him.  From lawsuits to what have you.  And they're not going to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  -- in the land that will join this president on the basis of his declaration of a national emergency.  I -- we know then that the corruption has absolutely grasped our judiciary system as well.  We got every indication that that's happened.  But for them to enjoin a president in a matter of national security would be an act against the Republic, the constitution itself.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Well, you and I have been around long enough to know that's going to happen.  And at the end of the day it's going to end up being in the Supreme Court.  And the Supreme Court has to rule in the President's favor at the end of the day here.  But it's going to go through the process.  There's -- all of these political attorney generals and what have you who want to make (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>DOBBS:  But honorable, honest and judges who are not overwhelmed by their partisan prejudice would understand that that it could be absolutely litigated in our judiciary.  Without enjoining until a decision by the high court.  That would be the honorable thing to do.</p><p>ROLLINS:  That's the absolute honoring thing to do.  And I would -- I would hope the Supreme Court is stepping very quickly if they started out this process.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  I worry about this court and what more -- the more that we learned about Chief Justice John Roberts, I'm not saying when about, what will or will not occur in that high court.</p><p>ROLLINS:  I'm hopeful in the end he will do the right thing.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  Well, we can all hope.  But I'd rather have certainty.</p><p>ROLLINS:  In the end.  In the end.  There is no certainty -- there's no certainty in life.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there isn't.  But in this constitution there should be absolute certainty.  Ed Rollins, thanks much.</p><p>ROLLINS:  Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS:  We appreciate it.  We'd like to hear your thoughts on all this.  Share your comments, follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.  Coming up here next, Chicago Police, they want answers from actor, Jussie Smollett after their investigation into an alleged hate crime reverses.  That and much more coming up next.  We'll be talking with Washington Times' Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Before we go to break, let's take a look at the U.S. national debt as if we don't have enough problems already.  $22 trillion and climbing.  We're coming right back after this.  Stay brave of heart, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump in Miami today for claiming the days of socialism in the western hemisphere are numbered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If you choose this path, you have the opportunity to help forge a safe and prosperous future for all of the people of Venezuela.  Or you can choose the second path, continuing to support Maduro.  If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out.  You will lose everything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  President Trump also using his speech to continue to express his supportive of Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guido.  A reported hate crime in Chicago looking more and more like a hate hoax.  Chicago Police say they no longer consider actor Jussie Smollett a victim.  And they are pushing for a follow-up interview which his attorney -- Smollett's attorneys have resisted.  The police request -- imagine that, a request comes amid new reports that Smollett paid two Nigerian brothers to carry out the assault.</p><p>Both men have been questioned and released without charges.  Reverend Al Sharpton, we want to point out, responding to the news.  And Sharpton saying Smollett should face as he put it, \"accountability to the maximum\" if it's found the actor stage the attack.  Joining us tonight, Tammy Bruce, Washington Times Columnist, Fox Business Contributor.  Tammy, good to see you.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, everybody.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's start with Smollett and the hoax.  I have to give Reverend Al Sharpton great credit for standing up which by the way all of the candidates who have been commenting on this, the Democratic candidates have not had the courage to do.  Your thoughts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  The candidates seem to be wanting to pretend this never happened.  They get away without law because then the media also steps away from it and stops discussing it.  But Reverend Al Sharpton of course is very well known for promoting one of the original hoaxes, if you will with a young woman named Tawana Brawley who made some accusations against police officers which ended up being false.</p><p>So it's fascinating that he would actually take that position.  So good for him if he has found, you know, the right direction.  And maybe -- I don't know, maybe he's thinking that Mr. Smollett deserves a program on MSNBC like he has.  Who knows what that end result should be.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, you brought that to us with a sense of appropriate justice.</p><p>BRUCE:  Absolutely.  Hanging every day, every day.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let's turn to Venezuela, the President today importantly going to Miami as the setting to announce his views and judgment and policies on the hemisphere and Venezuela in particular.  Your thoughts?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  Perfect of course.  We know for South Florida it has a lot of people who are immigrants who have experienced in our lifetimes very recently, the impact of totalitarianism and tyrants.  So when he --</p><p>DOBBS:  And Venezuelans by the way.</p><p>BRUCE:  Well, Venezuelans and Cubans.  So when he's speaking it happens to be the right thing, of course it is the thing that the President believes in.  But it also speaks to the Venezuelans that are already in South Florida that are coming to South Florida but speaking to that core of people in this region that understand the importance of freedom, this nation, capitalism and the value of the support of the American Presidents.</p><p>And so it's going to make I think a big different for people there and sends a very strong message back home about what his intentions are.</p><p>DOBBS:  I think he had a couple of other audiences as well in mind as he spoke.  And one of this of course the American people when he said this country will never be socialist.  That was a loud straightforward challenge to everyone of the -- what seemed to be every one of the Democratic hopefuls so far.  At least announced, this is not going to be an easy campaign for you because you've already gone to the left and lined up against this country and our traditions.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  It's the first education they may be receiving about real life.  These are -- especially young people, Miss Ocasio-Cortez obviously seems to not have any major education about the impact of socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Or minor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Or a minor education on the nape on how it destroys lives, on how it destroys countries and economies.  So, this is going to be her first indication about courtesy of the President, about real life and what socialism does to people.</p><p>DOBBS:  This could be an expensive tutorial for AOC if it moves into, as it appears, it is about to, into the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.  This is -- it could be.  And she won't understand this, I think, until 2020.  The benefit of this education for the American people about what the Democratic Party is becoming, and how everybody is running on this kind of an issue.</p><p>The President stands as the bulwark against this framework and as a reminder about what -- how greatness really can be brought into our lives.  And it's not through certainly that totalitarianism by any stretch.</p><p>DOBBS:  And most to me, it's very encouraging to see the presidential tracking poll with the president's popularity.  I had approval rising at 52 percent.  I confess that I personally think it should be significantly higher, and I hope it soon will be.</p><p>BRUCE:  It probably is, as a matter of fact.  When you think about the --</p><p>DOBBS:  I'd like to see it expressed in black-and-white.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, yes.</p><p>DOBBS:  Like you, I have faith in the forgotten man and woman in this country.  But this president, I think now, has turned a very important corner.  I think the national left-wing media understands it.  It is beginning to understand it.  That's why they are not quite as free with their nonsense as they have been.</p><p>In other words, Jim Acosta is receding quite a bit, as his colleagues, I think, on the left, in that White House briefing room, for example, it's one of the barometers of this all.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's good news.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy, good to have you here.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, thank you, sir.</p><p>DOBBS:  Tammy Bruce, thanks.  Up next, British lawmakers say Facebook is acting like gangsters with our personal information.  We take that up.  Now, the Europeans are doing something about it.  Why in the world isn't the United States?  Isn't privacy an even bigger right for Americans?  We take that up with cyber expert, Morgan Wright.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.  Oh, Google, Facebook, gangsters.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Headlines tonight, Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, claims he has \"a lot of discretion on border wall funding from President Trump's national emergency declaration,\" despite receiving a direct order from the President of the United States to secure the border.</p><p>Shanahan says \"I'm not required to do anything.\"  Well, he'd be required to do something, one would think, like pack his bags and get out of there.  A North Carolina elections board, beginning deliberations over election fraud allegations, Republican Mark Harris leading in last month's ninth congressional district election.</p><p>The board consists of three Democrats, two Republicans, they will decide whether to certify a winner or order a new election, Harris, by the way, leading Democrat Dan McCready, by 905 votes, but again, the vote that may count as the 3-2 vote on the elections board.</p><p>A new report from the U.K. parliament, calling Facebook, digital gangsters, for failing to thwart attempts by Russia to influence elections, the report accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of contempt of parliament.</p><p>Joining me now, Morgan Wright, Former Senior Advisor in the State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, Former Law Enforcement Advisor to the Republican National Committee, Cyber Security Expert, Morgan, great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN WRIGHT, EXPERT, CYBERSECURITY:  Hey, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Let me start with, first, the gangsters that Facebook and Google.  Who knew that they were going to be declared gangsters first by the U.K., rather than the United States?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, I don't see Al Pacino playing Mark Zuckerberg in a movie, you know, about gangsters, but yes, you know.  And Lou, we've talked about this before about why is the -- why is the E.U. ahead of us with things like the General Data Protection Regulations, privacy?</p><p>And I'll tell you, the only thing I can think of as it comes down to money, because there's a -- Facebook has figured out the Google playbook, which is, spend a lot of money, spend a lot of time here in D.C., on K Street, M Street, whatever all the streets are, and you know, get in there and lobby people, spread lots of money around.</p><p>And Lou, during the hearings, how many members of Congress did we see ponder to Mark Zuckerberg, hoping to relocate shit jobs in their district.  I mean, this is one reason why you don't have it because everybody's hoping to get something from Zuckerberg.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes, and -- but it reinforces the impression.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  That a half dozen of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, have such concentrated economic and technological and political power, that they are almost now so large that it is impossible to rein them in.  Is that fear well-placed?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  And I'll tell you, Lou, you and I talked about this awhile back too, when we talked about how globalism is killing patriotism.  And all of these companies have taken the advantage of the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) well guess what?</p><p>It's coming home to roost now, because now that these companies want to be global.  Your subject to the E.U. regulations, the U.K. regulations, you know, Germany's regulations, all of these other places that actually place a premium on privacy, for too long self-regulation, they've tried it, it hasn't worked.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is the self-regulation go away.  And you're going to see more government interventions starting overseas, and hopefully, it'll end up over here, not to put them out of business, but, man, we've got to put a check on the seemingly unchecked power that they have right now.</p><p>DOBBS:  There is no countervailing influence in our economy, or our society, or our body politic to the awesome power of big tech.  That's simply a fact, and to that, the power of Wall Street and Corporate America.</p><p>And right now, the middle class in this country, if they were not the champion, the President of the United States would be defenseless against an onslaught that had rolled back the middle class for 20 years, and which under this president, is once again, growing.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.  And look, you know, something interesting that came out of the U.K. report too, is they talked about -- even though Zuckerberg, in front of Congress, and sent his minions over there to say we don' sell any data, it's clear they've been selling data.  It's true that they've been using apps to spy on the activities of users and their competitors.</p><p>Look, this is the modern version.</p><p>DOBBS:  And even those who are not users.</p><p>WRIGHT:  --have that power, right, absolutely.  And the KGB only wished they would've had this power back in the day.  You know, our NSA and FBI don't have near the power that Facebook, Google, Amazon.  You know, these folks have to spy into the lives of us, but there are no consequences for it.  At some point, there has to be stick because the carrot hasn't worked.</p><p>DOBBS:  Yes.  This is a president who is keenly aware --</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  -- that U.S. policies haven't worked.  He is also confronted now by ZTE, as a favor to President Xi.  He backed off of the consequences for ZTE, Huawei, now paying the consequences for its role in spying, but doing so, only within our court system, not as a result of a national security response from the part of the United States.</p><p>How much longer can we go without saying straightforwardly to the Chinese, there will be a response on national security terms if you continue to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from this country each year and carry out acts of espionage nonstop.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Look, I think Gordon Chang's been on with before he talked about poor Chinese economically, I think they need to put -- they need to put the hammer down on Huawei.  It's time to put Huawei and ZTE out of business.</p><p>And I'll tell you why, Lou, the upcoming 5G, Huawei is doing everything they can to get their technology into these countries, but you've Australia, New Zealand, Japan.  The U.K. said it's going to take, you know -- they probably going to have to spend five years and $2-$3 billion to meet the U.K. standards.</p><p>The best way to stop this economic espionage is to quit lulling the government of China to subsidize the rail system, the electronic system, the communication systems to where it's all Chinese infrastructure.  And there's no U.S. infrastructure in play.  We can't -- it's not a fair fight.</p><p>So, I think they've got to put the hammer down on these guys.  One of the ways to stop espionage is to keep their equipment out of our infrastructure.</p><p>DOBBS:  And the -- and the administration to its credit is trying to do exactly that.  Huawei, at the same time, is bragging they are now too big to stop.  And this is -- this again, is advised rhetoric from the PLA and from President Xi, himself.</p><p>The Communist Party is now flaunting their economic and political and military power.  The United States is -- has to simply respond, and hopefully, before it becomes a military response.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Right.</p><p>DOBBS:  But it looks as though we are absolutely vulnerable in cyberspace right now.  Is that a correct impression?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes, absolutely.  Lou, we have -- from our power grid, to our nuclear plants, to you know -- the rail system transportation.  A lot of things are still so vulnerable because we're so fragmented.  We don't have --</p><p>Even though we might have an overall plan, we don't have an overall coherent ability to secure all the things we need to do, why, because the private sector owns 85 percent of the critical infrastructure that's out there.</p><p>The government can provide a lot of support, a lot of help, but were the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese?  And even the North Koreans are exploiting.  They're exploiting all of these gaps between the different infrastructures.</p><p>DOBBS:  Right.</p><p>WRIGHT:  The lack of coherence among the security plans.  And the old technology that's out there.  We've got out-of-date machines that are still running windows that haven't been supported for five or six years.</p><p>DOBBS:  What Morgan is not saying, that 85 percent that is in the private sector, is often run by CEOs and boards that are frankly, friendlier to Chinese policies than they are to the policies of the Trump administration and the U.S. government.  And that's got to change, straightaway.  I didn't put words in your mouth, did I, Morgan?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Lou, you're always right.  That's one lesson I've learned.</p><p>DOBBS:  Morgan, thanks so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>WRIGHT:  You bet, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you, Morgan Wright.</p><p>Up next, New York Governor Bill -- New York Mayor, Bill de Blasio says AOC doesn't know what she is talking about.  We take that up after the break with American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio putting freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her place after Amazon decided not to build its headquarters in Long Island City.  Cortez claimed the failed deal would free up $4 billion in taxes incentives for the city to use elsewhere.  The good mayor reminded her even a socialist understood this, at least one of the socialists did, reminding her the money would only be available after the city secured the Amazon jobs and revenue and that it wasn't in a budget somewhere.</p><p>Radical freshman congresswoman, there's a lot of those going around.  Ilhan Omar scheduled to raise money in March for the Hamas link council on American-Islamic relations.  Omar received $5,000 from them during a run for Congress.  She since repeatedly made headlines for her anti-Semitic remarks most recently suggesting Republican support of Israel is bought and paid for by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC.  At some point anti-Semitic remarks result in being anti -- an anti-Semite it seems.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Matt Schlapp.  He's the chairman of the American Conservative Union.  Why is it that the Left is suddenly so reluctant to say what is obvious that they have an anti-Semitic strain within their party and on Capitol Hill and aren't dealing with it?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, I completely agree with you, Lou, but I asked -- I actually think it's more cynical than this.  I think the Democratic Party has really shed its longtime support of the State of Israel.  I think they're moving away from this policy point of view and I think it gives Donald Trump who has done everything he said he would do with getting rid of the Iran deal, moving the embassy a great chance with these voters not with the not with the Liberal leaders potentially of this community but with everyday voters who can see anti-Semitism when it's so clear.</p><p>DOBBS:  Anti-Semitism, we saw reports today that the yellow vest in France you know, blaming them for a strain of anti-Semitism within France leaving out the entire ruling body and class in France that -- I mean there's anti-Semitism has been a huge issue in France.  It is not only anti-Israel, it is pro-Palestinian, and the expression is found throughout the political structure of France.  This looks like another gambit to lay off blame for what is a strengthening strain of anti-Semitism in France and indeed Europe.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.  And look, I think what's happening -- what's ironic, Lou, is what's happening in Israel is this once socialist country has really been embracing free markets and innovation and really has become a kindred soul in one of our closest allies to obviously to America and to our way of life into our values.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of people that just hate everything about the idea of innovation of entrepreneurs or free markets of the little guy being able to go to market and take his ideas to the customers.  And they are against every aspect of that and I love the fact that Israel in America and freedom-loving people including the people of South America, including the freedom lovers in Venezuela.  We're working together to rid the world of this dreaded socialism.</p><p>DOBBS:  Dreaded socialism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism and that really what I was asking you about.  Socialism is as the President assured is this country will never be socialistic.  What is in question tonight is whether or not one guy you know, is going to be the successor to Maduro.  Will he or will he not and what is your sense from where you look?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a great question, Lou.  And I worry I think it's a little bit of a jump ball right now.  I think the President, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo we're trying to do everything they can to use power in influence to stand up for the Venezuelan people in this new president Mr. Guaido.  And Maduro is a -- is a tin-pot dictator.  And you know they have a lot of power at the end of their reigns.  And we'll see if he's able to use that power.  But I'm hopeful that the right side will win out in Venezuela.</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, there's a lot of hope running around this country right now primarily because President Trump is indeed the leader of the free world.  My question to you is why is the establishment in Washington D.C. not screaming for the arrest of Andrew McCabe and for all of his cohorts and the DOJ and the FBI?  Why is it that there seems to be almost a satisfaction in the status quo no matter how rancid and corrupt in the swamp that is D.C.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Look, I'm disgusted by it and I guess there's only one person who can do something about it and that's Bill Barr.  Is he either going to do this or he's not, and I'd be greatly disappointed if he doesn't.  And I think --</p><p>DOBBS:  Well, why the hell isn't the Republican Party's standing up and demanding his arrest?  Why --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You know why.</p><p>DOBBS:  I do not know why.  I would not be asking you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I think the reason is because they don't want the controversy of actually taking the deep state on because they might be coming its next victim.</p><p>DOBBS:  Then their doubtless wonders and why in the world should we tolerate these Koch brothers hired excuses for legislators and representatives.  They represent nothing but Koch brothers, the Wall Street, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber, they are -- it's enough to make you sick.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Lou, if that's where the Republican Party stays, it will deserve to lose beyond the ash heap of history.  We either going to represent the people or we're not and if we don't, we deserve to lose and we ought to get out of the way.</p><p>DOBBS:  It's very simple.  They either follow President Trump or they are going to be on the scrap heap of history.  The problem is they could take the Republican with them.  Matt, good to have you with us.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS:  Good to see you.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Good to see you too.</p><p>DOBBS:  Up next, more on the dark political agenda of the deep state, their efforts to subvert the presidency of Donald Trump -- that's right -- to overthrow the U.S. government.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back with that and more.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS:  Andrew McCabe, fired as acting director of the FBI last night on 60 Minutes confessed he was involved in an effort to remove well, President Trump from office and to overthrow the government of the United States.  Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton says McCabe, the Department of Justice and the FBI were trying to overthrow the government and this republic.</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT JUDICIAL WATCH:  If there were generals and colonels in the Pentagon talking like this, there would be no doubt the media would be calling it a coup.  But because you've got an elected bureaucrats and appointed officials talking like this, and if the target is President Trump, they don't care.  And Americans should realize this is how you can lose a republic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS:  That's it for us tonight.  We thank you for being with us.  Tomorrow night, Congressman Mark Green, David Bossie, and Attorney Harmeet Dhillon among our guests tomorrow.  We hope you'll join us.  Thanks for being with us tonight.  Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs.  And again, thanks for being with us.  Good night.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2183280011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8B-GB61-DY0W-4278-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Predictably, he was ridiculed - especially by fellow Tory MPs.</p><p>Since then, the clever and hard-working MP has learnt to disguise his boundless ambition, emerging as one of the shrewdest, politically adroit members of the Commons - a man of whom big things are expected.</p><p>When the 39-year-old became Secretary of State for Digital, Culture Media and Sport in January, he took the admirably firm position of making sure newspaper-hating zealots did not reboot the second part of the Leveson inquiry.</p><p>Equally commendably, he set about tackling one of Leveson's most egregious failings - not addressing how the amoral Wild West of social media giants should be properly regulated.</p><p>As a result, Hancock has fearlessly taken on big tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. He summoned bosses of the firms to a meeting after saying they were failing in their duty of care to customers, following revelations that users' personal data had been secretly harvested.</p><p>'It is not for companies,' he declared, 'to decide on the delicate balance between privacy and innovation, but for society as a whole.'</p><p>The father of three young children also wants limits on the amount of time that youngsters can spend on certain websites.</p><p>He has been praised for tackling the menace of fixed-odds betting terminals, which allow people to wager up to \u00a3100 every 20 seconds or potentially \u00a318,000 in one hour.</p><p>He favours a \u00a32 cap on bets - in defiance of Chancellor Philip Hammond, who, disgracefully, is worried about the potential loss of tax revenue.</p><p>After studying at Oxford and Cambridge, Hancock worked in his family's software firm before taking a job as an economist at the Bank of England.</p><p>There he was spotted by the then shadow chancellor George Osborne, who appointed him his chief of staff.</p><p>After being elected MP for West Suffolk, he co-wrote a book, Masters Of Nothing, with fellow Tory MP Nadim Zahawi, which called for corrupt bankers to be jailed.\u00a0</p><p>Within three years he became Minister of State and colleagues are convinced that because he impressed the Cabinet Secretary he was promoted to become Culture Secretary.</p><p>His wide brief covers a host of areas - from Press regulation, to the provision of reliable and fast broadband to sport.</p><p>Indeed, his qualifications for the latter role are unusually impressive - being the only modern MP to have ridden a horse race winner, coming first at Newmarket in a charity race in 2016.</p><p>After seeing off Leveson 2 with such aplomb, many say Hancock could reach greater heights in politics than his mentor and friend George Osborne ever did.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-43794987</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S93-7JR1-JCJY-G3M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><timeReceived>12:37 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Good morning. Which is the bigger factor for the market today, inflation number coming out a little bit later on or what's happening on the geopolitical front?</p><p>SHEETS: I think geopolitics have really taken -- taken the lead here. I think if you would ask investors on Monday, it was absolutely around CPI, it would be absolutely around, you know, the timing of -- of a Fed action and what we might see, but I think the moves -- the rhetoric that we've seen out of Washington and North Korea, that has I think, been the predominant factor now dominating markets.</p><p>JOHNSON: Just to kind of take a step back, nobody's here, these are thinned markets. The president's, theoretically, on holiday, is it just the fact that -- that we are in holiday liquidity sort of environments in - - in various asset classes that is -- that is driving this kind of pickup in volatility?</p><p>SHEETS: Well, look, I mean, I think that's -- that's actually a really important point, right? As -- as silly as it might sound that kind of where people currently are, are a bigger factor than some of these macroeconomic events. The fact that August is a time when a lot of people are out that we are seeing the -- the president and his staff are not in the White House, that investors often have to deal with markets with thinner liquidity and thinner markets in August, has a tendency to exacerbate moves. And I think that's maybe one reason why historically, you tend to see somewhat weaker market performance in August relative to other months.</p><p>MILLER: So you think we're going to see a pickup then in volatility? Are we going to -- I mean, the other day, we were making a massive deal about the S&amp;P 500 being down 0.24 percent, are we going to start seeing 1 percent moves again, real -- real range?</p><p>SHEETS: So I would actually be a little bit skeptical about that. So look, you -- you obviously have had a big shock to a market that was incredibly calm. So right, as of Monday, the 10-year -- the 10-day realized volatility for the S&amp;P 500 was just 2 or 3 percent, it was the lowest in 50 years. So it's definitely a shock for the market to go from that level of calm to what we have currently, but if I think about the factors that are still in place, I think you still are dealing with relatively solid global growth, you're s till dealing with very dovish policy. Most of the positioning metrics that we track don't suggest investors are unusually long. I think all of those things argue against a really large regime shift into kind of daily 1, 1.5 percent moves.</p><p>MILLER: One of the things -- one of the factoids I saw recently in a story about how quant hedge fund strategies are failing because there's not enough dumb money out there is that, retail investors' cash levels are at the lowest they've been in a decade. If they've -- if they've already -- if they're already so invested or it doesn't matter I guess, where they're invested, do you expect them to maybe be pulling money out then? Especially as we see highs like this?</p><p>SHEETS: Well, look, I mean, I think this is a debate where you can find data on -- on either side, so I guess what -- what I find a little bit more encouraging is that if we look at flows into the equity market, especially the U.S. equity market, those flows have still been incredibly modest, not just over the last year, but really over the last eight years. So I don't yet see evidence, and I think, you know, our -- our U.S. equity strategist very much agree with this. We don't see evidence that retail has rushed a lot of money into the market recently that it would then need to pull out. So -- so look, there's always -- you know, I certainly wouldn't say that investors were negative, you know, in the last several months, but we don't see that sign of excessive stock buying that would lead we think, to excessive retail selling.</p><p>JOHNSON: This is definitely the wrong chart, what I'm about to show here. Let's talk about -- a little bit about the skew and what's going on. The market is -- is positioning itself to buy kind of downside protection at the moment. The -- the -- the line goes up, as it goes up, basically, that's signaling that the market is trying to buy downside protection. Is that an opportunity do you think at this point when you're looking at what is happening with the SPX? Would you be going the other way?</p><p>SHEETS: Yes. Well, look, I think that's -- that's a really important part, right? So as much as, you know, the -- the focus has been on the rhetoric in Korea or the -- the daily moves in the S&amp;P that the much bigger moves we've had over the last 48 hours have really been in the VIX, and volatility on the VIX, right, which have moved significantly more than you would usually expect. And you know, that suggest that that's maybe where the real market pressure is, where some of the real market inefficiency might be, and it's not just mood volatility significantly, but as you mentioned it's moved skew significantly, right? So you've seen the volatility on puts rise to relatively unusually high levels versus calls. So you know, in our view, probably, the best way to lean against that would be, that that makes calls relatively cheap, because that's the volatility that's lowest relative to everything else.</p><p>MILLER: All right, Andrew, you're going to stick with us here. Andrew Sheets is chief -- chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley. There's a lot to talk about on a day like today when we see actual movement in equity index.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MILLER: Joining us here to talk about that in Berlin is our government editor, Alan Crawford. Andrew Sheets is with us as well, chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley. Alan, let's talk -- touch on the first point. And I think a lot of Germans find it hard to sort of discern now between the policies of the two parties. What would change say, if the SPD won and Martin Schultz came in Angela Merkel's place, policy-wise?</p><p>CRAWFORD: Well, at the moment, that looks like a big if, but it would also depend very much on what kind of coalition he could form. At the moment, that latest poll suggests it would have to be something like a four-way coalition, so it's extremely hard to see. Nevertheless, what we could see is that Martin Schulz as a former president of the European Parliament, he's somewhat more open to certainly common European policies, so perhaps more in terms of defense sharing and crucially perhaps, more in terms of integrating the Eurozone. Merkel has also made some comments about that, that she's open to some of these moves by the -- the French president, but the -- the assumption is that Schultz would probably be somewhat more open. Whether that extends to debt sharing is a different issue, but yes, more open.</p><p>JOHNSON: So it's hers to lose at this point in time, now that I think it's clear judging by the polling, Alan, so what risks is she running, kind of -- and -- and how does that relate to the strategy that we're seeing?</p><p>CRAWFORD: Well, as we just mentioned, we're talking about party certainly, party officials are somewhat concerned about any -- any hint of complacency. Not so much on Merkel's behalf but more like on behalf of the party and the party apparatus. Remember of course, when Merkel first ran for Chancellor in 2005, she was running Gerhard Schroder who was the incumbent -- he was the chancellor, and she managed to -- to squander a lead of more than 20 percentage points. He of course, was an extremely adept campaigner, and it was -- and in the end, she one by one point. Nevertheless, she is embarking on 50-stop campaign tour, so I think it's hard to accuse her of complacency at this point.</p><p>MILLER: You're welcome to refresh or memories. I mean, not all of us wrote a book on Angela Merkel. I should point out that Alan wrote a book on Merkel, so he knows this subject better than anyone. Andrew, let me ask you from an investor's perspective, is this an important election for you to pay close attention to? I mean, do you have to be as concerned about this as you did the French elections or the Dutch elections, or can you pretty much consider this a confirmation of Angela Merkel's fourth term and that kind consistency is good for you as an investor?</p><p>SHEETS: Well, look, so I -- I think about it as -- as follows. I think in terms of the actual outcome, I think markets are probably going to focus on it somewhat less because of what we've already seen in the Netherlands and France, and because I think there's a broad majority within Germany that -- that is pro-Europe, pro the E.U., and is pushing towards more integrations, that whole argument that there might be some faction pushing for something different now, seems significantly less likely. But I think what markets will focus on is this idea that at the core of Europe in -- between France and Germany, this idea of really working for a stronger European union, are pushed towards reform that we might not have seen in a way that we have in a number of years. I think that's structurally bullish for the euro, that's been one of the key calls of our FX strategy team, and the euro remains very undervalued on a long-term basis, and so this is a multi-year call in our view, for a stronger euro.</p><p>JOHNSON: Alan, where does the risk lie to Europe in this election? There does seem to be this sense that coming out of this, we're going to see a new impetus towards a closer integration. Now, that's started by Mr. Macron, but the German election's a pivotal piece in all of this. Does the coalition formation have a bearing on that? I.e., if she's in -- in -- in coalition with the -- with the FDP for instance, would that dilute that drive?</p><p>CRAWFORD: This is exactly the point that we will be focusing on during our coverage. The -- the latest poll for example, showed that Merkel has various coalition options which could in turn strengthen her hand in negotiations which remember, tend to last several weeks, if not months in Germany, after the election. Yes, the free democrats with whom had her second term coalition, they are -- they're more skeptical in terms of euro are bailouts, in terms of -- in terms of more integration in the Eurozone, that could put a break on some of her plans. Equally, the Greens are also in play. They are somewhat more enthusiastic about Eurozone integration and essentially, helping others. There could be a three-way coalition which is untested at the Federal level, or it could be an underground coalition.</p><p>MILLER: I remember when Joschka Fischer who was -- who's arguably, one of the most famous Greens said, forget about it, we prefer to wear dreadlocks, and they wouldn't be able to deal with that. Something like that, I'm paraphrasing. But it is a possible coalition. What's the -- what's the -- what are the dangers to Merkel here, and what could bring her down in the next six weeks? Is diesel a problem for her, is -- is the refugee, I would say crisis, but it's no longer a crisis here in Germany, is the influx that we saw a couple of years ago of refugees a problem for her? What could bring her down?</p><p>CRAWFORD: That's definitely an Achilles heel. If there were -- if there were to be some massive influx to Germany such as we saw two years ago when there was a genuine crisis and a buildup of people at Germany's border, that -- at the moment, the focus is on Italy, so it looks somewhat less likely, but nevertheless, if she was forced to make some kind of snap decision about that, then that would be a problem for her. Who that would benefit, whether it would benefit her main rival is another issue. Certainly, there's also, if there were any sort of repeat of the -- of the sexual attacks in Cologne, that was a devastating issue related to the crisis. Of course, terrorism is always -- is always lurking. Again, it's hard to see how these issues could -- could boost support for her -- her -- her main rival. The one thing I would say is, there is a potential that support for the -- the far right, anti-immigration AfD Party, perhaps the polls are underestimating that. I'm not saying it could win, but there is importantly the level, higher.</p><p>MILLER: The polls here though, historically more accurate than they are say, in Britain. Alan Crawford, our European government editor here in Berlin. I should point out that he co-wrote the book, \"Angela Merkel: A Chancellor Forged in Crisis\" with Tony Czuczka who also works with us here in Berlin. Andrew Sheets is the chief crosset (ph) asset -- cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley, he's going to stick with us, our guest host for the hour.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Let's turn our attention now to market risks and how investors should be positioning themselves. Alan Sheets chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley is still with us, and let's talk about some of the calls that we should be making right now. Andrew, the world is long euro, is that the right call?</p><p>SHEETS: Yes. So we think from an equity perspective, not necessarily. Graham Secker, our European equity strategist has been somewhat cautious over the last several months on concerns around what the strong euro will mean for earnings. Now, I think what's quite interesting is just really, over the last day, some of the tactical indicators that his team follows have finally dipped down into bi-territory, so that's something we have to watch in terms of our relative preferences. Currently, the U.S. and Japan are our top global equity markets, but Europe has underperformed recently, and that's something we have to monitor.</p><p>MILLER: Why are you long European value versus growth right now, Andrew?</p><p>SHEETS: Sure. So look, I think the -- the argument for Europe is that you have an improving economy and that valuations are attractive, that I think is the dominant narrative that I hear for European equities. I think if we look deeper into the market, most of the value in Europe lies within value, it lies within the financial sector, it lies within the energy sector, it lies within some of the other parts that make up the value index. So in our view, that's the part of the market where the majority of the cheapness of Europe is concentrated. It's starting to get some positive momentum on a long-term basis, it's underperformed really, for a decade and we think that's starting to turn around in our long-term view.</p><p>JOHNSON: Why are you short U.K. inflation? Why are you short the U.K. 10-year breakeven?</p><p>SHEETS: Sure. So -- so we think Brexit remains a challenging dynamic, right, and you're going to have U.K. politicians coming back from their holidays, going into negotiations in September, and we expect potentially more negative news flow. I think breakevens are one of the more optimistically priced assets related to the U.K. economy, right? Expecting inflation to remain at levels, really similar levels predicted in 2007.</p><p>JOHNSON: Matt?</p><p>MILLER: All right. That was a fun speed round, we should do that -- we should do that more often. Andrew Sheets from Morgan Stanley is going to stay with us. We have a lot more questions for him.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MILLER: Joining me now is Bloomberg Businessweek senior editor here in Berlin, David Rocks. Andrew Sheets, chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley is still with us in London as our guest host for the hour. David, first off, tell -- tell me about the city series, what prompted this, what's it about, what's the cities issue?</p><p>ROCKS: Well, there's -- there's 32 cities in the world now with more than 10 million people. More and more people around the world are moving to cities, and obviously, cities are a hugely important -- it's where people live now, right? More and more, especially in the developing world, so we wanted to look some of the problems ...</p><p>MILLER: Some (inaudible) rural and into the urban basically, yes.</p><p>ROCKS: Yes. We look at the kind of problems that these cities are having and how they can keep themselves from being strangled by their growth.</p><p>JOHNSON: It's interesting that -- that Moscow has -- has sort of changed so much and so quickly, David. It's gone in 20 years from being this incredibly sort of dower, difficult city to live in, to being this kind of sort of, standout metropolis, and that journey has been quite an incredible one. Just in terms of the momentum that Moscow has right now, how would you describe it?</p><p>ROCKS: Well, I think that a couple things are at play here. The -- the -- the numbers that we're about to see toady are probably going to show that consumption remains the main driver of the Russian economy. And you're never going to -- you're going to see that mostly in Moscow, or more -- more -- more clearly in Moscow. It's a -- it's a pretty wealthy city, and there are a lot of people there with a lot of money, and the city has a -- brought a lot of tax revenue, so they're spending it on making the place a nicer place to live.</p><p>MILLER: What is -- what are some of the other cities that you focused on?</p><p>ROCKS: Well, we looked at -- we looked at bike-sharing in Beijing, we've got somebody who went out and sort of tried that, and it's, you know, Beijing used to be a city where there were tons and tons of bikes, and now it's become -- for years, they sort of focused on cars, now they're kind of looking at bikes again, so that's a nice -- that's a nice view. We looked at New York City, how cities have a difficult time knowing what's actually underneath them. In New York City, you know, obviously, everybody knows where, you know, 57th and Park is, but do they actually know what's underneath there? And the answer is no. Not just the subways, but all of the conduits and things like that, and that's a huge problem for cities around the world. So there's a guy who's creating a -- like an underground map of New York City that we profile nicely, so ...</p><p>JOHNSON: That sounds amazing. (inaudible) can't wait to see that. Andrew, let's bring you into this conversation, Andrew Sheets. GDP data out of Russia a little bit later on. Where does Russia stack up in the -- the -- in the options that you see in front of you? It's long being perceived as being a kind of oil trade, but -- but that -- that kind of story has been diluted a little bit. How do you -- how do you see Russia stacking up? It's isolated increasingly, it finds itself on the wrong side of the political story increasingly. Where do we go with it as an investment, though?</p><p>SHEETS: Well, look, I mean, obviously, this is a country, right, where there's the political side of things, and then there's the economic side of things, right? Politically, it -- it is clearly going to be in the head -- it is clearly in the headlines and will continue to be in the headlines with some of the things coming out of the U.S. as well as the continued volatility in oil prices. But if we look at the macro economics, those in the country have been improving. Inflation has been moderating, the budget balances have been getting better thanks to the weaker ruble, and we think that credit profile of the country has actually been getting somewhat stronger while the currency remains very inexpensive, and real rates in Russia are some of the highest anywhere. So it's -- it's been very prudential, it's been very cautious since monetary policy, it's been very conservative which we think is helpful, and that's one of the reasons why generally speaking, we see the risk reward in Russian fixed income as more favorable than many other countries in EM.</p><p>MILLER: All right. Very interesting call and very interesting edition, can't wait to see it. David Rocks our senior editor here in Berlin, thanks so much for joining us. Andrew Sheets, chief crosset (ph) strategist at Morgan Stanley is our guest host for the hour, he's going to stick with us as we tack tech. Is tech disrupting the inflation theory? We'll discuss how Amazon is factoring in today's consumer price reading and decisions. This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Joining us now, Julian David, he's the CEO of techUK. Andrew Sheets, chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley is still with us. Julian, first of all, I -- I -- we're going to spend a lot of the day talking about inflation. Tech we know, is a disinflationary factor. It -- look at Moore's Law, look at all kinds of different factors, tech generally has that -- has that impact, and it improves productivity and -- and -- and therefore, filters back in that way as well. When you look at the incredibly low, sort of, inflationary environment that we have at the moment, do you think tech is, and -- and companies like Amazon are responsible partly for that?</p><p>DAVID: Yes. I think -- I mean, there's -- there's historical trend on this. I mean, technology has applied to all industries, has brought prices down and changed the balance. So if you just look at the move from craft industries to manufactured goods, there's a huge reduction there. You look at what happened in the emergence of China as a manufacturing powerhouse driven by tech, the -- the use of robotics and so on. What's happening now of course, is that's also now being applied to services, and it's the internet which is -- which is powering that. So you're having the ability first of all, to use assets much more productively, secondly, to increase the pull of assets. If you look at things like, you know, Airbnb bringing trillions of dollars worth of flexible accommodation into the market, that makes a big -- big -- big change. So yes, tech is -- is a major force behind better pricing, better offers, more flexible offers for -- for consumers.</p><p>MILLER: Julian, are we talking about two different things, though that both are contributing to lower prices or a lack of price growth? On the one hand, you got the sharing economy, and basically, that's allowing people to pay lower prices for services that the -- the providers used to charge a premium for, now, for example, if you're a driver or offering a room for rent, you just don't make that much money on it -- on that service. On the other hand, you've got a company that is such a behemoth, it's willing to not make a profit in order to eat up the market share that everybody else used to enjoy. Aren't those two different issues?</p><p>DAVID: Well, there's a consistent thread which is, it's technology that enables that kind of approach, so you know, if you -- if you just look at conventional retailing, the technology around superstores, which -- which came into place, the ability to manage distribution using tech to do logistics, you know, really gave you the opportunity to operate at a larger scale with lower margins, better pricing for the consumer. And the internet allows you to do that on a bigger scale, so -- so I really think technology is a driver of this, and you're going to see this across services now.</p><p>MILLER: Well, tech -- on the one hand is technology, on the other hand, if you look at company like Amazon, if you look at a company like Uber, it's the willingness not to make any money in order to knock the other guy out of business and control the entire market, no?</p><p>DAVID: Well, the -- the ability to take a long-term look at this, the -- the willingness of investors to -- to go with and the ability to finance this stuff is clearly, you know, a necessary part of it. But at the end of the day, you still got to back to the performance. You know, if they're able to get a better performance by using technology in a smarter way by, you know, managing assets at -- at -- at lower returns, then that's going to give them the opportunity to -- to grow, and that's going to drive again, you know, investor interest.</p><p>JOHNSON: Andrew, is the Phillips curve broken because of Amazon?</p><p>SHEETS: Well, you know, I think it's interesting, right? So our interest rate strategists have looked at this and they find that the Phillips curve is actually still in place and still working in -- in parts of the economy, and just not working in others in part, due to technology disruption and some of these other factors. So I think it is still there, and I think it's also important, I think as Julian alluded to, which is, we need to differentiate between this low inflation and the function of a negative demand shock which is very concerning for markets and a sign that growth is weaker than expected, or a positive supply shock, i.e., more technology coming online, more supply which is a positive. So again, I would say that our interpretation is more towards the latter, is more that some of the inflation dynamics that we're seeing are more of a function of a positive supply dynamic than a weak demand dynamic. But again, I think that is a real key debate for markets.</p><p>MILLER: What about the -- I wonder how long investors are willing to put money behind a company that doesn't make any money, as long as it grows revenue and takes market share? Is that -- I mean, is there really no set time limit for that because Amazon's been doing it for 20 years?</p><p>DAVID: Yes, I think -- I think, Matt, that's a very interesting question, you know, it's one that has been asked ever since they got going. You know, I used to work a lot with conventional retailers. You know, the conventional wisdom was, this can't last. Conventional wisdom, Andrew, sometimes doesn't work out, does it? And it certainly didn't in this case.</p><p>MILLER: Andrew, what do you think?</p><p>SHEETS: Well -- well, look, I mean, again, I think that's -- that's right. So look, I -- I won't comment specifically on -- on the company itself, but -- but this has been a trend that's been in place for -- for a long period of time. You know, I -- I also think that you have a market where, you know, we just talked in a previous segment, I mean, people are very willing to buy gold despite the fact that it has a negative income. So -- so the site -- I mean, one of the -- the -- the fallouts of low interest rates is that the opportunity cost of investing in a business or investing in an asset does not necessarily earn any money right now, that opportunity cost is a lot lower. And so you know, there -- there are some positive dynamics of that and there are potentially some negative dynamics of that.</p><p>JOHNSON: We'll leave it there. Gentlemen, thank you very much indeed. Andrew, you're going to stick around, but we're going to give you a 10-minute break. You're going to join Matt and I on Bloomberg Radio very shortly at the top of the hour. Andrew Sheets joining us from Morgan Stanley. We're going to carry on the conversation with Julian David, he is the CEO of techUK, we need to talk about what is happening with Brexit. Brexit optimism, Theresa may sticking to her (inaudible) timetable despite doubts within her cabinet. We're going to discuss what that means to the tech landscape. We should probably also talk about gender within the tech landscape as well. This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MILLER: I want to get back to the tech theme though that we've been discussing. Theresa May still aims to stick to her two-year Brexit deal goal despite members of her own cabinet expressing doubts over the timetable. Last month, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox called this optimistic, while chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond envisions a three-year bridging period.</p><p>Julian David, CEO of techUK is still with us. And Julian, we were talking about -- we were talking about tech issues as far as market share profitability and inflation in the U.S. is concerned, let's talk about tech issues as far as employment, location, positioning, and Brexit is concerned. We had an interesting story earlier this week about how media companies may need to look outside the U.K. because of licensing issues. Do you see the same concern at tech company headquarters as we do with bank headquarters in the U.K. post-Brexit?</p><p>DAVID: Absolutely, Matt. You know, the -- the U.K. tech industry was very clear in the run up to the referendum that the best solution was staying in the European Union, and since the referendum which of course, the democratic process, we accept that, we've been very clear that we need to be very close to the single market, we need to have access to this and we need to concentrate on three areas which are really concerning to tech. The first one is skills and talent. We're already seeing it difficult to get the sort of talent that we need to be the global leader in tech here in the U.K., and secondly, is the -- the whole regulatory and customs, and equivalents regime which some call a customs union, but it's a bit more than that in tech because it also covers services and it covers other things.</p><p>And -- and we need to have that as close to Europe as possible, and the last one is data. You know, if we don't have a data adequacy agreement with the European Union, then it will be impossible for tech companies to operate with European citizens' data. So that's a big deal, that's a cliff edge. That's a -- that's a , you know, fall-off-the-clip thing.</p><p>JOHNSON: The -- the data is here, it was massive. Google's just won approval to -- to build its new London headquarters next to the -- to the old one up in King's Cross. Aren't you surprised that they're building that?</p><p>DAVID: No, because U.K. is a big tech opportunity, big tech market, big tech center. You know, we are globally up there speaking of data. Well, if you think about it, you know, these kind of things are set against an industry that's growing, so making that kind of investment in a big economy like the U.K probably still makes sense. But also of course, they don't know exactly how this is going to turn out, so we're trying and hoping the government's going to -- going to get this right, you know. Our (inaudible) hash tag say get it right, because if we don't ...</p><p>JOHNSON: That sounds nice.</p><p>DAVID: Yes. If we don't -- you know, so it's encouraging to hear the kind of stuff that's being talked about -- about our transition. We're saying we need a long runway to make, you know, to land this Brexit claim. It's not going to be done in what is left, a year? And I know it's two years in theory, but really, you -- you need to get these things done, otherwise, people will have to make decisions and they'll have to move stuff. So what we need is that -- that transition period, and we need a data adequacy position without a doubt. Not just us, but all the industries is (inaudible) on data.</p><p>MILLER: Julian, I want to ask about -- I mean, we know that there's a need for more biological diversity at tech companies in the U.S., it's something, you know, Bloomberg is a company who feels very strongly about, and we've been reporting on it for -- for years now. What about ideological diversity? Is it possible to have a difference of opinion in these companies, or are they really, just -- have they really just turned into an echo chamber? Because most recently, you know, one employee was fired for voicing a different opinion, and now, (inaudible) he wants to find a safe space for people to have free speech.</p><p>DAVID: Look, obviously, I don't have the detail and I can't comment on an individual company situation, but clearly, you know, tech thrives on innovation, it thrives on -- on -- on diversity, and that's diversity of opinion and diversity of -- of people in the market. But it must be said, we all understand there is a problem around the participation of -- of female workforce in tech. It's only about 17 percent. You know, you -- you can't carry on with that in the face of what is a continuing skill shortage, plus, at the end of the day, tech has a bigger roles (inaudible) a supplier, it's also part of society, so women are contributing (inaudible) that's not going to be good.</p><p>JOHNSON: We're going to carry on that conversation on Bloomberg Radio. Surveillance is next. Matt and I are going to Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Good morning.  Which is the bigger factor for the  market today, inflation number coming out a little bit later on or what's  happening on the geopolitical front?</p><p>  SHEETS:  I think geopolitics have really taken -- taken the lead here.   I think if you would ask investors on Monday, it was absolutely around CPI,  it would be absolutely around, you know, the timing of -- of a Fed action  and what we might see, but I think the moves -- the rhetoric that we've  seen out of Washington and North Korea, that has I think, been the  predominant factor now dominating markets.</p><p>  JOHNSON: Just to kind of take a step back, nobody's here, these are  thinned markets.  The president's, theoretically, on holiday, is it just  the fact that -- that we are in holiday liquidity sort of environments in - - in various asset classes that is -- that is driving this kind of pickup  in volatility?</p><p>  SHEETS:  Well, look, I mean, I think that's -- that's actually a  really important point, right?  As -- as silly as it might sound that kind  of where people currently are, are a bigger factor than some of these  macroeconomic events.  The fact that August is a time when a lot of people  are out that we are seeing the -- the president and his staff are not in  the White House, that investors often have to deal with markets with  thinner liquidity and thinner markets in August, has a tendency to  exacerbate moves.  And I think that's maybe one reason why historically,  you tend to see somewhat weaker market performance in August relative to  other months.</p><p>  MILLER:  So you think we're going to see a pickup then in volatility?   Are we going to -- I mean, the other day, we were making a massive deal  about the S&amp;P 500 being down 0.24 percent, are we going to start seeing 1  percent moves again, real -- real range?</p><p>  SHEETS:  So I would actually be a little bit skeptical about that.  So  look, you -- you obviously have had a big shock to a market that was  incredibly calm.  So right, as of Monday, the 10-year -- the 10-day  realized volatility for the S&amp;P 500 was just 2 or 3 percent, it was the  lowest in 50 years.  So it's definitely a shock for the market to go from  that level of calm to what we have currently, but if I think about the  factors that are still in place, I think you still are dealing with  relatively solid global growth, you're s till dealing with very dovish  policy.  Most of the positioning metrics that we track don't suggest  investors are unusually long.  I think all of those things argue against a  really large regime shift into kind of daily 1, 1.5 percent moves.</p><p>  MILLER:  One of the things -- one of the factoids I saw recently in a  story about how quant hedge fund strategies are failing because there's not  enough dumb money out there is that, retail investors' cash levels are at  the lowest they've been in a decade.  If they've -- if they've already --  if they're already so invested or it doesn't matter I guess, where they're  invested, do you expect them to maybe be pulling money out then?   Especially as we see highs like this?</p><p>  SHEETS:  Well, look, I mean, I think this is a debate where you can  find data on -- on either side, so I guess what -- what I find a little bit  more encouraging is that if we look at flows into the equity market,  especially the U.S. equity market, those flows have still been incredibly  modest, not just over the last year, but really over the last eight years.   So I don't yet see evidence, and I think, you know, our -- our U.S. equity  strategist very much agree with this.  We don't see evidence that retail  has rushed a lot of money into the market recently that it would then need  to pull out.  So -- so look, there's always -- you know, I certainly  wouldn't say that investors were negative, you know, in the last several  months, but we don't see that sign of excessive stock buying that would  lead we think, to excessive retail selling.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  This is definitely the wrong chart, what I'm about to show  here.  Let's talk about -- a little bit about the skew and what's going on.   The market is -- is positioning itself to buy kind of downside protection  at the moment.  The -- the -- the line goes up, as it goes up, basically,  that's signaling that the market is trying to buy downside protection.  Is  that an opportunity do you think at this point when you're looking at what  is happening with the SPX?  Would you be going the other way?</p><p>  SHEETS:  Yes.  Well, look, I think that's -- that's a really important  part, right?  So as much as, you know, the -- the focus has been on the  rhetoric in Korea or the -- the daily moves in the S&amp;P that the much bigger  moves we've had over the last 48 hours have really been in the VIX, and  volatility on the VIX, right, which have moved significantly more than you  would usually expect.  And you know, that suggest that that's maybe where  the real market pressure is, where some of the real market inefficiency  might be, and it's not just mood volatility significantly, but as you  mentioned it's moved skew significantly, right?  So you've seen the  volatility on puts rise to relatively unusually high levels versus calls.   So you know, in our view, probably, the best way to lean against that would  be, that that makes calls relatively cheap, because that's the volatility  that's lowest relative to everything else.</p><p>  MILLER:  All right, Andrew, you're going to stick with us here.   Andrew Sheets is chief -- chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley.   There's a lot to talk about on a day like today when we see actual movement  in equity index.</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  MILLER:  Joining us here to talk about that in Berlin is our  government editor, Alan Crawford.  Andrew Sheets is with us as well, chief  cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley.  Alan, let's talk -- touch on the  first point.  And I think a lot of Germans find it hard to sort of discern  now between the policies of the two parties.  What would change say, if the  SPD won and Martin Schultz came in Angela Merkel's place, policy-wise?</p><p>  CRAWFORD:  Well, at the moment, that looks like a big if, but it would  also depend very much on what kind of coalition he could form.  At the  moment, that latest poll suggests it would have to be something like a  four-way coalition, so it's extremely hard to see.  Nevertheless, what we  could see is that Martin Schulz as a former president of the European  Parliament, he's somewhat more open to certainly common European policies,  so perhaps more in terms of defense sharing and crucially perhaps, more in  terms of integrating the Eurozone.  Merkel has also made some comments  about that, that she's open to some of these moves by the -- the French  president, but the --  the assumption is that Schultz would probably be  somewhat more open.  Whether that extends to debt sharing is a different  issue, but yes, more open.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  So it's hers to lose at this point in time, now that I think  it's clear judging by the polling, Alan, so what risks is she running, kind  of -- and -- and how does that relate to the strategy that we're seeing?</p><p>  CRAWFORD:  Well, as we just mentioned, we're talking about party  certainly, party officials are somewhat concerned about any -- any hint of  complacency.  Not so much on Merkel's behalf but more like on behalf of the  party and the party apparatus.  Remember of course, when Merkel first ran  for Chancellor in 2005, she was running Gerhard Schroder who was the  incumbent -- he was the chancellor, and she managed to -- to squander a  lead of more than 20 percentage points.  He of course, was an extremely  adept campaigner, and it was -- and in the end, she one by one point.   Nevertheless, she is embarking on 50-stop campaign tour, so I think it's  hard to accuse her of complacency at this point.</p><p>  MILLER:  You're welcome to refresh or memories.  I mean, not all of us  wrote a book on Angela Merkel.  I should point out that Alan wrote a book  on Merkel, so he knows this subject better than anyone.  Andrew, let me ask  you from an investor's perspective, is this an important election for you  to pay close attention to?  I mean, do you have to be as concerned about  this as you did the French elections or the Dutch elections, or can you  pretty much consider this a confirmation of Angela Merkel's fourth term and  that kind consistency is good for you as an investor?</p><p>  SHEETS:  Well, look, so I -- I think about it as -- as follows.  I  think in terms of the actual outcome, I think markets are probably going to  focus on it somewhat less because of what we've already seen in the  Netherlands and France, and because I think there's a broad majority within  Germany that -- that is pro-Europe, pro the E.U., and is pushing towards  more integrations, that whole argument that there might be some faction  pushing for something different now, seems significantly less likely.  But  I think what markets will focus on is this idea that at the core of Europe  in -- between France and Germany, this idea of really working for a  stronger European union, are pushed towards reform that we might not have  seen in a way that we have in a number of years.  I think that's  structurally bullish for the euro, that's been one of the key calls of our  FX strategy team, and the euro remains very undervalued on a long-term  basis, and so this is a multi-year call in our view, for a stronger euro.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  Alan, where does the risk lie to Europe in this election?   There does seem to be this sense that coming out of this, we're going to  see a new impetus towards a closer integration.  Now, that's started by Mr.  Macron, but the German election's a pivotal piece in all of this.  Does the  coalition formation have a bearing on that?  I.e., if she's in -- in -- in  coalition with the -- with the FDP for instance, would that dilute that  drive?</p><p>  CRAWFORD:  This is exactly the point that we will be focusing on  during our coverage.  The -- the latest poll for example, showed that  Merkel has various coalition options which could in turn strengthen her  hand in negotiations which remember, tend to last several weeks, if not  months in Germany, after the election.  Yes, the free democrats with whom  had her second term coalition, they are -- they're more skeptical in terms  of euro are bailouts, in terms of -- in terms of more integration in the  Eurozone, that could put a break on some of her plans.  Equally, the Greens  are also in play.  They are somewhat more enthusiastic about Eurozone  integration and essentially, helping others.  There could be a three-way  coalition which is untested at the Federal level, or it could be an  underground coalition.</p><p>  MILLER:  I remember when Joschka Fischer who was -- who's arguably,  one of the most famous Greens said, forget about it, we prefer to wear  dreadlocks, and they wouldn't be able to deal with that.  Something like  that, I'm paraphrasing.  But it is a possible coalition.  What's the --  what's the -- what are the dangers to Merkel here, and what could bring her  down in the next six weeks?  Is diesel a problem for her, is -- is the  refugee, I would say crisis, but it's no longer a crisis here in Germany,  is the influx that we saw a couple of years ago of refugees a problem for  her?  What could bring her down?</p><p>  CRAWFORD:  That's definitely an Achilles heel.  If there were -- if  there were to be some massive influx to Germany such as we saw two years  ago when there was a genuine crisis and a buildup of people at Germany's  border, that -- at the moment, the focus is on Italy, so it looks somewhat  less likely, but nevertheless, if she was forced to make some kind of snap  decision about that, then that would be a problem for her.  Who that would  benefit, whether it would benefit her main rival is another issue.   Certainly, there's also, if there were any sort of repeat of the -- of the  sexual attacks in Cologne, that was a devastating issue related to the  crisis.  Of course, terrorism is always -- is always lurking.  Again, it's  hard to see how these issues could -- could boost support for her -- her --  her main rival.  The one thing I would say is, there is a potential that  support for the -- the far right, anti-immigration AfD Party, perhaps the  polls are underestimating that.  I'm not saying it could win, but there is  importantly the level, higher.</p><p>  MILLER:  The polls here though, historically more accurate than they  are say, in Britain.  Alan Crawford, our European government editor here in  Berlin.  I should point out that he co-wrote the book, \"Angela Merkel: A  Chancellor Forged in Crisis\" with Tony Czuczka who also works with us here  in Berlin.  Andrew Sheets is the chief crosset (ph) asset -- cross asset  strategist at Morgan Stanley, he's going to stick with us, our guest host  for the hour.</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  JOHNSON:  Let's turn our attention now to market risks and how  investors should be positioning themselves.  Alan Sheets chief cross asset  strategist at Morgan Stanley is still with us, and let's talk about some of  the calls that we should be making right now.  Andrew, the world is long  euro, is that the right call?</p><p>  SHEETS:  Yes.  So we think from an equity perspective, not  necessarily.  Graham Secker, our European equity strategist has been  somewhat cautious over the last several months on concerns around what the  strong euro will mean for earnings.  Now, I think what's quite interesting  is just really, over the last day, some of the tactical indicators that his  team follows have finally dipped down into bi-territory, so that's  something we have to watch in terms of our relative preferences.   Currently, the U.S. and Japan are our top global equity markets, but Europe  has underperformed recently, and that's something we have to monitor.</p><p>  MILLER:  Why are you long European value versus growth right now,  Andrew?</p><p>  SHEETS:  Sure.  So look, I think the -- the argument for Europe is  that you have an improving economy and that valuations are attractive, that  I think is the dominant narrative that I hear for European equities.  I  think if we look deeper into the market, most of the value in Europe lies  within value, it lies within the financial sector, it lies within the  energy sector, it lies within some of the other parts that make up the  value index.  So in our view, that's the part of the market where the  majority of the cheapness of Europe is concentrated.  It's starting to get  some positive momentum on a long-term basis, it's underperformed really,  for a decade and we think that's starting to turn around in our long-term  view.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  Why are you short U.K. inflation?  Why are you short the  U.K. 10-year breakeven?</p><p>  SHEETS:  Sure.  So -- so we think Brexit remains a challenging  dynamic, right, and you're going to have U.K. politicians coming back from  their holidays, going into negotiations in September, and we expect  potentially more negative news flow.  I think breakevens are one of the  more optimistically priced assets related to the U.K. economy, right?   Expecting inflation to remain at levels, really similar levels predicted in  2007.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  Matt?</p><p>  MILLER:  All right.  That was a fun speed round, we should do that --  we should do that more often.  Andrew Sheets from Morgan Stanley is going  to stay with us.  We have a lot more questions for him.</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  MILLER:  Joining me now is Bloomberg Businessweek senior editor here  in Berlin, David Rocks.  Andrew Sheets, chief cross asset strategist at  Morgan Stanley is still with us in London as our guest host for the hour.   David, first off, tell -- tell me about the city series, what prompted  this, what's it about, what's the cities issue?</p><p>  ROCKS:  Well, there's -- there's 32 cities in the world now with more  than 10 million people.  More and more people around the world are moving  to cities, and obviously, cities are a hugely important -- it's where  people live now, right?  More and more, especially in the developing world,  so we wanted to look some of the problems ...</p><p>  MILLER:  Some (inaudible) rural and into the urban basically, yes.</p><p>  ROCKS:  Yes.  We look at the kind of problems that these cities are  having and how they can keep themselves from being strangled by their  growth.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  It's interesting that -- that Moscow has -- has sort of  changed so much and so quickly, David.  It's gone in 20 years from being  this incredibly sort of dower, difficult city to live in, to being this  kind of sort of, standout metropolis, and that journey has been quite an  incredible one.  Just in terms of the momentum that Moscow has right now,  how would you describe it?</p><p>  ROCKS:  Well, I think that a couple things are at play here.  The --  the -- the numbers that we're about to see toady are probably going to show  that consumption remains the main driver of the Russian economy.  And  you're never going to -- you're going to see that mostly in Moscow, or more  -- more -- more clearly in Moscow.  It's a -- it's a pretty wealthy city,  and there are a lot of people there with a lot of money, and the city has a  -- brought a lot of tax revenue, so they're spending it on making the place  a nicer place to live.</p><p>  MILLER:  What is -- what are some of the other cities that you focused  on?</p><p>  ROCKS:  Well, we looked at -- we looked at bike-sharing in Beijing,  we've got somebody who went out and sort of tried that, and it's, you know,  Beijing used to be a city where there were tons and tons of bikes, and now  it's become -- for years, they sort of focused on cars, now they're kind of  looking at bikes again, so that's a nice -- that's a nice view.  We looked  at New York City, how cities have a difficult time knowing what's actually  underneath them.  In New York City, you know, obviously, everybody knows  where, you know, 57th and Park is, but do they actually know what's  underneath there?  And the answer is no.  Not just the subways, but all of  the conduits and things like that, and that's a huge problem for cities  around the world.  So there's a guy who's creating a -- like an underground  map of New York City that we profile nicely, so ...</p><p>  JOHNSON:  That sounds amazing.  (inaudible) can't wait to see that.   Andrew, let's bring you into this conversation, Andrew Sheets.  GDP data  out of Russia a little bit later on.  Where does Russia stack up in the --  the -- in the options that you see in front of you?  It's long being  perceived as being a kind of oil trade, but -- but that -- that kind of  story has been diluted a little bit.  How do you -- how do you see Russia  stacking up?  It's isolated increasingly, it finds itself on the wrong side  of the political story increasingly.  Where do we go with it as an  investment, though?</p><p>  SHEETS:  Well, look, I mean, obviously, this is a country, right,  where there's the political side of things, and then there's the economic  side of things, right?  Politically, it -- it is clearly going to be in the  head -- it is clearly in the headlines and will continue to be in the  headlines with some of the things coming out of the U.S. as well as the  continued volatility in oil prices.  But if we look at the macro economics,  those in the country have been improving.  Inflation has been moderating,  the budget balances have been getting better thanks to the weaker ruble,  and we think that credit profile of the country has actually been getting  somewhat stronger while the currency remains very inexpensive, and real  rates in Russia are some of the highest anywhere.  So it's -- it's been  very prudential, it's been very cautious since monetary policy, it's been  very conservative which we think is helpful, and that's one of the reasons  why generally speaking, we see the risk reward in Russian fixed income as  more favorable than many other countries in EM.</p><p>  MILLER:  All right.  Very interesting call and very interesting  edition, can't wait to see it.  David Rocks our senior editor here in  Berlin, thanks so much for joining us.  Andrew Sheets, chief crosset (ph)  strategist at Morgan Stanley is our guest host for the hour, he's going to  stick with us as we tack tech.  Is tech disrupting the inflation theory?   We'll discuss how Amazon is factoring in today's consumer price reading and  decisions.  This is Bloomberg.</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  JOHNSON:  Joining us now, Julian David, he's the CEO of techUK.   Andrew Sheets, chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley is still with  us.  Julian, first of all, I -- I -- we're going to spend a lot of the day  talking about inflation.  Tech we know, is a disinflationary factor.  It --  look at Moore's Law, look at all kinds of different factors, tech generally  has that -- has that impact, and it improves productivity and -- and -- and  therefore, filters back in that way as well.  When you look at the  incredibly low, sort of, inflationary environment that we have at the  moment, do you think tech is, and -- and companies like Amazon are  responsible partly for that?</p><p>  DAVID:  Yes.  I think -- I mean, there's -- there's historical trend  on this.  I mean, technology has applied to all industries, has brought  prices down and changed the balance.  So if you just look at the move from  craft industries to manufactured goods, there's a huge reduction there.   You look at what happened in the emergence of China as a manufacturing  powerhouse driven by tech, the -- the use of robotics and so on.  What's  happening now of course, is that's also now being applied to services, and  it's the internet which is -- which is powering that.  So you're having the  ability first of all, to use assets much more productively, secondly, to  increase the pull of assets.  If you look at things like, you know, Airbnb  bringing trillions of dollars worth of flexible accommodation into the  market, that makes a big -- big -- big change.  So yes, tech is -- is a  major force behind better pricing, better offers, more flexible offers for  -- for consumers.</p><p>  MILLER:  Julian, are we talking about two different things, though  that both are contributing to lower prices or a lack of price growth?  On  the one hand, you got the sharing economy, and basically, that's allowing  people to pay lower prices for services that the -- the providers used to  charge a premium for, now, for example, if you're a driver or offering a  room for rent, you just don't make that much money on it -- on that  service.  On the other hand, you've got a company that is such a behemoth,  it's willing to not make a profit in order to eat up the market share that  everybody else used to enjoy.  Aren't those two different issues?</p><p>  DAVID:  Well, there's a consistent thread which is, it's technology  that enables that kind of approach, so you know, if you -- if you just look  at conventional retailing, the technology around superstores, which --  which came into place, the ability to manage distribution using tech to do  logistics, you know, really gave you the opportunity to operate at a larger  scale with lower margins, better pricing for the consumer.  And the  internet allows you to do that on a bigger scale, so -- so I really think  technology is a driver of this, and you're going to see this across  services now.</p><p>  MILLER:  Well, tech -- on the one hand is technology, on the other  hand, if you look at company like Amazon, if you look at a company like  Uber, it's the willingness not to make any money in order to knock the  other guy out of business and control the entire market, no?</p><p>  DAVID:  Well, the -- the ability to take a long-term look at this, the  -- the willingness of investors to -- to go with and the ability to finance  this stuff is clearly, you know, a necessary part of it.  But at the end of  the day, you still got to back to the performance.  You know, if they're  able to get a better performance by using technology in a smarter way by,  you know, managing assets at -- at -- at lower returns, then that's going  to give them the opportunity to -- to grow, and that's going to drive  again, you know, investor interest.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  Andrew, is the Phillips curve broken because of Amazon?</p><p>  SHEETS:  Well, you know, I think it's interesting, right?  So our  interest rate strategists have looked at this and they find that the  Phillips curve is actually still in place and still working in -- in parts  of the economy, and just not working in others in part, due to technology  disruption and some of these other factors.  So I think it is still there,  and I think it's also important, I think as Julian alluded to, which is, we  need to differentiate between this low inflation and the function of a  negative demand shock which is very concerning for markets and a sign that  growth is weaker than expected, or a positive supply shock, i.e., more  technology coming online, more supply which is a positive.  So again, I  would say that our interpretation is more towards the latter, is more that  some of the inflation dynamics that we're seeing are more of a function of  a positive supply dynamic than a weak demand dynamic.  But again, I think  that is a real key debate for markets.</p><p>  MILLER:  What about the -- I wonder how long investors are willing to  put money behind a company that doesn't make any money, as long as it grows  revenue and takes market share?  Is that -- I mean, is there really no set  time limit for that because Amazon's been doing it for 20 years?</p><p>  DAVID:  Yes, I think -- I think, Matt, that's a very interesting  question, you know, it's one that has been asked ever since they got going.   You know, I used to work a lot with conventional retailers.  You know, the  conventional wisdom was, this can't last.  Conventional wisdom, Andrew,  sometimes doesn't work out, does it?  And it certainly didn't in this case.</p><p>  MILLER:  Andrew, what do you think?</p><p>  SHEETS:  Well -- well, look, I mean, again, I think that's -- that's  right.  So look, I -- I won't comment specifically on -- on the company  itself, but -- but this has been a trend that's been in place for -- for a  long period of time.  You know, I -- I also think that you have a market  where, you know, we just talked in a previous segment, I mean, people are  very willing to buy gold despite the fact that it has a negative income.   So -- so the site -- I mean, one of the -- the -- the fallouts of low  interest rates is that the opportunity cost of investing in a business or  investing in an asset does not necessarily earn any money right now, that  opportunity cost is a lot lower.  And so you know, there -- there are some  positive dynamics of that and there are potentially some negative dynamics  of that.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  We'll leave it there.  Gentlemen, thank you very much  indeed.  Andrew, you're going to stick around, but we're going to give you  a 10-minute break.  You're going to join Matt and I on Bloomberg Radio very  shortly at the top of the hour.  Andrew Sheets joining us from Morgan  Stanley.  We're going to carry on the conversation with Julian David, he is  the CEO of techUK, we need to talk about what is happening with Brexit.   Brexit optimism, Theresa may sticking to her (inaudible) timetable despite  doubts within her cabinet.  We're going to discuss what that means to the  tech landscape.  We should probably also talk about gender within the tech  landscape as well.  This is Bloomberg.</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  MILLER:  I want to get back to the tech theme though that we've been  discussing.  Theresa May still aims to stick to her two-year Brexit deal  goal despite members of her own cabinet expressing doubts over the  timetable.  Last month, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox called  this optimistic, while chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond  envisions a three-year bridging period.</p><p>  Julian David, CEO of techUK is still with us.  And Julian, we were  talking about -- we were talking about tech issues as far as market share  profitability and inflation in the U.S. is concerned, let's talk about tech  issues as far as employment, location, positioning, and Brexit is  concerned.  We had an interesting story earlier this week about how media  companies may need to look outside the U.K. because of licensing issues.   Do you see the same concern at tech company headquarters as we do with bank  headquarters in the U.K. post-Brexit?</p><p>  DAVID:  Absolutely, Matt.  You know, the -- the U.K. tech industry was  very clear in the run up to the referendum that the best solution was  staying in the European Union, and since the referendum which of course,  the democratic process, we accept that, we've been very clear that we need  to be very close to the single market, we need to have access to this and  we need to concentrate on three areas which are really concerning to tech.   The first one is skills and talent.  We're already seeing it difficult to  get the sort of talent that we need to be the global leader in tech here in  the U.K., and secondly, is the -- the whole regulatory and customs, and  equivalents regime which some call a customs union, but it's a bit more  than that in tech because it also covers services and it covers other  things.</p><p>  And -- and we need to have that as close to Europe as possible, and  the last one is data.  You know, if we don't have a data adequacy agreement  with the European Union, then it will be impossible for tech companies to  operate with European citizens' data.  So that's a big deal, that's a cliff  edge.  That's a -- that's a , you know, fall-off-the-clip thing.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  The -- the data is here, it was massive.  Google's just won  approval to -- to build its new London headquarters next to the -- to the  old one up in King's Cross.  Aren't you surprised that they're building  that?</p><p>  DAVID:  No, because U.K. is a big tech opportunity, big tech market,  big tech center.  You know, we are globally up there speaking of data.   Well, if you think about it, you know, these kind of things are set against  an industry that's growing, so making that kind of investment in a big  economy like the U.K probably still makes sense.  But also of course, they  don't know exactly how this is going to turn out, so we're trying and  hoping the government's going to -- going to get this right, you know.  Our  (inaudible) hash tag say get it right, because if we don't ...</p><p>  JOHNSON:  That sounds nice.</p><p>  DAVID:  Yes.  If we don't -- you know, so it's encouraging to hear the  kind of stuff that's being talked about -- about our transition.  We're  saying we need a long runway to make, you know, to land this Brexit claim.   It's not going to be done in what is left, a year?  And I know it's two  years in theory, but really, you -- you need to get these things done,  otherwise, people will have to make decisions and they'll have to move  stuff.  So what we need is that -- that transition period, and we need a  data adequacy position without a doubt.  Not just us, but all the  industries is (inaudible) on data.</p><p>  MILLER:  Julian, I want to ask about -- I mean, we know that there's a  need for more biological diversity at tech companies in the U.S., it's  something, you know, Bloomberg is a company who feels very strongly about,  and we've been reporting on it for -- for years now.  What about  ideological diversity?  Is it possible to have a difference of opinion in  these companies, or are they really, just -- have they really just turned  into an echo chamber?  Because most recently, you know, one employee was  fired for voicing a different opinion, and now, (inaudible) he wants to  find a safe space for people to have free speech.</p><p>  DAVID:  Look, obviously, I don't have the detail and I can't comment  on an individual company situation, but clearly, you know, tech thrives on  innovation, it thrives on -- on -- on diversity, and that's diversity of  opinion and diversity of -- of people in the market.  But it must be said,  we all understand there is a problem around the participation of -- of  female workforce in tech.  It's only about 17 percent.  You know, you --  you can't carry on with that in the face of what is a continuing skill  shortage, plus, at the end of the day, tech has a bigger roles (inaudible)  a supplier, it's also part of society, so women are contributing  (inaudible) that's not going to be good.</p><p>  JOHNSON:  We're going to carry on that conversation on Bloomberg  Radio.  Surveillance is next.  Matt and I are going to Bloomberg Radio.</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Good morning. Which is the bigger factor for the market today, inflation number coming out a little bit later on or what's happening on the geopolitical front?</p><p>SHEETS: I think geopolitics have really taken -- taken the lead here. I think if you would ask investors on Monday, it was absolutely around CPI, it would be absolutely around, you know, the timing of -- of a Fed action and what we might see, but I think the moves -- the rhetoric that we've seen out of Washington and North Korea, that has I think, been the predominant factor now dominating markets.</p><p>JOHNSON: Just to kind of take a step back, nobody's here, these are thinned markets. The president's, theoretically, on holiday, is it just the fact that -- that we are in holiday liquidity sort of environments in - - in various asset classes that is -- that is driving this kind of pickup in volatility?</p><p>SHEETS: Well, look, I mean, I think that's -- that's actually a really important point, right? As -- as silly as it might sound that kind of where people currently are, are a bigger factor than some of these macroeconomic events. The fact that August is a time when a lot of people are out that we are seeing the -- the president and his staff are not in the White House, that investors often have to deal with markets with thinner liquidity and thinner markets in August, has a tendency to exacerbate moves. And I think that's maybe one reason why historically, you tend to see somewhat weaker market performance in August relative to other months.</p><p>MILLER: So you think we're going to see a pickup then in volatility? Are we going to -- I mean, the other day, we were making a massive deal about the S&amp;P 500 being down 0.24 percent, are we going to start seeing 1 percent moves again, real -- real range?</p><p>SHEETS: So I would actually be a little bit skeptical about that. So look, you -- you obviously have had a big shock to a market that was incredibly calm. So right, as of Monday, the 10-year -- the 10-day realized volatility for the S&amp;P 500 was just 2 or 3 percent, it was the lowest in 50 years. So it's definitely a shock for the market to go from that level of calm to what we have currently, but if I think about the factors that are still in place, I think you still are dealing with relatively solid global growth, you're s till dealing with very dovish policy. Most of the positioning metrics that we track don't suggest investors are unusually long. I think all of those things argue against a really large regime shift into kind of daily 1, 1.5 percent moves.</p><p>MILLER: One of the things -- one of the factoids I saw recently in a story about how quant hedge fund strategies are failing because there's not enough dumb money out there is that, retail investors' cash levels are at the lowest they've been in a decade. If they've -- if they've already -- if they're already so invested or it doesn't matter I guess, where they're invested, do you expect them to maybe be pulling money out then? Especially as we see highs like this?</p><p>SHEETS: Well, look, I mean, I think this is a debate where you can find data on -- on either side, so I guess what -- what I find a little bit more encouraging is that if we look at flows into the equity market, especially the U.S. equity market, those flows have still been incredibly modest, not just over the last year, but really over the last eight years. So I don't yet see evidence, and I think, you know, our -- our U.S. equity strategist very much agree with this. We don't see evidence that retail has rushed a lot of money into the market recently that it would then need to pull out. So -- so look, there's always -- you know, I certainly wouldn't say that investors were negative, you know, in the last several months, but we don't see that sign of excessive stock buying that would lead we think, to excessive retail selling.</p><p>JOHNSON: This is definitely the wrong chart, what I'm about to show here. Let's talk about -- a little bit about the skew and what's going on. The market is -- is positioning itself to buy kind of downside protection at the moment. The -- the -- the line goes up, as it goes up, basically, that's signaling that the market is trying to buy downside protection. Is that an opportunity do you think at this point when you're looking at what is happening with the SPX? Would you be going the other way?</p><p>SHEETS: Yes. Well, look, I think that's -- that's a really important part, right? So as much as, you know, the -- the focus has been on the rhetoric in Korea or the -- the daily moves in the S&amp;P that the much bigger moves we've had over the last 48 hours have really been in the VIX, and volatility on the VIX, right, which have moved significantly more than you would usually expect. And you know, that suggest that that's maybe where the real market pressure is, where some of the real market inefficiency might be, and it's not just mood volatility significantly, but as you mentioned it's moved skew significantly, right? So you've seen the volatility on puts rise to relatively unusually high levels versus calls. So you know, in our view, probably, the best way to lean against that would be, that that makes calls relatively cheap, because that's the volatility that's lowest relative to everything else.</p><p>MILLER: All right, Andrew, you're going to stick with us here. Andrew Sheets is chief -- chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley. There's a lot to talk about on a day like today when we see actual movement in equity index.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MILLER: Joining us here to talk about that in Berlin is our government editor, Alan Crawford. Andrew Sheets is with us as well, chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley. Alan, let's talk -- touch on the first point. And I think a lot of Germans find it hard to sort of discern now between the policies of the two parties. What would change say, if the SPD won and Martin Schultz came in Angela Merkel's place, policy-wise?</p><p>CRAWFORD: Well, at the moment, that looks like a big if, but it would also depend very much on what kind of coalition he could form. At the moment, that latest poll suggests it would have to be something like a four-way coalition, so it's extremely hard to see. Nevertheless, what we could see is that Martin Schulz as a former president of the European Parliament, he's somewhat more open to certainly common European policies, so perhaps more in terms of defense sharing and crucially perhaps, more in terms of integrating the Eurozone. Merkel has also made some comments about that, that she's open to some of these moves by the -- the French president, but the -- the assumption is that Schultz would probably be somewhat more open. Whether that extends to debt sharing is a different issue, but yes, more open.</p><p>JOHNSON: So it's hers to lose at this point in time, now that I think it's clear judging by the polling, Alan, so what risks is she running, kind of -- and -- and how does that relate to the strategy that we're seeing?</p><p>CRAWFORD: Well, as we just mentioned, we're talking about party certainly, party officials are somewhat concerned about any -- any hint of complacency. Not so much on Merkel's behalf but more like on behalf of the party and the party apparatus. Remember of course, when Merkel first ran for Chancellor in 2005, she was running Gerhard Schroder who was the incumbent -- he was the chancellor, and she managed to -- to squander a lead of more than 20 percentage points. He of course, was an extremely adept campaigner, and it was -- and in the end, she one by one point. Nevertheless, she is embarking on 50-stop campaign tour, so I think it's hard to accuse her of complacency at this point.</p><p>MILLER: You're welcome to refresh or memories. I mean, not all of us wrote a book on Angela Merkel. I should point out that Alan wrote a book on Merkel, so he knows this subject better than anyone. Andrew, let me ask you from an investor's perspective, is this an important election for you to pay close attention to? I mean, do you have to be as concerned about this as you did the French elections or the Dutch elections, or can you pretty much consider this a confirmation of Angela Merkel's fourth term and that kind consistency is good for you as an investor?</p><p>SHEETS: Well, look, so I -- I think about it as -- as follows. I think in terms of the actual outcome, I think markets are probably going to focus on it somewhat less because of what we've already seen in the Netherlands and France, and because I think there's a broad majority within Germany that -- that is pro-Europe, pro the E.U., and is pushing towards more integrations, that whole argument that there might be some faction pushing for something different now, seems significantly less likely. But I think what markets will focus on is this idea that at the core of Europe in -- between France and Germany, this idea of really working for a stronger European union, are pushed towards reform that we might not have seen in a way that we have in a number of years. I think that's structurally bullish for the euro, that's been one of the key calls of our FX strategy team, and the euro remains very undervalued on a long-term basis, and so this is a multi-year call in our view, for a stronger euro.</p><p>JOHNSON: Alan, where does the risk lie to Europe in this election? There does seem to be this sense that coming out of this, we're going to see a new impetus towards a closer integration. Now, that's started by Mr. Macron, but the German election's a pivotal piece in all of this. Does the coalition formation have a bearing on that? I.e., if she's in -- in -- in coalition with the -- with the FDP for instance, would that dilute that drive?</p><p>CRAWFORD: This is exactly the point that we will be focusing on during our coverage. The -- the latest poll for example, showed that Merkel has various coalition options which could in turn strengthen her hand in negotiations which remember, tend to last several weeks, if not months in Germany, after the election. Yes, the free democrats with whom had her second term coalition, they are -- they're more skeptical in terms of euro are bailouts, in terms of -- in terms of more integration in the Eurozone, that could put a break on some of her plans. Equally, the Greens are also in play. They are somewhat more enthusiastic about Eurozone integration and essentially, helping others. There could be a three-way coalition which is untested at the Federal level, or it could be an underground coalition.</p><p>MILLER: I remember when Joschka Fischer who was -- who's arguably, one of the most famous Greens said, forget about it, we prefer to wear dreadlocks, and they wouldn't be able to deal with that. Something like that, I'm paraphrasing. But it is a possible coalition. What's the -- what's the -- what are the dangers to Merkel here, and what could bring her down in the next six weeks? Is diesel a problem for her, is -- is the refugee, I would say crisis, but it's no longer a crisis here in Germany, is the influx that we saw a couple of years ago of refugees a problem for her? What could bring her down?</p><p>CRAWFORD: That's definitely an Achilles heel. If there were -- if there were to be some massive influx to Germany such as we saw two years ago when there was a genuine crisis and a buildup of people at Germany's border, that -- at the moment, the focus is on Italy, so it looks somewhat less likely, but nevertheless, if she was forced to make some kind of snap decision about that, then that would be a problem for her. Who that would benefit, whether it would benefit her main rival is another issue. Certainly, there's also, if there were any sort of repeat of the -- of the sexual attacks in Cologne, that was a devastating issue related to the crisis. Of course, terrorism is always -- is always lurking. Again, it's hard to see how these issues could -- could boost support for her -- her -- her main rival. The one thing I would say is, there is a potential that support for the -- the far right, anti-immigration AfD Party, perhaps the polls are underestimating that. I'm not saying it could win, but there is importantly the level, higher.</p><p>MILLER: The polls here though, historically more accurate than they are say, in Britain. Alan Crawford, our European government editor here in Berlin. I should point out that he co-wrote the book, \"Angela Merkel: A Chancellor Forged in Crisis\" with Tony Czuczka who also works with us here in Berlin. Andrew Sheets is the chief crosset (ph) asset -- cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley, he's going to stick with us, our guest host for the hour.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Let's turn our attention now to market risks and how investors should be positioning themselves. Alan Sheets chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley is still with us, and let's talk about some of the calls that we should be making right now. Andrew, the world is long euro, is that the right call?</p><p>SHEETS: Yes. So we think from an equity perspective, not necessarily. Graham Secker, our European equity strategist has been somewhat cautious over the last several months on concerns around what the strong euro will mean for earnings. Now, I think what's quite interesting is just really, over the last day, some of the tactical indicators that his team follows have finally dipped down into bi-territory, so that's something we have to watch in terms of our relative preferences. Currently, the U.S. and Japan are our top global equity markets, but Europe has underperformed recently, and that's something we have to monitor.</p><p>MILLER: Why are you long European value versus growth right now, Andrew?</p><p>SHEETS: Sure. So look, I think the -- the argument for Europe is that you have an improving economy and that valuations are attractive, that I think is the dominant narrative that I hear for European equities. I think if we look deeper into the market, most of the value in Europe lies within value, it lies within the financial sector, it lies within the energy sector, it lies within some of the other parts that make up the value index. So in our view, that's the part of the market where the majority of the cheapness of Europe is concentrated. It's starting to get some positive momentum on a long-term basis, it's underperformed really, for a decade and we think that's starting to turn around in our long-term view.</p><p>JOHNSON: Why are you short U.K. inflation? Why are you short the U.K. 10-year breakeven?</p><p>SHEETS: Sure. So -- so we think Brexit remains a challenging dynamic, right, and you're going to have U.K. politicians coming back from their holidays, going into negotiations in September, and we expect potentially more negative news flow. I think breakevens are one of the more optimistically priced assets related to the U.K. economy, right? Expecting inflation to remain at levels, really similar levels predicted in 2007.</p><p>JOHNSON: Matt?</p><p>MILLER: All right. That was a fun speed round, we should do that -- we should do that more often. Andrew Sheets from Morgan Stanley is going to stay with us. We have a lot more questions for him.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MILLER: Joining me now is Bloomberg Businessweek senior editor here in Berlin, David Rocks. Andrew Sheets, chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley is still with us in London as our guest host for the hour. David, first off, tell -- tell me about the city series, what prompted this, what's it about, what's the cities issue?</p><p>ROCKS: Well, there's -- there's 32 cities in the world now with more than 10 million people. More and more people around the world are moving to cities, and obviously, cities are a hugely important -- it's where people live now, right? More and more, especially in the developing world, so we wanted to look some of the problems ...</p><p>MILLER: Some (inaudible) rural and into the urban basically, yes.</p><p>ROCKS: Yes. We look at the kind of problems that these cities are having and how they can keep themselves from being strangled by their growth.</p><p>JOHNSON: It's interesting that -- that Moscow has -- has sort of changed so much and so quickly, David. It's gone in 20 years from being this incredibly sort of dower, difficult city to live in, to being this kind of sort of, standout metropolis, and that journey has been quite an incredible one. Just in terms of the momentum that Moscow has right now, how would you describe it?</p><p>ROCKS: Well, I think that a couple things are at play here. The -- the -- the numbers that we're about to see toady are probably going to show that consumption remains the main driver of the Russian economy. And you're never going to -- you're going to see that mostly in Moscow, or more -- more -- more clearly in Moscow. It's a -- it's a pretty wealthy city, and there are a lot of people there with a lot of money, and the city has a -- brought a lot of tax revenue, so they're spending it on making the place a nicer place to live.</p><p>MILLER: What is -- what are some of the other cities that you focused on?</p><p>ROCKS: Well, we looked at -- we looked at bike-sharing in Beijing, we've got somebody who went out and sort of tried that, and it's, you know, Beijing used to be a city where there were tons and tons of bikes, and now it's become -- for years, they sort of focused on cars, now they're kind of looking at bikes again, so that's a nice -- that's a nice view. We looked at New York City, how cities have a difficult time knowing what's actually underneath them. In New York City, you know, obviously, everybody knows where, you know, 57th and Park is, but do they actually know what's underneath there? And the answer is no. Not just the subways, but all of the conduits and things like that, and that's a huge problem for cities around the world. So there's a guy who's creating a -- like an underground map of New York City that we profile nicely, so ...</p><p>JOHNSON: That sounds amazing. (inaudible) can't wait to see that. Andrew, let's bring you into this conversation, Andrew Sheets. GDP data out of Russia a little bit later on. Where does Russia stack up in the -- the -- in the options that you see in front of you? It's long being perceived as being a kind of oil trade, but -- but that -- that kind of story has been diluted a little bit. How do you -- how do you see Russia stacking up? It's isolated increasingly, it finds itself on the wrong side of the political story increasingly. Where do we go with it as an investment, though?</p><p>SHEETS: Well, look, I mean, obviously, this is a country, right, where there's the political side of things, and then there's the economic side of things, right? Politically, it -- it is clearly going to be in the head -- it is clearly in the headlines and will continue to be in the headlines with some of the things coming out of the U.S. as well as the continued volatility in oil prices. But if we look at the macro economics, those in the country have been improving. Inflation has been moderating, the budget balances have been getting better thanks to the weaker ruble, and we think that credit profile of the country has actually been getting somewhat stronger while the currency remains very inexpensive, and real rates in Russia are some of the highest anywhere. So it's -- it's been very prudential, it's been very cautious since monetary policy, it's been very conservative which we think is helpful, and that's one of the reasons why generally speaking, we see the risk reward in Russian fixed income as more favorable than many other countries in EM.</p><p>MILLER: All right. Very interesting call and very interesting edition, can't wait to see it. David Rocks our senior editor here in Berlin, thanks so much for joining us. Andrew Sheets, chief crosset (ph) strategist at Morgan Stanley is our guest host for the hour, he's going to stick with us as we tack tech. Is tech disrupting the inflation theory? We'll discuss how Amazon is factoring in today's consumer price reading and decisions. This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Joining us now, Julian David, he's the CEO of techUK. Andrew Sheets, chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley is still with us. Julian, first of all, I -- I -- we're going to spend a lot of the day talking about inflation. Tech we know, is a disinflationary factor. It -- look at Moore's Law, look at all kinds of different factors, tech generally has that -- has that impact, and it improves productivity and -- and -- and therefore, filters back in that way as well. When you look at the incredibly low, sort of, inflationary environment that we have at the moment, do you think tech is, and -- and companies like Amazon are responsible partly for that?</p><p>DAVID: Yes. I think -- I mean, there's -- there's historical trend on this. I mean, technology has applied to all industries, has brought prices down and changed the balance. So if you just look at the move from craft industries to manufactured goods, there's a huge reduction there. You look at what happened in the emergence of China as a manufacturing powerhouse driven by tech, the -- the use of robotics and so on. What's happening now of course, is that's also now being applied to services, and it's the internet which is -- which is powering that. So you're having the ability first of all, to use assets much more productively, secondly, to increase the pull of assets. If you look at things like, you know, Airbnb bringing trillions of dollars worth of flexible accommodation into the market, that makes a big -- big -- big change. So yes, tech is -- is a major force behind better pricing, better offers, more flexible offers for -- for consumers.</p><p>MILLER: Julian, are we talking about two different things, though that both are contributing to lower prices or a lack of price growth? On the one hand, you got the sharing economy, and basically, that's allowing people to pay lower prices for services that the -- the providers used to charge a premium for, now, for example, if you're a driver or offering a room for rent, you just don't make that much money on it -- on that service. On the other hand, you've got a company that is such a behemoth, it's willing to not make a profit in order to eat up the market share that everybody else used to enjoy. Aren't those two different issues?</p><p>DAVID: Well, there's a consistent thread which is, it's technology that enables that kind of approach, so you know, if you -- if you just look at conventional retailing, the technology around superstores, which -- which came into place, the ability to manage distribution using tech to do logistics, you know, really gave you the opportunity to operate at a larger scale with lower margins, better pricing for the consumer. And the internet allows you to do that on a bigger scale, so -- so I really think technology is a driver of this, and you're going to see this across services now.</p><p>MILLER: Well, tech -- on the one hand is technology, on the other hand, if you look at company like Amazon, if you look at a company like Uber, it's the willingness not to make any money in order to knock the other guy out of business and control the entire market, no?</p><p>DAVID: Well, the -- the ability to take a long-term look at this, the -- the willingness of investors to -- to go with and the ability to finance this stuff is clearly, you know, a necessary part of it. But at the end of the day, you still got to back to the performance. You know, if they're able to get a better performance by using technology in a smarter way by, you know, managing assets at -- at -- at lower returns, then that's going to give them the opportunity to -- to grow, and that's going to drive again, you know, investor interest.</p><p>JOHNSON: Andrew, is the Phillips curve broken because of Amazon?</p><p>SHEETS: Well, you know, I think it's interesting, right? So our interest rate strategists have looked at this and they find that the Phillips curve is actually still in place and still working in -- in parts of the economy, and just not working in others in part, due to technology disruption and some of these other factors. So I think it is still there, and I think it's also important, I think as Julian alluded to, which is, we need to differentiate between this low inflation and the function of a negative demand shock which is very concerning for markets and a sign that growth is weaker than expected, or a positive supply shock, i.e., more technology coming online, more supply which is a positive. So again, I would say that our interpretation is more towards the latter, is more that some of the inflation dynamics that we're seeing are more of a function of a positive supply dynamic than a weak demand dynamic. But again, I think that is a real key debate for markets.</p><p>MILLER: What about the -- I wonder how long investors are willing to put money behind a company that doesn't make any money, as long as it grows revenue and takes market share? Is that -- I mean, is there really no set time limit for that because Amazon's been doing it for 20 years?</p><p>DAVID: Yes, I think -- I think, Matt, that's a very interesting question, you know, it's one that has been asked ever since they got going. You know, I used to work a lot with conventional retailers. You know, the conventional wisdom was, this can't last. Conventional wisdom, Andrew, sometimes doesn't work out, does it? And it certainly didn't in this case.</p><p>MILLER: Andrew, what do you think?</p><p>SHEETS: Well -- well, look, I mean, again, I think that's -- that's right. So look, I -- I won't comment specifically on -- on the company itself, but -- but this has been a trend that's been in place for -- for a long period of time. You know, I -- I also think that you have a market where, you know, we just talked in a previous segment, I mean, people are very willing to buy gold despite the fact that it has a negative income. So -- so the site -- I mean, one of the -- the -- the fallouts of low interest rates is that the opportunity cost of investing in a business or investing in an asset does not necessarily earn any money right now, that opportunity cost is a lot lower. And so you know, there -- there are some positive dynamics of that and there are potentially some negative dynamics of that.</p><p>JOHNSON: We'll leave it there. Gentlemen, thank you very much indeed. Andrew, you're going to stick around, but we're going to give you a 10-minute break. You're going to join Matt and I on Bloomberg Radio very shortly at the top of the hour. Andrew Sheets joining us from Morgan Stanley. We're going to carry on the conversation with Julian David, he is the CEO of techUK, we need to talk about what is happening with Brexit. Brexit optimism, Theresa may sticking to her (inaudible) timetable despite doubts within her cabinet. We're going to discuss what that means to the tech landscape. We should probably also talk about gender within the tech landscape as well. This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MILLER: I want to get back to the tech theme though that we've been discussing. Theresa May still aims to stick to her two-year Brexit deal goal despite members of her own cabinet expressing doubts over the timetable. Last month, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox called this optimistic, while chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond envisions a three-year bridging period.</p><p>Julian David, CEO of techUK is still with us. And Julian, we were talking about -- we were talking about tech issues as far as market share profitability and inflation in the U.S. is concerned, let's talk about tech issues as far as employment, location, positioning, and Brexit is concerned. We had an interesting story earlier this week about how media companies may need to look outside the U.K. because of licensing issues. Do you see the same concern at tech company headquarters as we do with bank headquarters in the U.K. post-Brexit?</p><p>DAVID: Absolutely, Matt. You know, the -- the U.K. tech industry was very clear in the run up to the referendum that the best solution was staying in the European Union, and since the referendum which of course, the democratic process, we accept that, we've been very clear that we need to be very close to the single market, we need to have access to this and we need to concentrate on three areas which are really concerning to tech. The first one is skills and talent. We're already seeing it difficult to get the sort of talent that we need to be the global leader in tech here in the U.K., and secondly, is the -- the whole regulatory and customs, and equivalents regime which some call a customs union, but it's a bit more than that in tech because it also covers services and it covers other things.</p><p>And -- and we need to have that as close to Europe as possible, and the last one is data. You know, if we don't have a data adequacy agreement with the European Union, then it will be impossible for tech companies to operate with European citizens' data. So that's a big deal, that's a cliff edge. That's a -- that's a , you know, fall-off-the-clip thing.</p><p>JOHNSON: The -- the data is here, it was massive. Google's just won approval to -- to build its new London headquarters next to the -- to the old one up in King's Cross. Aren't you surprised that they're building that?</p><p>DAVID: No, because U.K. is a big tech opportunity, big tech market, big tech center. You know, we are globally up there speaking of data. Well, if you think about it, you know, these kind of things are set against an industry that's growing, so making that kind of investment in a big economy like the U.K probably still makes sense. But also of course, they don't know exactly how this is going to turn out, so we're trying and hoping the government's going to -- going to get this right, you know. Our (inaudible) hash tag say get it right, because if we don't ...</p><p>JOHNSON: That sounds nice.</p><p>DAVID: Yes. If we don't -- you know, so it's encouraging to hear the kind of stuff that's being talked about -- about our transition. We're saying we need a long runway to make, you know, to land this Brexit claim. It's not going to be done in what is left, a year? And I know it's two years in theory, but really, you -- you need to get these things done, otherwise, people will have to make decisions and they'll have to move stuff. So what we need is that -- that transition period, and we need a data adequacy position without a doubt. Not just us, but all the industries is (inaudible) on data.</p><p>MILLER: Julian, I want to ask about -- I mean, we know that there's a need for more biological diversity at tech companies in the U.S., it's something, you know, Bloomberg is a company who feels very strongly about, and we've been reporting on it for -- for years now. What about ideological diversity? Is it possible to have a difference of opinion in these companies, or are they really, just -- have they really just turned into an echo chamber? Because most recently, you know, one employee was fired for voicing a different opinion, and now, (inaudible) he wants to find a safe space for people to have free speech.</p><p>DAVID: Look, obviously, I don't have the detail and I can't comment on an individual company situation, but clearly, you know, tech thrives on innovation, it thrives on -- on -- on diversity, and that's diversity of opinion and diversity of -- of people in the market. But it must be said, we all understand there is a problem around the participation of -- of female workforce in tech. It's only about 17 percent. You know, you -- you can't carry on with that in the face of what is a continuing skill shortage, plus, at the end of the day, tech has a bigger roles (inaudible) a supplier, it's also part of society, so women are contributing (inaudible) that's not going to be good.</p><p>JOHNSON: We're going to carry on that conversation on Bloomberg Radio. Surveillance is next. Matt and I are going to Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Good morning.  Which is the bigger factor for the  market today, inflation number coming out a little bit later on or what's  happening on the geopolitical front?</p><p>SHEETS:  I think geopolitics have really taken -- taken the lead here.   I think if you would ask investors on Monday, it was absolutely around CPI,  it would be absolutely around, you know, the timing of -- of a Fed action  and what we might see, but I think the moves -- the rhetoric that we've  seen out of Washington and North Korea, that has I think, been the  predominant factor now dominating markets.</p><p>JOHNSON: Just to kind of take a step back, nobody's here, these are  thinned markets.  The president's, theoretically, on holiday, is it just  the fact that -- that we are in holiday liquidity sort of environments in - - in various asset classes that is -- that is driving this kind of pickup  in volatility?</p><p>SHEETS:  Well, look, I mean, I think that's -- that's actually a  really important point, right?  As -- as silly as it might sound that kind  of where people currently are, are a bigger factor than some of these  macroeconomic events.  The fact that August is a time when a lot of people  are out that we are seeing the -- the president and his staff are not in  the White House, that investors often have to deal with markets with  thinner liquidity and thinner markets in August, has a tendency to  exacerbate moves.  And I think that's maybe one reason why historically,  you tend to see somewhat weaker market performance in August relative to  other months.</p><p>MILLER:  So you think we're going to see a pickup then in volatility?   Are we going to -- I mean, the other day, we were making a massive deal  about the S&amp;P 500 being down 0.24 percent, are we going to start seeing 1  percent moves again, real -- real range?</p><p>SHEETS:  So I would actually be a little bit skeptical about that.  So  look, you -- you obviously have had a big shock to a market that was  incredibly calm.  So right, as of Monday, the 10-year -- the 10-day  realized volatility for the S&amp;P 500 was just 2 or 3 percent, it was the  lowest in 50 years.  So it's definitely a shock for the market to go from  that level of calm to what we have currently, but if I think about the  factors that are still in place, I think you still are dealing with  relatively solid global growth, you're s till dealing with very dovish  policy.  Most of the positioning metrics that we track don't suggest  investors are unusually long.  I think all of those things argue against a  really large regime shift into kind of daily 1, 1.5 percent moves.</p><p>MILLER:  One of the things -- one of the factoids I saw recently in a  story about how quant hedge fund strategies are failing because there's not  enough dumb money out there is that, retail investors' cash levels are at  the lowest they've been in a decade.  If they've -- if they've already --  if they're already so invested or it doesn't matter I guess, where they're  invested, do you expect them to maybe be pulling money out then?   Especially as we see highs like this?</p><p>SHEETS:  Well, look, I mean, I think this is a debate where you can  find data on -- on either side, so I guess what -- what I find a little bit  more encouraging is that if we look at flows into the equity market,  especially the U.S. equity market, those flows have still been incredibly  modest, not just over the last year, but really over the last eight years.   So I don't yet see evidence, and I think, you know, our -- our U.S. equity  strategist very much agree with this.  We don't see evidence that retail  has rushed a lot of money into the market recently that it would then need  to pull out.  So -- so look, there's always -- you know, I certainly  wouldn't say that investors were negative, you know, in the last several  months, but we don't see that sign of excessive stock buying that would  lead we think, to excessive retail selling.</p><p>JOHNSON:  This is definitely the wrong chart, what I'm about to show  here.  Let's talk about -- a little bit about the skew and what's going on.   The market is -- is positioning itself to buy kind of downside protection  at the moment.  The -- the -- the line goes up, as it goes up, basically,  that's signaling that the market is trying to buy downside protection.  Is  that an opportunity do you think at this point when you're looking at what  is happening with the SPX?  Would you be going the other way?</p><p>SHEETS:  Yes.  Well, look, I think that's -- that's a really important  part, right?  So as much as, you know, the -- the focus has been on the  rhetoric in Korea or the -- the daily moves in the S&amp;P that the much bigger  moves we've had over the last 48 hours have really been in the VIX, and  volatility on the VIX, right, which have moved significantly more than you  would usually expect.  And you know, that suggest that that's maybe where  the real market pressure is, where some of the real market inefficiency  might be, and it's not just mood volatility significantly, but as you  mentioned it's moved skew significantly, right?  So you've seen the  volatility on puts rise to relatively unusually high levels versus calls.   So you know, in our view, probably, the best way to lean against that would  be, that that makes calls relatively cheap, because that's the volatility  that's lowest relative to everything else.</p><p>MILLER:  All right, Andrew, you're going to stick with us here.   Andrew Sheets is chief -- chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley.   There's a lot to talk about on a day like today when we see actual movement  in equity index.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MILLER:  Joining us here to talk about that in Berlin is our  government editor, Alan Crawford.  Andrew Sheets is with us as well, chief  cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley.  Alan, let's talk -- touch on the  first point.  And I think a lot of Germans find it hard to sort of discern  now between the policies of the two parties.  What would change say, if the  SPD won and Martin Schultz came in Angela Merkel's place, policy-wise?</p><p>CRAWFORD:  Well, at the moment, that looks like a big if, but it would  also depend very much on what kind of coalition he could form.  At the  moment, that latest poll suggests it would have to be something like a  four-way coalition, so it's extremely hard to see.  Nevertheless, what we  could see is that Martin Schulz as a former president of the European  Parliament, he's somewhat more open to certainly common European policies,  so perhaps more in terms of defense sharing and crucially perhaps, more in  terms of integrating the Eurozone.  Merkel has also made some comments  about that, that she's open to some of these moves by the -- the French  president, but the --  the assumption is that Schultz would probably be  somewhat more open.  Whether that extends to debt sharing is a different  issue, but yes, more open.</p><p>JOHNSON:  So it's hers to lose at this point in time, now that I think  it's clear judging by the polling, Alan, so what risks is she running, kind  of -- and -- and how does that relate to the strategy that we're seeing?</p><p>CRAWFORD:  Well, as we just mentioned, we're talking about party  certainly, party officials are somewhat concerned about any -- any hint of  complacency.  Not so much on Merkel's behalf but more like on behalf of the  party and the party apparatus.  Remember of course, when Merkel first ran  for Chancellor in 2005, she was running Gerhard Schroder who was the  incumbent -- he was the chancellor, and she managed to -- to squander a  lead of more than 20 percentage points.  He of course, was an extremely  adept campaigner, and it was -- and in the end, she one by one point.   Nevertheless, she is embarking on 50-stop campaign tour, so I think it's  hard to accuse her of complacency at this point.</p><p>MILLER:  You're welcome to refresh or memories.  I mean, not all of us  wrote a book on Angela Merkel.  I should point out that Alan wrote a book  on Merkel, so he knows this subject better than anyone.  Andrew, let me ask  you from an investor's perspective, is this an important election for you  to pay close attention to?  I mean, do you have to be as concerned about  this as you did the French elections or the Dutch elections, or can you  pretty much consider this a confirmation of Angela Merkel's fourth term and  that kind consistency is good for you as an investor?</p><p>SHEETS:  Well, look, so I -- I think about it as -- as follows.  I  think in terms of the actual outcome, I think markets are probably going to  focus on it somewhat less because of what we've already seen in the  Netherlands and France, and because I think there's a broad majority within  Germany that -- that is pro-Europe, pro the E.U., and is pushing towards  more integrations, that whole argument that there might be some faction  pushing for something different now, seems significantly less likely.  But  I think what markets will focus on is this idea that at the core of Europe  in -- between France and Germany, this idea of really working for a  stronger European union, are pushed towards reform that we might not have  seen in a way that we have in a number of years.  I think that's  structurally bullish for the euro, that's been one of the key calls of our  FX strategy team, and the euro remains very undervalued on a long-term  basis, and so this is a multi-year call in our view, for a stronger euro.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Alan, where does the risk lie to Europe in this election?   There does seem to be this sense that coming out of this, we're going to  see a new impetus towards a closer integration.  Now, that's started by Mr.  Macron, but the German election's a pivotal piece in all of this.  Does the  coalition formation have a bearing on that?  I.e., if she's in -- in -- in  coalition with the -- with the FDP for instance, would that dilute that  drive?</p><p>CRAWFORD:  This is exactly the point that we will be focusing on  during our coverage.  The -- the latest poll for example, showed that  Merkel has various coalition options which could in turn strengthen her  hand in negotiations which remember, tend to last several weeks, if not  months in Germany, after the election.  Yes, the free democrats with whom  had her second term coalition, they are -- they're more skeptical in terms  of euro are bailouts, in terms of -- in terms of more integration in the  Eurozone, that could put a break on some of her plans.  Equally, the Greens  are also in play.  They are somewhat more enthusiastic about Eurozone  integration and essentially, helping others.  There could be a three-way  coalition which is untested at the Federal level, or it could be an  underground coalition.</p><p>MILLER:  I remember when Joschka Fischer who was -- who's arguably,  one of the most famous Greens said, forget about it, we prefer to wear  dreadlocks, and they wouldn't be able to deal with that.  Something like  that, I'm paraphrasing.  But it is a possible coalition.  What's the --  what's the -- what are the dangers to Merkel here, and what could bring her  down in the next six weeks?  Is diesel a problem for her, is -- is the  refugee, I would say crisis, but it's no longer a crisis here in Germany,  is the influx that we saw a couple of years ago of refugees a problem for  her?  What could bring her down?</p><p>CRAWFORD:  That's definitely an Achilles heel.  If there were -- if  there were to be some massive influx to Germany such as we saw two years  ago when there was a genuine crisis and a buildup of people at Germany's  border, that -- at the moment, the focus is on Italy, so it looks somewhat  less likely, but nevertheless, if she was forced to make some kind of snap  decision about that, then that would be a problem for her.  Who that would  benefit, whether it would benefit her main rival is another issue.   Certainly, there's also, if there were any sort of repeat of the -- of the  sexual attacks in Cologne, that was a devastating issue related to the  crisis.  Of course, terrorism is always -- is always lurking.  Again, it's  hard to see how these issues could -- could boost support for her -- her --  her main rival.  The one thing I would say is, there is a potential that  support for the -- the far right, anti-immigration AfD Party, perhaps the  polls are underestimating that.  I'm not saying it could win, but there is  importantly the level, higher.</p><p>MILLER:  The polls here though, historically more accurate than they  are say, in Britain.  Alan Crawford, our European government editor here in  Berlin.  I should point out that he co-wrote the book, \"Angela Merkel: A  Chancellor Forged in Crisis\" with Tony Czuczka who also works with us here  in Berlin.  Andrew Sheets is the chief crosset (ph) asset -- cross asset  strategist at Morgan Stanley, he's going to stick with us, our guest host  for the hour.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON:  Let's turn our attention now to market risks and how  investors should be positioning themselves.  Alan Sheets chief cross asset  strategist at Morgan Stanley is still with us, and let's talk about some of  the calls that we should be making right now.  Andrew, the world is long  euro, is that the right call?</p><p>SHEETS:  Yes.  So we think from an equity perspective, not  necessarily.  Graham Secker, our European equity strategist has been  somewhat cautious over the last several months on concerns around what the  strong euro will mean for earnings.  Now, I think what's quite interesting  is just really, over the last day, some of the tactical indicators that his  team follows have finally dipped down into bi-territory, so that's  something we have to watch in terms of our relative preferences.   Currently, the U.S. and Japan are our top global equity markets, but Europe  has underperformed recently, and that's something we have to monitor.</p><p>MILLER:  Why are you long European value versus growth right now,  Andrew?</p><p>SHEETS:  Sure.  So look, I think the -- the argument for Europe is  that you have an improving economy and that valuations are attractive, that  I think is the dominant narrative that I hear for European equities.  I  think if we look deeper into the market, most of the value in Europe lies  within value, it lies within the financial sector, it lies within the  energy sector, it lies within some of the other parts that make up the  value index.  So in our view, that's the part of the market where the  majority of the cheapness of Europe is concentrated.  It's starting to get  some positive momentum on a long-term basis, it's underperformed really,  for a decade and we think that's starting to turn around in our long-term  view.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Why are you short U.K. inflation?  Why are you short the  U.K. 10-year breakeven?</p><p>SHEETS:  Sure.  So -- so we think Brexit remains a challenging  dynamic, right, and you're going to have U.K. politicians coming back from  their holidays, going into negotiations in September, and we expect  potentially more negative news flow.  I think breakevens are one of the  more optimistically priced assets related to the U.K. economy, right?   Expecting inflation to remain at levels, really similar levels predicted in  2007.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Matt?</p><p>MILLER:  All right.  That was a fun speed round, we should do that --  we should do that more often.  Andrew Sheets from Morgan Stanley is going  to stay with us.  We have a lot more questions for him.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MILLER:  Joining me now is Bloomberg Businessweek senior editor here  in Berlin, David Rocks.  Andrew Sheets, chief cross asset strategist at  Morgan Stanley is still with us in London as our guest host for the hour.   David, first off, tell -- tell me about the city series, what prompted  this, what's it about, what's the cities issue?</p><p>ROCKS:  Well, there's -- there's 32 cities in the world now with more  than 10 million people.  More and more people around the world are moving  to cities, and obviously, cities are a hugely important -- it's where  people live now, right?  More and more, especially in the developing world,  so we wanted to look some of the problems ...</p><p>MILLER:  Some (inaudible) rural and into the urban basically, yes.</p><p>ROCKS:  Yes.  We look at the kind of problems that these cities are  having and how they can keep themselves from being strangled by their  growth.</p><p>JOHNSON:  It's interesting that -- that Moscow has -- has sort of  changed so much and so quickly, David.  It's gone in 20 years from being  this incredibly sort of dower, difficult city to live in, to being this  kind of sort of, standout metropolis, and that journey has been quite an  incredible one.  Just in terms of the momentum that Moscow has right now,  how would you describe it?</p><p>ROCKS:  Well, I think that a couple things are at play here.  The --  the -- the numbers that we're about to see toady are probably going to show  that consumption remains the main driver of the Russian economy.  And  you're never going to -- you're going to see that mostly in Moscow, or more  -- more -- more clearly in Moscow.  It's a -- it's a pretty wealthy city,  and there are a lot of people there with a lot of money, and the city has a  -- brought a lot of tax revenue, so they're spending it on making the place  a nicer place to live.</p><p>MILLER:  What is -- what are some of the other cities that you focused  on?</p><p>ROCKS:  Well, we looked at -- we looked at bike-sharing in Beijing,  we've got somebody who went out and sort of tried that, and it's, you know,  Beijing used to be a city where there were tons and tons of bikes, and now  it's become -- for years, they sort of focused on cars, now they're kind of  looking at bikes again, so that's a nice -- that's a nice view.  We looked  at New York City, how cities have a difficult time knowing what's actually  underneath them.  In New York City, you know, obviously, everybody knows  where, you know, 57th and Park is, but do they actually know what's  underneath there?  And the answer is no.  Not just the subways, but all of  the conduits and things like that, and that's a huge problem for cities  around the world.  So there's a guy who's creating a -- like an underground  map of New York City that we profile nicely, so ...</p><p>JOHNSON:  That sounds amazing.  (inaudible) can't wait to see that.   Andrew, let's bring you into this conversation, Andrew Sheets.  GDP data  out of Russia a little bit later on.  Where does Russia stack up in the --  the -- in the options that you see in front of you?  It's long being  perceived as being a kind of oil trade, but -- but that -- that kind of  story has been diluted a little bit.  How do you -- how do you see Russia  stacking up?  It's isolated increasingly, it finds itself on the wrong side  of the political story increasingly.  Where do we go with it as an  investment, though?</p><p>SHEETS:  Well, look, I mean, obviously, this is a country, right,  where there's the political side of things, and then there's the economic  side of things, right?  Politically, it -- it is clearly going to be in the  head -- it is clearly in the headlines and will continue to be in the  headlines with some of the things coming out of the U.S. as well as the  continued volatility in oil prices.  But if we look at the macro economics,  those in the country have been improving.  Inflation has been moderating,  the budget balances have been getting better thanks to the weaker ruble,  and we think that credit profile of the country has actually been getting  somewhat stronger while the currency remains very inexpensive, and real  rates in Russia are some of the highest anywhere.  So it's -- it's been  very prudential, it's been very cautious since monetary policy, it's been  very conservative which we think is helpful, and that's one of the reasons  why generally speaking, we see the risk reward in Russian fixed income as  more favorable than many other countries in EM.</p><p>MILLER:  All right.  Very interesting call and very interesting  edition, can't wait to see it.  David Rocks our senior editor here in  Berlin, thanks so much for joining us.  Andrew Sheets, chief crosset (ph)  strategist at Morgan Stanley is our guest host for the hour, he's going to  stick with us as we tack tech.  Is tech disrupting the inflation theory?   We'll discuss how Amazon is factoring in today's consumer price reading and  decisions.  This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON:  Joining us now, Julian David, he's the CEO of techUK.   Andrew Sheets, chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley is still with  us.  Julian, first of all, I -- I -- we're going to spend a lot of the day  talking about inflation.  Tech we know, is a disinflationary factor.  It --  look at Moore's Law, look at all kinds of different factors, tech generally  has that -- has that impact, and it improves productivity and -- and -- and  therefore, filters back in that way as well.  When you look at the  incredibly low, sort of, inflationary environment that we have at the  moment, do you think tech is, and -- and companies like Amazon are  responsible partly for that?</p><p>DAVID:  Yes.  I think -- I mean, there's -- there's historical trend  on this.  I mean, technology has applied to all industries, has brought  prices down and changed the balance.  So if you just look at the move from  craft industries to manufactured goods, there's a huge reduction there.   You look at what happened in the emergence of China as a manufacturing  powerhouse driven by tech, the -- the use of robotics and so on.  What's  happening now of course, is that's also now being applied to services, and  it's the internet which is -- which is powering that.  So you're having the  ability first of all, to use assets much more productively, secondly, to  increase the pull of assets.  If you look at things like, you know, Airbnb  bringing trillions of dollars worth of flexible accommodation into the  market, that makes a big -- big -- big change.  So yes, tech is -- is a  major force behind better pricing, better offers, more flexible offers for  -- for consumers.</p><p>MILLER:  Julian, are we talking about two different things, though  that both are contributing to lower prices or a lack of price growth?  On  the one hand, you got the sharing economy, and basically, that's allowing  people to pay lower prices for services that the -- the providers used to  charge a premium for, now, for example, if you're a driver or offering a  room for rent, you just don't make that much money on it -- on that  service.  On the other hand, you've got a company that is such a behemoth,  it's willing to not make a profit in order to eat up the market share that  everybody else used to enjoy.  Aren't those two different issues?</p><p>DAVID:  Well, there's a consistent thread which is, it's technology  that enables that kind of approach, so you know, if you -- if you just look  at conventional retailing, the technology around superstores, which --  which came into place, the ability to manage distribution using tech to do  logistics, you know, really gave you the opportunity to operate at a larger  scale with lower margins, better pricing for the consumer.  And the  internet allows you to do that on a bigger scale, so -- so I really think  technology is a driver of this, and you're going to see this across  services now.</p><p>MILLER:  Well, tech -- on the one hand is technology, on the other  hand, if you look at company like Amazon, if you look at a company like  Uber, it's the willingness not to make any money in order to knock the  other guy out of business and control the entire market, no?</p><p>DAVID:  Well, the -- the ability to take a long-term look at this, the  -- the willingness of investors to -- to go with and the ability to finance  this stuff is clearly, you know, a necessary part of it.  But at the end of  the day, you still got to back to the performance.  You know, if they're  able to get a better performance by using technology in a smarter way by,  you know, managing assets at -- at -- at lower returns, then that's going  to give them the opportunity to -- to grow, and that's going to drive  again, you know, investor interest.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Andrew, is the Phillips curve broken because of Amazon?</p><p>SHEETS:  Well, you know, I think it's interesting, right?  So our  interest rate strategists have looked at this and they find that the  Phillips curve is actually still in place and still working in -- in parts  of the economy, and just not working in others in part, due to technology  disruption and some of these other factors.  So I think it is still there,  and I think it's also important, I think as Julian alluded to, which is, we  need to differentiate between this low inflation and the function of a  negative demand shock which is very concerning for markets and a sign that  growth is weaker than expected, or a positive supply shock, i.e., more  technology coming online, more supply which is a positive.  So again, I  would say that our interpretation is more towards the latter, is more that  some of the inflation dynamics that we're seeing are more of a function of  a positive supply dynamic than a weak demand dynamic.  But again, I think  that is a real key debate for markets.</p><p>MILLER:  What about the -- I wonder how long investors are willing to  put money behind a company that doesn't make any money, as long as it grows  revenue and takes market share?  Is that -- I mean, is there really no set  time limit for that because Amazon's been doing it for 20 years?</p><p>DAVID:  Yes, I think -- I think, Matt, that's a very interesting  question, you know, it's one that has been asked ever since they got going.   You know, I used to work a lot with conventional retailers.  You know, the  conventional wisdom was, this can't last.  Conventional wisdom, Andrew,  sometimes doesn't work out, does it?  And it certainly didn't in this case.</p><p>MILLER:  Andrew, what do you think?</p><p>SHEETS:  Well -- well, look, I mean, again, I think that's -- that's  right.  So look, I -- I won't comment specifically on -- on the company  itself, but -- but this has been a trend that's been in place for -- for a  long period of time.  You know, I -- I also think that you have a market  where, you know, we just talked in a previous segment, I mean, people are  very willing to buy gold despite the fact that it has a negative income.   So -- so the site -- I mean, one of the -- the -- the fallouts of low  interest rates is that the opportunity cost of investing in a business or  investing in an asset does not necessarily earn any money right now, that  opportunity cost is a lot lower.  And so you know, there -- there are some  positive dynamics of that and there are potentially some negative dynamics  of that.</p><p>JOHNSON:  We'll leave it there.  Gentlemen, thank you very much  indeed.  Andrew, you're going to stick around, but we're going to give you  a 10-minute break.  You're going to join Matt and I on Bloomberg Radio very  shortly at the top of the hour.  Andrew Sheets joining us from Morgan  Stanley.  We're going to carry on the conversation with Julian David, he is  the CEO of techUK, we need to talk about what is happening with Brexit.   Brexit optimism, Theresa may sticking to her (inaudible) timetable despite  doubts within her cabinet.  We're going to discuss what that means to the  tech landscape.  We should probably also talk about gender within the tech  landscape as well.  This is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>MILLER:  I want to get back to the tech theme though that we've been  discussing.  Theresa May still aims to stick to her two-year Brexit deal  goal despite members of her own cabinet expressing doubts over the  timetable.  Last month, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox called  this optimistic, while chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond  envisions a three-year bridging period.</p><p>Julian David, CEO of techUK is still with us.  And Julian, we were  talking about -- we were talking about tech issues as far as market share  profitability and inflation in the U.S. is concerned, let's talk about tech  issues as far as employment, location, positioning, and Brexit is  concerned.  We had an interesting story earlier this week about how media  companies may need to look outside the U.K. because of licensing issues.   Do you see the same concern at tech company headquarters as we do with bank  headquarters in the U.K. post-Brexit?</p><p>DAVID:  Absolutely, Matt.  You know, the -- the U.K. tech industry was  very clear in the run up to the referendum that the best solution was  staying in the European Union, and since the referendum which of course,  the democratic process, we accept that, we've been very clear that we need  to be very close to the single market, we need to have access to this and  we need to concentrate on three areas which are really concerning to tech.   The first one is skills and talent.  We're already seeing it difficult to  get the sort of talent that we need to be the global leader in tech here in  the U.K., and secondly, is the -- the whole regulatory and customs, and  equivalents regime which some call a customs union, but it's a bit more  than that in tech because it also covers services and it covers other  things.</p><p>And -- and we need to have that as close to Europe as possible, and  the last one is data.  You know, if we don't have a data adequacy agreement  with the European Union, then it will be impossible for tech companies to  operate with European citizens' data.  So that's a big deal, that's a cliff  edge.  That's a -- that's a , you know, fall-off-the-clip thing.</p><p>JOHNSON:  The -- the data is here, it was massive.  Google's just won  approval to -- to build its new London headquarters next to the -- to the  old one up in King's Cross.  Aren't you surprised that they're building  that?</p><p>DAVID:  No, because U.K. is a big tech opportunity, big tech market,  big tech center.  You know, we are globally up there speaking of data.   Well, if you think about it, you know, these kind of things are set against  an industry that's growing, so making that kind of investment in a big  economy like the U.K probably still makes sense.  But also of course, they  don't know exactly how this is going to turn out, so we're trying and  hoping the government's going to -- going to get this right, you know.  Our  (inaudible) hash tag say get it right, because if we don't ...</p><p>JOHNSON:  That sounds nice.</p><p>DAVID:  Yes.  If we don't -- you know, so it's encouraging to hear the  kind of stuff that's being talked about -- about our transition.  We're  saying we need a long runway to make, you know, to land this Brexit claim.   It's not going to be done in what is left, a year?  And I know it's two  years in theory, but really, you -- you need to get these things done,  otherwise, people will have to make decisions and they'll have to move  stuff.  So what we need is that -- that transition period, and we need a  data adequacy position without a doubt.  Not just us, but all the  industries is (inaudible) on data.</p><p>MILLER:  Julian, I want to ask about -- I mean, we know that there's a  need for more biological diversity at tech companies in the U.S., it's  something, you know, Bloomberg is a company who feels very strongly about,  and we've been reporting on it for -- for years now.  What about  ideological diversity?  Is it possible to have a difference of opinion in  these companies, or are they really, just -- have they really just turned  into an echo chamber?  Because most recently, you know, one employee was  fired for voicing a different opinion, and now, (inaudible) he wants to  find a safe space for people to have free speech.</p><p>DAVID:  Look, obviously, I don't have the detail and I can't comment  on an individual company situation, but clearly, you know, tech thrives on  innovation, it thrives on -- on -- on diversity, and that's diversity of  opinion and diversity of -- of people in the market.  But it must be said,  we all understand there is a problem around the participation of -- of  female workforce in tech.  It's only about 17 percent.  You know, you --  you can't carry on with that in the face of what is a continuing skill  shortage, plus, at the end of the day, tech has a bigger roles (inaudible)  a supplier, it's also part of society, so women are contributing  (inaudible) that's not going to be good.</p><p>JOHNSON:  We're going to carry on that conversation on Bloomberg  Radio.  Surveillance is next.  Matt and I are going to Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Good morning.  Which is the bigger factor for the market today, inflation number coming out a little bit later on or what's happening on the geopolitical front?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHEETS</emphasis>:  I think geopolitics have really taken -- taken the lead here.  I think if you would ask investors on Monday, it was absolutely around CPI, it would be absolutely around, you know, the timing of -- of a Fed action and what we might see, but I think the moves -- the rhetoric that we've seen out of Washington and North Korea, that has I think, been the predominant factor now dominating markets.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Just to kind of take a step back, nobody's here, these are thinned markets.  The president's, theoretically, on holiday, is it just the fact that -- that we are in holiday liquidity sort of environments in -- in various asset classes that is -- that is driving this kind of pickup in volatility?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHEETS</emphasis>:  Well, look, I mean, I think that's -- that's actually a really important point, right?  As -- as silly as it might sound that kind of where people currently are, are a bigger factor than some of these macroeconomic events.  The fact that August is a time when a lot of people are out that we are seeing the -- the president and his staff are not in the White House, that investors often have to deal with markets with thinner liquidity and thinner markets in August, has a tendency to exacerbate moves.  And I think that's maybe one reason why historically, you tend to see somewhat weaker market performance in August relative to other months.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  So you think we're going to see a pickup then in volatility?  Are we going to -- I mean, the other day, we were making a massive deal about the S&amp;P 500 being down 0.24 percent, are we going to start seeing 1 percent moves again, real -- real range?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHEETS</emphasis>:  So I would actually be a little bit skeptical about that.  So look, you -- you obviously have had a big shock to a market that was incredibly calm.  So right, as of Monday, the 10-year -- the 10-day realized volatility for the S&amp;P 500 was just 2 or 3 percent, it was the lowest in 50 years.  So it's definitely a shock for the market to go from that level of calm to what we have currently, but if I think about the factors that are still in place, I think you still are dealing with relatively solid global growth, you're s till dealing with very dovish policy.  Most of the positioning metrics that we track don't suggest investors are unusually long.  I think all of those things argue against a really large regime shift into kind of daily 1, 1.5 percent moves.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  One of the things -- one of the factoids I saw recently in a story about how quant hedge fund strategies are failing because there's not enough dumb money out there is that, retail investors' cash levels are at the lowest they've been in a decade.  If they've -- if they've already -- if they're already so invested or it doesn't matter I guess, where they're invested, do you expect them to maybe be pulling money out then?  Especially as we see highs like this?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHEETS</emphasis>:  Well, look, I mean, I think this is a debate where you can find data on -- on either side, so I guess what -- what I find a little bit more encouraging is that if we look at flows into the equity market, especially the U.S. equity market, those flows have still been incredibly modest, not just over the last year, but really over the last eight years.  So I don't yet see evidence, and I think, you know, our -- our U.S. equity strategist very much agree with this. We don't see evidence that retail has rushed a lot of money into the market recently that it would then need to pull out.  So -- so look, there's always -- you know, I certainly wouldn't say that investors were negative, you know, in the last several months, but we don't see that sign of excessive stock buying that would lead we think, to excessive retail selling.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  This is definitely the wrong chart, what I'm about to show here.  Let's talk about -- a little bit about the skew and what's going on.  The market is -- is positioning itself to buy kind of downside protection at the moment.  The -- the -- the line goes up, as it goes up, basically, that's signaling that the market is trying to buy downside protection.  Is that an opportunity do you think at this point when you're looking at what is happening with the SPX?  Would you be going the other way?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHEETS</emphasis>:  Yes.  Well, look, I think that's -- that's a really important part, right?  So as much as, you know, the -- the focus has been on the rhetoric in Korea or the -- the daily moves in the S&amp;P that the much bigger moves we've had over the last 48 hours have really been in the VIX, and volatility on the VIX, right, which have moved significantly more than you would usually expect.  And you know, that suggest that that's maybe where the real market pressure is, where some of the real market inefficiency might be, and it's not just mood volatility significantly, but as you mentioned it's moved skew significantly, right?  So you've seen the volatility on puts rise to relatively unusually high levels versus calls.  So you know, in our view, probably, the best way to lean against that would be, that that makes calls relatively cheap, because that's the volatility that's lowest relative to everything else.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  All right, Andrew, you're going to stick with us here. Andrew Sheets is chief -- chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley.  There's a lot to talk about on a day like today when we see actual movement in equity index.    </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Joining us here to talk about that in Berlin is our government editor, Alan Crawford.  Andrew Sheets is with us as well, chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley.  Alan, let's talk -- touch on the first point.  And I think a lot of Germans find it hard to sort of discern now between the policies of the two parties.  What would change say, if the SPD won and Martin Schultz came in Angela Merkel's place, policy-wise?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAWFORD</emphasis>:  Well, at the moment, that looks like a big if, but it would also depend very much on what kind of coalition he could form. At the moment, that latest poll suggests it would have to be something like a four-way coalition, so it's extremely hard to see. Nevertheless, what we could see is that Martin Schulz as a former president of the European Parliament, he's somewhat more open to certainly common European policies, so perhaps more in terms of defense sharing and crucially perhaps, more in terms of integrating the Eurozone.  Merkel has also made some comments about that, that she's open to some of these moves by the -- the French president, but the --  the assumption is that Schultz would probably be somewhat more open.  Whether that extends to debt sharing is a different issue, but yes, more open.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  So it's hers to lose at this point in time, now that I think it's clear judging by the polling, Alan, so what risks is she running, kind of -- and -- and how does that relate to the strategy that we're seeing?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAWFORD</emphasis>:  Well, as we just mentioned, we're talking about party certainly, party officials are somewhat concerned about any -- any hint of complacency.  Not so much on Merkel's behalf but more like on behalf of the party and the party apparatus.  Remember of course, when Merkel first ran for Chancellor in 2005, she was running Gerhard Schroder who was the incumbent -- he was the chancellor, and she managed to -- to squander a lead of more than 20 percentage points. He of course, was an extremely adept campaigner, and it was -- and in the end, she one by one point.  Nevertheless, she is embarking on 50- stop campaign tour, so I think it's hard to accuse her of complacency at this point.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  You're welcome to refresh or memories.  I mean, not all of us wrote a book on Angela Merkel.  I should point out that Alan wrote a book on Merkel, so he knows this subject better than anyone. Andrew, let me ask you from an investor's perspective, is this an important election for you to pay close attention to?  I mean, do you have to be as concerned about this as you did the French elections or the Dutch elections, or can you pretty much consider this a confirmation of Angela Merkel's fourth term and that kind consistency is good for you as an investor?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHEETS</emphasis>:  Well, look, so I -- I think about it as -- as follows. I think in terms of the actual outcome, I think markets are probably going to focus on it somewhat less because of what we've already seen in the Netherlands and France, and because I think there's a broad majority within Germany that -- that is pro-Europe, pro the E.U., and is pushing towards more integrations, that whole argument that there might be some faction pushing for something different now, seems significantly less likely.  But I think what markets will focus on is this idea that at the core of Europe in -- between France and Germany, this idea of really working for a stronger European union, are pushed towards reform that we might not have seen in a way that we have in a number of years.  I think that's structurally bullish for the euro, that's been one of the key calls of our FX strategy team, and the euro remains very undervalued on a long-term basis, and so this is a multi- year call in our view, for a stronger euro.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Alan, where does the risk lie to Europe in this election?  There does seem to be this sense that coming out of this, we're going to see a new impetus towards a closer integration.  Now, that's started by Mr. Macron, but the German election's a pivotal piece in all of this.  Does the coalition formation have a bearing on that?  I.e., if she's in -- in -- in coalition with the -- with the FDP for instance, would that dilute that drive?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAWFORD</emphasis>:  This is exactly the point that we will be focusing on during our coverage.  The -- the latest poll for example, showed that Merkel has various coalition options which could in turn strengthen her hand in negotiations which remember, tend to last several weeks, if not months in Germany, after the election.  Yes, the free democrats with whom had her second term coalition, they are -- they're more skeptical in terms of euro are bailouts, in terms of -- in terms of more integration in the Eurozone, that could put a break on some of her plans.  Equally, the Greens are also in play.  They are somewhat more enthusiastic about Eurozone integration and essentially, helping others.  There could be a three-way coalition which is untested at the Federal level, or it could be an underground coalition.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  I remember when Joschka Fischer who was -- who's arguably, one of the most famous Greens said, forget about it, we prefer to wear dreadlocks, and they wouldn't be able to deal with that.  Something like that, I'm paraphrasing.  But it is a possible coalition.  What's the -- what's the -- what are the dangers to Merkel here, and what could bring her down in the next six weeks?  Is diesel a problem for her, is -- is the refugee, I would say crisis, but it's no longer a crisis here in Germany, is the influx that we saw a couple of years ago of refugees a problem for her?  What could bring her down?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRAWFORD</emphasis>:  That's definitely an Achilles heel.  If there were -- if there were to be some massive influx to Germany such as we saw two years ago when there was a genuine crisis and a buildup of people at Germany's border, that -- at the moment, the focus is on Italy, so it looks somewhat less likely, but nevertheless, if she was forced to make some kind of snap decision about that, then that would be a problem for her.  Who that would benefit, whether it would benefit her main rival is another issue.  Certainly, there's also, if there were any sort of repeat of the -- of the sexual attacks in Cologne, that was a devastating issue related to the crisis.  Of course, terrorism is always -- is always lurking.  Again, it's hard to see how these issues could -- could boost support for her -- her -- her main rival. The one thing I would say is, there is a potential that support for the -- the far right, anti-immigration AfD Party, perhaps the polls are underestimating that.  I'm not saying it could win, but there is importantly the level, higher.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  The polls here though, historically more accurate than they are say, in Britain.  Alan Crawford, our European government editor here in Berlin.  I should point out that he co-wrote the book, \"Angela Merkel: A Chancellor Forged in Crisis\" with Tony Czuczka who also works with us here in Berlin.  Andrew Sheets is the chief crosset (ph) asset -- cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley, he's going to stick with us, our guest host for the hour.    </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Let's turn our attention now to market risks and how investors should be positioning themselves.  Alan Sheets chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley is still with us, and let's talk about some of the calls that we should be making right now.  Andrew, the world is long euro, is that the right call?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHEETS</emphasis>:  Yes.  So we think from an equity perspective, not necessarily.  Graham Secker, our European equity strategist has been somewhat cautious over the last several months on concerns around what the strong euro will mean for earnings.  Now, I think what's quite interesting is just really, over the last day, some of the tactical indicators that his team follows have finally dipped down into bi- territory, so that's something we have to watch in terms of our relative preferences.  Currently, the U.S. and Japan are our top global equity markets, but Europe has underperformed recently, and that's something we have to monitor.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Why are you long European value versus growth right now, Andrew?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHEETS</emphasis>:  Sure.  So look, I think the -- the argument for Europe is that you have an improving economy and that valuations are attractive, that I think is the dominant narrative that I hear for European equities.  I think if we look deeper into the market, most of the value in Europe lies within value, it lies within the financial sector, it lies within the energy sector, it lies within some of the other parts that make up the value index.  So in our view, that's the part of the market where the majority of the cheapness of Europe is concentrated.  It's starting to get some positive momentum on a long- term basis, it's underperformed really, for a decade and we think that's starting to turn around in our long-term view.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Why are you short U.K. inflation?  Why are you short the U.K. 10-year breakeven?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHEETS</emphasis>:  Sure.  So -- so we think Brexit remains a challenging dynamic, right, and you're going to have U.K. politicians coming back from their holidays, going into negotiations in September, and we expect potentially more negative news flow.  I think breakevens are one of the more optimistically priced assets related to the U.K. economy, right?  Expecting inflation to remain at levels, really similar levels predicted in 2007.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Matt?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  All right.  That was a fun speed round, we should do that -- we should do that more often.  Andrew Sheets from Morgan Stanley is going to stay with us.  We have a lot more questions for him.    </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Joining me now is Bloomberg Businessweek senior editor here in Berlin, David Rocks.  Andrew Sheets, chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley is still with us in London as our guest host for the hour.  David, first off, tell -- tell me about the city series, what prompted this, what's it about, what's the cities issue?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROCKS</emphasis>:  Well, there's -- there's 32 cities in the world now with more than 10 million people.  More and more people around the world are moving to cities, and obviously, cities are a hugely important -- it's where people live now, right?  More and more, especially in the developing world, so we wanted to look some of the problems ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Some (inaudible) rural and into the urban basically, yes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROCKS</emphasis>:  Yes.  We look at the kind of problems that these cities are having and how they can keep themselves from being strangled by their growth.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  It's interesting that -- that Moscow has -- has sort of changed so much and so quickly, David.  It's gone in 20 years from being this incredibly sort of dower, difficult city to live in, to being this kind of sort of, standout metropolis, and that journey has been quite an incredible one.  Just in terms of the momentum that Moscow has right now, how would you describe it?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROCKS</emphasis>:  Well, I think that a couple things are at play here.  The -- the -- the numbers that we're about to see toady are probably going to show that consumption remains the main driver of the Russian economy.  And you're never going to -- you're going to see that mostly in Moscow, or more -- more -- more clearly in Moscow.  It's a -- it's a pretty wealthy city, and there are a lot of people there with a lot of money, and the city has a -- brought a lot of tax revenue, so they're spending it on making the place a nicer place to live.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  What is -- what are some of the other cities that you focused on?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROCKS</emphasis>:  Well, we looked at -- we looked at bike-sharing in Beijing, we've got somebody who went out and sort of tried that, and it's, you know, Beijing used to be a city where there were tons and tons of bikes, and now it's become -- for years, they sort of focused on cars, now they're kind of looking at bikes again, so that's a nice -- that's a nice view.  We looked at New York City, how cities have a difficult time knowing what's actually underneath them.  In New York City, you know, obviously, everybody knows where, you know, 57th and Park is, but do they actually know what's underneath there?  And the answer is no.  Not just the subways, but all of the conduits and things like that, and that's a huge problem for cities around the world.  So there's a guy who's creating a -- like an underground map of New York City that we profile nicely, so ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  That sounds amazing.  (inaudible) can't wait to see that.  Andrew, let's bring you into this conversation, Andrew Sheets. GDP data out of Russia a little bit later on.  Where does Russia stack up in the -- the -- in the options that you see in front of you?  It's long being perceived as being a kind of oil trade, but -- but that -- that kind of story has been diluted a little bit.  How do you -- how do you see Russia stacking up?  It's isolated increasingly, it finds itself on the wrong side of the political story increasingly.  Where do we go with it as an investment, though?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHEETS</emphasis>:  Well, look, I mean, obviously, this is a country, right, where there's the political side of things, and then there's the economic side of things, right?  Politically, it -- it is clearly going to be in the head -- it is clearly in the headlines and will continue to be in the headlines with some of the things coming out of the U.S. as well as the continued volatility in oil prices.  But if we look at the macro economics, those in the country have been improving. Inflation has been moderating, the budget balances have been getting better thanks to the weaker ruble, and we think that credit profile of the country has actually been getting somewhat stronger while the currency remains very inexpensive, and real rates in Russia are some of the highest anywhere.  So it's -- it's been very prudential, it's been very cautious since monetary policy, it's been very conservative which we think is helpful, and that's one of the reasons why generally speaking, we see the risk reward in Russian fixed income as more favorable than many other countries in EM.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  All right.  Very interesting call and very interesting edition, can't wait to see it.  David Rocks our senior editor here in Berlin, thanks so much for joining us.  Andrew Sheets, chief crosset (ph) strategist at Morgan Stanley is our guest host for the hour, he's going to stick with us as we tack tech.  Is tech disrupting the inflation theory?  We'll discuss how Amazon is factoring in today's consumer price reading and decisions.  This is Bloomberg.    </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Joining us now, Julian David, he's the CEO of techUK. Andrew Sheets, chief cross asset strategist at Morgan Stanley is still with us.  Julian, first of all, I -- I -- we're going to spend a lot of the day talking about inflation.  Tech we know, is a disinflationary factor.  It -- look at Moore's Law, look at all kinds of different factors, tech generally has that -- has that impact, and it improves productivity and -- and -- and therefore, filters back in that way as well.  When you look at the incredibly low, sort of, inflationary environment that we have at the moment, do you think tech is, and -- and companies like Amazon are responsible partly for that?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DAVID</emphasis>:  Yes.  I think -- I mean, there's -- there's historical trend on this.  I mean, technology has applied to all industries, has brought prices down and changed the balance.  So if you just look at the move from craft industries to manufactured goods, there's a huge reduction there.  You look at what happened in the emergence of China as a manufacturing powerhouse driven by tech, the -- the use of robotics and so on.  What's happening now of course, is that's also now being applied to services, and it's the internet which is -- which is powering that.  So you're having the ability first of all, to use assets much more productively, secondly, to increase the pull of assets.  If you look at things like, you know, Airbnb bringing trillions of dollars worth of flexible accommodation into the market, that makes a big -- big -- big change.  So yes, tech is -- is a major force behind better pricing, better offers, more flexible offers for -- for consumers.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Julian, are we talking about two different things, though that both are contributing to lower prices or a lack of price growth?  On the one hand, you got the sharing economy, and basically, that's allowing people to pay lower prices for services that the -- the providers used to charge a premium for, now, for example, if you're a driver or offering a room for rent, you just don't make that much money on it -- on that service.  On the other hand, you've got a company that is such a behemoth, it's willing to not make a profit in order to eat up the market share that everybody else used to enjoy. Aren't those two different issues?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DAVID</emphasis>:  Well, there's a consistent thread which is, it's technology that enables that kind of approach, so you know, if you -- if you just look at conventional retailing, the technology around superstores, which -- which came into place, the ability to manage distribution using tech to do logistics, you know, really gave you the opportunity to operate at a larger scale with lower margins, better pricing for the consumer.  And the internet allows you to do that on a bigger scale, so -- so I really think technology is a driver of this, and you're going to see this across services now.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Well, tech -- on the one hand is technology, on the other hand, if you look at company like Amazon, if you look at a company like Uber, it's the willingness not to make any money in order to knock the other guy out of business and control the entire market, no?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DAVID</emphasis>:  Well, the -- the ability to take a long-term look at this, the -- the willingness of investors to -- to go with and the ability to finance this stuff is clearly, you know, a necessary part of it.  But at the end of the day, you still got to back to the performance.  You know, if they're able to get a better performance by using technology in a smarter way by, you know, managing assets at -- at -- at lower returns, then that's going to give them the opportunity to -- to grow, and that's going to drive again, you know, investor interest.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Andrew, is the Phillips curve broken because of Amazon?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHEETS</emphasis>:  Well, you know, I think it's interesting, right?  So our interest rate strategists have looked at this and they find that the Phillips curve is actually still in place and still working in -- in parts of the economy, and just not working in others in part, due to technology disruption and some of these other factors.  So I think it is still there, and I think it's also important, I think as Julian alluded to, which is, we need to differentiate between this low inflation and the function of a negative demand shock which is very concerning for markets and a sign that growth is weaker than expected, or a positive supply shock, i.e., more technology coming online, more supply which is a positive.  So again, I would say that our interpretation is more towards the latter, is more that some of the inflation dynamics that we're seeing are more of a function of a positive supply dynamic than a weak demand dynamic.  But again, I think that is a real key debate for markets.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  What about the -- I wonder how long investors are willing to put money behind a company that doesn't make any money, as long as it grows revenue and takes market share?  Is that -- I mean, is there really no set time limit for that because Amazon's been doing it for 20 years?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DAVID</emphasis>:  Yes, I think -- I think, Matt, that's a very interesting question, you know, it's one that has been asked ever since they got going.  You know, I used to work a lot with conventional retailers. You know, the conventional wisdom was, this can't last.  Conventional wisdom, Andrew, sometimes doesn't work out, does it?  And it certainly didn't in this case.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Andrew, what do you think?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHEETS</emphasis>:  Well -- well, look, I mean, again, I think that's -- that's right.  So look, I -- I won't comment specifically on -- on the company itself, but -- but this has been a trend that's been in place for -- for a long period of time.  You know, I -- I also think that you have a market where, you know, we just talked in a previous segment, I mean, people are very willing to buy gold despite the fact that it has a negative income.  So -- so the site -- I mean, one of the -- the -- the fallouts of low interest rates is that the opportunity cost of investing in a business or investing in an asset does not necessarily earn any money right now, that opportunity cost is a lot lower.  And so you know, there -- there are some positive dynamics of that and there are potentially some negative dynamics of that.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  We'll leave it there.  Gentlemen, thank you very much indeed.  Andrew, you're going to stick around, but we're going to give you a 10-minute break.  You're going to join Matt and I on Bloomberg Radio very shortly at the top of the hour.  Andrew Sheets joining us from Morgan Stanley.  We're going to carry on the conversation with Julian David, he is the CEO of techUK, we need to talk about what is happening with Brexit.  Brexit optimism, Theresa may sticking to her (inaudible) timetable despite doubts within her cabinet.  We're going to discuss what that means to the tech landscape.  We should probably also talk about gender within the tech landscape as well.  This is Bloomberg.    </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  I want to get back to the tech theme though that we've been discussing.  Theresa May still aims to stick to her two-year Brexit deal goal despite members of her own cabinet expressing doubts over the timetable.  Last month, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox called this optimistic, while chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond envisions a three-year bridging period.    </p><p>      Julian David, CEO of techUK is still with us.  And Julian, we were talking about -- we were talking about tech issues as far as market share profitability and inflation in the U.S. is concerned, let's talk about tech issues as far as employment, location, positioning, and Brexit is concerned.  We had an interesting story earlier this week about how media companies may need to look outside the U.K. because of licensing issues.  Do you see the same concern at tech company headquarters as we do with bank headquarters in the U.K. post-Brexit?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DAVID</emphasis>:  Absolutely, Matt.  You know, the -- the U.K. tech industry was very clear in the run up to the referendum that the best solution was staying in the European Union, and since the referendum which of course, the democratic process, we accept that, we've been very clear that we need to be very close to the single market, we need to have access to this and we need to concentrate on three areas which are really concerning to tech.  The first one is skills and talent. We're already seeing it difficult to get the sort of talent that we need to be the global leader in tech here in the U.K., and secondly, is the -- the whole regulatory and customs, and equivalents regime which some call a customs union, but it's a bit more than that in tech because it also covers services and it covers other things.    </p><p>      And -- and we need to have that as close to Europe as possible, and the last one is data.  You know, if we don't have a data adequacy agreement with the European Union, then it will be impossible for tech companies to operate with European citizens' data.  So that's a big deal, that's a cliff edge.  That's a -- that's a , you know, fall-off- the-clip thing.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  The -- the data is here, it was massive.  Google's just won approval to -- to build its new London headquarters next to the -- to the old one up in King's Cross.  Aren't you surprised that they're building that?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DAVID</emphasis>:  No, because U.K. is a big tech opportunity, big tech market, big tech center.  You know, we are globally up there speaking of data.  Well, if you think about it, you know, these kind of things are set against an industry that's growing, so making that kind of investment in a big economy like the U.K probably still makes sense. But also of course, they don't know exactly how this is going to turn out, so we're trying and hoping the government's going to -- going to get this right, you know.  Our (inaudible) hash tag say get it right, because if we don't ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  That sounds nice.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DAVID</emphasis>:  Yes.  If we don't -- you know, so it's encouraging to hear the kind of stuff that's being talked about -- about our transition.  We're saying we need a long runway to make, you know, to land this Brexit claim.  It's not going to be done in what is left, a year?  And I know it's two years in theory, but really, you -- you need to get these things done, otherwise, people will have to make decisions and they'll have to move stuff.  So what we need is that -- that transition period, and we need a data adequacy position without a doubt.  Not just us, but all the industries is (inaudible) on data.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILLER</emphasis>:  Julian, I want to ask about -- I mean, we know that there's a need for more biological diversity at tech companies in the U.S., it's something, you know, Bloomberg is a company who feels very strongly about, and we've been reporting on it for -- for years now. What about ideological diversity?  Is it possible to have a difference of opinion in these companies, or are they really, just -- have they really just turned into an echo chamber?  Because most recently, you know, one employee was fired for voicing a different opinion, and now, (inaudible) he wants to find a safe space for people to have free speech.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DAVID</emphasis>:  Look, obviously, I don't have the detail and I can't comment on an individual company situation, but clearly, you know, tech thrives on innovation, it thrives on -- on -- on diversity, and that's diversity of opinion and diversity of -- of people in the market.  But it must be said, we all understand there is a problem around the participation of -- of female workforce in tech.  It's only about 17 percent.  You know, you -- you can't carry on with that in the face of what is a continuing skill shortage, plus, at the end of the day, tech has a bigger roles (inaudible) a supplier, it's also part of society, so women are contributing (inaudible) that's not going to be good.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  We're going to carry on that conversation on Bloomberg Radio.  Surveillance is next.  Matt and I are going to Bloomberg Radio.        </p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>       THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

out of some food staples for Christmas if onerous coronavirusfuelled restrictions on workplaces, warehouses and distribution centres are maintained.</p><p>KPMG's partner in charge of Asia-Pacific supply chain advisory, Peter Liddell, said COVID-19 had up-ended normal supply-and-demand modelling and greater visibility of \"choke points\" was needed to combat shortages of high-demand goods.</p><p/><p>Mr Liddell said the use of AI enabled a real-time analysis of myriad data points that human-based systems could not absorb, which helped clear bottlenecks in supply chains by enabling businesses to predict disruptions and changes in consumer behaviour.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating bushfires over summer had accelerated the use of such technology as supply chains came under unprecedented pressure from social distancing measures, product shortages and panic buying.</p><p>Mr Liddell said that underlined the importance of businesses being able to respond more quickly to potential disruptions, particularly in the lead-up to the busy Christmas period, which the nation's supermarkets were expecting to be their biggest ever, forecasting COVID-19 restrictions to lift turnover by 20-30 per cent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">READ THE FULL STORY</emphasis><url

on the hard line they have taken on border exemptions, calling it a \"very challenging situation\".</p><p>It comes just days after a grieving daughter was banned from attending her father's funeral.</p><p>\"It has clearly been challenging and deeply distressing for the families that have had to either not see loved ones or have to quarantine before seeing loved ones,\" Dr Coatsworth said.</p><p>\"These are the effects of having borders closed and we all have to consider the balance between those border closures and the effect that they are having to keep out COVID-19 from a state or territory and whether that balance is actually achieved - ultimately that's a decision for the chief health officer in Queensland.\"</p><p>Dr Coatsworth said there had been 46 new cases of the virus reported on Saturday - 37 in Victoria, six in NSW and three in Queensland.</p><p>\"It is clear that those numbers are continuing to improve nationally and, very pleasingly, the numbers in Victoria continue to improve,\" he said.</p><p/><p>He took a moment to acknowledge our nation's health workers - who have made up 15 per cent of the cases in Victoria's second wave - ahead of Nursing in the Community week.</p><p>\"More than 70 per cent of COVID-19 cases from healthcare workers infected in hospitals, have been nurses,\" Dr Coatsworth said.</p><p>\"In the second wave, in contrast to the first, the majority of these infections have related to workplace exposures. That is why we are working so hard with state and territory governments, and hospitals and health services, to support nurses and all healthcare workers so they can go about their work caring for Australians as safely as possible. We continue to support hospitals in their efforts to protect their workers from COVID-19 including the provision of personal protective equipment from the national stockpile.\"</p><p><emphasis

I'm Alexei Oreskovic, Business Insider's West Coast bureau chief and global tech editor. If you like this email, tell your friends and colleagues that they can sign up for the newsletter here.[1]This week: Andrew Yang and his loyal \"knights\" of the valleyWhile much of the US was tuned in to the public impeachment hearings on Capitol Hill this Wednesday, a few dozen techies in San Francisco convened at the home of tech entrepreneur Sam Altman to focus on another political story. Andrew Yang, the Democratic party presidential hopeful, was in town for a fundraiser. </p><p>BI's Melia Russell managed to get into the event[2] so that she could see firsthand why so many techies are head-over-heels for Yang.As she reports, Yang is someone who speaks the techie language. Sure, it might help that he doesn't want to break up Big Tech as some of the other candidates do. But Yang isn't promising a libertarian, laissez-faire society. During the event he talked up how he shares Elon Musk's belief that AI needs to be reined in. When it comes to artificial intelligence technology, he told Melia, \"going as fast as possible could have some real drawbacks or negative effects. And so, you need a different set of incentives than 'just go as fast as possible.'\" His newly-unveiled tech policy blueprint, including a tax on digital ads and the creation of a \"Deparment of the Attention Economy,\" would also put new burdens and constraints on tech companies. Yang is preaching a tech-savvy and industry-active brand of regulation \u2014 \"you can't take a sledgehammer to these problems,\" he says \u2014 that plays well with the Valley's we-know-best mentality. He even suggested \"knighting\" the techies at the event, so that they could make the government operate more efficiently. That's earned him trust, and money, from a lot of the tech industry elite. The problem is, the tech industry has lost everyone else's trust.Read the full story here: Andrew Yang wants to regulate big tech without breaking it up and says his fan Elon Musk is in full support[3]Werner in the cloud with diamondsAmazon insiders don't appear overly worried about the company getting split up by the government, in any case. In an interview with Julie Bort,[4] Werner Vogels, the head of Amazon's AWS cloud business, insists that the topic never comes up internally. \"We have no intention of doing anything like that,\" he says.Vogels defends the benefits of being a giant, multi-business corporation, telling Bort that \"the synergies are just too good\" to ever consider breaking up. Those \"synergies\" are exactly what critics like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders contend are giving Big Tech companies unfair advantages. To judge by Vogels' response, Amazon is either playing ignorant to these concerns, or simply choosing to defy them.

His first dispatch from the field reveals a trend that's spreading throughout Silicon Valley[6]: official company outreach \u2014 including memos, workplace training drills and other communiqus \u2014 in toilet stalls. Google was first to implement the idea years ago, but a growing list of tech companies, including Yelp and Walmart's Jet.com, are now adopting the practice. It's the latest, and perhaps most intrusive, example of Silicon Valley's never ending quest to maximize worker productivity. If this Silicon Valley innovation is as successful as smartphones and instant messaging, it may soon become standard throughout the country. But I can't help wondering why the world's most cutting edge companies are using old-fashioned paper, and not a digital format, to reach their toilet-bound toilers.Read the full story here: Efficiency-obsessed tech firms are sticking newsletters on toilet stall walls to keep employees productive while they poop[7]Other recent tech highlights:A big new deal with Salesforce shows Microsoft is 'on the offensive' in the cloud wars, even as it puts Amazon under pressure for trying to 'go it alone'[8] Early Google and Apple backer Sequoia Capital is actively hiring to boost its investments in European startups[9] IBM and Oracle are so far behind in the cloud, they might stop trying to compete with Amazon altogether and go a different route, analyst says[10] The CEO of Freshworks had an idea 10 years ago when his TV was damaged by movers. Now his startup is worth $3.5 billion and is threatening Salesforce.[11] 2 months after Israeli startup Stoke was founded, it raised $4.5 million. Here's the pitch deck it used.[12]And more from across the BI newsroom:SoftBank-backed startup Fair burned through nearly $400 million in 10 months. Insiders reveal how Softbank stepped in and cleaned house in the wake of WeWork.[13] 'We're going to have to have a severe recession if we're ever going to build a viable economy': Here's why one market expert says the US is doomed to default on its debt no matter what[14] Inside a restructuring of Walmart's legal department that's dragging on longer than execs promised. Some employees are exiting, and one used a meme of Al Pacino to say goodbye.[15] A futuristic farming startup raised $260 million from Jeff Bezos and SoftBank on the promise of upending agriculture. Insiders are raising questions.[16] That's it for this week. As always, I'm eager for your feedback, thoughts, and tips \u2014 you can email me at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:aoreskovic@businessinsider.com\">aoreskovic@businessinsider.com</email> And if you like this newsletter,please tell your friends and colleagues they can sign up here to receive it[17].; AlexeiNOW WATCH: People are still debating the pink or grey sneaker, 2 years after it went viral.

Some will argue Yang's campaign simply rose to prominence because of his support of a $1,000 universal basic income, but he outlasted and outperformed most of the field because he seems to understand the impact of automation on the economy as well as communities and the lives of individuals. He defined himself and his campaign by his stance on AI and related issues like the future of work and how to create economic opportunity, and how AI is now essential to national defense[2]. Using that message, he rose from a relatively unknown businessman to become one of the most popular candidates online and as high as sixth in a Real Clear Politics average of national polls[3]. Days before the Iowa caucus, for example, Yang called for an international ban on autonomous weapons[4]. His campaign slogan: Humanity first. His major policy initiative: Universal basic income, which the campaign managed to do for 13 people around the country as a proof of concept and promotional campaign. 'We stood on the debate stage and shifted our national conversation to include the fourth industrial revolution, a topic no one wanted to touch until we made it happen here with this campaign,' he said in a speech announcing his departure. </p><p>'We highlighted the real problems in our communities as our economy is being transformed before our eyes by technology and automation, and Americans know now that when you go to a factory in Michigan, you do not find wall-to-wall immigrants doing work. You find wall-to-wall robot arms and machines doing the work that people used to do.' Rather than use immigration as a lightning rod of division to stoke fear and xenophobia, he talked about how most Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants, about being the son of a peanut farmer born in Taiwan, and asserted that the U.S. should not lose its reputation as a 'magnet for human capital for generations.' 'If we lose that, we lose something integral to our continued success. And that is where I would lead as president,' he said in a debate last fall[5]. Yang also spoke out about how the U.S. government is decades behind in technology[6] government technology, and the importance of giving parents time with their kids for early childhood education. He seemed to understand the anxiety that comes with the spread of AI and automation and tapped into that. Yang made inroads across the country for his policy and by exhibiting the confidence and charisma voters expect from a presidential candidate, but also by being a candidate who chose to recognize and closely examine how AI and automation are changing the world. It's unclear whether universal basic income persists as an issue important to voters or if Yang will run again in 2024, but he's right that the issues his campaign addressed related to AI are the 'future of American politics and the Democratic Party.' Indeed, AI is playing a role in the future of business, health care, criminal justice, civil liberties, and national security. Consultants like McKinsey now talk about AI readiness and industry as playing a role in shaping nation's GDP growth[7]. China plans to be the world leader in AI by 2030, and portions of the U.S. government and Department of Defense today see AI supremacy as critical to U.S. power[8]. Last June in the first Democratic debate, a majority of Democratic presidential candidates called China the biggest external threat to the United States[9]; Yang then said his first call as president would be to China to work together on issues like AI. Meanwhile, AI startups saw record funding growth in 2019[10], but surveys of business executives find many organizations are struggling to implement the technology; a majority of executives fear that an inability to do so could bring about domination by more advanced businesses, forcing them to close their doors. AI also continues to pose challenges to civil liberties, civil rights, and privacy laws and norms, challenges that led to the proposal of a facial recognition moratorium bill in the U.S. Senate[11] Wednesday and Congress is considering facial recognition regulation[12]. The AI-first campaign for president is over. That's history, but the issues Yang ran on are growing in importance.

PowerPoint! PowerPoint!\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is a truly bizarre thing to hear on the campaign trail, but it might not actually be the weirdest thing about Andrew Yang. In recent months, the 44-year-old former tech entrepreneur and self-confessed \"math nerd\" has gained a loyal following in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-democrat-candidates-running-president/\">bewilderingly crowded Democratic primary</url>, bringing in enough donations to qualify for this summer's TV debates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, on the doorstep of Amazon and Microsoft, which are based in Seattle - and with many of their employees around him - he expounds his central message: that Big Tech is screwing up the nation, and that only he can stop it.</p><p>\"We know that AI is coming,\" Mr Yang tells The Daily Telegraph, resting in his campaign office before the rally. \"It's going to displace hundreds of thousands of jobs in the most common categories: call centres and retail and food service and driving ... in the first industrial revolution there were mass riots that killed hundreds of people and caused the equivalent of billions of dollars' worth of economic harm. Most experts predict that this industrial revolution will be two to three times faster and more disruptive.\"</p><p>In fact, Mr Yang believes this has already started. He has looked at the numbers and found a \"direct line\" between the past automation of manufacturing jobs and support for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-democrat-candidates-running-president/\">Donald Trump</url> . Almost half of those workers never worked again, unleashing a wave of suicides and drug overdoses that have driven the first declines in American life expectancy since 1993.</p><p>For eight years, as the chief executive of Venture for America, Mr Yang tried to solve this problem by investing in start-ups that created jobs in those areas. Finally, though, he concluded this was not enough, and that the only realistic option was to become president and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-democrat-candidates-running-president/\">give everyone $1,000 (\u00a3790) a month</url> .</p><p>                   'Let's go get that money!'                   </p><p>The Yang campaign contains a dizzying grab-bag of proposals, from the profound (free healthcare for all) to the wonkish (abolishing the one-cent coin) to the bafflingly specific (empowering mixed martial artists to form trade unions). But its clear centrepiece is Mr Yang's version of a universal basic income (UBI), which he calls the \"freedom dividend\" (\"because it tests better,\" he likes to say).</p><p>This no-strings cash dump, similar to the way Alaska has disbursed its oil money since 1976, would not only insulate humanity against the rise of the robots but boost consumer spending, liberate entrepreneurs, empower women and reorient the economy to value parents and caregivers. It is both an emergency measure and a permanent change which\u00a0he believes will be so \"wildly popular\" that no politician would dare to remove it.</p><p>In that, Mr Yang is the avatar for an emerging conviction in Silicon Valley that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-democrat-candidates-running-president/\">radical action</url> is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-democrat-candidates-running-president/\">required to protect society from its products</url> . As he points out, UBI is not new; Thomas Paine and Martin Luther King were both supporters. But as incomes stagnate and AI destroys livelihoods, some believe its time has come. Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Richard Branson have all expressed support, while Mr Yang himself has received donations from Twitter's Jack Dorsey.</p><p>All very well, but where will all this money come from? There are 327m people in the US, so paying them $12,000 a year each would cost $3.9  trillion (the entire US government spent $4.1 trillion last year). Mr Yang's answer is that the money already exists in the enormous profits of tech giants.</p><p>In fact, he argues, the dividend will only be for adult citizens, and some of them will decline it due to incapacity or ideology. That brings the initial cost down to $2 trillion a year. Then factor in an estimated $800bn in extra revenue from a new federal VAT; $500bn to $600bn in increased taxes from citizens having more spending money; $100bn to $200bn from reduced burden on hospitals and prisons, plus another $400bn from people swapping their existing benefits for UBI. That gets you within striking distance of Mr Yang's promise that the dividend will pay for itself. He has, after all, \"done the math\".</p><p>This is Mr Yang's catchphrase: whenever he shouts it at a rally, people cheer. He even sells baseball caps emblazoned with the word \"math\". Five separate supporters tell the Telegraph that his focus on \"facts\" is one of the reasons they love him. Nor is this just a gimmick, because although it takes you a while to realise exactly how, Mr Yang really does speak quite differently from most other candidates.</p><p>                   The number of the beast                   </p><p>Instead of giving airy principles or sweeping moral statements, he explains in detail what he thinks a given policy will do and why he thinks it is the best option - explanations always punctuated with his\u00a0infectious chuckle, which bursts out of him at the oddest of moments. Only Elizabeth Warren, the former law professor whose slogan has become\u00a0\"she has a plan for that\", speaks with similar detail.</p><p>\"Once you listen to Yang, everyone else just sounds like Charlie Brown's teacher,\" says Gael Zane, a 59-year-old fan. \"They're like, 'Wah wah wah wah wah.'\"</p><p>Take Mr Yang's claim that laid-off truck drivers could soon become a disruptive social force. What does he mean? \"Tens of thousands of truck drivers are ex-military; many own guns,\" he explains. The trucks are expensive, so drivers take out loans to buy them. Some take out multiple loans and buy multiple trucks, becoming fleet owners.</p><p>\"So then let's say, hypothetically, I was a military veteran and I really like hiring military vets ... [my] life savings are on the line, and their jobs are on the line too.\" There are 3.5m truck drivers in America, so if one tenth of 1pc of them get radicalised, 3,500 trucks could be mobilised in a protest, strategically blocking major roads. \"That's actually catastrophic,\" Mr Yang concludes.</p><p>Why can't we educate our way out of the problem? Why not universal retraining instead of universal income? \"Well, mainly because it doesn't work very well,\" Mr Yang says, laughing. \"It's very popular to think we can transform truck drivers into coders. But only 8pc of American jobs right now are in STEM fields and it's unrealistic to expect a 49-year-old former truck driver with a high school education to become an engineer...</p><p>\"I know this because the success rates for federal retraining of former factory workers was 0pc to 12pc... as someone who's spent time in truck stops in the Midwest, it's difficult to imagine. They didn't like school 30 years ago; there's no reason why they'll learn to love it now.\"</p><p>Underneath that detail is a tendency to think systemically, envisioning society as a flow of causes and effects. Mr Yang does not really talk about punishing public enemies but about\u00a0creating good carrots and sticks, whether for medical doctors or for big social networks.</p><p>\"If you go to a company like Facebook or Snapchat and say, 'Hey, studies have shown that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-democrat-candidates-running-president/\">teenage girls are getting depressed using your stuff</url>,' they literally cannot lighten up because it's going to decrease their quarterly earnings,\" he says. \"If they decide to prioritise teenage mental health over shareholder value, they'd probably lose their job.\"\u00a0He describes Mark Zuckerberg's recent call for stricter internet regulation as \"essentially a plea for help\". Don't blame the tech giants, he argues; blame the system that makes their current behaviour rational and worth the cost.</p><p>Similarly, one of his pledges is to increase the president's pay from $400,000 a year to $4m, which sounds venal until he clarifies that he would also ban the president from taking speaking fees and board positions after leaving office. He wants public service to attract the best people, and for that to be their only priority.</p><p>There is an irony here, in that Mr Yang is a data-driven candidate who wants to free Americans from the tyranny of numbers. One of his big three policies, alongside free medical care and UBI, is literally to change a number - specifically, GDP, which he attacks with great gusto as a false measure of national wellbeing which is blinding the country to its own problems and must immediately be replaced.</p><p>\"Right now we rely on the market to determine our own value, and the market is highly imperfect,\" he says. \"The thinking is that if you lose economic value then we must transform you into something that has economic value.\"</p><p>Instead he wants currently unpaid work - such as that of his wife, a former marketing executive who is currently at home in New York City looking after\u00a0 their two sons - to be more highly valued. He thinks UBI would help artists and carers as well as budding business owners.</p><p>                   Drones, cannabis and a bald eagle                   </p><p>In private, Mr Yang\u00a0is measured and a little detached. On the stump, however, he is exuberant and passionate. His speech in Seattle is a freewheeling mixture of jokes, profanity, digs at Jeff Bezos, audience call and response, detailed economic statistics and references to marijuana. He draws a raucous crowd of 2,500, bigger than Joe Biden's first rally.</p><p>\"Now I know some of you work for Amazon,\" he says.\u00a0\"How much did Amazon pay in federal taxes again last year?\" (\"Zero!\" the crowd shouts.)\u00a0\"That's right! And it's not even Amazon's vault that they're paying zero taxes, that's also their job!. But it's our fault if they're paying zero. Like, we must have messed up if we've designed a system where a trillion dollar tech company can pay less in federal taxes than everyone here in this park tonight.\"</p><p>He pauses. \" So the Amazon employees are like 'oh sh--, is Jeff watching\u00a0 me right now? Should I cheer for this? It's cool, it's cool! Jeff's looking at some rocket to Mars right now, he's not paying attention to this park. He'll pay attention to it later when I'm in the White House.\"</p><p>Drones, appropriately enough, hover overhead, joined at one point by a bald eagle which Mr Yang hails with the joyous cry: \"It's a sign! Oh, mighty eagle... come to my hand! Snatch this cap off my head!\"</p><p>Earlier, when the Telegraph\u00a0encounters him by chance on his way to the rally, he is interrupted in the street by a bystander who asks: \"Hey, are you Andrew Yang?\" This man is not aware of the rally, but recognises him anyway. Mr Yang shoots the breeze with him, then notices a poster with his face on it plastered to a nearby lamp post - apparently nothing to do\u00a0with his campaign or with the bystander.\u00a0</p><p>Even so, there are some things that Mr Yang is shy about. He talks about his \"friends in Silicon Valley\", but will only name those already listed as donors on his website. He gives a politician's answer to a question about his religion: \"I was brought up in a secular household, but I married a woman who is Christian and am now bringing up my boys in the church. So all I'd say is that, to the extent that I have a relationship with God, it's still developing.\"</p><p>His campaign has embraced conservative podcasts and Democrat-leaning hip hop radio shows, and he seems to speak both languages with equal comfort. So what are his instincts? Why is he in this race?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-democrat-candidates-running-president/\">Donald Trump's 2019 State of the Union | Read more</url></p><p>\"I'm in this because my country does not understand what is happening,\" he says. \"We are scapegoating immigrants for a set of economic dislocations that immigrants have very little to do with.\" That has the peal of truth: as the child of two Taiwanese professors, this is something he has mentioned repeatedly and without prompting across all manner of interviews and speeches..</p><p>But probed on his personal morality - on what lies beneath his political beliefs - he says only: \"I'm guided by what I think are the best practical solutions to the problems of our era ... I don't know if you can consider pragmatism an ideology. I consider myself a humanist, in that instead of trying to talk yourself into abstractions you just have to pay attention to how people are doing.\"</p><p>This pragmatism, of\u00a0 course, is part of his appeal. He boasts at his rally of getting support from \"independents!\" (cheers), \"libertarians!\" (more cheers) and \"Trump voters!\" (fewer cheers). He starts his pitch by mocking other progressives, and CNN, for blaming Mr Trump's rise on \"Russia, maybe Facebook, maybe the FBI\". He scorns the distinction between socialism and capitalism, even while pitching arguably the most Left-wing policies of any recent campaign.</p><p>One of his acknowledged Valley friends is Eric Weinstein, a doyen of the \"Intellectual Dark Web\" of conservative and contrarian thinkers (though Mr Weinstein defines himself as a \"progressive\"). And \u00a0while Mr Yang's actual policies are robustly anti-racist and pro-LGBT, he does not emphasise them much in his rhetoric, which mostly refrains from culture-war themes despite the intense pressure on Democrat candidates to prove their bona fides.</p><p>Why is that? \"I think we should be laser focused on solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected,\" he says, levelly. \"And so if I thought doing something would be helpful in that regard, I would do it. But I don't think engaging in certain arguments actually moves the needle. And this is one reason why some Americans are drawn to my campaign, because they can sense that I have a low interest in those kind of conversations.\"\u00a0</p><p>In another interview, with the African-American\u00a0YouTuber Tim Black, he was more blunt: \"I'm convinced that identity politics has been set up to distract us from the money. Let's go get that money, and then after we get that money we can talk about whatever else!\"</p><p>                   'Challenge f---ing accepted!'                   </p><p>In this fight, Mr Yang has more in common with Mr Trump than a first glance might suggest. For one thing, he is trying to meme his way to victory by using his opponents to bring him exposure. He says that joining in the Democratic debates will expose him to people who have no idea who he is, by which they will encounter his arresting $1,000-a-month promise.</p><p>A group of secondary students from Puyallup, a small town south of Seattle, told the Telegraph\u00a0that they found him in exactly this way. They first heard his name as an ironic joke spreading virally through their school, only to research him and find that they agreed with his policies.</p><p>Oddly, his campaign also initially attracted support from former Trump partisans in the online alt-Right, including favourable words from neo-Nazis. Some praised his dividend as a boon to jobless young men, a kind of subsidy for their video game habits, while others appeared to back him semi-ironically as a way to at least make some money from the alleged decline of the West.</p><p>Mr Yang strongly disavowed them, saying: \"We do not want your votes. You are not welcome in this campaign.\" The mood has since soured, and alt-Righters have mounted\u00a0online harassment campaigns against his chief of staff Carly Reilly.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-democrat-candidates-running-president/\">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</url></p><p>Mr Yang's true Trumpiness, howeber, lies in his self-description as an outsider fighting a system too stupid and blind to save itself. Like Mr Trump, he makes much of his background in business: during a recent interview with the eccentric podcast host Joe Rogan,\u00a0he used the word \"entrepreneur\" 11 times in one hour.</p><p>And, while he also identifies himself\u00a0 in his book The War On Normal People\u00a0as one of America's \"elites\", having graduated from the Ivy League into corporate law, it's true that he is not a career politician.\u00a0Listen to how he talks about Washington DC:</p><p>\"There was one guy there who did me this immense favour. He said 'Andrew, you're in the wrong town. No one here is going to do anything about these problems because this is not a town of leaders. Washington DC is a town of followers.... the only way that we will try to solve these problems is if you were to create a wave in other parts of the country and bring that wave crashing down on our heads.'\"</p><p>He pauses to let the cheering subside. \"And what I said to him was: challenge f---ing accepted!\"</p><p>Over the next year, then, Mr Yang will truly test what Americans really mean when they say they want an outsider. Are they really crying out for a \"nerd\" who makes arguments from data? That question makes Mr Yang laugh more than usual.</p><p>\"Well, you can only be yourself,\" he says. \"I communicate the way I communicate. I think it is compelling to a lot of Americans, because they've lost faith in our political establishment to solve these problems. And if somebody says 'Hey, this is horrifying but here's something we can do about it', I think they find that refreshing.\"</p><p>It works, he happily admits, \"phenomenally well on some people\" and terribly on others.</p><p>Perhaps Mr Yang will not get far. The online forecasting market PredictIt thinks he has a 6pc chance of success, which is higher than the likes of Cory Booker and Beto O'Rourke far below Mr Biden (at 25pc) and Mr Trump (42pc). He tends to poll around 1-2pc, firmly in the middle of the table (though perhaps that is impressive for someone with little name recognition).</p><p>FiveThirtyEight, the polling news website set up by election savant Nate Silver, says that Mr Yang polls is likely to appeal to millennials, Hispanic and Asian Americans and the hard Left, but not so much to black voters and \"party loyalists\".\u00a0</p><p>\"Because of his lack of political experience, narrow coalition and niche platform, Yang remains a long shot for the Democratic nomination,\" wrote the site.\u00a0\"But we can no longer say with confidence that he is any more of a long shot than several other candidates; that's an accomplishment in and of itself.\"\u00a0</p><p>But none of that may matter if Mr Yang is able to influence the public debate about UBI. The idea is not going to vanish any time soon, and neither is the threat of automation.\u00a0While Mr Yang is the first to make them central to his campaign, he will not be the last. It is possible that even if he crashes and burns in 2020, history will remember him as a trailblazer.</p><p>Meanwhile, he seems to be having a whale of a time. As the interview wraps up before the rally, he smiles: \"Isn't that fun?\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-53208272</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5S-W671-JCJY-G4MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3097\"/><timeReceived>7:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 23, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The website outlines a variety of rights including letting consumers know what data is collected about them, how it will be used, and when the data  changes hands.  Other proposals include letting consumers opt out of having their data collected, requiring companies to delete data if a consumer wants it removed, creating a standardized way to download data in a transferable format, and informing people of data breaches in a  timely manner. </p><p> Our data is ours   or it should be,  Yang, a former lawyer and entrepreneur,<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>wrote on Twitter</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>this morning while announcing the proposal.  At this point our data is more valuable than oil. If anyone benefits from our data it should be us. I would make data a property right that each of us shares. </p><p>Yang isn t the first Democratic candidate to suggest comprehensive changes to U.S. data privacy laws. Last year and again this year, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, introduced the Social Media Privacy and Consumer Rights Act, which would provide added transparency and controls for how data is collected and used by companies and how consumers would be informed of any data breaches. And in March, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, rolled out her own plan to regulate tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Apple.</p><p>So far, no federal legislation has gained traction. However, at the state level, the California Consumer Privacy Act which will implement many of the same types of requirements as Yang proposes is set to go into effect in January 2020. Industry trade groups have said they want data privacy legislation passed at the federal level to avoid forcing companies to have to comply with data laws at the state level.</p><p>Tech companies including Google and Facebook have also publicly expressed a preference for federal legislation. However, leaked audio recordings of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg acquired and published today by<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>The Verge</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> revealed that Facebook would be willing to pick a legal battle with Warren.</p><p> You have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies,  Zuckerberg said in a meeting with Facebook employees in July, according to<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>The Verge</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.    if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.   But look, at the end of the day, if someone s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight. </p><p>Responding today on Twitter, Warren linked to her own<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>policy</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, adding that she s  not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable. </p><p> We have to fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy,  she wrote in a separate<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>tweet</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>a few hours later.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-5d93a68b887382000663d7e3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5W-BHV1-DXVP-5004-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 1, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Following a childhood spent upstate, Yang entered the tech world in both Silicon Valley and New York, working for a health care startup and then founding an education company before launching Venture for America, a nonprofit fellowship organization that helps entrepreneurs create jobs outside of the country's two tech hubs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite a lack of political experience, Yang is likely to qualify for the Democratic primary debates this summer, and he's building a national profile \u2013 even among fringe conservatives. Earlier this month, City &amp; State spoke with Yang about his Silicon Valley background, how New York is leading in tech, and his most ambitious policy proposal \u2013 the universal basic income.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p> You're an entrepreneur and former tech executive vying for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 \u2013 why do we need that experience in the White House?</p><p> I think it's imperative that our federal government has senior leaders that understand technology innately, because at this point, technology has transformed many aspects of our society, and our government is years, maybe even decades behind the curve. And we all saw the congressional hearings with Mark Zuckerberg that indicated just how ignorant our leaders are about even the basic workings of our biggest tech companies. There used to be an agency that was meant to inform congressional leaders of technology issues and they got rid of that agency decades ago. Think about that. There was a group that was meant to keep legislators informed of technology and they got rid of it as a cost savings. It's ridiculous. Our country recognizes this. We know that our leaders are way behind the curve and it's going from dangerous to disastrous.</p><p> How is it going to disastrous?</p><p> Technology is, for example, playing a key role in automating away millions of American jobs and our congressional leaders don't understand that fact. Being a truck driver is the most common job in 29 states. There are three and a half million truck drivers, 94 percent male, and if you imagine a technology that disrupts their livelihood, that's going to be catastrophic. Thirty percent of American malls are going to close in the next four years and working as a retail clerk is the No. 1 job in the country. Our teenagers \u2013 particularly teenage girls \u2013 are becoming basket cases because of pervasive smartphone and social media use. You can just go on and on. No one trusts the information they're getting. And our government is just looking at this in complete ignorance.</p><p> A central proposal of your platform is a universal basic income as a solution to the economic troubles caused by workplace automation. How would that work?</p><p> Every American receives $1,000 a month starting at age 18. And the money comes largely from a new tax that falls most heavily on the Amazon, Google, Facebook, Ubers of the world. And if you look at headlines, Amazon just paid zero in federal taxes despite reporting record profits last year. This is just yet another way that these technology companies are running rings around our lawmakers and policymakers.</p><p> That's an ambitious solution to automation. Are there other measures that could or should be taken?</p><p> The big question on everyone's minds right now is, are some of these companies so big that they need to be broken up? The problem is that our antitrust laws are designed to fight price gouging. In other words, you get a monopoly and then you start overcharging for your railroad or whatever it is. And the tech companies do not overcharge \u2013 if anything, they undercharge. And so they're putting other companies out of business, but our antitrust laws don't have a problem with that. So there are certain things that we probably should do. For example, if Amazon accounts for 50 percent of e-commerce \u2013 which they do \u2013 they should probably not be allowed to promote their own offerings. But the dynamics of technology are such that the No. 1 companies get much, much stronger than the No. 2. And as an example, you don't need five navigation apps, you just want the one best one. And so our thinking about competition doesn't really work, where if I were to break Amazon into four mini Amazons, that doesn't really solve the problem. And it also does not magically restore the main street retailers that are going out of business. So this is the big issue of our day: What do reforms in these industries look like? I would suggest that that's going to be something that we have to address as a country in the immediate future.</p><p> Are these bipartisan issues? And what kind of feedback have you heard from conservatives on the universal basic income proposal?</p><p> Very much so. At this point, these are bipartisan issues, they're American issues, and there's an appetite on both sides of the aisle to try and address them meaningfully. I've also gotten people from both sides of the aisle say they're very excited about (universal basic income) as a way to help move our economy forward, so I see it in a similar way.</p><p> Speaking of Amazon, what went wrong with HQ2 here in New York?</p><p> To me, the fault primarily lies with Amazon. If you come into a community, you expect to have many issues that you have to iron out and work with people. And Amazon clearly had no real desire to work things out that it didn't immediately find convenient. Do I think Amazon would have been a net positive for the New York metro area? Of course, yes. It's a ton of jobs and economic activity. But do I also think that if Amazon had sincerely wanted to be here, they would be here? Of course.</p><p>New York has taken the lead on some tech issues, including regulations for e-hail companies and proposing an internet sales tax. What tech issues should be handled at the city or state level?</p><p> Waiting for Washington to get something done might be forever. So to the extent that New York City and New York state can take the lead on some of these issues I think would make a lot of sense. This is the biggest market in the country, so whatever guidelines and rules and regulations are put forward here would have a national impact.</p><p> Concerns about the power and reach of Big Tech companies have recently been raised by candidates including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. Do you feel that making automation and other less-discussed issues central to your platform could drive other candidates to pick them up as well?</p><p> I certainly hope so. One of the goals of this campaign is to first help Americans understand that it's not immigrants that are causing economic problems around the country, it's advancing technology. And if we can get other candidates to embrace this set of issues and propose meaningful solutions then that would be a win for the American people.</p><p> You're not the only New Yorker plotting a challenge to Donald Trump in 2020. What sets you apart from U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, or even a potential candidate like New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio?</p><p> I believe I'm the only one who is building my campaign around the issues that got Donald Trump elected in the first place. You have to ask yourself, why is Donald Trump our president today, and to me, the reason he's our president is that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa \u2013 all the swing states he needed to win. For whatever reason, most other candidates are ignoring that, whereas I'm very much focused on how to improve Americans' lives in an era of unprecedented technological change.</p><p> The European Union adopted sweeping data privacy protections under the General Data Protection Regulation last year. Is something like the GDPR called for in the United States?</p><p> That is very much called for. I think our data should be considered a property right that we have control over. It doesn't make sense that there are companies profiting into billions of dollars from our data while we see none of that. So we should have these rights protected, and if other companies are profiting from them, then we should see some proportion of that value.</p><p> Are tech companies aware that the tides are shifting and that regulations are coming down the pike?</p><p> Yeah, very much so. At this point, many of them are just trying to prepare for what the rules are going to look like, but they increasingly expect to be regulated.</p><p> Do specific companies come to mind as embracing regulation?</p><p> I think there are a couple of leaders that are more open to it. I know that (Marc) Benioff and Salesforce have expressed a greater willingness to work with regulators. But they realize that it's a different era that we're in, where it used to be that everyone felt like technology could do no wrong, and now, people feel like the pendulum is swinging the other way.</p><p> What would you tell Americans \u2013 New Yorkers especially \u2013 who are worried about the rise of automation and AI?</p><p> I would say if you're worried about AI taking away jobs, you are largely right to be worried. We need to collectively arrive at what that means for us, our families, our communities and our society. And one of the big reasons I'm running for president is to help America truly confront and address the challenges of the 21st century.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang surrounded by supporters.

Now he lives on the road because he wants to be president. Insider recently followed Yang as he campaigned through New Hampshire, the site of the first presidential primary next month. New Hampshireites love being courted by presidential hopefuls every four years, and as we saw, they're not shy about bluntly confronting candidates in public with serious concerns. </p><p>Yang talked about how he dealt with being a lonely, bullied high school kid, why he misses the hardscrabble role players in the NBA, and why he rejects using identity politics as a campaign strategy. He also spoke openly about being the father of an autistic child, and what he looks forward to when he gets a rare break from the grind of the campaign trail. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. A year ago, Andrew Yang[3] was a successful entrepreneur, the author of two books, living a comfortable and largely anonymous life. He was a 44-year-old happily married father of two living in Manhattan, with most weekends and summer months spent with his family in a country home about 90 minutes north of the city. Now he's 45 and he lives on the road, amid the isolation that comes from shaking hundreds of hands a day, away from his loving family, because he wants to be president.Grinding in the Granite StateLife on the campaign trail is a grind. The unmooring of daily stability. The unfamiliar beds, high-calorie meals, and lack of any privacy whatsoever. But it's in New Hampshire, a month before the primary, that the grind becomes a maw \u2014 it swallows you whole. You're ping-pinging around the icy roads of the Granite State, where in January the sun rarely pierces the low, gray blanket of sky. You're squeezing in media interviews and slogging through mid-day debate prep cram sessions on the slim chance you'll reach the required polling threshold and make it back to the nationally televised stage. You're giving the same speech at up to six events a day to voters who take pride in being courted every four years by presidential candidates. But Yang's not complaining, because he won't even entertain the idea of what he'd do in the event he does not win the Democratic nomination, and later, the presidency. Over a hearty two-plate diner breakfast that included a stack of pancakes covered in what looked like the innards of an apple pie and cream, Yang told me, \"After I'm president I'm going to get on a bit of an [exercise] regimen.\" He'd be a morning workout guy, because he doesn't like to shower twice a day. \"That seems excessive,\" he says.\"Random Man\" gets a gangIn June 2019, Washington Post magazine profiled Yang under the headline, \"Random Man Runs for President[4].\" Tough, but fair. Then, as now, Yang had almost no chance of becoming the nominee. Yes, we're in a post-Trump world where nothing should ever be ruled out, but Yang is not Trump \u2014 who was a nationally known figure for three decades. Still, Yang could make some noise. In a lot of ways, he already has. The New York Times has called him \"the internet's favorite candidate[5],\" and thanks in part to his rabid meme-creating online supporters \u2014 the Yang Gang[6] \u2014 he has been able to go from complete anonymity to polling higher and for longer than several nationally-visible Democratic rivals. According to Insider's data, he's been able to lock down more new supporters[7] than any other 2020 contender outside of the four frontrunners (former Vice President Joe Biden[8], Sen. Bernie Sanders[9], Sen. Elizabeth Warren[10], former Mayor Pete Buttigieg[11]). He's appeared in all six of the first debates and was the only candidate of color on stage in December, which he called an \"honor and a disappointment[12].\" His campaign raised $16.5 million in the last quarter of 2019[13], putting him fifth among all Democratic candidates[14], behind Warren's $21.2 million and ahead of Sen. Amy Klobuchar[15]'s $11.5 million. That massive haul was thanks to small donors, 98% of whom gave $200 or less, with an average donation of $30, according to the campaign. Yang jokes that his fans are \"as cheap as Bernie's\" \u2014 a reference to the democratic socialist senator whose front-running campaign is also built on small donations. But thanks to them, Yang's war chest might allow him to stay in the primary race until the last vote is cast. Yang knows New HampshireAbout as northeast geographically as a state can get, New Hampshire isn't \"flyover country,\" but that doesn't mean a lot of its residents don't feel similarly abused and ignored by the coastal elites. What makes them unlike most small, largely rural states is that they have a voice. As Yang regularly reminds attendees at his town halls here, their per capita vote in the primary counts for far more than New York or California. They have power and they know it. New Hampshireites make it a point to check out the candidates that come to their towns, and they're not shy about putting candidates on the spot if they run into them in public. After an early morning town hall in Hudson, while Yang tended to his trucker-sized breakfast, a diner waitress refilled my coffee then without so much as a \"Pardon me, Mr. Yang,\" demanded to know from the presidential hopeful, \"What's he going to do for me?\" \"I have to come up with $35,000 for my kid's lung transplant. Isn't that pathetic?\" she asked. Yang responded with his sympathies for what he called our \"broken\" health care system. Shortly after, a man who appeared to be in his 60s walked up to our table and asked Yang how he's liking New Hampshire. \"It's great to be back, I went to high school here,\" Yang replied, referring to his time at Phillips Exeter Academy[16] \u2014 a highly selective boarding school which has been called the best private school in America[17]. \"It was a great place to learn, but it was a hard place. I was the awkward Asian kid.\" The man noted that he spent time in Asia, Vietnam specifically. \"Good for you, thank you for your service,\" Yang offered. \"Well I don't know if it's good for me, I came back with post-traumatic stress disorder,\" the man replied. \"I haven't heard you say one word about the military. I like some of the stuff that Tulsi Gabbard[18]'s bringing up, because ever since World War Two we've become the world's policeman. We've got troops in over 150 countries and I don't know if you think that's a good idea.\" Yang stood up and calmly noted that he is aligned with Rep. Gabbard (another 2020 candidate) in ending \"the forever wars\" \u2014 the foreign conflicts that have stretched over decades with no exit strategies in sight \u2014 and that he has a slew of proposals to provide better care for veterans. But the man was only getting started, laying into both Presidents Obama and Trump for what he said were broken promises to end US involvement in foreign wars in \"shithole\" nations, before seguing into a heartbreaking story about his 31-year-old nephew dying by suicide after suffering through untreated PTSD from his own combat service. Yang thoughtfully listened, offered his sympathies, and reiterated his support for ending the forever wars. Making it through his high school years and rejecting identity politicsYang's not shy about mentioning that he didn't enjoy his high school years. But it's nothing personal against New Hampshire. He was bullied in his early teenage years in suburban New York, before he transferred to Phillips Exeter. \"Growing up in my town, I was one of the only Asian kids and I'd skipped a grade, so I was very scrawny and felt small and out of place,\" Yang recalls. \"And I did get called 'chink' and 'gook' a fair amount. So I wound up getting into fights that I would lose typically.\" When he transferred to boarding school, it wasn't as rough, but still lonely. \"Showing up in 11th grade wasn't easy because most people in the school had been there already and it was fairly well-established in terms of social circles,\" he says. \"I would go to the music center and just play piano for an hour or two. There was a local arcade in town that I would go to play video games. There was a comic book store I went to every week. Those were the teenage things I would do that were kind of escape hatches.\" Despite being a victim of racially-motivated bullying and feeling out of place because he was the rare Asian kid, Yang the candidate has made it a point to eschew what's become a prominent feature of Democratic Party progressivism: identity politics. \"I'm very proud of my own heritage. And I think that Americans being proud of who they are is great and getting different types of experiences into the public arena is tremendously positive,\" Yang says. \"But I think that identity politics as it's used in many contexts serves to highlight differences and separate Americans from each other and does so in a way that's not very productive.\" He adds: \"I believe the biggest problems that concern Americans concern the vast majority of us. Things like an economic system that's leaving more and more people behind. Climate change. A broken healthcare system and an underperforming educational system with record high levels of student loan debt. Some of these problems affect certain groups more than others, but there are many things that bring us together much more than serve to separate us from each other. And on a national level, I think that identity politics is a very counterproductive way to go because most people are drawn to messages that talk about how we can work together, rather than saying that people who have certain experiences or don't have certain experiences aren't allowed to relate to each other.\" It's 2020 and the geeks shall inherit the EarthThe awkward, bullied Asian kid now can say that Rivers Cuomo \u2014 the Weezer frontman and rock and roll avatar[19] for all 90s-raised Dungeons and Dragons-playing geeks[20] \u2014 is endorsing his presidential campaign and performing at one of his Iowa rallies[21]. As a fellow Weezer fan, I had to know: \"The Blue Album\" or \"Pinkerton\"? \"The Blue Album,\" Yang replied after considering the question for a moment (Weezer fans can love both of the band's first two classic albums, but no one can say they don't have a preference). He's also received endorsements from superstar comic Dave Chappelle and \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" director James Gunn. But in Donald Glover \u2014 the \"Star Wars\" actor, \"Atlanta\" creator, and Childish Gambino rapper who brilliantly straddles \"cool\" and \"geek\" culture like no one in the business \u2014 Yang's not only earned an endorsement but found his campaign's creative consultant[22]. When a progressive voter at a town hall in Manchester revealed himself to be a professional wrestler, Yang replied, \"that's so cool!\" He then asked if the man would ask his question in character. Without missing a beat, the man channeled the late \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage[23] and thunderously growled, \"We're intrigued by the concept of universal basic income, but some of us are concerned it could lead to cuts in social services!\" (Yang assured the gentleman that under his presidency, he would not support cuts to the social safety net.) Yang, like me, is a frustrated fan of the hapless New York Knicks. Although in his case, he's actually abandoned his fandom. \"I feel the same way about the Knicks that most Americans do about various institutions. We've seen bad leadership and lack of accountability.\" He's also not as enthusiastically into the NBA itself as he used to be, now that the league is obsessively driven by analytics and has become all about three-point shooting to the detriment of hard-nosed defense and lane-driving dunks. \"They're making a high enough percentage [of three-pointers] where the math is working now. But in another era they would have said that's a bad shot,\" Yang says. He also lamented the loss of a certain kind of role player which barely exists in the league anymore: \"I remember the Anthony Bonner[24] types. He had no skills except that he played hard. Now you can't have a 'play hard' guy who just comes in off the bench and is the energy guy.\" I'm struck by these sentiments coming from a candidate whose answer to MAGA hats is MATH hats (an acronym for Make America Think Harder). Yang's no technophobe; some of his hardcore fans even wear shirts that say, \"The Robots are Coming.\" But maybe there isn't a disconnect here. Perhaps it's apt for a candidate whose main policy is giving every adult American $1,000 a month as a way of preparing for, but not resisting, the near-future when automation makes a lot of working class jobs obsolete. Technology is putting an end to a lot of hardscrabble careers, much as technology (and math) have made the \"play hard\" NBA role player a memory for fans like Yang and me. One day homeWhen Yang gets his one day a week off the campaign, he's unsurprisingly in decompression mode. \"It can be mindless entertainment where you just watch something really dumb. It can be mindless chores or tasks around the house,\" Yang says of how he unwinds. \"I might try and watch half an episode of 'The Witcher' because apparently it's the number one show on streaming. And I genuinely generally like science fiction and fantasy stuff.\" But, Yang adds, \"I was a huge 'Game of Thrones' fan, and I can already say that 'The Witcher' is no 'Game of Thrones.'\" More than anything, Yang says the hardest part of life on the trail is being away from his two sons. The older of them, Christopher, is autistic. \"We found this adaptive sports foundation that teaches kids with special needs how to ski,\" Yang says, before expressing his admiration for the volunteer instructors helping his son. \"Imagine being an adaptive ski instructor. You're dealing with people who are really challenged. Like our son is very uncoordinated. Various body control issues.\" \"Those people are saints,\" Yang says.Evelyn Yang, Andrew's wife, recently began making appearances on the campaign trail for her husband's campaign. At a town hall in Concord, she spoke of parenting a special needs child. \"I'm working the hardest, most intense job of my life, and I used to work at 5:30 AM shift in high school. Now every day is a 5:30 AM shift and a 1pm shift and an 8pm shift and maybe a 3am shift just for fun,\" Evelyn says. \"But Andrew recognizes the importance of the work that caregivers do and he wants parents in our society to have a choice.\" She adds that like Andrew, she once had a high-stakes career in the private sector, but now her job is \"CEO of Team Christopher.\" Evelyn told me that when Andrew takes his brief respites from the trail, the Yang kids can expect one thing. \"They know whenever dad's around they get ice cream. It doesn't matter what time of year, it could be freezing cold. It's time for ice cream,\" she says. Read more:Andrew Yang is running for president in 2020.

Yang jokes that his fans are \"as cheap as Bernie's\" - a reference to the democratic socialist senator whose front-running campaign is also built on small donations.\u00a0</p><p>But thanks to them, Yang's war chest might allow him to stay in the primary race until the last vote is cast.</p><p>Anthony Fisher/Insider</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yang knows New Hampshire</emphasis></h><p>About as northeast geographically as a state can get, New Hampshire isn't \"flyover country,\" but that doesn't mean a lot of its residents don't feel similarly abused and ignored by the coastal elites.\u00a0</p><p>What makes them unlike most small, largely rural states is that they have a voice. As Yang regularly reminds attendees at his town halls here, their per capita vote in the primary counts for far more than New York or California. They have power and they know it.</p><p>New Hampshireites make it a point to check out the candidates that come to their towns, and they're not shy about putting candidates on the spot if they run into them in public.\u00a0</p><p>After an early morning town hall in Hudson, while Yang tended to his trucker-sized breakfast, a diner waitress refilled my coffee then without so much as a \"Pardon me, Mr. Yang,\" demanded to know from the presidential hopeful, \"What's he going to do for me?\"\u00a0</p><p>\"I have to come up with $35,000 for my kid's lung transplant. Isn't that pathetic?\" she asked. Yang responded with his sympathies for what he called our \"broken\" health care system.\u00a0</p><p>Shortly after, a man who appeared to be in his 60s walked up to our table and asked Yang how he's liking New Hampshire.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's great to be back, I went to high school here,\" Yang replied, referring to his time at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-attend-phillips-exeter-academy-2014-11?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Phillips Exeter Academy</url> - a highly selective boarding school which has been called the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-private-high-schools-america-2014-11?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">best private school in America</url>. \"It was a great place to learn, but it was a hard place. I was the awkward Asian kid.\"\u00a0</p><p>The man noted that he spent time in Asia, Vietnam specifically. \"Good for you, thank you for your service,\" Yang offered.</p><p>\"Well I don't know if it's good for me, I came back with post-traumatic stress disorder,\" the man replied. \"I haven't heard you say one word about the military. I like some of the stuff that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-tulsi-gabbard-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Tulsi Gabbard</url>'s bringing up, because ever since World War Two we've become the world's policeman. We've got troops in over 150 countries and I don't know if you think that's a good idea.\"</p><p>Yang stood up and calmly noted that he is aligned with Rep. Gabbard (another 2020 candidate) in ending \"the forever wars\" - the foreign conflicts that have stretched over decades with no exit strategies in sight - and that he has a slew of proposals to provide better care for veterans.</p><p>But the man was only getting started, laying into both Presidents Obama and Trump for what he said were broken promises to end US involvement in foreign wars in \"shithole\" nations, before seguing into a heartbreaking story about his 31-year-old nephew dying by suicide after suffering through untreated PTSD from his own combat service.</p><p>Yang thoughtfully listened, offered his sympathies, and reiterated his support for ending the forever wars.\u00a0</p><p>Anthony Fisher/Insider</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Making it through his high school years and rejecting identity politics</emphasis></h><p>Yang's not shy about mentioning that he didn't enjoy his high school years. But it's nothing personal against New Hampshire. He was bullied in his early teenage years in suburban New York, before he transferred to Phillips Exeter.\u00a0</p><p>\"Growing up in my town, I was one of the only Asian kids and I'd skipped a grade, so I was very scrawny and felt small and out of place,\" Yang recalls. \"And I did get called 'chink' and 'gook' a fair amount. So I wound up getting into fights that I would lose typically.\"\u00a0</p><p>When he transferred to boarding school, it wasn't as rough, but still lonely.\u00a0</p><p>\"Showing up in 11th grade wasn't easy because most people in the school had been there already and it was fairly well-established in terms of social circles,\" he says. \"I would go to the music center and just play piano for an hour or two. There was a local arcade in town that I would go to play video games. There was a comic book store I went to every week. Those were the teenage things I would do that were kind of escape hatches.\"</p><p>Despite being a victim of racially-motivated bullying and feeling out of place because he was the rare Asian kid, Yang the candidate has made it a point to eschew what's become a prominent feature of Democratic Party progressivism: identity politics.</p><p>\"I'm very proud of my own heritage. And I think that Americans being proud of who they are is great and getting different types of experiences into the public arena is tremendously positive,\" Yang says. \"But I think that identity politics as it's used in many contexts serves to highlight differences and separate Americans from each other and does so in a way that's not very productive.\"\u00a0</p><p>He adds: \"I believe the biggest problems that concern Americans concern the vast majority of us. Things like an economic system that's leaving more and more people behind. Climate change. A broken healthcare system and an underperforming educational system with record high levels of student loan debt. Some of these problems affect certain groups more than others, but there are many things that bring us together much more than serve to separate us from each other. And on a national level, I think that identity politics is a very counterproductive way to go because most people are drawn to messages that talk about how we can work together, rather than saying that people who have certain experiences or don't have certain experiences aren't allowed to relate to each other.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Fisher/Insider</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It's 2020 and the geeks shall inherit the Earth</emphasis></h><p>The awkward, bullied Asian kid now can say that Rivers Cuomo - the Weezer frontman and <url normalizedValue=\"https://genius.com/Weezer-in-the-garage-lyrics\">rock and roll avatar</url> for all 90s-raised       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0rV88Ev-og\">Dungeons and Dragons-playing geeks</url> - is endorsing his presidential campaign and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.spin.com/2019/11/rivers-cuomo-performs-weezer-songs-at-andrew-yang-yangapalooza-watch/\">performing at one of his Iowa rallies</url>.\u00a0</p><p>As a fellow Weezer fan, I had to know: \"The Blue Album\" or \"Pinkerton\"?</p><p>\"The Blue Album,\" Yang replied after considering the question for a moment (Weezer fans can love both of the band's first two classic albums, but no one can say they don't have a preference).</p><p>He's also received endorsements from superstar comic Dave Chappelle and \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" director James Gunn. But in Donald Glover - the \"Star Wars\" actor, \"Atlanta\" creator, and Childish Gambino rapper who brilliantly straddles \"cool\" and \"geek\" culture like no one in the business - Yang's not only earned an endorsement but found his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90446610/youll-want-to-buy-donald-glovers-andrew-yang-merch-even-if-in-youre-not-in-the-yanggang\">campaign's creative consultant</url>.\u00a0</p><p>When a progressive voter at a town hall in Manchester revealed himself to be a professional wrestler, Yang replied, \"that's so cool!\" He then asked if the man would ask his question in character.\u00a0</p><p>Without missing a beat, the man channeled the late <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnBUbRowRgM\">\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage</url> and thunderously growled, \"We're intrigued by the concept of universal basic income, but some of us are concerned it could lead to cuts in social services!\" (Yang assured the gentleman that under his presidency, he would not support cuts to the social safety net.)</p><p>Yang, like me, is a frustrated fan of the hapless New York Knicks. Although in his case, he's actually abandoned his fandom.</p><p>\"I feel the same way about the Knicks that most Americans do about various institutions. We've seen bad leadership and lack of accountability.\"</p><p>He's also not as enthusiastically into the NBA itself as he used to be, now that the league is obsessively driven by analytics and has become all about three-point shooting to the detriment of hard-nosed defense and lane-driving dunks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"</emphasis>They're making a high enough percentage [of three-pointers] where the math is working now. But in another era they would have said that's a bad shot,\" Yang says.\u00a0</p><p>He also lamented the loss of a certain kind of role player which barely exists in the league anymore: \"I remember the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.slamonline.com/nba/anthony-bonner-new-york-knicks/\">Anthony Bonner</url> types. He had no skills except that he played hard. Now you can't have a 'play hard' guy who just comes in off the bench and is the energy guy.\"</p><p>I'm struck by these sentiments coming from a candidate whose answer to MAGA hats is MATH hats (an acronym for Make America Think Harder). Yang's no technophobe; some of his hardcore fans even wear shirts that say, \"The Robots are Coming.\"</p><p>But maybe there isn't a disconnect here. Perhaps it's apt for a candidate whose main policy is giving every adult American $1,000 a month as a way of preparing for, but not resisting, the near-future when automation makes a lot of working class jobs obsolete.</p><p>Technology is putting an end to a lot of hardscrabble careers, much as technology (and math) have made the \"play hard\" NBA role player a memory for fans like Yang and me.\u00a0</p><p>Anthony Fisher/Insider</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">One day home</emphasis></h><p>When Yang gets his one day a week off the campaign, he's unsurprisingly in decompression mode.</p><p>\"It can be mindless entertainment where you just watch something really dumb. It can be mindless chores or tasks around the house,\" Yang says of how he unwinds. \"I might try and watch half an episode of 'The Witcher' because apparently it's the number one show on streaming. And I genuinely generally like science fiction and fantasy stuff.\"</p><p>But, Yang adds, \"I was a huge 'Game of Thrones' fan, and I can already say that 'The Witcher' is no 'Game of Thrones.'\"\u00a0</p><p>More than anything, Yang says the hardest part of life on the trail is being away from his two sons. The older of them, Christopher, is autistic.\u00a0</p><p>\"We found this adaptive sports foundation that teaches kids with special needs how to ski,\" Yang says, before expressing his admiration for the volunteer instructors helping his son. \"Imagine being an adaptive ski instructor. You're dealing with people who are really challenged. Like our son is very uncoordinated. Various body control issues.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Those people are saints,\" Yang says.\u00a0</p><p>Anthony Fisher/Insider</p><p>Evelyn Yang, Andrew's wife, recently began making appearances on the campaign trail for her husband's campaign. At a town hall in Concord, she spoke of parenting a special needs child.\u00a0</p><p>\"I'm working the hardest, most intense job of my life, and I used to work at 5:30 AM shift in high school. Now every day is a 5:30 AM shift and a 1pm shift and an 8pm shift and maybe a 3am shift just for fun,\" Evelyn says. \"But Andrew recognizes the importance of the work that caregivers do and he wants parents in our society to have a choice.\"</p><p>She adds that like Andrew, she once had a high-stakes career in the private sector, but now her job is \"CEO of Team Christopher.\"</p><p>Evelyn told me that when Andrew takes his brief respites from the trail, the Yang kids can expect one thing.</p><p>\"They know whenever dad's around they get ice cream. It doesn't matter what time of year, it could be freezing cold. It's time for ice cream,\" she says.\u00a0</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Read more:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-yang-better-democratic-presidential-candidate-warren-sanders-2019-10?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Andrew Yang is running for president in 2020.

The New York native's signature policy \u2014 one inspired by futurist Martin Ford's book Rise of the Robots\u2014 is what he calls the Freedom Dividend, a form of universal basic income that would guarantee every American aged 18-64 at least $1,000 per month. Yang has also proposed a federal agency devoted to regulating the 'addictive nature' of media, making Tax Day a national holiday and limiting the private sector work of federal investigators after they leave public office, in an effort to curb corruption. Yang \u2014 a graduate of Brown University and Columbia Law School \u2014 worked in the health care industry for four years before assuming the role of CEO at Manhattan Prep, a test preparation company, in 2006. In 2009, the company was acquired by testing giant Kaplan, after which Yang launched Venture for America, a fellowship program with the mission 'to create economic opportunity in American cities by mobilizing the next generation of entrepreneurs.' </p><p>The nonprofit grew from an annual operating budget of $200,000 in 2012 to $6 million in 2017, and it now has a presence in about 20 U.S. cities and a startup accelerator in Detroit. Moments before Yang stepped onstage last week to deliver a speech at the Techonomy 2019 conference in New York City, VentureBeat spoke with him about the U.S.' role in fostering a thriving AI research community, unregulated AI's potential to do harm, and policies that might ease the coming AI-driven job market transformation.American AI InitiativeIn February, President Trump signed[1] an executive order establishing a program called the American AI Initiative[2], which codifies several White House proposals made in spring 2018 during an informal summit on AI. Specifically, it tasks federal agencies with devoting additional resources to AI research and training, and it instructs the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and other departments to draft standards guiding the development of 'reliable, robust, trustworthy, secure, portable, and interoperable AI systems' and to create AI fellowships and apprenticeships. In the future, these agencies will be required to make a good-faith effort to provide data, computing resources, and models to AI researchers whenever possible and to 'prioritize AI' investments in their budgets. Yang says the American AI Initiative is 'better than nothing' and 'very welcome,' but he points out that it fails to devote the meaningful resources needed to bolster the U.S.' leadership in AI. 'We have to be realistic about what actually happened \u2014 the announcement amounted more to an assignment of agencies,' he told VentureBeat. 'If you were to make a list of the top folks in AI, a very, very low proportion of them work in the government at present. And if you were to dig into one of these agencies and see what they're doing on AI, you would [probably] find that they're doing very little, in most places.' With the signing of the American AI Initiative, the U.S. joined the dozens of other countries that have launched national AI guidelines and policies, most of which have outstripped the U.S. with respect to the amount of capital they've set aside for research. For instance, Canada's Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy[3] is a five-year, $94 million (CAD $125 million) plan to invest in AI research and talent, and the EU Commission has committed to increasing[4] its investment in AI from $565 million (\u20ac500 million) in 2017 to $1.69 billion (\u20ac1.5 billion) by the end of 2020. China's AI plan is perhaps the most ambitious: In two policy documents[5], 'A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan' and 'Three-Year Action Plan to Promote the Development of New-Generation Artificial Intelligence Industry,' the Chinese government laid out a roadmap for cultivating an AI industry worth roughly $147 billion by 2030. 'The top minds in the field aren't working for the government trying to make breakthroughs \u2014 they're working for Google, OpenAI, and other Silicon Valley giants,' said Yang. 'It's a very different model than what's happening in China, where China is essentially writing blank checks to private firms and saying, 'Hey, if you need computing, resources, and infrastructure, we've got billions of dollars in infrastructure that you can utilize.'' He's not wrong. Analysts at CB Insights report[6] that 11% of all AI startups are headquartered in Chinese cities, a share equaled only by Israel, and that China-based firms SenseTime[7] and Megvii[8] are two of the best-funded AI companies globally, owing in large part to government contracts. SenseTime and Megvii \u2014 both of which develop computer vision technologies, principally in the areas of facial recognition and object detection \u2014 have so far attracted over $1.4 billion and $2.6 billion in capital, respectively, according to Crunchbase. By comparison, one of the top-funded stateside AI firms \u2014 self-driving delivery vehicle startup Nuro[9] \u2014 has raked in just over $1 billion in equity financing. Moreover, according to the Allen Institute[10], a Seattle-based nonprofit bioscience research organization, China has published more AI academic papers than the U.S. since 2005. A more recent analysis of more than 2 million publications forecasts that China's share of top research contributions will equal that of the U.S. by 2020. One thing that gives Chinese firms a leg up on their American rivals is liberal access to data, according to Yang. '[China's] privacy regulations are very lax, and their attitude toward sharing one's information are different in China, so they can feed their AI more data and make their algorithm smarter, stronger, and faster.' That's why Yang says it's critical that the U.S. government 'step up and help,' perhaps by contributing capital in exchange for 'a bead on what's happening at the frontier of development in AI.' 'We [need to] make sure that nothing destructive comes out that could be negative for our citizens,' said Yang, perhaps alluding to the Defense Innovation Board[11] \u2014 an advisory commission that seeks to bring technological innovation to the U.S. military \u2014 and its ongoing effort to formulate AI ethics recommendations for the Department of Defense (DoD). 'The U.S. model of letting private companies lead the charge works phenomenally well for [some things and] not as well for others, and there's reason to believe that in the development of AI, the organizations with the most data are going to make the most headway more quickly.' 'We need to try and avoid what's considered an AI arms race with China, and the best way to avoid an arms race dynamic is to maintain a spot at the leadership table,' said Yang. 'And if we fall behind significantly, then it's going to be much harder for us to be collaborative. I believe [this is something that] would be welcomed by many leaders in Silicon Valley because they recognize that this is not a domestic industry \u2014 that this is going to be global.'Progress and setbacksYang notes that there have been small but meaningful steps in the right direction. The U.S. military last month opened its Joint AI Center and published[12] an AI strategy adherent to a 2012 DoD directive[13] that limits the use of AI in weaponry. Separately, the U.S. Senate is considering legislation like the Algorithmic Accountability Act[14], which would require companies to study and fix inaccurate or biased algorithms, and the Commercial Facial Recognition Privacy Act[15], which would ban users of commercial face recognition from identifying or tracking consumers without their consent. More recently, the City of San Francisco prohibited the deployment of facial identification[16] systems by the police and other agencies. On the private sector side of the equation, CEO Sundar Pichai last summer laid out Goole's AI principles[17], which include a ban on the creation of autonomous weaponry[18], and the company committed[19] in December to refrain from offering a 'general-purpose' facial recognition service until 'challenges' have been 'identif[ied] and address[ed].' Microsoft similarly revealed last year that it turned down requests to install facial recognition technology where there might be human rights risks, and the company said it canceled a contract[20] to supply processing and AI tools to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). But setbacks threaten to derail the progress that's been made, warns Yang. At a city council hearing[21] in March, New York City officials said they had not yet arrived at a definition of automated decision systems (ADS) \u2014 the tools that the city's Automated Decision Systems Task Force was created to study \u2014 and that they hadn't identified a system the task force could study in detail. Reports last year revealed that Project Maven, a secretive Pentagon contract that attracted participation from companies like Google, Oculus founder Palmer Luckey's Anduril Industries, Clarifai, and IBM, sought to use AI to improve object recognition in military drones. And Microsoft's Research Asia division, which works with AI researchers affiliated with the Chinese military, has been accused of complicity in human rights abuses[22]. Meanwhile, Clarifai late last year announced[23] the formation of a Washington, D.C. subsidiary \u2014 Neural Net One \u2014 that will in part handle defense and intelligence contracts, sparking concern among some employees. This summer, Amazon seeded Rekognition[24], a cloud-basedimage analysis technology[25] that an MIT study found[26] to be biased against certain genders and ethnicities, to law enforcement agencies. And Peter Thiel-backed Palantir, a startup that provides predictive policing solutions to local law enforcement, has been accused of perpetrating 'racist feedback loop[s]' in which police surveil groups of people based on data generated by their own racially biased policing, creating more monitoring and thereby more arrests. According to Yang, the government's ethically regressive policies \u2014 produced in the absence of a sound AI strategy \u2014 have led to its complicity in advancing potentially dangerous AI. '[T]he U.S. government is clearly 24 years behind [the times], because they literally got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995,' said Yang. 'So we've essentially been flying blind when it comes to technology for two and a half decades. There's some catching up to do.'Universal Basic IncomeYang believes this is particularly true when it comes to the job market, which he says will be \u2014 and already has been \u2014 transformed by AI. Analysts agree: In a report late last year, Forrester[27] found that automation could eliminate 10% of U.S. jobs in the coming months. The World Economic Forum[28], PricewaterhouseCoopers, [29]McKinsey Global Institute[30], andGartner[31] have forecast that AI could make redundant as many as 75 million jobs by 2025. And in a recent study[32], the U.K.'s Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that of the 19.9 million people the department surveyed in 2017, approximately 7.4% could be replaced by robots in the coming years. '[There's] low-hanging fruit that [automation is] going to knock out soon, like replacing call center workers and truck drivers,' said Yang. 'That's in part because there are powerful economic incentives driving the development.' That's why Yang is advocating the Freedom Dividend. He asserts that the monthly payments \u2014 which would be paid for by a value-added tax, a consumption tax levied on goods at each stage of their production \u2014 could kickstart economic development in regions of the country that haven't benefited from a wellspring of venture capital. 'One reason why people are so animated about breaking up the biggest tech companies is because they know that, in Silicon Valley, the primary business model is to get bought by one of those big tech companies, rather than trying to build a company that's going to last for decades,' said Yang. He's far from the first to voice support for a universal basic income. Martin Luther King Jr.[33], Mark Zuckerberg[34], Richard Branson[35], and Elon Musk[36] have championed the idea, with Musk going so far as to suggest that the job loss from automation will be so severe that some form of social safety net will be necessary to support society. Bill Gates has suggested implementing a 'robot tax,[37]' whereby the government would extract a fee every time a business replaces an employee with automated software or machines. To that end, the EU considered[38] \u2014 but ultimately rejected \u2014 a draft plan that would have seen robot workers classed as 'electronic persons,' with their owners liable to pay social security for them. Indeed, a semblance of a universal basic income program is ongoing in Alaska, where the government has invested money in a diversified asset portfolio (the Alaska Permanent Fund[39]) and distributed the earnings among the residents of the state for the better part of four decades. Namibia[40] launched a UBI pilot project[41] in 2009, followed a decade later by the city ofStockton, California[42]. And this year, Y Combinator[43]'s research arm \u2014 YC Research \u2014 will begin conducting a UBI study involving 3,000 people in partnership with the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center. Some of these programs have achieved success, but not all. Since the implementation of Alaska's policy, the state has created more than 10,000 new jobs[44], and the Namibian government reports that its pilot resulted in an 18% dip in general poverty levels. However, participants in Finland's trial said[45] they weren't more likely to find work than before they started receiving payments. Still, Yang thinks that the dividend is '[t]he best way' to encourage entrepreneurship around the country. '[It] would enable more Americans to take risks, have a cushion, and be able to figure out what kind of work they want to do and what sort of work their community needs,' he said. 'I think managing the transition [to a more automated workforce] is one of the great projects of this age and that the U.S. in particular is behind the curve. [W]e have to get our act together.'

His top priority is to give people a right to own their personal data, enabling them to make money by sharing it with companies. That would be a huge shift from the current status quo where companies fully own users' data, giving them little control over how it's used. </p><p>Yang also wants to tackle issues like tech ethics, misinformation, algorithmic bias, and modernizing government regulators. Regulating the tech industry more tightly has become a key talking point among Democratic primary candidates. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[2] Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang[3] released his comprehensive plan to regulate the tech industry in a blog post Thursday. His top priority: establishing \"data as a property right,\" which would give people more control over their data and potentially enable them to make money when companies use it to power their products and services. That would be a major shift from how things work currently, where companies typically own any data generated by users, limiting their ability to restrict access to that data or earn any money off it. Yang made his case for data as a property right, a proposal he initially rolled out[4] in October, by pointing to the massive amount of data people create everyday and how companies have been able to monetize it, saying \"our data is now worth more than oil.\" \"By implementing measures to increase transparency in the data collection and monetization process, individuals can begin to reclaim ownership of what's theirs,\" Yang said in the plan. According to a report Yang cited[5], gathering and using Americans' personal data has become a $198 billion industry, and he argued that users haven't gotten enough in return. During a Democratic debate in October, Yang made a similar point[6], asking the audience: \"How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail? It got lost. It went to Facebook, Amazon, Google.\" Yang also proposed: Creating a government agency tasked with minimizing the \"health impacts of modern tech\" on people \u2014 particularly children. Taxing digital ads, regulating bot activity, and regulating algorithms to make spreading misinformation more costly and difficult. \"Addressing the grey area between publishers and platforms\" \u2014 that is, companies like Facebook and YouTube. Modernizing the government's approach to regulation so it can better respond to emerging technologies. Yang explained more about his views at a fundraiser in San Francisco this week[7], noting that tech executives like Elon Musk agree that the tech industry needs more regulation. Regulating the tech industry has become a popular talking point[8] among Democrats in the 2020 primary race, with candidates like Elizabeth Warren proposing breaking up tech giants.
