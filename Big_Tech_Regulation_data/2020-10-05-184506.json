For the past few weeks I've been cautiously optimistic. The virus is bad, but the economic damage looks far less than feared. We've seen economies, companies, and employment fare far less badly that predicted. I've even gone as far as to recently declare myself bullish on recovery prospects.. But, after a month of upside economic surprises, I sense the mood is beginning to change. </p><p>There is less talk of V shapes, and we are back to more discussion about inverted L-shapes stretching into 2021/22. Maybe its summer lethargy or the renewed outbreaks in the US? Or hangovers from the packed weekend pubs that is causing the negativity? Or, is just the realisation that although the pandemic has caused less damage than feared - it's still caused massive damage! France thinks it's had a great virus because its economy will only be 8% smaller! (And, on a relative basis, they might be right..!) Not that any re-assessment of recovery expectations seems to matter to stock markets! Next week we get the start of Q2 earnings season. A few weeks ago I was warning the Q2 numbers were likely to be brutally bad - revealing devasting negative results for many companies - and might trigger a correction. But now we have banks telling us the numbers season will surprise to the upside - Bank of America expects an 8% beat across the earnings season. That will please the Robinhood army.. Whoo Hoo! Fan these flames higher! Whoo Hoo! Buy stocks! Buy stocks! Alphabet (Google) has just joined the $1 trillion market cap club alongside Apple and Microsoft. Amazon tops the list and has just broken $3000 \u2014 up a real 121% since Dec 2018. The analysts are confused - they think it's an expensive stock, but predict Amazon going higher on the back of online activity and competitive streak. I'm a big fan of these big tech names - but are they really, really worth that much? Financial Asset inflation meansyes, probably for now. Although their stock prices have risen fast, (and benefited from stock buybacks fuelled by ultra-cheap debt, supported by Fed QE Infinity programmes buying their bonds), have these firms doubled productivity and profits in the last few months - like their stock prices would indicate? Er no. On the plus side, these companies make/sell good stuff that's genuinely valuable. Cloud services, steady service revenues, and good products make the difference. (When a Tesla fanboy tries to explain the $220 bln valuation of a car company that sells very few cars is because it's the 'Apple of the car market' then you want to reach for the little brown bag) Financial Asset Inflation is here to stay - for the medium term at least. I now have few expectations the world will wake up suddenly to say how overvalued stocks are. I'm less and less convinced there is going to be a sudden crash or stock market reset. Any dip, and buyers will swiftly emerge. I think we're in for a long-period of volatile markets with little real trading outside current ranges. Smart analysts know the ongoing overvaluation of stocks will continue to be supported by the search for yield and returns. When there are zero returns from bonds, then investors are drawn, like moths, to the stock markets. Wonder where all that QE money has gone? Look at some stock prices <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2020-07-07_5-03-56.jpg?itok=ERocbNVV\">https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2020-07-07_5-03-56.jpg?itok=ERocbNVV</url> Of course, there are massive risks in a stock market supported by QE infinity. It drives illusionary valuations - Tesla being just the most obvious. Where zombie companies are thriving because of limitless free debt, the basic functioning and discipline of markets is in trouble. It encourages the survival and even apparent success of implausible tulip-like names. Does that mean the whole stock market should be rising? Large numbers of dull, boring, predictable and profitable companies have underperformed the elite tech stocks. These are the ones to watch. The ones which have massively underperformed are financials. Why are bank stocks doing so badly? While the distortions caused by QE Infinity and Zero Interest rates have bounced Tech stocks and fantabulous hope-and-a-prayer-stocks, they have absolutely crushed the banking and finance sectors. As investors realise the downside for banks is worsening and savers discover their pension pots have been massively downgraded by financial asset inflation and diminished returns, the outlook for the whole sector is miserable. Part of the reason is the outlook - zero rates are bad news. But it's also due to the perception regulatory control and interference makes banks a zero-sum game. Its kind of ironic. 12 years ago, the authorities spent billions to keep the financial and banking sector alive. Today, its the most disliked sector. You know the sector is in trouble when the only positive bank investment scenario I can come up with is Deutsche Bank - basically because it's so big and important to Germany (which desperately needs to pretend everything is fine and dandy afrer Wirecard), then I know I'm struggling. DB is up 76% since March - largely on the basis it was so cheap and bad, it couldn't get any worse! The NASDAQ Bank Index is down 33% this year. The MSCI Europe Banks Index is even worse! When a Fed governor dissents from a decision to allow banks to pay dividends because she foresee massive banking challenges ahead When the Fed slaps massive additional capital requirements on Goldman because it thinks it knows more about the risks than the Vampyre Squid (unlikely) (Remember:the only thing worse for a bank than too little capital, is too much!) When the Fed is so embarrassed by its last stress test it effectively degraded them to a box-tick points exercise to test not resilience, but how good their compliance is - then we're all in trouble. OK - so the timing in the middle of pandemic didn't help. What we got was full information on how US banks would perform in a totally imaginary downside scenario, while they were actually in the throes of a completely different and much more severe real time event. Meanwhile, European dividends have been stopped. I really can't see much upside investing in European banks, including these in the UK. Zero interest rates (or soon to be negative interest rates) kill opportunities for banks to earn margin and force them to undercharge for credit risk. The continental banks variously remain riddled with Non Performing Loans (NPLs), unclear derivative exposures, or a questionable attitude to money laundering. Most banks are now run as de facto bureaucracies - answering to regulator and compliance committees rather than business imperatives. They will manage lending to meet capital ratios set by regulators by cutting lending rather than innovating new ways to allocate capital to clients. Few management boards are thinking about how to improve customers service, or expansion into the opportunities Coronavirus present - they are all far more concerned with hitting capital ratios, making sure they pass pointless stress tests, or avoid failing KYC tests. Ask any high street bank for a loan, a mortgage or an overdraft, and they are unwilling - customers are getting in the way of the Coronavirus response, which essentially amounts to shutting down risk business. 15 years ago the most 'successful' high street banks were seen as dull, boring, and predictable dividend stocks. The global financial crisis of 2008 put an end to that. Only HSBC emerged with any kind of honour. Most banks were rescued, and Barclay's resorted to - well the courts haven't proved it was legal yet - capital chicanery to keep itself solvent. The final straw for the High Street Banks might have already been written. The State Capture of HSBC by the Chinese may be the final chapter. Its been forced to kowtow over Hong Kong, support Chinese security laws and to lobby for Huawei. Its completely compromised, and it's still entirely possible they will be closed out of Hong Kong if the UK isn't seen to support Xi - which might be why Boris hasn't singled out China in his latest sanctions list. Is there such a thing as a European Champion bank? Not really. But, maybe one is investible.  Deutsche Bank is rightly regarded as a disaster story of mismanagement, decline and undelivered hopes and promises. However, it's now the only German banking champion. Could Europe's worst bank could be its best?

Ongoing data breaches, and the revelations surrounding the Cambridge Analytica scandal, have raised concerns about who owns our data, and how it is being used and shared.  Tech companies have vowed to do better. Following his grilling by both the US Congress and the EU Parliament, Facebook CEO, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>said Facebook will change the way it shares data with third party suppliers. </p><p>There is some evidence that this is occurring, particularly with advertisers.  But have tech companies really changed their ways? After all, data is now a primary asset in the modern economy.  To find whether there\u2019s been a significant realignment between community expectations and corporate behaviour, we analysed the data ethics principles and initiatives that various global organisations have committed since the various scandals broke.  What we found is concerning. Some of the largest organisations have not demonstrably altered practices, instead signing up to ethics initiatives that are neither enforced nor enforceable. How we tracked this information  Before discussing our findings, some points of clarification.  Firstly, the issues of data, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and algorithms are difficult to draw apart, and their scope is contested. In fact, for most of these organisations, the concepts are lumped together, while for researchers and policy makers they present distinctly different challenges.  For example, machine learning, while a branch of AI, is about building machines to learn on their own without supervision. As such, policy makers must ensure that the machine learning algorithms are free from bias and take into consideration various social and economic issues, rather than treating everyone the same.  Secondly, the policies, statements and guidelines of the companies we looked at are not centrally located, consistently presented or simple to decipher.  Accounting for the lack of consistent approach to data ethics taken by technology companies, our method was to survey visible steps undertaken, and to look at the broad ethical principles embraced. Five broad categories of data ethics  Some companies, such as Microsoft, IBM, and Google, have published their own AI ethical principles.  More companies, including Facebook and Amazon, have opted to keep an arm\u2019s length approach to ethics by joining consortiums, such as Partnership on AI (PAI) and the Information and Technology Industry Council (ITI). These two consortiums have published statements containing ethical principles. The principles are voluntary, and have no reporting requirements, objective standards or oversight.  We examined the content of the published ethical guidelines of these companies and consortiums, and found the principles fell into five broad categories.      Privacy: privacy is widely acknowledged as an area of importance, highlighting that the focus for most of these organisations is a traditional consumer/supplier relationship. That is, the data provided by the consumers is now owned by the company, who will use this data, but respect confidentiality     governance: these principles are about accountability in data management, ensuring quality and accuracy of data, and the ethical application of algorithms. The focus here is on the internal processes that should be followed     fairness: fairness means using data and algorithms in a way that respects the person behind the data. That means taking safety into consideration, and recognising the impact the use of data can have on people\u2019s lives. This includes a recognition of how algorithms relying on historical data or flawed programming can discriminate against marginalised communities     shared benefit: this refers to the idea that data is owned by those that produce it and, as such, there should be joint control of the data, as well as shared benefits. We noted a lack of consensus or intention to adhere to this category     transparency: it is here that a more nuanced understanding of data ownership begins to emerge. Transparency essentially refers to being open about the way data is collected and used, as well as eschewing unnecessary data collection. Given the commercial imperative of companies to protect confidential research and development, it\u2019s not surprising this principle is only acknowledged by a handful of players.  Initiatives big tech companies have signed up to in particular categories of data ethics. Author provided Fairness and transparency is important  Our research suggests conversations about data ethics are largely focused on privacy and governance. But these principles are the minimum expected in a legal framework. If anything, the scandals of the past have shown us this is not enough.  Facebook is notable as company keeping an arm\u2019s length approach to ethics. It\u2019s a member of Partnership on AI and Information and Technology Industry Council, but has eschewed publication of its own data ethics principles. And while there have been rumblings about a so-called \u201cFairness Flow\u201d machine learning bias detector, and rumours of an ethics team at Facebook, details for either of these developments are sketchy.  Meanwhile, the extent to which Partnership on AI and Information and Technology Industry Council influence the behaviour of member companies is highly questionable. The Partnership on AI, which has more than 70 members, was formed in 2016, but it has yet to demonstrate any tangible outcomes beyond the publication of key tenets. Better regulation is required  For tech companies, there may be a trade-off between treating data ethically and how much money they can make from that data. There is also a lack of consensus between companies about what the correct ethical approach looks like. So, in order to protect the public, external guidance and oversight is needed.  Unfortunately, the government has currently kept its focus in the new Australian Government Data Sharing and Release Legislation on privacy \u2013 a principle that\u2019s covered in legislation elsewhere.  The data related events of the last few years have confirmed we need a greater focus on data as a citizen right, not just a consumer right. As such, we need greater focus on fairness, transparency and shared benefit \u2013 all areas which are currently being neglected by companies and government alike.

Oh, and China is going to zoom past the U.S.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the 20th year the Churchill Club, a 32-year-old thought leadership organization based in San Jose but which offers its programs throughout the Bay Area, has looked at coming tech trends. Scroll down for the full list of 2018 predictions from five venture capitalists and watch the full program at this video. Thanks to the Churchill Club for providing this content.</p><p>1. The new space stack will enable extraterrestrial commerce</p><p>David Cowan, Bessemer Venture Partners: After holding back Moore's Law for 50 years, the space industry is being turned upside down by a new ecosystem of startups developing microsat constellations that replace mainframe-like systems at 1 percent of the cost, with planetary coverage and higher resilience. Companies in tourism, mining, communications, manufacturing, agriculture, energy, defense, media and more will buy the tech and services they need off-the-shelf to operate extraterrestrial fleets.</p><p>2. Move fast and change everything</p><p>Sarah Guo, Greylock Partners: From self-driving trucks to electric scooters, every segment of the multitrillion-dollar transportation industry is being invented or reinvented, and the unexpected impact on our infrastructure and our lives will be massive.</p><p>3. Voice first will open up Internet to the world</p><p>Nicole Quinn, Lightspeed Venture Partners: We are trying to bring the world online. However, 25 percent of the adult population are illiterate so the way to bring them online will be voice first.</p><p>4. The hunt for authenticity</p><p>Tomasz Tunguz, Redpoint Ventures: Deep learning enables computers to synthesize voice indistinguishable from humans and generate photographs that look real. Plus computers enable disinformation at greater scale than ever (election, net neutrality debate). Determining authenticity will be an important growth area.</p><p>5. China accelerates past the U.S. in key technology areas</p><p>Mike Vernal, Sequoia Capital: If you want to have an MRI read today, you might want to fly to China. Deep learning can help radiologists better diagnose cancers, but it'll be years before that technology is widespread in the US. It's already deployed and scaling in China. The strong alignment between the Chinese government and technology ecosystem, combined with a national focus on key technologies like AI and autonomous vehicles, means that China will become the global leader in these core technologies.</p><p>6. High-density AI promises conversational bots smart enough to disrupt mobile commerce\u00a0</p><p>Cowan: High-density AI will break up NLP into narrow domains that neural networks can master, enabling a generation of conversational bots who can reliably satisfy consumer needs without human intervention. With intuitiveness and immediacy, these bots will displace mobile apps as the dominant UI for computing, disrupting the entire consumer internet economy.\u00a0</p><p>7. The all-seeing eye\u00a0</p><p>Guo: Cheap and smart cameras with computer vision algorithms are blanketing the world. New smart camera apps, from your face unlocking your phone to Amazon Go stores, will delight consumers. But this tracking of our every move will also remake expectations and regulation around surveillance.\u00a0</p><p>8. People will no longer distinguish between online and offline worlds\u00a0</p><p>Quinn: We've seen eCommerce and retail come together into omnichannel and experiential retail. We'll see the same for social, dating, media, fitness and everything else.\u00a0</p><p>9. Decentralization of data\u00a0</p><p>Tunguz: Today, all of our data is centralized in clouds controlled by a handful of data oligarchs. In the future, users will exert more control over their personal data and use a technology like the blockchain to do it.\u00a0</p><p>10. Robotics goes mainstream because of the AV gold rush\u00a0</p><p>Vernal: Thousands of engineers and billions of dollars are being poured into the race for an autonomous passenger vehicle. That investment will (a) massively drive down the price of key sensors and actuators, (b) 100x the pool of engineers trained in perception and planning, and (c) inspire tons of entrepreneurs in adjacent industries (trucking, construction, warehouse management, etc.). We will see a surge in autonomous robots replacing dangerous or laborious jobs across industries.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.churchillclub.org/\">For more from the Churchill Club, click here.</url></p><p>Did you find this article useful?

(Image credit: Baker McKenzie Habib Al Mulla)</p><p>The pandemic has impacted several industries such as transportation, hospitality and manufacturing but certain sectors like education, media and communication, government, healthcare, and retail aggressively accelerated their adoption of cloud.</p><p>According to research firm International Data Corporation, spending on public cloud services in the UAE is expected to grow 27.4% year on year in 2020 to reach over $400 million.</p><p>In terms of cloud deployment models, IDC said that infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) has seen significant growth during the crisis, with spending to increase 30% year on year in 2020 while the combined growth of both SaaS and PaaS is at 26.1% over the same period.</p><p>In Saudi Arabia, Khaled Zowayed, Senior Lawyer at Baker McKenzie, said that leases have been the most common model applied for the transactions and this could be due to the restrictions on foreign ownership compared to the generally unregulated leasing market.</p><p>Khaled Zowayed, Senior Lawyer at Baker McKenzie, said the leasing market in Saudi Arabia, generally, allows freedom of contract but there are restrictions from Sharia on passing on obligations that are typically landlord obligations such as structural repairs, ownership taxes and property insurance onto the tenant and these must be carefully navigated to achieve the commercial outcome desired. (Image credit: Baker McKenzie Habib Al Mulla)</p><p>Zowayed said the leasing market in Saudi Arabia, generally, allows freedom of contract but there are restrictions from Sharia on passing on obligations that are typically landlord obligations such as structural repairs, ownership taxes and property insurance onto the tenant and these must be carefully navigated to achieve the commercial outcome desired.</p><p>&amp;#x201C;There are also restrictions from Sharia on limiting future losses, indemnities and late payment penalties that often require standard form data centre agreements to be revisited,&amp;#x201D; he said.</p><p>Bahrain adopts a more liberal foreign ownership model than the UAE and Saudi Arabia, he said and this has led to AWS to announce its first availability zone in the Middle East.</p><p>&amp;#x201C;The structures available in Bahrain are therefore not restricted and can range from ownership, joint ventures and leasehold interests,&amp;#x201D; he said.</p><p>Industry experts chalk out the legal issues to consider when operating a data centre.</p><p>Customer contract</p><p>The Dubai Landlord and Tenant law prohibits a tenant (data centre operator) from subletting the premises without the prior approval of the landlord (data centre owner), unless or otherwise agreed between the parties.</p><p>As the data centre operator will normally have standard agreements with its customers, there must be an absolute right for the operator to enter into such contracts without the need for the data centre owner to approve each contract.</p><p>While explicit prohibitions do not necessarily exist in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, it is better if clear subleasing rights are provided in the underlying documents, if it is based on a leasehold structure.</p><p>Data protection</p><p>There is no federal standalone data protection law in the UAE, however, the data protection concepts are captured in various other laws and regulations.</p><p>Saudi Arabia does not have a standalone data protection law but the principles of privacy of information and personal data do exist in Sharia.</p><p>Bahrain has passed a personal data law recently and it exists along with other data protection provisions from other laws in the areas of banking, telecommunications and employment. A new Personal Data Protection Authority is also to be established in accordance with the law with inspection rights to ensure compliance.</p><p>There are, however, some sector-specific data protection obligations that exist in regulations about certain sectors, including cybersecurity, telecommunications, and employment. Careful consideration should be given to each of these regulations as well as the basic principles derived from Sharia that protect personal and private information.</p><p>Both the data centre owner and operator should also consider the implications of the EU General Data Protection Regulation which captures the transfer and use of personal data outside of the EU (including Middle East).</p><p>Regulatory compliance</p><p>Regulatory and licensing requirements are an important consideration for both data centre owners and operators, and each should ensure that they fully understand the position.</p><p>The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) is the body responsible for governing the sector in the UAE.</p><p>Ensuring compliance with the security requirements, as imposed by the National Electronic Security Authority, is also a mandatory requirement.</p><p>In Saudi Arabia, the Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) regulates data centres while there is no single regulator for data centres in Bahrain.</p><p>A careful approach to full compliance with all applicable regulations, in relation to doing business and commercial registration, must be carefully considered in all of these jurisdictions.</p><p>Service level agreement&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Service level agreements (SLAs) are commonly used in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, like they are used elsewhere in the globe, and are typically incorporated into the lease agreement by way of a schedule.</p><p>The data centre operator should ensure that the services that will be provided by the owner and/or the facility manager are acceptable (including the power availability, temperature, network infrastructure, commitments and maintenance).</p><p>Termination</p><p>The agreements governing the relationship between the data centre owner and the operator will typically address the circumstances within which the owner and operator can terminate their relationship.</p><p>Most agreements in the region have very limited termination rights in favour of a data centre operator. While this recommendation appears obvious, the importance of carefully reading the draft agreements between the parties before signing the final form cannot be overemphasised.</p><p>Governing law and disputes</p><p>The parties should pay particular attention to the governing law provisions of the agreement and the forum to which disputes should be referred.</p><p>Generally, parties entering into contracts in the UAE are entitled to opt for a foreign law to govern the relationship - however, this is not the case for matters pertaining to a property located in the UAE.</p><p>Local law dictates that property located in the UAE is a matter of public policy and the &amp;apos;laws of the land&amp;apos; must govern the agreement between the parties.</p><p>Any disputes over the lease agreement in Dubai should be referred to the Rental Dispute Settlement Centre at the Dubai Land Department. There is controversy around the arbitrability of real estate disputes in Dubai, as real estate is an area that has been regarded by the UAE courts as a public order matter.</p><p>Similar provisions also apply in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, if the subject matter of the agreement is real estate in the country. However, if the underlying agreement relates to services or any other aspect of the data centre other than specifically real estate, foreign governing law provisions are generally permitted.</p><p>The ordinary courts settle leasing disputes in both these jurisdictions.</p><p>Damages</p><p>While some agreements include a pre-agreed sum of damages in the event of termination without cause, most lease type agreements do not.</p><p>In the latter case, this does not usually mean that there are no damages payable but actually that a wronged party may be able to claim damages in the amount of the full fees they would have received had the agreements not been unlawfully terminated. The governing law provision is also a key consideration when quantifying damages as different jurisdictions have varying positions on the ability to award damages for future economic loss.</p><p>In the UAE, for example, damages are typically awarded based on the actual loss of the party claiming relief and while contractual provisions are likely to be generally applied by a Bahraini court.</p><p>In Saudi Arabia, regardless of the text of the contract, only direct and actual losses are usually awarded.</p><p>Only a third of CFOs in Mideast plan to make remote working a permanent option<br/>Lenovo&amp;#x2019;s mission is to solve challenges through intelligent transformation<br/>CFOs in UAE feel heat from financial impact of Covid-19 more than others in Middle East<br/>Future Publishing Limited Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TBREAK-178343752</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TBREAK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607N-Y9Y1-F11P-X40K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TBREAK MEDIA Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Yet if we asked them what branch of government should take the lead in adapting policy to a revolution in technology, they would say that\u2019s a job for Congress.</p><p>Alas, I reckon they would be gobsmacked by today\u2019s Congress, too. The August creation of Article I of the Constitution can\u2019t walk and chew gum at the same time. Often, Congress can\u2019t even walk.</p><p> Gridlock in Congress stalls all causes: the bitterly divisive ones and the vital nonpartisan ones, too. The mobile digital age presents pressing issues, from privacy to the price of broadband. But Congress does, basically, diddly.</p><p> So the need for action falls to the executive branch and the courts \u2014 both of them problematic.</p><p> Relying on executive-branch regulators can result in radically shifting rules of the road. As for the courts, their limitations will be on display soon after the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday over cellphone privacy.</p><p> You might not realize that your cellular provider keeps track of your travels even when you have your GPS switched off. Each call, text, email and alert that enters or leaves your phone must pass through a nearby antenna.</p><p> In the case before the court, Timothy Carpenter\u2019s cellular provider supplied investigators a record of his smartphone\u2019s whereabouts. The pings placed Carpenter in the vicinity of several armed robberies in Ohio and Michigan. Now behind bars, he is asking the justices to find this a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be safe from warrantless searches of his private domain.</p><p> Lower courts ruled that pre-iPhone case law was adequate to uphold Carpenter\u2019s conviction. Under existing law, if a person passes information through another entity, the fact of the transaction is not private.</p><p> If you send a letter, for instance, the writing on the outside of the envelope can be read. If you dial a phone number, the fact of the call (though not its content) is information owned by the phone company. And the carrier can share that fact with police.</p><p> Carpenter\u2019s appeal is supported by big tech firms, leading civil liberties groups and digital privacy advocates.</p><p> And the problem doesn\u2019t stop with collection. The capacity to store nearly infinite amounts of data assures that our virtual trails will never go cold.</p><p> In such an intricate web of issues, the courts aren\u2019t well-suited to making policy. Their mandate is to decide the discrete legal questions presented one case at a time. A fully formed body of law from the bench may require decades of maturation through a series of cases.</p><p> Which brings us back to Congress \u2014 and, more hopefully, to state legislatures. The legislative branch is best equipped to define big issues, gather research, hold hearings, weigh competing interests and draft comprehensive reforms.</p><p> Lawmakers claim to resent judges who legislate from the bench \u2014 but they\u2019re making it a last resort.</p><p>           David Von Drehle is a Washington Post columnist.

But  internal documents released by the committee  after the hearing say plenty.    The release is a curated selection of the 1.3 million documents collected by the committee during its more than year-long investigation into competition concerns with the four tech giants. It includes emails and chat logs between executives at the four companies and with those they sought to acquire. It shows industry leaders strategizing ahead of decisions that would become turning points in the legacy of their businesses, like Facebook\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram or Amazon\u2019s decision to undercut prices for diapers to compete with Diapers.com.    The four companies turned over the documents at the request of the committee. But the huge trove of evidence is likely just a fraction of that which federal and state regulators have been poring over as they decide whether to bring an antitrust case against any of the tech giants. Google appears to be most immediately in danger of such an outcome as  The Wall Street Journal  reported earlier this year that the Justice Department is gearing up to announce an antitrust case as soon as this summer.    In some cases, regulators may have had these documents before, like when requesting more information on a potential deal. Alicia Batts, a partner in the antitrust and competition practice at Squire Patton Boggs, said it\u2019s not uncommon for \u201cbad documents\u201d to surface in a merger investigation.    \u201cIt\u2019s an indication to look deeper but not necessarily an indication you won\u2019t be able to close [the deal],\u201d she said in an interview this week with CNBC. \u201cWhen you have both documents that show a company is planning to harm competition and the economic data or the economic model support that it\u2019s possible, that\u2019s when the documents are given the most weight.\u201d    CNBC dug through the hundreds of pages released by the House Judiciary Committee last week to find the most revealing details laid bare in the companies\u2019 private correspondences.     Here are the most notable finds and what they could mean for a potential antitrust case against each company.   Facebook   What an antitrust case could look like:  Experts speculate that an antitrust case against Facebook would center largely around its acquisition strategy and whether it broke merger laws by buying up a nascent competitor or violated anti-monopoly law by taking anti-competitive actions to build or maintain dominance in its market.    Most interesting finds:  The most compelling documents released by the committee on Facebook reveal top executives\u2019 thinking behind its acquisition of Instagram, one of the two deals that are now thought to have played a key role in Facebook\u2019s continued growth, along with its acquisition of WhatsApp. Some enforcement advocates, like  Columbia Law Professor Tim Wu , believe that had those apps not been acquired at an early stage, they could have grown into formidable competitors against Facebook.    -  Facebook executives feared decelerating engagement prior to the Instagram deal: Executives fretted about Facebook\u2019s relatively weak offerings on mobile, where Instagram had built its growing userbase.     \u201cWe have this big issue right now because gaming is shifting from us to mobile platforms,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in one April 2012 email. \u201cIt\u2019s causing all this negative momentum in a bunch of ways around gamer overall user engagement, ad spend from gamers, overall revenue, etc.\u201d     -  Facebook executives appeared threatened by Instagram\u2019s growth in 2012: Zuckerberg acknowledged the threat posed by Instagram in conversations with his deputies. In February 2012, Zuckerberg wrote in an email to his then-CFO David Ebersman he was considering how much Facebook should be \u201cwilling to pay to acquire mobile app companies like Instagram and Path that are building networks that are competitive with our own.\u201d He said that while those competitors have small teams, they have shown fast growth and even if they don\u2019t want to sell, a high enough price may change their minds.     \u201cThe businesses are nascent but the networks are established, the brands are already meaningful and if they grow to a large scale they could be disruptive to us,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.     In April 2012, he told one employee in an email, \u201cInstagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business though. For the others, if they become big we\u2019ll just regret not doing them.\u201d     -  Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom feared Zuckerberg entering \u201cdestroy mode\u201d if he didn\u2019t sell:  As Zuckerberg began to court Instagram for a potential deal, Systrom messaged one of his investors, Benchmark Partner Matt Cohler, in February 2012 for advice on how to politely rebuff an offer. Systrom seemed adamant in wanting to stay independent to see how far he could take Instagram on his own. But he wanted Cohler\u2019s advice on whether Zuckerberg would \u201cgo into destroy mode\u201d if he rejected an offer.     \u2033[P]robably,\u201d Cohler responded, \u201d(and probably if we just don\u2019t engage at all).\u201d    As they strategized the best response, Systrom acknowledged, \u201cbottom line I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever escape the wrath of mark haha\u201d    Later on, messages between Systrom and Zuckerberg leading up to their agreement to merge shed light on what Instagram had to fear if they were to go it alone.    \u201cOf course, at the same time we\u2019re developing our own photos strategy,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote, \u201cso how we engage now will also determine how much we\u2019re partners vs competitors down the line.\u201d    What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Even if regulators believe Facebook executives were afraid of the potential rise of Instagram and WhatsApp, it may not be enough to accuse them of violating merger law. To prove that Facebook violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act through those acquisitions, the FTC may have to prove not only that Instagram and WhatsApp were capable of growing into competitors to Facebook on their own, but also that they were one of the very few firms that were committed to getting into Facebook\u2019s market and capable of doing so.    \u201cWhat that means is, if at the time of the acquisition it looks as if Instagram was just one of many nascent folks nibbling at the heels of Facebook, the case law makes it very hard for the government to block that kind of an acquisition,\u201d said Bill Baer, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who formerly led the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition and DOJ Antitrust Division during Democratic administrations.    A Facebook spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that the company had submitted the documents included in the Judiciary Committee file in its disclosure to the FTC in 2012 when the agency reviewed Facebook\u2019s proposed acquisition of Instagram. That indicates the FTC determined at the time that those statements did not preclude the merger when weighed against economic models predicting the companies\u2019 future success.    But looking back is often easier than looking forward. Showing a pattern of anti-competitive acquisitions or other behavior could potentially help build a case against Facebook under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the anti-monopoly law, or Section 5 of the  FTC Act , which grants what some believe to be broader power to the regulator.    Section 5 empowers the FTC to prevent companies from engaging in \u201cunfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\u201d    \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about Section 5, it\u2019s not just [the] Sherman and Clayton Act, but it\u2019s kind of the spirit of the antitrust laws,\u201d said Batts, the Squire Patton Boggs partner.    This could also be an issue the House Judiciary Committee tackles with its legislative proposals expected to follow the conclusion of its probe. Lawmakers may determine the bar is too high to decide a deal is anti-competitive and adjust the language to make it easier for authorities to bring a case on such grounds.     Facebook did not provide a comment on the documents.   Amazon   What an antitrust case could look like:  An antitrust case for Amazon may resemble the line of thinking Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offered in her  presidential campaign platform  on breaking up Big Tech. Warren argued large tech companies designated as \u201cPlatform Utilities\u201d should not be able to control and participate on their own platforms. The FTC has been talking to third-party sellers on Amazon\u2019s platform, according to  Bloomberg , following concerns that Amazon undercuts sellers on its marketplace.    A recent  Wall Street Journal investigation  found that Amazon employees had used internal data to inform their private-label brand strategy and compete with other sellers. Though the employees reportedly used aggregated reports combining multiple sellers\u2019 performance, they sometimes contained as few as two sellers, making it easy to extrapolate a single seller\u2019s data. Amazon has said it was launching an internal investigation into the allegations by the Journal, but said it didn\u2019t believe the claims to be true.    Most Interesting finds:  Amazon\u2019s internal emails mostly shed light on the company\u2019s acquisition mindset and pricing strategy to compete with Diapers.com before it acquired its parents company.    -  Amazon undercut Diapers.com\u2019s prices before buying it: A top executive, then-vice president of worldwide corporate development Douglas Booms, identified Diapers.com as Amazon\u2019s \u201d#1 short term competitor\u201d in a 2009 email. \u201cAs I\u2019ve mentioned to each of you, I think, we need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost,\u201d Booms wrote.    Over the next year, Amazon began operating its diaper business at a loss, a  profit and loss statement shows , offset by other segments of the baby business.     Once executives learned Diapers.com\u2019s parent company, Quidsi, was planning to launch a new vertical, Soap.com, executives crafted a plan to keep it at bay.    \u201cWe have already initiated a more aggressive \u2018plan to win\u2019 against diapers.com in the diaper/baby space, which includes market leading pricing on diapers (\u201cdouble your SNS discount to 30% off diapers and wipes\u201d), a free PRIME offering for new Moms, and a structured and marketed \u2018Amazon Mom\u201d program,\u2019\u201d said Doug Herrington, then-VP of consumables at Amazon. \u201cTo the extent this plan undercuts the core diapers business for diapers.com, it will slow the adoption of soap.com.\u201d    Amazon announced in 2010 its move to buy  Quidsi in a reported $545 million deal , only to  shut down the business in 2017  after Amazon said it failed to become profitable.    -  Bezos planned to buy \u201cmarket position - not technology\u201d with Amazon\u2019s Ring acquisition: CEO Jeff Bezos acknowledged in an email to executives in 2017 that he wantedto buy doorbell security camera system Ring to solidify market position.     \u201cTo be clear, my view here is that we\u2019re buying market position - not technology,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cAnd that market position and momentum is very valuable.\u201d     What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Regulators could use the Diapers.com documents to argue that Amazon engaged in predatory pricing to eliminate a competitor. But doing so is not as easy as showing it discounted goods below its costs, which is a standard competitive practice in some cases and could be considered beneficial for consumers if it results in sustained lower prices.    The FTC  says on its website  that while prices can at times be \u201ctoo low,\u201d this doesn\u2019t happen often.    \u201cConsumers are harmed only if below-cost pricing allows a dominant competitor to knock its rivals out of the market and then raise prices to above-market levels for a substantial time,\u201d the agency says. \u201cA firm\u2019s independent decision to reduce prices to a level below its own costs does not necessarily injure competition, and, in fact, may simply reflect particularly vigorous competition.\u201d    Baer, the former federal antitrust enforcer, said laws prohibiting predatory pricing are not meant to discourage price competition. But discounting could lend way to anti-competitive practices when a firm later has the ability to raise prices after eliminating its rival.      \u201cIf you are pricing below an appropriate measure of your cost for the purpose of injuring a competitor and you have the ability to recoup those losses once your competitor is out of business or retreats from its discounting practices, that is potentially an antitrust violation,\u201d Baer said.    Still, the documents released by the committee so far don\u2019t shed much light on what could become the true focus of an antitrust investigation: how Amazon competes with sellers on its platform. That doesn\u2019t mean those documents don\u2019t exist, though, or that regulators aren\u2019t learning more about those relationships in their interviews with competitors and insiders.    Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.   Apple    What an antitrust case could look like:  The antitrust theory against Apple centers on its control of the App Store. While iPhones are prevalent throughout the U.S., Apple only ranks third in worldwide market share for smartphones at 13.3%, according to  IDC , while the market leader Samsung holds a 21.2% share.    A potential case against Apple could look similar to one against Amazon, focusing on the fact that it both owns a marketplace (the App Store) and has its own pre-loaded apps like Apple Music and Apple Podcasts that compete with other apps on its platform, like  Spotify .    Some developers who offer their apps through the App Store \u2014 the only way Apple allows for apps to be added to users\u2019 devices \u2014 have complained about Apple\u2019s opaque and sometimes seemingly arbitrary process for accepting new apps.    Most recently, the  founders of Basecamp complained that Apple unfairly rejected their new email app , Hey. Apple had originally claimed it did not meet standards in an early version because it did not offer a way for users to make an account through the app, which would require the developers to give Apple a 30% cut of iOS sign-ups in the first year. An updated version of the app was later approved.    Spotify has been among the most vocal opponents of what it\u2019s dubbed the \u201cApple Tax,\u201d the 15% to 30% cut Apple takes for payments processed through apps offered on the App Store. Apple claims the commission covers the cost of running the App Store, but developers have complained that the cost can be prohibitively high and Apple does not provide alternative payment methods. The  European Commission recently announced two antitrust probes  into Apple\u2019s App Store and Apple Pay.    Most Interesting finds:  The documents released paint a picture that Apple\u2019s rules around its App Store may not be as rigid as the company has repeatedly insisted they are.    - Apple executives discussed exceptions to how it applied its App Store rules:  Faced with criticism over its opaque enforcement of App Store rules, Apple has publicly stated that it approaches enforcement consistently.     \u201cWe apply the rules to all developers evenly,\u201d CEO Tim Cook testified at the antitrust subcommittee hearing last week.     But internal emails released by the Judiciary Committee show that Apple has at times loosened its rules for some developers. In 2016, for example, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in an email that Apple had  agreed to taking only a 15% cut of revenue for customers who sign up for Amazon Prime Video in their iOS app  and no cut for already-subscribed customers.     Although it\u2019s unclear from the emails what terms the companies ended up acting on, Cue\u2019s promise is different from what Apple typically says it charges developers: a 30% cut of in-app purchase revenue in the first year and 15% every year after for recurring subscriptions.    -  Apple\u2019s evolving stance on parental control apps frustrated developers, including big brands like T-Mobile: Several emails included in the release revolve around developers and customers complaining about Apple\u2019s enforcement of rules for parental control apps. Apple cracked down on several such apps last year, as  The New York Times  reported, coinciding with the announcement of Apple\u2019s own feature to track screen time. Apple said at the time the removal of the apps was based on the discovery that they could gain too much access to information on users\u2019 devices and it was unrelated to the screen time feature launch. In an email responding to a concerned user, Apple\u2019s App Store boss Phil Schiller said the technology used to control devices \u201cis not intended to enable a developer to have access to and control over consumers\u2019 data and devices, but the apps we removed from the store did just that.\u201d    Back in 2018, then- T-Mobile  COO Mike Sievert emailed Schiller complaining about its FamilyMode app being removed from the App Store after back and forth with Apple about getting it into compliance. Schiller ended up offering to reinstate the app on the platform for two weeks while T-Mobile worked to remedy the alleged violations.    Apple later loosened its restrictions on parental control apps, causing further frustration for some. One developer complained to Apple executives they had spent $30,000 to retool their parental control app with the guidance of Apple employees only to later find the rule was changed, presumably in such a way that it would not have had to make that investment. Responses from Apple executives to the developer were not included in the documents released.    -  Even some Apple employees seemed confused by the company\u2019s policies:   In a couple emails, Apple executives seemed unclear on the company\u2019s rules or at least acknowledged the ambiguity around its policies.    Emails between PR executives in 2019 showed those tasked with communicating Apple\u2019s views on right to repair legislation were unclear on the company\u2019s stance. The proposals aimed to make it easier for consumers and third-parties to find and offer repair services outside of the manufacturer.    \u201cRight now, it\u2019s pretty clear things are happening in a vacuum and there is not an overall strategy,\u201d then-director of corporate communications Lori Lodes wrote in a 2019 email. \u201cPlus, with one hand we are making these changes and the other is actively fighting Right to Repair legislation moving in 20 states without real coordination for how updated policies could be used to leverage our position.\u201d    In another instance, then-senior product manager for AR and VR Cameron Rogers told Schiller in a 2019 email that it was unclear to him and others within Apple why a particular gaming app was not included on the App Store.    \u201cIt still isn\u2019t obvious to people inside the company that work directly on the App Store. I think few people understand the subtleties of the rules as well as you do,\u201d Rogers wrote.    -  Executives sought to draw a distinction between Google and Apple in arguing it should not be a target of Warren\u2019s push to break up Big Tech:  Top PR officials at Apple sought to separate their brand from Google\u2019s as they discussed how best to respond to Warren\u2019s platform of breaking up Big Tech.    Apple\u2019s former VP of Communications Steve Dowling wrote to his team last year that arguments against Warren\u2019s platform should seek to show Apple is not a monopolist \u201cthat\u2019s shown by market share\u201d and emphasize, \u201cHow do we handle competition with our own apps? We don\u2019t do things like pushing down results, etc., as Google (one of her real targets) has.\u201d The charge seems to refer to allegations that Google prioritizes its own features in search results or stacks ads at the top of the page. Google has denied unfairly disadvantaging websites in its search product.    What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Regulators could seek to prove that Apple applies its App Store rules disproportionately to disadvantage rivals. However, they\u2019d likely need to make a credible case that Apple\u2019s decisions are fueled at least in part by an attempt to preference its own services, rather than consumer protection issues it claims to champion. Still, if regulators can show Apple inconsistently applied its rules across developers and made better terms for some for its own business reasons, it could face serious scrutiny.    Apple did not provide a comment on the emails.   Google   What an antitrust case could look like:  Google\u2019s sprawling business has attracted antitrust scrutiny on multiple fronts. Regulators have looked into Google\u2019s search business, online advertising platform and Android mobile operating system. Here\u2019s what they might be looking for in each:    - Search: Vertical search competitors like  Yelp  and  TripAdvisor , which offer search engines for specific purposes like local businesses or travel, have complained for years that Google prioritizes its own services over their own, like by offering its own competing services above theirs in relevant Google search results.    The FTC has investigated Google\u2019s search practices in the past and in 2013, its commissioners unanimously voted to close the investigation. An internal report later obtained by the  Journal  showed that FTC staff had recommended bringing a case against Google on multiple grounds, though they recommended against a lawsuit over allegations Google favored its own vertical search features over competitors\u2019 even though staff said its actions resulted in \u201csignificant harm\u201d to rivals.    - Advertising:  Google\u2019s advertising business has attracted scrutiny over a variety of concerns that essentially boil down to the question of whether Google\u2019s expansive control over the digital media supply chain allows other companies to compete. While Google has competitors across many functions of the advertising marketplace, it operates in both the buy-side and sell-side of transactions, leading to some questions about whether it remains objective about where it routes advertising dollars. Competitors also argue that Google\u2019s prices are hard to match because it bundles its ad tools. And on YouTube, Google eliminated the ability to buy ads through third-party services, funneling all spend through its own tools.    - Android:   Finally, with its Android mobile operating system, Google requires device manufacturers who use its platform to pre-install its app store and other native apps like Gmail and its Chrome web browser. The European Commission required Google to stop bundling its apps on Android phones and allow allow EU users to select their default search engine after  fining the company $5 billion  over alleged antitrust abuse.    Most Interesting finds:  The internal emails released show how Google executives considered the ways they could position various aspects of the business to become most integral to their users\u2019 lives.    -  Executives recognized threats from social media platforms and vertical search competitors and aimed to draw users to their own offerings:  The documents show Google\u2019s fixation on being the leader in search. In a report about how the company would stay ahead in search in 2007, Google said it should \u201cTurn having the largest user base into an unfair advantage by building out tech that improves linearly with user base size.\u201d     The report recognized MySpace \u201cas the clear leader\u201d in people search and social networking at the time. It noted that sites like MySpace and YouTube \u201cwill ultimately represent a threat to our search business as people will spend more time on those sites and ultimately may do most searches from the search boxes available there. They aren\u2019t direct competitors, but they may displace us in end-user time tradeoff.\u201d    \u201cIn the future, we do not want users [to] \u2018myspace\u2019 people for more information. Google should host all information about a person, including myspace info,\u201d the report later states.    In 2012, executives discussed their strategy around vertical search, where competitors like Yelp and  Booking.com  had taken hold. Jeff Huber, a senior vice president who led location services and commerce at the time, explained in an email why he believed it was important to have a presence in verticals like travel and shopping.    \u2033[I]f we don\u2019t have experiences in these areas that are compelling compared to increasingly concentrated branded alternatives, we risk losing relevance overall (e.g., Amazon is increasingly becoming the place you search for things and Google is the place you search for information).\u201d    Still, then-SVP of Knowledge Alan Eustace warned, \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to fight amazon on their turf by building and branding a single purpose experience by a separate team. The same goes for Yelp and Local.\u201d Instead, he advocated for an interface that works across several verticals.    -  Executives saw a potential deal with YouTube as a way to prevent Yahoo from buying it:   As Google executives pondered whether to buy YouTube, one key consideration appeared to be thwarting Yahoo from snatching up the video service.    Huber, the SVP of geo and commerce at the time, wrote in a 2005 email, \u201cI think we should talk to them, if nothing else to make it more expensive for Yahoo. They\u2019ll also eventually need a monetization/ads model, so we should use ours instead of anything from Yahoo (if they don\u2019t go acquisition soon, and we maintain reasonable relations with them).\u201d    Still, then-Group Product Manager Peter Chane wrote that there would be plenty of other acquisition targets for Yahoo to aim for.     \u2033[I]f we pick them up it would be defensive vs yahoo but there are 20 more sites like this that yahoo could go and buy,\u201d he wrote at the time.    Google ended up buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion.    What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Like the documents released for the other companies, it is hard to point to any email as a smoking gun. But if regulators were to build an antitrust case against Google, documents like these could be used to show patterns in Google\u2019s competitive strategy, like buying a company to prevent a rival from doing it first or building and prioritizing native tools on its search engine platform to keep users from clicking away to competitors\u2019 websites.    Google did not provide a comment on the emails, but a spokesperson downplayed the company\u2019s dominance in search, saying Amazon gets more searches for consumer products than Google does, for example.    -CNBC\u2019s  Jessica Bursztynsky ,  Michelle Gao  and  J.R.

But  internal documents released by the committee  after the hearing say plenty.    The release is a curated selection of the 1.3 million documents collected by the committee during its more than year-long investigation into competition concerns with the four tech giants. It includes emails and chat logs between executives at the four companies and with those they sought to acquire. It shows industry leaders strategizing ahead of decisions that would become turning points in the legacy of their businesses, like Facebook\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram or Amazon\u2019s decision to undercut prices for diapers to compete with Diapers.com.    The four companies turned over the documents at the request of the committee. But the huge trove of evidence is likely just a fraction of that which federal and state regulators have been poring over as they decide whether to bring an antitrust case against any of the tech giants. Google appears to be most immediately in danger of such an outcome as  The Wall Street Journal  reported earlier this year that the Justice Department is gearing up to announce an antitrust case as soon as this summer.    In some cases, regulators may have had these documents before, like when requesting more information on a potential deal. Alicia Batts, a partner in the antitrust and competition practice at Squire Patton Boggs, said it\u2019s not uncommon for \u201cbad documents\u201d to surface in a merger investigation.    \u201cIt\u2019s an indication to look deeper but not necessarily an indication you won\u2019t be able to close [the deal],\u201d she said in an interview this week with CNBC. \u201cWhen you have both documents that show a company is planning to harm competition and the economic data or the economic model support that it\u2019s possible, that\u2019s when the documents are given the most weight.\u201d    CNBC dug through the hundreds of pages released by the House Judiciary Committee last week to find the most revealing details laid bare in the companies\u2019 private correspondences.     Here are the most notable finds and what they could mean for a potential antitrust case against each company.   Facebook   What an antitrust case could look like:  Experts speculate that an antitrust case against Facebook would center largely around its acquisition strategy and whether it broke merger laws by buying up a nascent competitor or violated anti-monopoly law by taking anti-competitive actions to build or maintain dominance in its market.    Most interesting finds:  The most compelling documents released by the committee on Facebook reveal top executives\u2019 thinking behind its acquisition of Instagram, one of the two deals that are now thought to have played a key role in Facebook\u2019s continued growth, along with its acquisition of WhatsApp. Some enforcement advocates, like  Columbia Law Professor Tim Wu , believe that had those apps not been acquired at an early stage, they could have grown into formidable competitors against Facebook.    -  Facebook executives feared decelerating engagement prior to the Instagram deal: Executives fretted about Facebook\u2019s relatively weak offerings on mobile, where Instagram had built its growing userbase.     \u201cWe have this big issue right now because gaming is shifting from us to mobile platforms,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in one April 2012 email. \u201cIt\u2019s causing all this negative momentum in a bunch of ways around gamer overall user engagement, ad spend from gamers, overall revenue, etc.\u201d     -  Facebook executives appeared threatened by Instagram\u2019s growth in 2012: Zuckerberg acknowledged the threat posed by Instagram in conversations with his deputies. In February 2012, Zuckerberg wrote in an email to his then-CFO David Ebersman he was considering how much Facebook should be \u201cwilling to pay to acquire mobile app companies like Instagram and Path that are building networks that are competitive with our own.\u201d He said that while those competitors have small teams, they have shown fast growth and even if they don\u2019t want to sell, a high enough price may change their minds.     \u201cThe businesses are nascent but the networks are established, the brands are already meaningful and if they grow to a large scale they could be disruptive to us,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.     In April 2012, he told one employee in an email, \u201cInstagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business though. For the others, if they become big we\u2019ll just regret not doing them.\u201d     -  Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom feared Zuckerberg entering \u201cdestroy mode\u201d if he didn\u2019t sell:  As Zuckerberg began to court Instagram for a potential deal, Systrom messaged one of his investors, Benchmark Partner Matt Cohler, in February 2012 for advice on how to politely rebuff an offer. Systrom seemed adamant in wanting to stay independent to see how far he could take Instagram on his own. But he wanted Cohler\u2019s advice on whether Zuckerberg would \u201cgo into destroy mode\u201d if he rejected an offer.     \u2033[P]robably,\u201d Cohler responded, \u201d(and probably if we just don\u2019t engage at all).\u201d    As they strategized the best response, Systrom acknowledged, \u201cbottom line I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever escape the wrath of mark haha\u201d    Later on, messages between Systrom and Zuckerberg leading up to their agreement to merge shed light on what Instagram had to fear if they were to go it alone.    \u201cOf course, at the same time we\u2019re developing our own photos strategy,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote, \u201cso how we engage now will also determine how much we\u2019re partners vs competitors down the line.\u201d    What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Even if regulators believe Facebook executives were afraid of the potential rise of Instagram and WhatsApp, it may not be enough to accuse them of violating merger law. To prove that Facebook violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act through those acquisitions, the FTC may have to prove not only that Instagram and WhatsApp were capable of growing into competitors to Facebook on their own, but also that they were one of the very few firms that were committed to getting into Facebook\u2019s market and capable of doing so.    \u201cWhat that means is, if at the time of the acquisition it looks as if Instagram was just one of many nascent folks nibbling at the heels of Facebook, the case law makes it very hard for the government to block that kind of an acquisition,\u201d said Bill Baer, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who formerly led the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition and DOJ Antitrust Division during Democratic administrations.    A Facebook spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that the company had submitted the documents included in the Judiciary Committee file in its disclosure to the FTC in 2012 when the agency reviewed Facebook\u2019s proposed acquisition of Instagram. That indicates the FTC determined at the time that those statements did not preclude the merger when weighed against economic models predicting the companies\u2019 future success.    But looking back is often easier than looking forward. Showing a pattern of anti-competitive acquisitions or other behavior could potentially help build a case against Facebook under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the anti-monopoly law, or Section 5 of the  FTC Act , which grants what some believe to be broader power to the regulator.    Section 5 empowers the FTC to prevent companies from engaging in \u201cunfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\u201d    \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about Section 5, it\u2019s not just [the] Sherman and Clayton Act, but it\u2019s kind of the spirit of the antitrust laws,\u201d said Batts, the Squire Patton Boggs partner.    This could also be an issue the House Judiciary Committee tackles with its legislative proposals expected to follow the conclusion of its probe. Lawmakers may determine the bar is too high to decide a deal is anti-competitive and adjust the language to make it easier for authorities to bring a case on such grounds.     Facebook did not provide a comment on the documents.   Amazon   What an antitrust case could look like:  An antitrust case for Amazon may resemble the line of thinking Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offered in her  presidential campaign platform  on breaking up Big Tech. Warren argued large tech companies designated as \u201cPlatform Utilities\u201d should not be able to control and participate on their own platforms. The FTC has been talking to third-party sellers on Amazon\u2019s platform, according to  Bloomberg , following concerns that Amazon undercuts sellers on its marketplace.    A recent  Wall Street Journal investigation  found that Amazon employees had used internal data to inform their private-label brand strategy and compete with other sellers. Though the employees reportedly used aggregated reports combining multiple sellers\u2019 performance, they sometimes contained as few as two sellers, making it easy to extrapolate a single seller\u2019s data. Amazon has said it was launching an internal investigation into the allegations by the Journal, but said it didn\u2019t believe the claims to be true.    Most Interesting finds:  Amazon\u2019s internal emails mostly shed light on the company\u2019s acquisition mindset and pricing strategy to compete with Diapers.com before it acquired its parents company.    -  Amazon undercut Diapers.com\u2019s prices before buying it: A top executive, then-vice president of worldwide corporate development Douglas Booms, identified Diapers.com as Amazon\u2019s \u201d#1 short term competitor\u201d in a 2009 email. \u201cAs I\u2019ve mentioned to each of you, I think, we need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost,\u201d Booms wrote.    Over the next year, Amazon began operating its diaper business at a loss, a  profit and loss statement shows , offset by other segments of the baby business.     Once executives learned Diapers.com\u2019s parent company, Quidsi, was planning to launch a new vertical, Soap.com, executives crafted a plan to keep it at bay.    \u201cWe have already initiated a more aggressive \u2018plan to win\u2019 against diapers.com in the diaper/baby space, which includes market leading pricing on diapers (\u201cdouble your SNS discount to 30% off diapers and wipes\u201d), a free PRIME offering for new Moms, and a structured and marketed \u2018Amazon Mom\u201d program,\u2019\u201d said Doug Herrington, then-VP of consumables at Amazon. \u201cTo the extent this plan undercuts the core diapers business for diapers.com, it will slow the adoption of soap.com.\u201d    Amazon announced in 2010 its move to buy  Quidsi in a reported $545 million deal , only to  shut down the business in 2017  after Amazon said it failed to become profitable.    -  Bezos planned to buy \u201cmarket position - not technology\u201d with Amazon\u2019s Ring acquisition: CEO Jeff Bezos acknowledged in an email to executives in 2017 that he wantedto buy doorbell security camera system Ring to solidify market position.     \u201cTo be clear, my view here is that we\u2019re buying market position - not technology,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cAnd that market position and momentum is very valuable.\u201d     What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Regulators could use the Diapers.com documents to argue that Amazon engaged in predatory pricing to eliminate a competitor. But doing so is not as easy as showing it discounted goods below its costs, which is a standard competitive practice in some cases and could be considered beneficial for consumers if it results in sustained lower prices.    The FTC  says on its website  that while prices can at times be \u201ctoo low,\u201d this doesn\u2019t happen often.    \u201cConsumers are harmed only if below-cost pricing allows a dominant competitor to knock its rivals out of the market and then raise prices to above-market levels for a substantial time,\u201d the agency says. \u201cA firm\u2019s independent decision to reduce prices to a level below its own costs does not necessarily injure competition, and, in fact, may simply reflect particularly vigorous competition.\u201d    Baer, the former federal antitrust enforcer, said laws prohibiting predatory pricing are not meant to discourage price competition. But discounting could lend way to anti-competitive practices when a firm later has the ability to raise prices after eliminating its rival.      \u201cIf you are pricing below an appropriate measure of your cost for the purpose of injuring a competitor and you have the ability to recoup those losses once your competitor is out of business or retreats from its discounting practices, that is potentially an antitrust violation,\u201d Baer said.    Still, the documents released by the committee so far don\u2019t shed much light on what could become the true focus of an antitrust investigation: how Amazon competes with sellers on its platform. That doesn\u2019t mean those documents don\u2019t exist, though, or that regulators aren\u2019t learning more about those relationships in their interviews with competitors and insiders.    Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.   Apple    What an antitrust case could look like:  The antitrust theory against Apple centers on its control of the App Store. While iPhones are prevalent throughout the U.S., Apple only ranks third in worldwide market share for smartphones at 13.3%, according to  IDC , while the market leader Samsung holds a 21.2% share.    A potential case against Apple could look similar to one against Amazon, focusing on the fact that it both owns a marketplace (the App Store) and has its own pre-loaded apps like Apple Music and Apple Podcasts that compete with other apps on its platform, like  Spotify .    Some developers who offer their apps through the App Store \u2014 the only way Apple allows for apps to be added to users\u2019 devices \u2014 have complained about Apple\u2019s opaque and sometimes seemingly arbitrary process for accepting new apps.    Most recently, the  founders of Basecamp complained that Apple unfairly rejected their new email app , Hey. Apple had originally claimed it did not meet standards in an early version because it did not offer a way for users to make an account through the app, which would require the developers to give Apple a 30% cut of iOS sign-ups in the first year. An updated version of the app was later approved.    Spotify has been among the most vocal opponents of what it\u2019s dubbed the \u201cApple Tax,\u201d the 15% to 30% cut Apple takes for payments processed through apps offered on the App Store. Apple claims the commission covers the cost of running the App Store, but developers have complained that the cost can be prohibitively high and Apple does not provide alternative payment methods. The  European Commission recently announced two antitrust probes  into Apple\u2019s App Store and Apple Pay.    Most Interesting finds:  The documents released paint a picture that Apple\u2019s rules around its App Store may not be as rigid as the company has repeatedly insisted they are.    - Apple executives discussed exceptions to how it applied its App Store rules:  Faced with criticism over its opaque enforcement of App Store rules, Apple has publicly stated that it approaches enforcement consistently.     \u201cWe apply the rules to all developers evenly,\u201d CEO Tim Cook testified at the antitrust subcommittee hearing last week.     But internal emails released by the Judiciary Committee show that Apple has at times loosened its rules for some developers. In 2016, for example, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in an email that Apple had  agreed to taking only a 15% cut of revenue for customers who sign up for Amazon Prime Video in their iOS app  and no cut for already-subscribed customers.     Although it\u2019s unclear from the emails what terms the companies ended up acting on, Cue\u2019s promise is different from what Apple typically says it charges developers: a 30% cut of in-app purchase revenue in the first year and 15% every year after for recurring subscriptions.    -  Apple\u2019s evolving stance on parental control apps frustrated developers, including big brands like T-Mobile: Several emails included in the release revolve around developers and customers complaining about Apple\u2019s enforcement of rules for parental control apps. Apple cracked down on several such apps last year, as  The New York Times  reported, coinciding with the announcement of Apple\u2019s own feature to track screen time. Apple said at the time the removal of the apps was based on the discovery that they could gain too much access to information on users\u2019 devices and it was unrelated to the screen time feature launch. In an email responding to a concerned user, Apple\u2019s App Store boss Phil Schiller said the technology used to control devices \u201cis not intended to enable a developer to have access to and control over consumers\u2019 data and devices, but the apps we removed from the store did just that.\u201d    Back in 2018, then- T-Mobile  COO Mike Sievert emailed Schiller complaining about its FamilyMode app being removed from the App Store after back and forth with Apple about getting it into compliance. Schiller ended up offering to reinstate the app on the platform for two weeks while T-Mobile worked to remedy the alleged violations.    Apple later loosened its restrictions on parental control apps, causing further frustration for some. One developer complained to Apple executives they had spent $30,000 to retool their parental control app with the guidance of Apple employees only to later find the rule was changed, presumably in such a way that it would not have had to make that investment. Responses from Apple executives to the developer were not included in the documents released.    -  Even some Apple employees seemed confused by the company\u2019s policies:   In a couple emails, Apple executives seemed unclear on the company\u2019s rules or at least acknowledged the ambiguity around its policies.    Emails between PR executives in 2019 showed those tasked with communicating Apple\u2019s views on right to repair legislation were unclear on the company\u2019s stance. The proposals aimed to make it easier for consumers and third-parties to find and offer repair services outside of the manufacturer.    \u201cRight now, it\u2019s pretty clear things are happening in a vacuum and there is not an overall strategy,\u201d then-director of corporate communications Lori Lodes wrote in a 2019 email. \u201cPlus, with one hand we are making these changes and the other is actively fighting Right to Repair legislation moving in 20 states without real coordination for how updated policies could be used to leverage our position.\u201d    In another instance, then-senior product manager for AR and VR Cameron Rogers told Schiller in a 2019 email that it was unclear to him and others within Apple why a particular gaming app was not included on the App Store.    \u201cIt still isn\u2019t obvious to people inside the company that work directly on the App Store. I think few people understand the subtleties of the rules as well as you do,\u201d Rogers wrote.    -  Executives sought to draw a distinction between Google and Apple in arguing it should not be a target of Warren\u2019s push to break up Big Tech:  Top PR officials at Apple sought to separate their brand from Google\u2019s as they discussed how best to respond to Warren\u2019s platform of breaking up Big Tech.    Apple\u2019s former VP of Communications Steve Dowling wrote to his team last year that arguments against Warren\u2019s platform should seek to show Apple is not a monopolist \u201cthat\u2019s shown by market share\u201d and emphasize, \u201cHow do we handle competition with our own apps? We don\u2019t do things like pushing down results, etc., as Google (one of her real targets) has.\u201d The charge seems to refer to allegations that Google prioritizes its own features in search results or stacks ads at the top of the page. Google has denied unfairly disadvantaging websites in its search product.    What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Regulators could seek to prove that Apple applies its App Store rules disproportionately to disadvantage rivals. However, they\u2019d likely need to make a credible case that Apple\u2019s decisions are fueled at least in part by an attempt to preference its own services, rather than consumer protection issues it claims to champion. Still, if regulators can show Apple inconsistently applied its rules across developers and made better terms for some for its own business reasons, it could face serious scrutiny.    Apple did not provide a comment on the emails.   Google   What an antitrust case could look like:  Google\u2019s sprawling business has attracted antitrust scrutiny on multiple fronts. Regulators have looked into Google\u2019s search business, online advertising platform and Android mobile operating system. Here\u2019s what they might be looking for in each:    - Search: Vertical search competitors like  Yelp  and  TripAdvisor , which offer search engines for specific purposes like local businesses or travel, have complained for years that Google prioritizes its own services over their own, like by offering its own competing services above theirs in relevant Google search results.    The FTC has investigated Google\u2019s search practices in the past and in 2013, its commissioners unanimously voted to close the investigation. An internal report later obtained by the  Journal  showed that FTC staff had recommended bringing a case against Google on multiple grounds, though they recommended against a lawsuit over allegations Google favored its own vertical search features over competitors\u2019 even though staff said its actions resulted in \u201csignificant harm\u201d to rivals.    - Advertising:  Google\u2019s advertising business has attracted scrutiny over a variety of concerns that essentially boil down to the question of whether Google\u2019s expansive control over the digital media supply chain allows other companies to compete. While Google has competitors across many functions of the advertising marketplace, it operates in both the buy-side and sell-side of transactions, leading to some questions about whether it remains objective about where it routes advertising dollars. Competitors also argue that Google\u2019s prices are hard to match because it bundles its ad tools. And on YouTube, Google eliminated the ability to buy ads through third-party services, funneling all spend through its own tools.    - Android:   Finally, with its Android mobile operating system, Google requires device manufacturers who use its platform to pre-install its app store and other native apps like Gmail and its Chrome web browser. The European Commission required Google to stop bundling its apps on Android phones and allow allow EU users to select their default search engine after  fining the company $5 billion  over alleged antitrust abuse.    Most Interesting finds:  The internal emails released show how Google executives considered the ways they could position various aspects of the business to become most integral to their users\u2019 lives.    -  Executives recognized threats from social media platforms and vertical search competitors and aimed to draw users to their own offerings:  The documents show Google\u2019s fixation on being the leader in search. In a report about how the company would stay ahead in search in 2007, Google said it should \u201cTurn having the largest user base into an unfair advantage by building out tech that improves linearly with user base size.\u201d     The report recognized MySpace \u201cas the clear leader\u201d in people search and social networking at the time. It noted that sites like MySpace and YouTube \u201cwill ultimately represent a threat to our search business as people will spend more time on those sites and ultimately may do most searches from the search boxes available there. They aren\u2019t direct competitors, but they may displace us in end-user time tradeoff.\u201d    \u201cIn the future, we do not want users [to] \u2018myspace\u2019 people for more information. Google should host all information about a person, including myspace info,\u201d the report later states.    In 2012, executives discussed their strategy around vertical search, where competitors like Yelp and  Booking.com  had taken hold. Jeff Huber, a senior vice president who led location services and commerce at the time, explained in an email why he believed it was important to have a presence in verticals like travel and shopping.    \u2033[I]f we don\u2019t have experiences in these areas that are compelling compared to increasingly concentrated branded alternatives, we risk losing relevance overall (e.g., Amazon is increasingly becoming the place you search for things and Google is the place you search for information).\u201d    Still, then-SVP of Knowledge Alan Eustace warned, \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to fight amazon on their turf by building and branding a single purpose experience by a separate team. The same goes for Yelp and Local.\u201d Instead, he advocated for an interface that works across several verticals.    -  Executives saw a potential deal with YouTube as a way to prevent Yahoo from buying it:   As Google executives pondered whether to buy YouTube, one key consideration appeared to be thwarting Yahoo from snatching up the video service.    Huber, the SVP of geo and commerce at the time, wrote in a 2005 email, \u201cI think we should talk to them, if nothing else to make it more expensive for Yahoo. They\u2019ll also eventually need a monetization/ads model, so we should use ours instead of anything from Yahoo (if they don\u2019t go acquisition soon, and we maintain reasonable relations with them).\u201d    Still, then-Group Product Manager Peter Chane wrote that there would be plenty of other acquisition targets for Yahoo to aim for.     \u2033[I]f we pick them up it would be defensive vs yahoo but there are 20 more sites like this that yahoo could go and buy,\u201d he wrote at the time.    Google ended up buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion.    What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Like the documents released for the other companies, it is hard to point to any email as a smoking gun. But if regulators were to build an antitrust case against Google, documents like these could be used to show patterns in Google\u2019s competitive strategy, like buying a company to prevent a rival from doing it first or building and prioritizing native tools on its search engine platform to keep users from clicking away to competitors\u2019 websites.    Google did not provide a comment on the emails, but a spokesperson downplayed the company\u2019s dominance in search, saying Amazon gets more searches for consumer products than Google does, for example.    -CNBC\u2019s  Jessica Bursztynsky ,  Michelle Gao  and  J.R.

But  internal documents released by the committee  after the hearing say plenty.    The release is a curated selection of the 1.3 million documents collected by the committee during its more than year-long investigation into competition concerns with the four tech giants. It includes emails and chat logs between executives at the four companies and with those they sought to acquire. It shows industry leaders strategizing ahead of decisions that would become turning points in the legacy of their businesses, like Facebook\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram or Amazon\u2019s decision to undercut prices for diapers to compete with Diapers.com.    The four companies turned over the documents at the request of the committee. But the huge trove of evidence is likely just a fraction of that which federal and state regulators have been poring over as they decide whether to bring an antitrust case against any of the tech giants. Google appears to be most immediately in danger of such an outcome as  The Wall Street Journal  reported earlier this year that the Justice Department is gearing up to announce an antitrust case as soon as this summer.    In some cases, regulators may have had these documents before, like when requesting more information on a potential deal. Alicia Batts, a partner in the antitrust and competition practice at Squire Patton Boggs, said it\u2019s not uncommon for \u201cbad documents\u201d to surface in a merger investigation.    \u201cIt\u2019s an indication to look deeper but not necessarily an indication you won\u2019t be able to close [the deal],\u201d she said in an interview this week with CNBC. \u201cWhen you have both documents that show a company is planning to harm competition and the economic data or the economic model support that it\u2019s possible, that\u2019s when the documents are given the most weight.\u201d    CNBC dug through the hundreds of pages released by the House Judiciary Committee last week to find the most revealing details laid bare in the companies\u2019 private correspondences.     Here are the most notable finds and what they could mean for a potential antitrust case against each company.   Facebook   What an antitrust case could look like:  Experts speculate that an antitrust case against Facebook would center largely around its acquisition strategy and whether it broke merger laws by buying up a nascent competitor or violated anti-monopoly law by taking anti-competitive actions to build or maintain dominance in its market.    Most interesting finds:  The most compelling documents released by the committee on Facebook reveal top executives\u2019 thinking behind its acquisition of Instagram, one of the two deals that are now thought to have played a key role in Facebook\u2019s continued growth, along with its acquisition of WhatsApp. Some enforcement advocates, like  Columbia Law Professor Tim Wu , believe that had those apps not been acquired at an early stage, they could have grown into formidable competitors against Facebook.    -  Facebook executives feared decelerating engagement prior to the Instagram deal: Executives fretted about Facebook\u2019s relatively weak offerings on mobile, where Instagram had built its growing userbase.     \u201cWe have this big issue right now because gaming is shifting from us to mobile platforms,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in one April 2012 email. \u201cIt\u2019s causing all this negative momentum in a bunch of ways around gamer overall user engagement, ad spend from gamers, overall revenue, etc.\u201d     -  Facebook executives appeared threatened by Instagram\u2019s growth in 2012: Zuckerberg acknowledged the threat posed by Instagram in conversations with his deputies. In February 2012, Zuckerberg wrote in an email to his then-CFO David Ebersman he was considering how much Facebook should be \u201cwilling to pay to acquire mobile app companies like Instagram and Path that are building networks that are competitive with our own.\u201d He said that while those competitors have small teams, they have shown fast growth and even if they don\u2019t want to sell, a high enough price may change their minds.     \u201cThe businesses are nascent but the networks are established, the brands are already meaningful and if they grow to a large scale they could be disruptive to us,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.     In April 2012, he told one employee in an email, \u201cInstagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business though. For the others, if they become big we\u2019ll just regret not doing them.\u201d     -  Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom feared Zuckerberg entering \u201cdestroy mode\u201d if he didn\u2019t sell:  As Zuckerberg began to court Instagram for a potential deal, Systrom messaged one of his investors, Benchmark Partner Matt Cohler, in February 2012 for advice on how to politely rebuff an offer. Systrom seemed adamant in wanting to stay independent to see how far he could take Instagram on his own. But he wanted Cohler\u2019s advice on whether Zuckerberg would \u201cgo into destroy mode\u201d if he rejected an offer.     \u2033[P]robably,\u201d Cohler responded, \u201d(and probably if we just don\u2019t engage at all).\u201d    As they strategized the best response, Systrom acknowledged, \u201cbottom line I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever escape the wrath of mark haha\u201d    Later on, messages between Systrom and Zuckerberg leading up to their agreement to merge shed light on what Instagram had to fear if they were to go it alone.    \u201cOf course, at the same time we\u2019re developing our own photos strategy,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote, \u201cso how we engage now will also determine how much we\u2019re partners vs competitors down the line.\u201d    What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Even if regulators believe Facebook executives were afraid of the potential rise of Instagram and WhatsApp, it may not be enough to accuse them of violating merger law. To prove that Facebook violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act through those acquisitions, the FTC may have to prove not only that Instagram and WhatsApp were capable of growing into competitors to Facebook on their own, but also that they were one of the very few firms that were committed to getting into Facebook\u2019s market and capable of doing so.    \u201cWhat that means is, if at the time of the acquisition it looks as if Instagram was just one of many nascent folks nibbling at the heels of Facebook, the case law makes it very hard for the government to block that kind of an acquisition,\u201d said Bill Baer, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who formerly led the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition and DOJ Antitrust Division during Democratic administrations.    A Facebook spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that the company had submitted the documents included in the Judiciary Committee file in its disclosure to the FTC in 2012 when the agency reviewed Facebook\u2019s proposed acquisition of Instagram. That indicates the FTC determined at the time that those statements did not preclude the merger when weighed against economic models predicting the companies\u2019 future success.    But looking back is often easier than looking forward. Showing a pattern of anti-competitive acquisitions or other behavior could potentially help build a case against Facebook under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the anti-monopoly law, or Section 5 of the  FTC Act , which grants what some believe to be broader power to the regulator.    Section 5 empowers the FTC to prevent companies from engaging in \u201cunfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\u201d    \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about Section 5, it\u2019s not just [the] Sherman and Clayton Act, but it\u2019s kind of the spirit of the antitrust laws,\u201d said Batts, the Squire Patton Boggs partner.    This could also be an issue the House Judiciary Committee tackles with its legislative proposals expected to follow the conclusion of its probe. Lawmakers may determine the bar is too high to decide a deal is anti-competitive and adjust the language to make it easier for authorities to bring a case on such grounds.     Facebook did not provide a comment on the documents.   Amazon   What an antitrust case could look like:  An antitrust case for Amazon may resemble the line of thinking Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offered in her  presidential campaign platform  on breaking up Big Tech. Warren argued large tech companies designated as \u201cPlatform Utilities\u201d should not be able to control and participate on their own platforms. The FTC has been talking to third-party sellers on Amazon\u2019s platform, according to  Bloomberg , following concerns that Amazon undercuts sellers on its marketplace.    A recent  Wall Street Journal investigation  found that Amazon employees had used internal data to inform their private-label brand strategy and compete with other sellers. Though the employees reportedly used aggregated reports combining multiple sellers\u2019 performance, they sometimes contained as few as two sellers, making it easy to extrapolate a single seller\u2019s data. Amazon has said it was launching an internal investigation into the allegations by the Journal, but said it didn\u2019t believe the claims to be true.    Most Interesting finds:  Amazon\u2019s internal emails mostly shed light on the company\u2019s acquisition mindset and pricing strategy to compete with Diapers.com before it acquired its parents company.    -  Amazon undercut Diapers.com\u2019s prices before buying it: A top executive, then-vice president of worldwide corporate development Douglas Booms, identified Diapers.com as Amazon\u2019s \u201d#1 short term competitor\u201d in a 2009 email. \u201cAs I\u2019ve mentioned to each of you, I think, we need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost,\u201d Booms wrote.    Over the next year, Amazon began operating its diaper business at a loss, a  profit and loss statement shows , offset by other segments of the baby business.     Once executives learned Diapers.com\u2019s parent company, Quidsi, was planning to launch a new vertical, Soap.com, executives crafted a plan to keep it at bay.    \u201cWe have already initiated a more aggressive \u2018plan to win\u2019 against diapers.com in the diaper/baby space, which includes market leading pricing on diapers (\u201cdouble your SNS discount to 30% off diapers and wipes\u201d), a free PRIME offering for new Moms, and a structured and marketed \u2018Amazon Mom\u201d program,\u2019\u201d said Doug Herrington, then-VP of consumables at Amazon. \u201cTo the extent this plan undercuts the core diapers business for diapers.com, it will slow the adoption of soap.com.\u201d    Amazon announced in 2010 its move to buy  Quidsi in a reported $545 million deal , only to  shut down the business in 2017  after Amazon said it failed to become profitable.    -  Bezos planned to buy \u201cmarket position - not technology\u201d with Amazon\u2019s Ring acquisition: CEO Jeff Bezos acknowledged in an email to executives in 2017 that he wantedto buy doorbell security camera system Ring to solidify market position.     \u201cTo be clear, my view here is that we\u2019re buying market position - not technology,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cAnd that market position and momentum is very valuable.\u201d     What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Regulators could use the Diapers.com documents to argue that Amazon engaged in predatory pricing to eliminate a competitor. But doing so is not as easy as showing it discounted goods below its costs, which is a standard competitive practice in some cases and could be considered beneficial for consumers if it results in sustained lower prices.    The FTC  says on its website  that while prices can at times be \u201ctoo low,\u201d this doesn\u2019t happen often.    \u201cConsumers are harmed only if below-cost pricing allows a dominant competitor to knock its rivals out of the market and then raise prices to above-market levels for a substantial time,\u201d the agency says. \u201cA firm\u2019s independent decision to reduce prices to a level below its own costs does not necessarily injure competition, and, in fact, may simply reflect particularly vigorous competition.\u201d    Baer, the former federal antitrust enforcer, said laws prohibiting predatory pricing are not meant to discourage price competition. But discounting could lend way to anti-competitive practices when a firm later has the ability to raise prices after eliminating its rival.      \u201cIf you are pricing below an appropriate measure of your cost for the purpose of injuring a competitor and you have the ability to recoup those losses once your competitor is out of business or retreats from its discounting practices, that is potentially an antitrust violation,\u201d Baer said.    Still, the documents released by the committee so far don\u2019t shed much light on what could become the true focus of an antitrust investigation: how Amazon competes with sellers on its platform. That doesn\u2019t mean those documents don\u2019t exist, though, or that regulators aren\u2019t learning more about those relationships in their interviews with competitors and insiders.    Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.   Apple    What an antitrust case could look like:  The antitrust theory against Apple centers on its control of the App Store. While iPhones are prevalent throughout the U.S., Apple only ranks third in worldwide market share for smartphones at 13.3%, according to  IDC , while the market leader Samsung holds a 21.2% share.    A potential case against Apple could look similar to one against Amazon, focusing on the fact that it both owns a marketplace (the App Store) and has its own pre-loaded apps like Apple Music and Apple Podcasts that compete with other apps on its platform, like  Spotify .    Some developers who offer their apps through the App Store \u2014 the only way Apple allows for apps to be added to users\u2019 devices \u2014 have complained about Apple\u2019s opaque and sometimes seemingly arbitrary process for accepting new apps.    Most recently, the  founders of Basecamp complained that Apple unfairly rejected their new email app , Hey. Apple had originally claimed it did not meet standards in an early version because it did not offer a way for users to make an account through the app, which would require the developers to give Apple a 30% cut of iOS sign-ups in the first year. An updated version of the app was later approved.    Spotify has been among the most vocal opponents of what it\u2019s dubbed the \u201cApple Tax,\u201d the 15% to 30% cut Apple takes for payments processed through apps offered on the App Store. Apple claims the commission covers the cost of running the App Store, but developers have complained that the cost can be prohibitively high and Apple does not provide alternative payment methods. The  European Commission recently announced two antitrust probes  into Apple\u2019s App Store and Apple Pay.    Most Interesting finds:  The documents released paint a picture that Apple\u2019s rules around its App Store may not be as rigid as the company has repeatedly insisted they are.    - Apple executives discussed exceptions to how it applied its App Store rules:  Faced with criticism over its opaque enforcement of App Store rules, Apple has publicly stated that it approaches enforcement consistently.     \u201cWe apply the rules to all developers evenly,\u201d CEO Tim Cook testified at the antitrust subcommittee hearing last week.     But internal emails released by the Judiciary Committee show that Apple has at times loosened its rules for some developers. In 2016, for example, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in an email that Apple had  agreed to taking only a 15% cut of revenue for customers who sign up for Amazon Prime Video in their iOS app  and no cut for already-subscribed customers.     Although it\u2019s unclear from the emails what terms the companies ended up acting on, Cue\u2019s promise is different from what Apple typically says it charges developers: a 30% cut of in-app purchase revenue in the first year and 15% every year after for recurring subscriptions.    -  Apple\u2019s evolving stance on parental control apps frustrated developers, including big brands like T-Mobile: Several emails included in the release revolve around developers and customers complaining about Apple\u2019s enforcement of rules for parental control apps. Apple cracked down on several such apps last year, as  The New York Times  reported, coinciding with the announcement of Apple\u2019s own feature to track screen time. Apple said at the time the removal of the apps was based on the discovery that they could gain too much access to information on users\u2019 devices and it was unrelated to the screen time feature launch. In an email responding to a concerned user, Apple\u2019s App Store boss Phil Schiller said the technology used to control devices \u201cis not intended to enable a developer to have access to and control over consumers\u2019 data and devices, but the apps we removed from the store did just that.\u201d    Back in 2018, then- T-Mobile  COO Mike Sievert emailed Schiller complaining about its FamilyMode app being removed from the App Store after back and forth with Apple about getting it into compliance. Schiller ended up offering to reinstate the app on the platform for two weeks while T-Mobile worked to remedy the alleged violations.    Apple later loosened its restrictions on parental control apps, causing further frustration for some. One developer complained to Apple executives they had spent $30,000 to retool their parental control app with the guidance of Apple employees only to later find the rule was changed, presumably in such a way that it would not have had to make that investment. Responses from Apple executives to the developer were not included in the documents released.    -  Even some Apple employees seemed confused by the company\u2019s policies:   In a couple emails, Apple executives seemed unclear on the company\u2019s rules or at least acknowledged the ambiguity around its policies.    Emails between PR executives in 2019 showed those tasked with communicating Apple\u2019s views on right to repair legislation were unclear on the company\u2019s stance. The proposals aimed to make it easier for consumers and third-parties to find and offer repair services outside of the manufacturer.    \u201cRight now, it\u2019s pretty clear things are happening in a vacuum and there is not an overall strategy,\u201d then-director of corporate communications Lori Lodes wrote in a 2019 email. \u201cPlus, with one hand we are making these changes and the other is actively fighting Right to Repair legislation moving in 20 states without real coordination for how updated policies could be used to leverage our position.\u201d    In another instance, then-senior product manager for AR and VR Cameron Rogers told Schiller in a 2019 email that it was unclear to him and others within Apple why a particular gaming app was not included on the App Store.    \u201cIt still isn\u2019t obvious to people inside the company that work directly on the App Store. I think few people understand the subtleties of the rules as well as you do,\u201d Rogers wrote.    -  Executives sought to draw a distinction between Google and Apple in arguing it should not be a target of Warren\u2019s push to break up Big Tech:  Top PR officials at Apple sought to separate their brand from Google\u2019s as they discussed how best to respond to Warren\u2019s platform of breaking up Big Tech.    Apple\u2019s former VP of Communications Steve Dowling wrote to his team last year that arguments against Warren\u2019s platform should seek to show Apple is not a monopolist \u201cthat\u2019s shown by market share\u201d and emphasize, \u201cHow do we handle competition with our own apps? We don\u2019t do things like pushing down results, etc., as Google (one of her real targets) has.\u201d The charge seems to refer to allegations that Google prioritizes its own features in search results or stacks ads at the top of the page. Google has denied unfairly disadvantaging websites in its search product.    What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Regulators could seek to prove that Apple applies its App Store rules disproportionately to disadvantage rivals. However, they\u2019d likely need to make a credible case that Apple\u2019s decisions are fueled at least in part by an attempt to preference its own services, rather than consumer protection issues it claims to champion. Still, if regulators can show Apple inconsistently applied its rules across developers and made better terms for some for its own business reasons, it could face serious scrutiny.    Apple did not provide a comment on the emails.   Google   What an antitrust case could look like:  Google\u2019s sprawling business has attracted antitrust scrutiny on multiple fronts. Regulators have looked into Google\u2019s search business, online advertising platform and Android mobile operating system. Here\u2019s what they might be looking for in each:    - Search: Vertical search competitors like  Yelp  and  TripAdvisor , which offer search engines for specific purposes like local businesses or travel, have complained for years that Google prioritizes its own services over their own, like by offering its own competing services above theirs in relevant Google search results.    The FTC has investigated Google\u2019s search practices in the past and in 2013, its commissioners unanimously voted to close the investigation. An internal report later obtained by the  Journal  showed that FTC staff had recommended bringing a case against Google on multiple grounds, though they recommended against a lawsuit over allegations Google favored its own vertical search features over competitors\u2019 even though staff said its actions resulted in \u201csignificant harm\u201d to rivals.    - Advertising:  Google\u2019s advertising business has attracted scrutiny over a variety of concerns that essentially boil down to the question of whether Google\u2019s expansive control over the digital media supply chain allows other companies to compete. While Google has competitors across many functions of the advertising marketplace, it operates in both the buy-side and sell-side of transactions, leading to some questions about whether it remains objective about where it routes advertising dollars. Competitors also argue that Google\u2019s prices are hard to match because it bundles its ad tools. And on YouTube, Google eliminated the ability to buy ads through third-party services, funneling all spend through its own tools.    - Android:   Finally, with its Android mobile operating system, Google requires device manufacturers who use its platform to pre-install its app store and other native apps like Gmail and its Chrome web browser. The European Commission required Google to stop bundling its apps on Android phones and allow allow EU users to select their default search engine after  fining the company $5 billion  over alleged antitrust abuse.    Most Interesting finds:  The internal emails released show how Google executives considered the ways they could position various aspects of the business to become most integral to their users\u2019 lives.    -  Executives recognized threats from social media platforms and vertical search competitors and aimed to draw users to their own offerings:  The documents show Google\u2019s fixation on being the leader in search. In a report about how the company would stay ahead in search in 2007, Google said it should \u201cTurn having the largest user base into an unfair advantage by building out tech that improves linearly with user base size.\u201d     The report recognized MySpace \u201cas the clear leader\u201d in people search and social networking at the time. It noted that sites like MySpace and YouTube \u201cwill ultimately represent a threat to our search business as people will spend more time on those sites and ultimately may do most searches from the search boxes available there. They aren\u2019t direct competitors, but they may displace us in end-user time tradeoff.\u201d    \u201cIn the future, we do not want users [to] \u2018myspace\u2019 people for more information. Google should host all information about a person, including myspace info,\u201d the report later states.    In 2012, executives discussed their strategy around vertical search, where competitors like Yelp and  Booking.com  had taken hold. Jeff Huber, a senior vice president who led location services and commerce at the time, explained in an email why he believed it was important to have a presence in verticals like travel and shopping.    \u2033[I]f we don\u2019t have experiences in these areas that are compelling compared to increasingly concentrated branded alternatives, we risk losing relevance overall (e.g., Amazon is increasingly becoming the place you search for things and Google is the place you search for information).\u201d    Still, then-SVP of Knowledge Alan Eustace warned, \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to fight amazon on their turf by building and branding a single purpose experience by a separate team. The same goes for Yelp and Local.\u201d Instead, he advocated for an interface that works across several verticals.    -  Executives saw a potential deal with YouTube as a way to prevent Yahoo from buying it:   As Google executives pondered whether to buy YouTube, one key consideration appeared to be thwarting Yahoo from snatching up the video service.    Huber, the SVP of geo and commerce at the time, wrote in a 2005 email, \u201cI think we should talk to them, if nothing else to make it more expensive for Yahoo. They\u2019ll also eventually need a monetization/ads model, so we should use ours instead of anything from Yahoo (if they don\u2019t go acquisition soon, and we maintain reasonable relations with them).\u201d    Still, then-Group Product Manager Peter Chane wrote that there would be plenty of other acquisition targets for Yahoo to aim for.     \u2033[I]f we pick them up it would be defensive vs yahoo but there are 20 more sites like this that yahoo could go and buy,\u201d he wrote at the time.    Google ended up buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion.    What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Like the documents released for the other companies, it is hard to point to any email as a smoking gun. But if regulators were to build an antitrust case against Google, documents like these could be used to show patterns in Google\u2019s competitive strategy, like buying a company to prevent a rival from doing it first or building and prioritizing native tools on its search engine platform to keep users from clicking away to competitors\u2019 websites.    Google did not provide a comment on the emails, but a spokesperson downplayed the company\u2019s dominance in search, saying Amazon gets more searches for consumer products than Google does, for example.    -CNBC\u2019s  Jessica Bursztynsky ,  Michelle Gao  and  J.R.

But  internal documents released by the committee  after the hearing say plenty.    The release is a curated selection of the 1.3 million documents collected by the committee during its more than year-long investigation into competition concerns with the four tech giants. It includes emails and chat logs between executives at the four companies and with those they sought to acquire. It shows industry leaders strategizing ahead of decisions that would become turning points in the legacy of their businesses, like Facebook\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram or Amazon\u2019s decision to undercut prices for diapers to compete with Diapers.com.    The four companies turned over the documents at the request of the committee. But the huge trove of evidence is likely just a fraction of that which federal and state regulators have been poring over as they decide whether to bring an antitrust case against any of the tech giants. Google appears to be most immediately in danger of such an outcome as  The Wall Street Journal  reported earlier this year that the Justice Department is gearing up to announce an antitrust case as soon as this summer.    In some cases, regulators may have had these documents before, like when requesting more information on a potential deal. Alicia Batts, a partner in the antitrust and competition practice at Squire Patton Boggs, said it\u2019s not uncommon for \u201cbad documents\u201d to surface in a merger investigation.    \u201cIt\u2019s an indication to look deeper but not necessarily an indication you won\u2019t be able to close [the deal],\u201d she said in an interview this week with CNBC. \u201cWhen you have both documents that show a company is planning to harm competition and the economic data or the economic model support that it\u2019s possible, that\u2019s when the documents are given the most weight.\u201d    CNBC dug through the hundreds of pages released by the House Judiciary Committee last week to find the most revealing details laid bare in the companies\u2019 private correspondences.     Here are the most notable finds and what they could mean for a potential antitrust case against each company.   Facebook   What an antitrust case could look like:  Experts speculate that an antitrust case against Facebook would center largely around its acquisition strategy and whether it broke merger laws by buying up a nascent competitor or violated anti-monopoly law by taking anti-competitive actions to build or maintain dominance in its market.    Most interesting finds:  The most compelling documents released by the committee on Facebook reveal top executives\u2019 thinking behind its acquisition of Instagram, one of the two deals that are now thought to have played a key role in Facebook\u2019s continued growth, along with its acquisition of WhatsApp. Some enforcement advocates, like  Columbia Law Professor Tim Wu , believe that had those apps not been acquired at an early stage, they could have grown into formidable competitors against Facebook.    -  Facebook executives feared decelerating engagement prior to the Instagram deal: Executives fretted about Facebook\u2019s relatively weak offerings on mobile, where Instagram had built its growing userbase.     \u201cWe have this big issue right now because gaming is shifting from us to mobile platforms,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in one April 2012 email. \u201cIt\u2019s causing all this negative momentum in a bunch of ways around gamer overall user engagement, ad spend from gamers, overall revenue, etc.\u201d     -  Facebook executives appeared threatened by Instagram\u2019s growth in 2012: Zuckerberg acknowledged the threat posed by Instagram in conversations with his deputies. In February 2012, Zuckerberg wrote in an email to his then-CFO David Ebersman he was considering how much Facebook should be \u201cwilling to pay to acquire mobile app companies like Instagram and Path that are building networks that are competitive with our own.\u201d He said that while those competitors have small teams, they have shown fast growth and even if they don\u2019t want to sell, a high enough price may change their minds.     \u201cThe businesses are nascent but the networks are established, the brands are already meaningful and if they grow to a large scale they could be disruptive to us,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.     In April 2012, he told one employee in an email, \u201cInstagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business though. For the others, if they become big we\u2019ll just regret not doing them.\u201d     -  Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom feared Zuckerberg entering \u201cdestroy mode\u201d if he didn\u2019t sell:  As Zuckerberg began to court Instagram for a potential deal, Systrom messaged one of his investors, Benchmark Partner Matt Cohler, in February 2012 for advice on how to politely rebuff an offer. Systrom seemed adamant in wanting to stay independent to see how far he could take Instagram on his own. But he wanted Cohler\u2019s advice on whether Zuckerberg would \u201cgo into destroy mode\u201d if he rejected an offer.     \u2033[P]robably,\u201d Cohler responded, \u201d(and probably if we just don\u2019t engage at all).\u201d    As they strategized the best response, Systrom acknowledged, \u201cbottom line I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever escape the wrath of mark haha\u201d    Later on, messages between Systrom and Zuckerberg leading up to their agreement to merge shed light on what Instagram had to fear if they were to go it alone.    \u201cOf course, at the same time we\u2019re developing our own photos strategy,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote, \u201cso how we engage now will also determine how much we\u2019re partners vs competitors down the line.\u201d    What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Even if regulators believe Facebook executives were afraid of the potential rise of Instagram and WhatsApp, it may not be enough to accuse them of violating merger law. To prove that Facebook violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act through those acquisitions, the FTC may have to prove not only that Instagram and WhatsApp were capable of growing into competitors to Facebook on their own, but also that they were one of the very few firms that were committed to getting into Facebook\u2019s market and capable of doing so.    \u201cWhat that means is, if at the time of the acquisition it looks as if Instagram was just one of many nascent folks nibbling at the heels of Facebook, the case law makes it very hard for the government to block that kind of an acquisition,\u201d said Bill Baer, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who formerly led the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition and DOJ Antitrust Division during Democratic administrations.    A Facebook spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that the company had submitted the documents included in the Judiciary Committee file in its disclosure to the FTC in 2012 when the agency reviewed Facebook\u2019s proposed acquisition of Instagram. That indicates the FTC determined at the time that those statements did not preclude the merger when weighed against economic models predicting the companies\u2019 future success.    But looking back is often easier than looking forward. Showing a pattern of anti-competitive acquisitions or other behavior could potentially help build a case against Facebook under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the anti-monopoly law, or Section 5 of the  FTC Act , which grants what some believe to be broader power to the regulator.    Section 5 empowers the FTC to prevent companies from engaging in \u201cunfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\u201d    \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about Section 5, it\u2019s not just [the] Sherman and Clayton Act, but it\u2019s kind of the spirit of the antitrust laws,\u201d said Batts, the Squire Patton Boggs partner.    This could also be an issue the House Judiciary Committee tackles with its legislative proposals expected to follow the conclusion of its probe. Lawmakers may determine the bar is too high to decide a deal is anti-competitive and adjust the language to make it easier for authorities to bring a case on such grounds.     Facebook did not provide a comment on the documents.   Amazon   What an antitrust case could look like:  An antitrust case for Amazon may resemble the line of thinking Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offered in her  presidential campaign platform  on breaking up Big Tech. Warren argued large tech companies designated as \u201cPlatform Utilities\u201d should not be able to control and participate on their own platforms. The FTC has been talking to third-party sellers on Amazon\u2019s platform, according to  Bloomberg , following concerns that Amazon undercuts sellers on its marketplace.    A recent  Wall Street Journal investigation  found that Amazon employees had used internal data to inform their private-label brand strategy and compete with other sellers. Though the employees reportedly used aggregated reports combining multiple sellers\u2019 performance, they sometimes contained as few as two sellers, making it easy to extrapolate a single seller\u2019s data. Amazon has said it was launching an internal investigation into the allegations by the Journal, but said it didn\u2019t believe the claims to be true.    Most Interesting finds:  Amazon\u2019s internal emails mostly shed light on the company\u2019s acquisition mindset and pricing strategy to compete with Diapers.com before it acquired its parents company.    -  Amazon undercut Diapers.com\u2019s prices before buying it: A top executive, then-vice president of worldwide corporate development Douglas Booms, identified Diapers.com as Amazon\u2019s \u201d#1 short term competitor\u201d in a 2009 email. \u201cAs I\u2019ve mentioned to each of you, I think, we need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost,\u201d Booms wrote.    Over the next year, Amazon began operating its diaper business at a loss, a  profit and loss statement shows , offset by other segments of the baby business.     Once executives learned Diapers.com\u2019s parent company, Quidsi, was planning to launch a new vertical, Soap.com, executives crafted a plan to keep it at bay.    \u201cWe have already initiated a more aggressive \u2018plan to win\u2019 against diapers.com in the diaper/baby space, which includes market leading pricing on diapers (\u201cdouble your SNS discount to 30% off diapers and wipes\u201d), a free PRIME offering for new Moms, and a structured and marketed \u2018Amazon Mom\u201d program,\u2019\u201d said Doug Herrington, then-VP of consumables at Amazon. \u201cTo the extent this plan undercuts the core diapers business for diapers.com, it will slow the adoption of soap.com.\u201d    Amazon announced in 2010 its move to buy  Quidsi in a reported $545 million deal , only to  shut down the business in 2017  after Amazon said it failed to become profitable.    -  Bezos planned to buy \u201cmarket position - not technology\u201d with Amazon\u2019s Ring acquisition: CEO Jeff Bezos acknowledged in an email to executives in 2017 that he wantedto buy doorbell security camera system Ring to solidify market position.     \u201cTo be clear, my view here is that we\u2019re buying market position - not technology,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cAnd that market position and momentum is very valuable.\u201d     What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Regulators could use the Diapers.com documents to argue that Amazon engaged in predatory pricing to eliminate a competitor. But doing so is not as easy as showing it discounted goods below its costs, which is a standard competitive practice in some cases and could be considered beneficial for consumers if it results in sustained lower prices.    The FTC  says on its website  that while prices can at times be \u201ctoo low,\u201d this doesn\u2019t happen often.    \u201cConsumers are harmed only if below-cost pricing allows a dominant competitor to knock its rivals out of the market and then raise prices to above-market levels for a substantial time,\u201d the agency says. \u201cA firm\u2019s independent decision to reduce prices to a level below its own costs does not necessarily injure competition, and, in fact, may simply reflect particularly vigorous competition.\u201d    Baer, the former federal antitrust enforcer, said laws prohibiting predatory pricing are not meant to discourage price competition. But discounting could lend way to anti-competitive practices when a firm later has the ability to raise prices after eliminating its rival.      \u201cIf you are pricing below an appropriate measure of your cost for the purpose of injuring a competitor and you have the ability to recoup those losses once your competitor is out of business or retreats from its discounting practices, that is potentially an antitrust violation,\u201d Baer said.    Still, the documents released by the committee so far don\u2019t shed much light on what could become the true focus of an antitrust investigation: how Amazon competes with sellers on its platform. That doesn\u2019t mean those documents don\u2019t exist, though, or that regulators aren\u2019t learning more about those relationships in their interviews with competitors and insiders.    Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.   Apple    What an antitrust case could look like:  The antitrust theory against Apple centers on its control of the App Store. While iPhones are prevalent throughout the U.S., Apple only ranks third in worldwide market share for smartphones at 13.3%, according to  IDC , while the market leader Samsung holds a 21.2% share.    A potential case against Apple could look similar to one against Amazon, focusing on the fact that it both owns a marketplace (the App Store) and has its own pre-loaded apps like Apple Music and Apple Podcasts that compete with other apps on its platform, like  Spotify .    Some developers who offer their apps through the App Store \u2014 the only way Apple allows for apps to be added to users\u2019 devices \u2014 have complained about Apple\u2019s opaque and sometimes seemingly arbitrary process for accepting new apps.    Most recently, the  founders of Basecamp complained that Apple unfairly rejected their new email app , Hey. Apple had originally claimed it did not meet standards in an early version because it did not offer a way for users to make an account through the app, which would require the developers to give Apple a 30% cut of iOS sign-ups in the first year. An updated version of the app was later approved.    Spotify has been among the most vocal opponents of what it\u2019s dubbed the \u201cApple Tax,\u201d the 15% to 30% cut Apple takes for payments processed through apps offered on the App Store. Apple claims the commission covers the cost of running the App Store, but developers have complained that the cost can be prohibitively high and Apple does not provide alternative payment methods. The  European Commission recently announced two antitrust probes  into Apple\u2019s App Store and Apple Pay.    Most Interesting finds:  The documents released paint a picture that Apple\u2019s rules around its App Store may not be as rigid as the company has repeatedly insisted they are.    - Apple executives discussed exceptions to how it applied its App Store rules:  Faced with criticism over its opaque enforcement of App Store rules, Apple has publicly stated that it approaches enforcement consistently.     \u201cWe apply the rules to all developers evenly,\u201d CEO Tim Cook testified at the antitrust subcommittee hearing last week.     But internal emails released by the Judiciary Committee show that Apple has at times loosened its rules for some developers. In 2016, for example, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in an email that Apple had  agreed to taking only a 15% cut of revenue for customers who sign up for Amazon Prime Video in their iOS app  and no cut for already-subscribed customers.     Although it\u2019s unclear from the emails what terms the companies ended up acting on, Cue\u2019s promise is different from what Apple typically says it charges developers: a 30% cut of in-app purchase revenue in the first year and 15% every year after for recurring subscriptions.    -  Apple\u2019s evolving stance on parental control apps frustrated developers, including big brands like T-Mobile: Several emails included in the release revolve around developers and customers complaining about Apple\u2019s enforcement of rules for parental control apps. Apple cracked down on several such apps last year, as  The New York Times  reported, coinciding with the announcement of Apple\u2019s own feature to track screen time. Apple said at the time the removal of the apps was based on the discovery that they could gain too much access to information on users\u2019 devices and it was unrelated to the screen time feature launch. In an email responding to a concerned user, Apple\u2019s App Store boss Phil Schiller said the technology used to control devices \u201cis not intended to enable a developer to have access to and control over consumers\u2019 data and devices, but the apps we removed from the store did just that.\u201d    Back in 2018, then- T-Mobile  COO Mike Sievert emailed Schiller complaining about its FamilyMode app being removed from the App Store after back and forth with Apple about getting it into compliance. Schiller ended up offering to reinstate the app on the platform for two weeks while T-Mobile worked to remedy the alleged violations.    Apple later loosened its restrictions on parental control apps, causing further frustration for some. One developer complained to Apple executives they had spent $30,000 to retool their parental control app with the guidance of Apple employees only to later find the rule was changed, presumably in such a way that it would not have had to make that investment. Responses from Apple executives to the developer were not included in the documents released.    -  Even some Apple employees seemed confused by the company\u2019s policies:   In a couple emails, Apple executives seemed unclear on the company\u2019s rules or at least acknowledged the ambiguity around its policies.    Emails between PR executives in 2019 showed those tasked with communicating Apple\u2019s views on right to repair legislation were unclear on the company\u2019s stance. The proposals aimed to make it easier for consumers and third-parties to find and offer repair services outside of the manufacturer.    \u201cRight now, it\u2019s pretty clear things are happening in a vacuum and there is not an overall strategy,\u201d then-director of corporate communications Lori Lodes wrote in a 2019 email. \u201cPlus, with one hand we are making these changes and the other is actively fighting Right to Repair legislation moving in 20 states without real coordination for how updated policies could be used to leverage our position.\u201d    In another instance, then-senior product manager for AR and VR Cameron Rogers told Schiller in a 2019 email that it was unclear to him and others within Apple why a particular gaming app was not included on the App Store.    \u201cIt still isn\u2019t obvious to people inside the company that work directly on the App Store. I think few people understand the subtleties of the rules as well as you do,\u201d Rogers wrote.    -  Executives sought to draw a distinction between Google and Apple in arguing it should not be a target of Warren\u2019s push to break up Big Tech:  Top PR officials at Apple sought to separate their brand from Google\u2019s as they discussed how best to respond to Warren\u2019s platform of breaking up Big Tech.    Apple\u2019s former VP of Communications Steve Dowling wrote to his team last year that arguments against Warren\u2019s platform should seek to show Apple is not a monopolist \u201cthat\u2019s shown by market share\u201d and emphasize, \u201cHow do we handle competition with our own apps? We don\u2019t do things like pushing down results, etc., as Google (one of her real targets) has.\u201d The charge seems to refer to allegations that Google prioritizes its own features in search results or stacks ads at the top of the page. Google has denied unfairly disadvantaging websites in its search product.    What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Regulators could seek to prove that Apple applies its App Store rules disproportionately to disadvantage rivals. However, they\u2019d likely need to make a credible case that Apple\u2019s decisions are fueled at least in part by an attempt to preference its own services, rather than consumer protection issues it claims to champion. Still, if regulators can show Apple inconsistently applied its rules across developers and made better terms for some for its own business reasons, it could face serious scrutiny.    Apple did not provide a comment on the emails.   Google   What an antitrust case could look like:  Google\u2019s sprawling business has attracted antitrust scrutiny on multiple fronts. Regulators have looked into Google\u2019s search business, online advertising platform and Android mobile operating system. Here\u2019s what they might be looking for in each:    - Search: Vertical search competitors like  Yelp  and  TripAdvisor , which offer search engines for specific purposes like local businesses or travel, have complained for years that Google prioritizes its own services over their own, like by offering its own competing services above theirs in relevant Google search results.    The FTC has investigated Google\u2019s search practices in the past and in 2013, its commissioners unanimously voted to close the investigation. An internal report later obtained by the  Journal  showed that FTC staff had recommended bringing a case against Google on multiple grounds, though they recommended against a lawsuit over allegations Google favored its own vertical search features over competitors\u2019 even though staff said its actions resulted in \u201csignificant harm\u201d to rivals.    - Advertising:  Google\u2019s advertising business has attracted scrutiny over a variety of concerns that essentially boil down to the question of whether Google\u2019s expansive control over the digital media supply chain allows other companies to compete. While Google has competitors across many functions of the advertising marketplace, it operates in both the buy-side and sell-side of transactions, leading to some questions about whether it remains objective about where it routes advertising dollars. Competitors also argue that Google\u2019s prices are hard to match because it bundles its ad tools. And on YouTube, Google eliminated the ability to buy ads through third-party services, funneling all spend through its own tools.    - Android:   Finally, with its Android mobile operating system, Google requires device manufacturers who use its platform to pre-install its app store and other native apps like Gmail and its Chrome web browser. The European Commission required Google to stop bundling its apps on Android phones and allow allow EU users to select their default search engine after  fining the company $5 billion  over alleged antitrust abuse.    Most Interesting finds:  The internal emails released show how Google executives considered the ways they could position various aspects of the business to become most integral to their users\u2019 lives.    -  Executives recognized threats from social media platforms and vertical search competitors and aimed to draw users to their own offerings:  The documents show Google\u2019s fixation on being the leader in search. In a report about how the company would stay ahead in search in 2007, Google said it should \u201cTurn having the largest user base into an unfair advantage by building out tech that improves linearly with user base size.\u201d     The report recognized MySpace \u201cas the clear leader\u201d in people search and social networking at the time. It noted that sites like MySpace and YouTube \u201cwill ultimately represent a threat to our search business as people will spend more time on those sites and ultimately may do most searches from the search boxes available there. They aren\u2019t direct competitors, but they may displace us in end-user time tradeoff.\u201d    \u201cIn the future, we do not want users [to] \u2018myspace\u2019 people for more information. Google should host all information about a person, including myspace info,\u201d the report later states.    In 2012, executives discussed their strategy around vertical search, where competitors like Yelp and  Booking.com  had taken hold. Jeff Huber, a senior vice president who led location services and commerce at the time, explained in an email why he believed it was important to have a presence in verticals like travel and shopping.    \u2033[I]f we don\u2019t have experiences in these areas that are compelling compared to increasingly concentrated branded alternatives, we risk losing relevance overall (e.g., Amazon is increasingly becoming the place you search for things and Google is the place you search for information).\u201d    Still, then-SVP of Knowledge Alan Eustace warned, \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to fight amazon on their turf by building and branding a single purpose experience by a separate team. The same goes for Yelp and Local.\u201d Instead, he advocated for an interface that works across several verticals.    -  Executives saw a potential deal with YouTube as a way to prevent Yahoo from buying it:   As Google executives pondered whether to buy YouTube, one key consideration appeared to be thwarting Yahoo from snatching up the video service.    Huber, the SVP of geo and commerce at the time, wrote in a 2005 email, \u201cI think we should talk to them, if nothing else to make it more expensive for Yahoo. They\u2019ll also eventually need a monetization/ads model, so we should use ours instead of anything from Yahoo (if they don\u2019t go acquisition soon, and we maintain reasonable relations with them).\u201d    Still, then-Group Product Manager Peter Chane wrote that there would be plenty of other acquisition targets for Yahoo to aim for.     \u2033[I]f we pick them up it would be defensive vs yahoo but there are 20 more sites like this that yahoo could go and buy,\u201d he wrote at the time.    Google ended up buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion.    What it could mean for a potential antitrust case:  Like the documents released for the other companies, it is hard to point to any email as a smoking gun. But if regulators were to build an antitrust case against Google, documents like these could be used to show patterns in Google\u2019s competitive strategy, like buying a company to prevent a rival from doing it first or building and prioritizing native tools on its search engine platform to keep users from clicking away to competitors\u2019 websites.    Google did not provide a comment on the emails, but a spokesperson downplayed the company\u2019s dominance in search, saying Amazon gets more searches for consumer products than Google does, for example.    -CNBC\u2019s  Jessica Bursztynsky ,  Michelle Gao  and  J.R.

CNBC dug through the hundreds of pages released by the committee to find the most revealing details laid bare in the companies\u2019 private correspondences The CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet were careful not to say too much as they were last Wednesday. But after the hearing say plenty.  The release is a curated selection of the 1.3 million documents collected by the committee during its more than year-long investigation into competition concerns with the four tech giants. It includes emails and chat logs between executives at the four companies and with those they sought to acquire. It shows industry leaders strategizing ahead of decisions that would become turning points in the legacy of their businesses, like Facebook\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram or Amazon\u2019s decision to undercut prices for diapers to compete with Diapers.com.  The four companies turned over the documents at the request of the committee. But the huge trove of evidence is likely just a fraction of that which federal and state regulators have been poring over as they decide whether to bring an antitrust case against any of the tech giants. Google appears to be most immediately in danger of such an outcome as The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that the Justice Department is gearing up to announce an antitrust case as soon as this summer.  U.S. &amp; World   Stories that affect your life across the U.S. and around the world. In some cases, regulators may have had these documents before, like when requesting more information on a potential deal. Alicia Batts, a partner in the antitrust and competition practice at Squire Patton Boggs, said it\u2019s not uncommon for \u201cbad documents\u201d to surface in a merger investigation.  \u201cIt\u2019s an indication to look deeper but not necessarily an indication you won\u2019t be able to close [the deal],\u201d she said in an interview this week with CNBC. \u201cWhen you have both documents that show a company is planning to harm competition and the economic data or the economic model support that it\u2019s possible, that\u2019s when the documents are given the most weight.\u201d  CNBC dug through the hundreds of pages released by the House Judiciary Committee last week to find the most revealing details laid bare in the companies\u2019 private correspondences.   Here are the most notable finds and what they could mean for a potential antitrust case against each company.  Facebook   What an antitrust case could look like: Experts speculate that an antitrust case against Facebook would center largely around its acquisition strategy and whether it broke merger laws by buying up a nascent competitor or violated anti-monopoly law by taking anti-competitive actions to build or maintain dominance in its market.  Most interesting finds: The most compelling documents released by the committee on Facebook reveal top executives\u2019 thinking behind its acquisition of Instagram, one of the two deals that are now thought to have played a key role in Facebook\u2019s continued growth, along with its acquisition of WhatsApp. Some enforcement advocates, like , believe that had those apps not been acquired at an early stage, they could have grown into formidable competitors against Facebook.  - Facebook executives feared decelerating engagement prior to the Instagram deal:Executives fretted about Facebook\u2019s relatively weak offerings on mobile, where Instagram had built its growing userbase.   \u201cWe have this big issue right now because gaming is shifting from us to mobile platforms,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in one April 2012 email. \u201cIt\u2019s causing all this negative momentum in a bunch of ways around gamer overall user engagement, ad spend from gamers, overall revenue, etc.\u201d   - Facebook executives appeared threatened by Instagram\u2019s growth in 2012:Zuckerberg acknowledged the threat posed by Instagram in conversations with his deputies. In February 2012, Zuckerberg wrote in an email to his then-CFO David Ebersman he was considering how much Facebook should be \u201cwilling to pay to acquire mobile app companies like Instagram and Path that are building networks that are competitive with our own.\u201d He said that while those competitors have small teams, they have shown fast growth and even if they don\u2019t want to sell, a high enough price may change their minds.   \u201cThe businesses are nascent but the networks are established, the brands are already meaningful and if they grow to a large scale they could be disruptive to us,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.  In April 2012, he told one employee in an email, \u201cInstagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business though. For the others, if they become big we\u2019ll just regret not doing them.\u201d   - Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom feared Zuckerberg entering \u201cdestroy mode\u201d if he didn\u2019t sell: As Zuckerberg began to court Instagram for a potential deal, Systrom messaged one of his investors, Benchmark Partner Matt Cohler, in February 2012 for advice on how to politely rebuff an offer. Systrom seemed adamant in wanting to stay independent to see how far he could take Instagram on his own. But he wanted Cohler\u2019s advice on whether Zuckerberg would \u201cgo into destroy mode\u201d if he rejected an offer.   \u2033[P]robably,\u201d Cohler responded, \u201d(and probably if we just don\u2019t engage at all).\u201d  As they strategized the best response, Systrom acknowledged, \u201cbottom line I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever escape the wrath of mark haha\u201d  Later on, messages between Systrom and Zuckerberg leading up to their agreement to merge shed light on what Instagram had to fear if they were to go it alone.  \u201cOf course, at the same time we\u2019re developing our own photos strategy,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote, \u201cso how we engage now will also determine how much we\u2019re partners vs competitors down the line.\u201d  What it could mean for a potential antitrust case: Even if regulators believe Facebook executives were afraid of the potential rise of Instagram and WhatsApp, it may not be enough to accuse them of violating merger law. To prove that Facebook violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act through those acquisitions, the FTC may have to prove not only that Instagram and WhatsApp were capable of growing into competitors to Facebook on their own, but also that they were one of the very few firms that were committed to getting into Facebook\u2019s market and capable of doing so.  \u201cWhat that means is, if at the time of the acquisition it looks as if Instagram was just one of many nascent folks nibbling at the heels of Facebook, the case law makes it very hard for the government to block that kind of an acquisition,\u201d said Bill Baer, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who formerly led the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition and DOJ Antitrust Division during Democratic administrations.  A Facebook spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that the company had submitted the documents included in the Judiciary Committee file in its disclosure to the FTC in 2012 when the agency reviewed Facebook\u2019s proposed acquisition of Instagram. That indicates the FTC determined at the time that those statements did not preclude the merger when weighed against economic models predicting the companies\u2019 future success.  But looking back is often easier than looking forward. Showing a pattern of anti-competitive acquisitions or other behavior could potentially help build a case against Facebook under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the anti-monopoly law, or Section 5 of the FTC Act, which grants what some believe to be broader power to the regulator.  Section 5 empowers the FTC to prevent companies from engaging in \u201cunfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\u201d  \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about Section 5, it\u2019s not just [the] Sherman and Clayton Act, but it\u2019s kind of the spirit of the antitrust laws,\u201d said Batts, the Squire Patton Boggs partner.  This could also be an issue the House Judiciary Committee tackles with its legislative proposals expected to follow the conclusion of its probe. Lawmakers may determine the bar is too high to decide a deal is anti-competitive and adjust the language to make it easier for authorities to bring a case on such grounds.   Facebook did not provide a comment on the documents.  Amazon   What an antitrust case could look like: An antitrust case for Amazon may resemble the line of thinking Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offered in her presidential campaign platform on breaking up Big Tech. Warren argued large tech companies designated as \u201cPlatform Utilities\u201d should not be able to control and participate on their own platforms. The FTC has been talking to third-party sellers on Amazon\u2019s platform, according to Bloomberg, following concerns that Amazon undercuts sellers on its marketplace.  A recent Wall Street Journal investigation found that Amazon employees had used internal data to inform their private-label brand strategy and compete with other sellers. Though the employees reportedly used aggregated reports combining multiple sellers\u2019 performance, they sometimes contained as few as two sellers, making it easy to extrapolate a single seller\u2019s data. Amazon has said it was launching an internal investigation into the allegations by the Journal, but said it didn\u2019t believe the claims to be true.  Most Interesting finds: Amazon\u2019s internal emails mostly shed light on the company\u2019s acquisition mindset and pricing strategy to compete with Diapers.com before it acquired its parents company.  - Amazon undercut Diapers.com\u2019s prices before buying it:A top executive, then-vice president of worldwide corporate development Douglas Booms, identified Diapers.com as Amazon\u2019s \u201d#1 short term competitor\u201d in a 2009 email. \u201cAs I\u2019ve mentioned to each of you, I think, we need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost,\u201d Booms wrote.  Over the next year, Amazon began operating its diaper business at a loss, a , offset by other segments of the baby business.   Once executives learned Diapers.com\u2019s parent company, Quidsi, was planning to launch a new vertical, Soap.com, executives crafted a plan to keep it at bay.  \u201cWe have already initiated a more aggressive \u2018plan to win\u2019 against diapers.com in the diaper/baby space, which includes market leading pricing on diapers (\u201cdouble your SNS discount to 30% off diapers and wipes\u201d), a free PRIME offering for new Moms, and a structured and marketed \u2018Amazon Mom\u201d program,\u2019\u201d said Doug Herrington, then-VP of consumables at Amazon. \u201cTo the extent this plan undercuts the core diapers business for diapers.com, it will slow the adoption of soap.com.\u201d  Amazon announced in 2010 its move to buy , only to after Amazon said it failed to become profitable.  - Bezos planned to buy \u201cmarket position - not technology\u201d with Amazon\u2019s Ring acquisition:CEO Jeff Bezos acknowledged in an email to executives in 2017 that he wantedto buy doorbell security camera system Ring to solidify market position.   \u201cTo be clear, my view here is that we\u2019re buying market position - not technology,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cAnd that market position and momentum is very valuable.\u201d   What it could mean for a potential antitrust case: Regulators could use the Diapers.com documents to argue that Amazon engaged in predatory pricing to eliminate a competitor. But doing so is not as easy as showing it discounted goods below its costs, which is a standard competitive practice in some cases and could be considered beneficial for consumers if it results in sustained lower prices.  The FTC says on its website that while prices can at times be \u201ctoo low,\u201d this doesn\u2019t happen often.  \u201cConsumers are harmed only if below-cost pricing allows a dominant competitor to knock its rivals out of the market and then raise prices to above-market levels for a substantial time,\u201d the agency says. \u201cA firm\u2019s independent decision to reduce prices to a level below its own costs does not necessarily injure competition, and, in fact, may simply reflect particularly vigorous competition.\u201d  Baer, the former federal antitrust enforcer, said laws prohibiting predatory pricing are not meant to discourage price competition. But discounting could lend way to anti-competitive practices when a firm later has the ability to raise prices after eliminating its rival.   \u201cIf you are pricing below an appropriate measure of your cost for the purpose of injuring a competitor and you have the ability to recoup those losses once your competitor is out of business or retreats from its discounting practices, that is potentially an antitrust violation,\u201d Baer said.  Still, the documents released by the committee so far don\u2019t shed much light on what could become the true focus of an antitrust investigation: how Amazon competes with sellers on its platform. That doesn\u2019t mean those documents don\u2019t exist, though, or that regulators aren\u2019t learning more about those relationships in their interviews with competitors and insiders.  Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. Apple What an antitrust case could look like: The antitrust theory against Apple centers on its control of the App Store. While iPhones are prevalent throughout the U.S., Apple only ranks third in worldwide market share for smartphones at 13.3%, according to IDC, while the market leader Samsung holds a 21.2% share.  A potential case against Apple could look similar to one against Amazon, focusing on the fact that it both owns a marketplace (the App Store) and has its own pre-loaded apps like Apple Music and Apple Podcasts that compete with other apps on its platform, like Spotify.  Some developers who offer their apps through the App Store \u2014 the only way Apple allows for apps to be added to users\u2019 devices \u2014 have complained about Apple\u2019s opaque and sometimes seemingly arbitrary process for accepting new apps. Most recently, the , Hey. Apple had originally claimed it did not meet standards in an early version because it did not offer a way for users to make an account through the app, which would require the developers to give Apple a 30% cut of iOS sign-ups in the first year. An updated version of the app was later approved.  Spotify has been among the most vocal opponents of what it\u2019s dubbed the \u201cApple Tax,\u201d the 15% to 30% cut Apple takes for payments processed through apps offered on the App Store. Apple claims the commission covers the cost of running the App Store, but developers have complained that the cost can be prohibitively high and Apple does not provide alternative payment methods. The into Apple\u2019s App Store and Apple Pay.  Most Interesting finds: The documents released paint a picture that Apple\u2019s rules around its App Store may not be as rigid as the company has repeatedly insisted they are.  - Apple executives discussed exceptions to how it applied its App Store rules: Faced with criticism over its opaque enforcement of App Store rules, Apple has publicly stated that it approaches enforcement consistently.   \u201cWe apply the rules to all developers evenly,\u201d CEO Tim Cook testified at the antitrust subcommittee hearing last week.   But internal emails released by the Judiciary Committee show that Apple has at times loosened its rules for some developers. In 2016, for example, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in an email that Apple had and no cut for already-subscribed customers.   Although it\u2019s unclear from the emails what terms the companies ended up acting on, Cue\u2019s promise is different from what Apple typically says it charges developers: a 30% cut of in-app purchase revenue in the first year and 15% every year after for recurring subscriptions.  - Apple\u2019s evolving stance on parental control apps frustrated developers, including big brands like T-Mobile:Several emails included in the release revolve around developers and customers complaining about Apple\u2019s enforcement of rules for parental control apps. Apple cracked down on several such apps last year, as The New York Times reported, coinciding with the announcement of Apple\u2019s own feature to track screen time. Apple said at the time the removal of the apps was based on the discovery that they could gain too much access to information on users\u2019 devices and it was unrelated to the screen time feature launch. In an email responding to a concerned user, Apple\u2019s App Store boss Phil Schiller said the technology used to control devices \u201cis not intended to enable a developer to have access to and control over consumers\u2019 data and devices, but the apps we removed from the store did just that.\u201d  Back in 2018, then-T-Mobile COO Mike Sievert emailed Schiller complaining about its FamilyMode app being removed from the App Store after back and forth with Apple about getting it into compliance. Schiller ended up offering to reinstate the app on the platform for two weeks while T-Mobile worked to remedy the alleged violations.  Apple later loosened its restrictions on parental control apps, causing further frustration for some. One developer complained to Apple executives they had spent $30,000 to retool their parental control app with the guidance of Apple employees only to later find the rule was changed, presumably in such a way that it would not have had to make that investment. Responses from Apple executives to the developer were not included in the documents released.  - Even some Apple employees seemed confused by the company\u2019s policies: In a couple emails, Apple executives seemed unclear on the company\u2019s rules or at least acknowledged the ambiguity around its policies.  Emails between PR executives in 2019 showed those tasked with communicating Apple\u2019s views on right to repair legislation were unclear on the company\u2019s stance. The proposals aimed to make it easier for consumers and third-parties to find and offer repair services outside of the manufacturer.  \u201cRight now, it\u2019s pretty clear things are happening in a vacuum and there is not an overall strategy,\u201d then-director of corporate communications Lori Lodes wrote in a 2019 email. \u201cPlus, with one hand we are making these changes and the other is actively fighting Right to Repair legislation moving in 20 states without real coordination for how updated policies could be used to leverage our position.\u201d  In another instance, then-senior product manager for AR and VR Cameron Rogers told Schiller in a 2019 email that it was unclear to him and others within Apple why a particular gaming app was not included on the App Store.  \u201cIt still isn\u2019t obvious to people inside the company that work directly on the App Store. I think few people understand the subtleties of the rules as well as you do,\u201d Rogers wrote.  - Executives sought to draw a distinction between Google and Apple in arguing it should not be a target of Warren\u2019s push to break up Big Tech: Top PR officials at Apple sought to separate their brand from Google\u2019s as they discussed how best to respond to Warren\u2019s platform of breaking up Big Tech.  Apple\u2019s former VP of Communications Steve Dowling wrote to his team last year that arguments against Warren\u2019s platform should seek to show Apple is not a monopolist \u201cthat\u2019s shown by market share\u201d and emphasize, \u201cHow do we handle competition with our own apps? We don\u2019t do things like pushing down results, etc., as Google (one of her real targets) has.\u201d The charge seems to refer to allegations that Google prioritizes its own features in search results or stacks ads at the top of the page. Google has denied unfairly disadvantaging websites in its search product.  What it could mean for a potential antitrust case: Regulators could seek to prove that Apple applies its App Store rules disproportionately to disadvantage rivals. However, they\u2019d likely need to make a credible case that Apple\u2019s decisions are fueled at least in part by an attempt to preference its own services, rather than consumer protection issues it claims to champion. Still, if regulators can show Apple inconsistently applied its rules across developers and made better terms for some for its own business reasons, it could face serious scrutiny.  Apple did not provide a comment on the emails.  Google   What an antitrust case could look like: Google\u2019s sprawling business has attracted antitrust scrutiny on multiple fronts. Regulators have looked into Google\u2019s search business, online advertising platform and Android mobile operating system. Here\u2019s what they might be looking for in each:  - Search:Vertical search competitors like Yelp and TripAdvisor, which offer search engines for specific purposes like local businesses or travel, have complained for years that Google prioritizes its own services over their own, like by offering its own competing services above theirs in relevant Google search results.  The FTC has investigated Google\u2019s search practices in the past and in 2013, its commissioners unanimously voted to close the investigation. An internal report later obtained by the Journal showed that FTC staff had recommended bringing a case against Google on multiple grounds, though they recommended against a lawsuit over allegations Google favored its own vertical search features over competitors\u2019 even though staff said its actions resulted in \u201csignificant harm\u201d to rivals.  - Advertising: Google\u2019s advertising business has attracted scrutiny over a variety of concerns that essentially boil down to the question of whether Google\u2019s expansive control over the digital media supply chain allows other companies to compete. While Google has competitors across many functions of the advertising marketplace, it operates in both the buy-side and sell-side of transactions, leading to some questions about whether it remains objective about where it routes advertising dollars. Competitors also argue that Google\u2019s prices are hard to match because it bundles its ad tools. And on YouTube, Google eliminated the ability to buy ads through third-party services, funneling all spend through its own tools.  - Android: Finally, with its Android mobile operating system, Google requires device manufacturers who use its platform to pre-install its app store and other native apps like Gmail and its Chrome web browser. The European Commission required Google to stop bundling its apps on Android phones and allow allow EU users to select their default search engine after over alleged antitrust abuse.  Most Interesting finds: The internal emails released show how Google executives considered the ways they could position various aspects of the business to become most integral to their users\u2019 lives.  - Executives recognized threats from social media platforms and vertical search competitors and aimed to draw users to their own offerings: The documents show Google\u2019s fixation on being the leader in search. In a report about how the company would stay ahead in search in 2007, Google said it should \u201cTurn having the largest user base into an unfair advantage by building out tech that improves linearly with user base size.\u201d   The report recognized MySpace \u201cas the clear leader\u201d in people search and social networking at the time. It noted that sites like MySpace and YouTube \u201cwill ultimately represent a threat to our search business as people will spend more time on those sites and ultimately may do most searches from the search boxes available there. They aren\u2019t direct competitors, but they may displace us in end-user time tradeoff.\u201d  \u201cIn the future, we do not want users [to] \u2018myspace\u2019 people for more information. Google should host all information about a person, including myspace info,\u201d the report later states.  In 2012, executives discussed their strategy around vertical search, where competitors like Yelp and Booking.com had taken hold. Jeff Huber, a senior vice president who led location services and commerce at the time, explained in an email why he believed it was important to have a presence in verticals like travel and shopping.  \u2033[I]f we don\u2019t have experiences in these areas that are compelling compared to increasingly concentrated branded alternatives, we risk losing relevance overall (e.g., Amazon is increasingly becoming the place you search for things and Google is the place you search for information).\u201d  Still, then-SVP of Knowledge Alan Eustace warned, \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to fight amazon on their turf by building and branding a single purpose experience by a separate team. The same goes for Yelp and Local.\u201d Instead, he advocated for an interface that works across several verticals.  - Executives saw a potential deal with YouTube as a way to prevent Yahoo from buying it: As Google executives pondered whether to buy YouTube, one key consideration appeared to be thwarting Yahoo from snatching up the video service.  Huber, the SVP of geo and commerce at the time, wrote in a 2005 email, \u201cI think we should talk to them, if nothing else to make it more expensive for Yahoo. They\u2019ll also eventually need a monetization/ads model, so we should use ours instead of anything from Yahoo (if they don\u2019t go acquisition soon, and we maintain reasonable relations with them).\u201d  Still, then-Group Product Manager Peter Chane wrote that there would be plenty of other acquisition targets for Yahoo to aim for.   \u2033[I]f we pick them up it would be defensive vs yahoo but there are 20 more sites like this that yahoo could go and buy,\u201d he wrote at the time.  Google ended up buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion.  What it could mean for a potential antitrust case: Like the documents released for the other companies, it is hard to point to any email as a smoking gun. But if regulators were to build an antitrust case against Google, documents like these could be used to show patterns in Google\u2019s competitive strategy, like buying a company to prevent a rival from doing it first or building and prioritizing native tools on its search engine platform to keep users from clicking away to competitors\u2019 websites.  Google did not provide a comment on the emails, but a spokesperson downplayed the company\u2019s dominance in search, saying Amazon gets more searches for consumer products than Google does, for example.  -CNBC\u2019s Jessica Bursztynsky, Michelle Gao and J.R. Reed contributed to this report. .

(BBVA) has issued the following press release:  <br/><br/><br/>Technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain and APIs continue to dominate the forecasts of the leading experts in the fintech sector. However, there are some new caveats for 2018, due to regulatory pressure. As the digitization of financial services gathers force, BBVA stands among the banks that have invested most in their digital transformation.  </p><p><br/>anuary is the month when analysts, news media and experts in the world of fintech speculate about the trends that will have the greatest impact in the next 12 months. A series of technology trends have occupied the headlines for years. Artificial intelligence, open banking and blockchain are three that are back again this year, but with a more practical focus. The message is clear: there\u2019s been sufficient time for testing; now it180;s time to implement real solutions.  The open banking challenge  <br/>Jim Marous, analyst, author of the Digital Banking Report and co-editor of The Financial Brand, shared his summary of the Forrester report in an article in early January entitled Predictions 2018: Financial Companies Get Serious About Digital Transformation. The article features 16 predictions, along with recommendations for the fintech sector for the new year.  <br/>The digitalization of financial services \u2013 which banks cannot afford to ignore \u2013 continues uninterrupted, as does the long overdue update of the banking industry\u2019 s back office. \u201cLeading financial services groups such as BBVA, Intesa Sanpaolo, and Lloyds Banking Group are already spending hundreds of millions on digital business transformation,\u201d the report says. Forrester also encourages banks to open up to the world of the fintech companies, in order to offer new services and reach new customer segments.  <br/>Forrester also warned about the new regulatory context in 2018. It predicts that \u201cfew organizations will embrace open banking.\u201d Although in Europe PSD2 has accelerated this transformation, and other regions have followed suit, Forrester says most banks still don\u2019t have a clear idea of how to proceed in the face of this new reality. Instead of budgeting these changes as a \u2018cost\u2019, Forrester recommends taking advantage of APIs as an opportunity to redefine the business model\u2014a strategy that BBVA has adopted in launching its API_Market.  Join forces to be more competitive  <br/>Understanding the tug of war with regulators will just be the first step of this new year. According to Forrester, financial and non-financial entities will be able to create ecosystems to improve the customer experience, and position themselves to compete with the big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Alibaba and Facebook. These changes will also open the door to new alliances in financial services and other areas.   Explore more133;  <br/>   Fintech and the banks, coming closer together   <br/>In fact, Forrester considers 2018 to be the year in which the alliances between banks and fintech companies will no longer be limited to small startups, as companies like Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba enter the playing field.  <br/>The issue of what role the big tech companies will play in the new open banking context was also present in the predictions of other specialized media. Let\u2019s Talk Payments has marked 2018 as a decisive year for determining whether consumers trust these companies or if they prefer traditional banking. \u201cThe jury is still out,\u201d the website says.  <br/>David Birch, journalist for Wired magazine, has a clearer idea. In his article, Forget banks, in 2018 you\u2019ll pay through Amazon and Facebook , he predicts that this year\u2019s regulatory changes will tip the scale in favor of the tech companies. According to Birch, \u201cTo stay in the loop, retail banks may choose a strategic option built around identity, trust and reputation.\u201d  Digital expectations increase  <br/>Regardless of who takes the biggest piece of the pie, what is clear to the experts is that users are not going to be content with just anything. \u201cConsumers and prospects don\u2019t care about a bank\u2019s clogged-up digital backlog or an insurer\u2019s problems with its legacy systems,\u201d says Forrester.  The consultancy warned that in 2018, \u201cStop-gap solutions will no longer suffice.\u201d The solution will change to making significant investments in infrastructure, in order get untangled from the legacy of a pre-digital culture.  <br/>Marous summarizes the situation as follows, \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s about value creation for the consumer, who will reward the organizations that make their daily life easier.\u201d The analyst also published on his website a compilation of the 10 strategic priorities for retail banking this year, in which the number one priority is \u201cremoving friction from the customer journey,\u201d followed by expanding the use of data and advanced analytics, and improving the multi-channel experience.  <br/>Chris Skinner, presenter and author of two successful books about the digital revolution in the banking industry, also approaches some of these aspects in his predictions for 2018. Specifically, he emphasizes the industry\u2019s need to \u201crationalize and clean up\u201d organizations\u2019 data structures, which are often fragmented, as an essential step to taking advantage of the potential of AI.  <br/>Regarding this technology, the author also says that 2018 will be the year in which the banking industry finally starts to implement it on a mass and generalized scale, especially in the fields of risk management and compliance. \u201cWhen most banks have one in three members of their staff checking compliance, it makes absolute sense to replace them with learning software,\u201d he writes.  Blockchain gets serious, and its challenges follow suit  <br/>Another of the technological environments that should bear real fruit after years of expectation will be blockchain. Skinner predicts a more generalized use in 2018, once the institutions start to \u201cgo live with real-world applications.\u201d Alicia Pertusa, Transformation Manager of BBVA Investment Banking, agrees with this logic. She thinks that 2018 will be the inflection point for moving past the pilot projects and concept tests. Specifically, Pertusa highlights the initiatives of three entities\u2014ASX (Australia Stock Exchange), We.trade and Calypso Technologies\u2014which will enter into the phases of production and marketing DLT-based projects in 2018.  <br/>An article in Forbes magazine analyzing the impact of political, economic and technological events in 2017 within the landscape of the fintech sector evaluated the immediate future of blockchain in similar terms: \u201c2018 will welcome a range of regulatory requirements and financial institutions are launching new blockchain-based products in order to simplify compliance, and this is where the Ethereum blockchain is becoming increasingly popular.\u201d  <br/>However, alongside the euphoria surrounding the uses of blockchain, there is also a place for skepticism. Mike Orcutt, editor of MIT Technology Review, summarized the questions faced by DLT technologies that must be overcome in order for the big revolution that experts expect in 2018 to occur. \u201cIn 2017 we were told that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies were going to save the world, disrupting just about anything with a digital fingerprint. But we saw very few tangible examples that justified the hype,\u201d writes Orcutt. According to the specialized journalist, we\u2019ll continue to hear many voices that want to join the technology movement, but the difference is that in 2018, \u201cthe challenge will consist of creating real products and services.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN522398820180123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RHK-HPD1-DXCW-D4HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1261\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 23, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Act on the news with POLITICO Pro .    Quick Fix    \u2014 Veepstakes in the tech world: Joe Biden will reveal his pick for vice president any day now, and one thing\u2019s for certain \u2014 there is likely no world in which any running mate will revive the Silicon Valley-White House chumminess of the Obama years.   \u2014 In profile:  Jim Hood, who went after Google for nearly a decade as Mississippi\u2019s attorney general, is now back for more as a consultant on the multistate investigation into the company\u2019s online dominance.   \u2014 Google vs. Oracle:  The sparring tech giants filed their final briefs with the Supreme Court before it hears arguments in their hotly watched copyright case in October \u2014 the capstone on a more than decade-long legal battle.

HERE\u2019S WHAT IT MEANS FOR TECH \u2014 He\u2019s played it close to the chest, but he\u2019s about to show the country his cards: The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee is expected to reveal his pick for second-in-command this week. Here are his short-listers\u2019 ties to the tech world and where they stand on the policy issues.   \u2014 Sen. Kamala Harris: As a 2020 candidate, Kamala Harris took a crack at regulating government use of facial recognition and turned up the dial on her criticism of social media companies. Last fall, Harris led the charge of 2020 Democrats urging Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend President Donald Trump from the platform \u2014 demands the company rejected . She also called to rein in Facebook and said CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s claim that breaking up his company would make it harder to tamp down on dangerous content was \u201ca ridiculous argument.\u201d More recently, the California lawmaker has slammed Facebook\u2019s progress on civil rights issues and questioned its readiness to protect the November election. But she wasn\u2019t always tough on tech.   Harris\u2019 track record on tech issues dates back to her time as the state\u2019s attorney general, when she recommended mobile apps make consumer privacy a bigger priority, for example. But she was just as much \u201ca cheerleader for Silicon Valley\u201d during that period, said Jeff Hauser, whose Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research has been tracking tech\u2019s ties to the election. \u201cShe was the attorney general as Uber developed its business model; as Facebook and Google took over publishing; and she does not have much of a record of antitrust activism,\u201d Hauser told POLITICO. \u201cI think her likely rise to VP will make big tech breathe more easily,\u201d he said, adding that Harris was Silicon Valley\u2019s favored candidate \u201cuntil Pete Buttigieg won their hearts.\u201d (Harris counts executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM, LinkedIn and Microsoft among her donors , according to Revolving Door.)   So how aggressively would she come down on tech as No. 2? \u201cShe is comfortable nibbling around the edges,\u201d Hauser said, but don\u2019t expect \u201csearing scrutiny of the business models of these companies.\u201d More here on Harris\u2019 views on tech and telecom .   \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren: Among the shortlisters, Elizabeth Warren \u2019s stance on tech is perhaps the clearest-cut. The Massachusetts lawmaker notably brought \u201cbreak up big tech\u201d rhetoric to the 2020 campaign trail and was more outspoken than any other candidate on tech market power issues \u2014 particularly around Amazon, Google and Facebook \u2014 an area she has also championed while in Congress. (Look no further than her recent merger ban legislation and her concern about ongoing deliberations over the Google-Fitbit deal.)   Warren has also spoken out on the industry\u2019s labor issues, calling for better protections of gig economy and warehouse workers. Finally, Warren has voiced national security concerns about Chinese companies like telecom giant ZTE \u2014 an issue likely to stick around in any winning administration. More here on Warren\u2019s views on tech and telecom .   \u2014 Rep. Karen Bass: The California lawmaker sits on House Judiciary\u2019s subcommittee on intellectual property and the internet. And because her district includes Los Angeles \u2014 which is increasingly becoming a major tech and startup hub \u2014 her work on the panel has focused on both the tech and entertainment industries. Her priorities include advocating for \u201ca free and open internet,\u201d according to her congressional page , and cracking down on so-called patent-trolls, which threaten to sue tech companies on weak patent infringement grounds and open up those burgeoning firms to unnecessary legal battles. \u201cThe practice has now become a cottage industry with tech companies being bombarded with threats of suits, often without merit,\u201d Bass\u2019 page says, stressing how stronger requirements for obtaining patents and more funding for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office could better protect American tech companies from being exploited.   Bass is a supporter  of net neutrality. She has also grilled Google CEO Sundar Pichai on the search giant\u2019s efforts to counter online trolls and bots post-2016 \u2014 particularly those aimed at sowing racial divisions in the U.S. \u2014 and steps Google is taking to protect the 2020 election.   Even so: \u201cI would suspect that Bass would not be preferred by Silicon Valley,\u201d Hauser told MT. \u201cShe is a committed progressive, and if I were Silicon Valley, I\u2019d be worried about Karen Bass .\u201d   \u2014 Sen. Tammy Duckworth: The Illinois lawmaker is a member of the Senate Commerce Committee who has been active on telecom issues ranging from net neutrality to inmate communications. Just last week, Tammy Duckworth (alongside Sen. Amy Klobuchar ) led a group of Democratic senators in a letter calling on chamber leadership to include language in a forthcoming coronavirus relief package that would give inmates at state and local facilities access to free phone and video calls, as John reported . (Much of Duckworth\u2019s work on criminal justice reform has centered on the importance of keeping inmates connected with family members, making equity in prison communications \u2014 from phone calls to video visits \u2014 a longtime pet issue .) Like Bass, Duckworth is also a net neutrality supporter who has thrown her weight behind attempts to restore the Obama-era rules walked back by the Trump administration.   \u201cI\u2019ve seen no indication to think she\u2019d rock the boat ,\u201d Hauser said of Duckworth. \u201cI don\u2019t think Silicon Valley would have anything to fear.\u201d   \u2014 Former national security adviser Susan Rice: Rice, a former U.N. ambassador and national security adviser under the Obama administration, is the only VP candidate who has never run for elected office. Because she\u2019s never had to directly fundraise, it\u2019s harder to assess her ties to tech or any other industry. \u201cRice remains a big question mark,\u201d Hauser told MT. \u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of biography than we\u2019re accustomed to analyzing.\u201d   Even so, there is likely no world in which any potential running mate would replicate Silicon Valley\u2019s cozy relationship with the Obama-Biden administration. \u201cI think post-Cambridge Analytica, that\u2019s not possible,\u201d Hauser said, referring to the data privacy scandal that rocked the last election cycle. The antitrust scrutiny and concerns around Covid-19 that have surfaced since then, he added, are going to make a return to the days of coziness \u201cimpossible.\u201d Read POLITICO\u2019s full running-mate rundown here .    IN PROFILE: JIM HOOD, \u2018THE MAN GOOGLE LOVES TO HATE\u2019 \u2014 Hood \u201cantagonized Google for nine years as Mississippi\u2019s attorney general, going after the internet giant for enabling the sale of illegal drugs, allowing pirated content to flourish online and serving up targeted ads to children. And Google fought back: Hood holds the title of the only U.S. public official the company has ever sued,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Leah Nylen reports. \u201dNow Hood has returned for more. Earlier this year, he signed on as a consultant to the massive, multistate investigation into the company\u2019s dominance online. \u2026 The states\u2019 decision to bring on Hood, who stepped down in January following an unsuccessful bid for governor, suggests they are expecting a drawn-out legal battle that will require persistence, and maybe a bit of an attack dog.\u201d Read the full story here .   SCOTUS WATCH  \u2014 Oracle and Google have traded their latest jabs before the Supreme Court in their decade-long copyright lawsuit. In supplemental briefs filed Friday, the companies offered opposing views on how seriously the court should consider the decision the jury reached in Google\u2019s favor during a previous trial. Oracle says the jury\u2019s verdict was a suggestion the court needn\u2019t uphold, while Google argues the justices shouldn\u2019t deviate from the decision.   \u2014 That will be one of several legal questions facing the justices as they decide whether Google had the right to incorporate code created by Oracle into its Android mobile platform without permission or paying a fee. This is likely the companies\u2019 last message to the court before delivering oral arguments Oct. 7. That hearing, originally slated for the spring, was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.          Transitions    Ch-ch-changes at the FCC : C. Sean Spivey is joining the office of Chair Ajit Pai as wireless and international advisor, replacing Aaron Goldberger , who will return to the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau; Allison Baker is also joining Pai\u2019s office, as economic advisor. Pai\u2019s rural broadband advisor Preston Wise is expanding his duties as wireline advisor, replacing Nirali Patel , who will head back to the Wireline Competition Bureau; Melissa Kirkel , who has been focusing on wireline issues as special counsel on detail in Pai\u2019s office, is also returning to the Wireline Competition Bureau.   Lobbying latest, via POLITICO Influence : The Internet Association has added Monument Advocacy to its lineup of outside lobbying firms. Stewart Verdery and four other Monument lobbyists will lobby on issues related to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, according to a disclosure filing.   Caleb Watney , who has been a technology and innovation fellow at the R Street Institute, is next week joining the Progressive Policy Institute as director of innovation policy. \u2026 Friday\u2019s MT incorrectly described the following transitions: TheBridge co-founder Allie Brandenburger and Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights fellow Dave Toomey are joining TechCongress as advisors and mentors to incoming fellows.     Silicon Valley Must Reads    Or should we call this section: The tick tock on TikTok.   ICYMI: TikTok on Friday threatened to take legal action against Trump\u2019s executive order that would bar the app\u2019s Beijing-based parent company from doing business with U.S. firms, POLITICO reports .   Loud noises! A weekend dispatch from The Washington Post details the Trump administration infighting, complete with an Oval Office \u201cshouting match,\u201d around the White House\u2019s handling of TikTok.   The plot thickens: \u201cTwitter has had preliminary talks about a potential combination with TikTok,\u201d WSJ reported Saturday .   Gates says:  In an interview with WIRED , Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates weighed in on the company\u2019s potential purchase of TikTok.     A message from Ericsson:     5G will drive a revolution in capabilities, leading to research and innovation advances that will support a multitude of industries and new devices. For the US to remain competitive in 5G innovation, we need timely access to substantial mid-band spectrum.

China, meanwhile, is hoping Trump will lose.   More ominous news for November: \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic should not open the floodgates to internet voting, security experts and a Democratic senator warned over the weekend, no matter how dangerous it may be to vote in person or how rosy technology vendors\u2019 promises may be,\u201d POLITICO reports .   That\u2019s showbiz, baby: A federal court in the Southern District of New York terminated the Paramount Consent Decrees with the major Hollywood studios, \u201cwhich for over seventy years have regulated how certain movie studios distribute films to movie theatres,\u201d The Justice Department announced Friday .

But the enormous cash sums on the sidelines meant that Wall Street actually started the week at higher levels.</p><p>But last night a number of broking houses started to point out to the investment community what a Joe Biden presidency would mean to US markets.</p><p>They included Boston-based Christine Todd, who is head of US fixed income for Amundi, Europe's largest investment manager. Todd travelled to Australia last November to alert markets to what a Bernie Sanders presidency <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/markets/how-the-us-presidential-race-will-affect-the-asx/news-story/892726b493078faead5557935b812407\">might look like </url>(Biden was then a rank outsider for democratic nomination ). </p><p>This week Todd and Amundi put out a special bulletin showing that while Biden might be better for markets than Sanders he would still dramatically reduce US share values, particularly when combined with the higher COVID-19 infection rates.</p><p>I will quote from the Amundi warning to explain what is ahead. Almost certainly our market will also be impacted if Biden stays ahead in the polls, albeit that US opinion polls are often wrong.</p><p>Trump has not led in a single major poll so far this year. No prior candidate for president has seen a lead this large at this point of the race. The slide in Trump's approval rating has been most noticeable among senior citizens.</p><p>But until the latest fall, the market was not pricing in risks associated with a potential Biden presidency and/or a Democratic sweep of Congress. </p><p/><p>Biden's agenda would have sweeping implications for every industry and sector of the economy, with significant investment fallout---particularly if Democrats control both houses.</p><p>And Biden's tax plan would reduce after tax corporate earnings considerably. </p><p>President Trump reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 per cent. Biden's agenda increases corporate taxes back to an effective tax rate of 26 per cent.</p><p>Todd and Amundi calculate that Biden's tax increase agenda would reduce the S&amp;P 500 earnings estimate for 2021 by roughly $US20 per share, from $US170 to $US150. As a rule of thumb, every percentage point change in the effective corporate tax rate should change S&amp;P 500 earnings by 1.2 per cent, or $US2 per share.</p><p>Todd and Amundi concentrated on corporate taxation but the Biden agenda also has a range of increased taxes for higher income individual Americans, including a 12.4 per cent Social Security payroll tax on income earned above $US400,000, evenly split between employers and employees; an increase in the top individual income tax rate for taxable incomes above $US400,000 from 37 per cent to 39.6 per cent; taxing long-term capital gains and qualified dividends at the ordinary income tax rate of 39.6 per cent on income above $US1 million and eliminating the so called step-up basis for capital gains taxation. </p><p>In addition, Biden plans to cap the tax benefit of itemised deductions to 28 per cent of value, which means that taxpayers in the brackets with tax rates higher than 28 per cent will face limited itemised deductions.</p><p>The money raised by the higher corporate and individual taxes will be directed towards increased access to healthcare and support minority communities through a new affordable housing program. There will also be substantial investment in infrastructure.</p><p>A key part of the Trump administration has been the reduction in regulation. Biden will re-regulate many areas.</p><p>Todd and Amundi say a reversal in the reduction of regulations during the Trump administration may hurt financials, big tech, energy, healthcare, and any labour-intensive business. Longer term, larger industry incumbents with strong competitive positions can most easily absorb increased regulations and pass on increased costs. Past examples of this include tobacco, utilities, managed care, and defence</p><p>Todd and Amundi believe Biden may keep a tough stance on China, though with less harsh rhetoric than Trump.</p><p>Can Trump come back? It will not be easy. His two best chances are the fact that many middle-class blacks believe the race issue has been hijacked by lawless Americans and are nervous. More importantly California's ban on independent contracting caused a huge swing to Republicans in a recent Californian equivalent of a by-election. Biden plans to embrace that agenda which will cause huge disruption in the US small business community. None of these matters are on the opinion polling agenda.</p><p>We are looking at a different America under Biden and one that will not be anywhere near as favourable to the share market. It will also require some flexibility in Australian foreign affairs and defence policy.</p><p>Meanwhile if the Biden/COVID-19 US correction continues, Australian June 30 superannuation balances will be lower.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

This restriction applies to all Google-owned platforms including YouTube and any websites where Google sells digital ad space. On Sunday, March 18, 2018, Sky News reported[1] Twitter will ban a range of cryptocurrency advertising by April 2018, including advertising for initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency wallets and some cryptocurrency exchanges. Twitter has not publicly communicated the ban nor has it denied the report.As Matthew Frankel with the Motley Fool suggests[2], the main purpose of Google's ban could be to protect investors without harming those already currently involved in the industry for the sake of positive development of the blockchain technology business ecosystem as a whole. Still, the reasoning and repercussions of this ban are worth investigating further. </p><p>While straightforward in delivery, the announcement itself has far-reaching implications for advertisers in the cryptocurrency space. The instance also leaves others with one more example to gauge Google's position of power, responsibility and liability over online communication. The news came as part of Google Adwords' annual 'trust and safety' report[3] in the form of a new policy 'to restrict the advertisement of Contracts of Difference, rolling spot forex and financial spread betting' \u2014 all speculative high-risk methods for generating greater amounts of profit in the short term with a low barrier of entry. Because cryptocurrency has always been associated with financial volatility and has more recently become a hot-button topic in finance and technology in general, understanding why Google has banned these other financial products might indicate a more rational consideration for the ban. Specifically, the update stated that advertisements for 'cryptocurrencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets and cryptocurrency trading advice) will no longer be served.' While the statement goes on to say that certain Contracts of Difference, rolling spot forex and financial spread betting can be authorized to advertise through Adwords in certain countries based on Google's certification, there is no mention of cryptocurrencies. Finally, 'Advertisers can request certification with Google starting March 2018 when the application form is published.' Blanket Approach Bitcoin Magazine spoke with Rick Hanna, a digital strategist with BTC Inc, to better understand the situation. According to Hanna, setting the update (bans are not typical) ahead of time, for June 2018, is typical of Google Adwords updates and changes. 'It gives their developers and end users time to implement and adjust for the changes. And a lot of cryptocurrency advertisers will be using Google and Facebook for the time being until it closes.' For Hanna, based on past behavior, the most atypical thing about Facebook and Google's announcements is the 'blanket approach' which bans all cryptocurrency advertising: 'Blanket approach raises eyebrows because you recognize how much they act as gatekeepers. A blanket ban seems a bit heavy-handed to squash a few bad eggs.' Hanna recognized that other social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Medium and Reddit will be used more often unless they follow suit. Reasons and Repercussions Tatiana Moroz is the founder of Crypto Media Hub, a consultancy specializing in advertising, PR, marketing and events for the cryptocurrency space since 2015, with clients like Vaultoro, Blockfinity and Zencash. While her company targets mainly publisher advertising, whether that be through website banner ads and original content or on events, rather than on Google or Facebook, Moroz helped to articulate big tech's thinking for the ban as well as potential repercussions for companies who rely on various advertising platforms to get their message across. 'This is not intended to sound conspiratorial in any way, but I think that Facebook and Google are very large corporations embedded in the establishment system,' Moroz told Bitcoin Magazine. 'They get a lot of benefit from that system. That has been proven with the way they censor their users and the way they exploit their users by incorrectly selling their information. When I look at their policy on cryptocurrency, I think that it's a disruptive technology that could potentially eat their lunch.' On the other hand, Moroz also admitted that these same corporations have valid concern with regard to liability: 'The SEC regulation around cryptocurrency has been somewhat unclear in an ever-evolving landscape, so, by allowing cryptocurrency advertisements, they might be opening themselves up to legal liability without necessarily knowing it.' Separating the Wheat From the Chaff Even for media and marketing companies that specialize in cryptocurrency, filtering potential clients through a vetting process that weeds out scams or potential pump-and-dump projects can be a difficult process that must constantly be redefined. From this perspective, the prospect of laying down a blanket approach to banning all cryptocurrency advertisements may be the easiest way to save time, while eliminating liability and mitigating the responsibility of imposing an evaluation framework that could stunt the industry or appear in any way, shape or form as collusion. However, the reality of the power which both Facebook and Google hold over the digital world means that even if they are attempting to mitigate their responsibility for something as new and unpredictable as cryptocurrency, banning cryptocurrency advertising is still a method by which they are able to choose the players who can (or cannot) grow their businesses through digital advertising. According to an eMarketer article[4] from last year, together, Google and Facebook were expected to control 63.1 percent of U.S. digital ad investment by the end of 2017. Art, Not Science 'As a marketing company, it's very difficult to choose which projects to work on,' admitted Moroz. 'It can be an intimidating process for everyone, but I do believe that there needs to be some way to figure out whether a company is real. On the other hand, I am not a venture capitalist or lawyer so I can't necessarily gauge each [project's] ability to be successful.' 'We try to be selective with who we work with, but knowing about legitimacy is an ongoing problem within this space. I don't think Google is in any position to be able to gauge that better, so, on a case-by-case basis, that may be difficult for people at this time.' It should be noted that when considering how to separate legitimate cryptocurrency companies from scams, it is not often so black and white \u2014 most companies fall somewhere in the middle. As a result, it may not always be easy to distinguish illegal activity from mere mediocrity or incompetence. Cryptocurrency Advertising in a Post-Google and Facebook World Assuming that Google, Twitter and Facebook's cryptocurrency advertising ban is here to stay, cryptocurrency and, to an extent, blockchain technology companies in general will be facing new challenges when it comes to promoting their brands and getting customers without the help of three of the internet's largest corporations. 'I definitely expect to see some blowback from the crypto-community since social media has become the primary channel for communications in this very new market,' said Swan Burrus, a strategist with OgilvyOne Worldwide. Burrus also speculated as to whether further restrictions on these same platforms could be placed on bounty programs which incentivize support and promotion for specific cryptocurrencies. Moroz, on the other hand, believes filling the space left by the absence of advertising on search engine and social media platforms will result in higher quality interactions through community involvement and relationship building.I think it is going to become even more focused on relationships and finding trusted partners who can help them navigate the space. If you can't necessarily afford an agency to do that, it would be worthwhile to at least do research or talk to people who have gone through that process. Projects can always go to different communities or cryptocurrency publishers that they trust for advertising.Though going through the internet's biggest online players will likely present advertisers the largest opportunity to receive the most impressions per ad, other organizations who work for cryptocurrency companies have found that it is not always best. According to Shane Jordan, vice president of strategic insights at Spark Public Relations, Google and Facebook play a much more peripheral role than one would first think:In our experience and data results, the Google and Facebook ad networks have not proved to be a significant driver of conversion and, thus, in past campaigns we have only included Google and FB ads as a very small percentage of the advertising media mix.With the understanding that advertisers who use data will build ad campaigns around those places on the internet where performance measures highest, Jordan said his team works more often with publishers. 'We've found that the best performing channels have been direct display advertising on targeted websites where we know crypto-investors get their news and market insights \u2014 and this is where we will continue to focus our efforts.\" At the industry's early stage, there is still clear disconnect or misconception between where advertising should place ads and where their customers want to see them. Joking on the complicated yet fascinating dynamic of the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology space on an episode of his podcast, Cointalk, writer Jay Kang aptly summarizes an ideal future for cryptocurrency that many will continue to work toward:What we really want is an atmosphere where you can make a good faith investment in a project because you think that the project has merit and potential for whatever reason. And that it is not going to be overrun by scammers, that theses shady things will not happen to them, that the exchange where they keep their money will not get hacked. And we'll eventually get there.

The Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general from across the country have all begun to investigate the tech giants like Facebook and Google, and with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren leading the charge, Democratic presidential hopefuls now have to stake out their own positions.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)                </p><p>ELIZABETH WARREN:                 I'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy.             </p><p>TOM STEYER:                 I agree with Senator Warren that, in fact, monopolies have to be dealt with. They either have to be broken up or regulated, and that's part of it.             </p><p>CORY BOOKER:                 Anybody who does not think that we have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy...             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 That's Cory Booker, and before him, Tom Steyer. To explain why this has become a leading political issue and what breaking up big tech might even look like, I'm joined now by someone who has spent years thinking about it, Columbia law professor Tim Wu. Welcome.             </p><p>TIM WU:                 Pleasure to be here.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 So I know you've explained this to lawmakers on the Hill already, but I want you to explain it to us now. What do you think the harm is that these companies are creating? Because they do offer free services, so we're not talking about, like, price gouging. Is this more about, say, elimination of choices?             </p><p>TIM WU:                 Yeah. It's the harms that come with monopolization, which is the ability of a company to get away with stuff. So if you take a company like Facebook facing very little competition, they've been able to decrease the privacy protections that they offer people. If you look at a company like Google with not much competition in search, they've been raising and raising their advertising rates. So it's less in the old-fashioned price-fixing kind of conspiracy but more about users having less choice, less places to go and, therefore, companies being able to get away with more.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 So do you think the Facebooks or the Googles, Amazons of the world are actually violating current antitrust law?             </p><p>TIM WU:                 You know, it depends on the company and the case, but I think there's enough evidence to look hard at the question. I've spent the most time looking at Facebook. They bought out a lot of their most dangerous rivals in the early 2010s. It's against the law to buy your competitors. Instagram and WhatsApp or two of their competitors they bought. So I think there's at least, you know, probable cause that they've done something. The case against Google is a little more complicated, but some people believe that there is enough there to take a look as well.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 Now, Elizabeth Warren, she has said that big tech companies - specifically Amazon, Google and Facebook - should be broken up. She says Amazon should not own Whole Foods, for example - should not own Zappos, the shoe company. Google should spin off Google Search - you know, things like that. So let me ask you, is breaking up these companies the best approach?             </p><p>TIM WU:                 It depends. I mean, I think sometimes, it is. Returning to Facebook, I think their acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram were illegal and anti-competitive, and so if they were asked to spin off those companies under the acquisitions, it would be a form of breakup, but one I think that would reintroduce competition. I think breakups or undoing of mergers are actually called for more than we have appreciated in the last few decades, but you don't want to create new problems.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 What kind of problems do you foresee?             </p><p>TIM WU:                 In any action, there's unintended consequences. If you imagine, for example, breaking up Apple into three little mini-Apples, there might be more competition, but it might be that people's phones don't work as well or, you know, they lose whatever magic mojo they had. So you don't want to actually make things worse for people, but that said, I think breakups have the positive effect of rebooting an industry, starting things afresh and frankly, historically, have often been better for people in the long run than anyone predicted.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 That's Tim Wu of Columbia Law School. He's the author of \"The Curse Of Bigness: Antitrust In The New Gilded Age.\" Thanks very much for joining us today.             </p><p>TIM WU:                 My pleasure.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-2019102104</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB4-KRK1-JBKP-Y03M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 21, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate was the first in a now crowded field to advocate the dismantling of Facebook and other Big Tech giants via <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/2019/05/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-elizabeth-warren-big-tech-breakup/\">antitrust legislation</url>. Her proposal sets forth an iron-fisted approach to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">curtailing the power</url> of platforms that have ballooned dramatically in the last 20 years and reshaped the digital landscape in their increasingly ruthless image. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren's call has caught on among <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/12/2020-democrats-big-tech-companies-1427758\">2020 presidential hopefuls</url>. They were recently joined by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, who wrote in support of      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/2019/05/facebook-cofounder-chris-hughes-dissects-mark-zuckerberg-problem-nyt-opinion/\"> breaking up the company</url> he helped create in a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times </emphasis>op-ed. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/subscribe/\">Subscribe to Observer's Business Newsletter</url></p><p>The internet's biggest data-thief is certainly due for a reckoning. Between helping to erode U.S. democracy in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/2018/07/uk-regulators-fined-facebook-660k-over-cambridge-analytica/\">Cambridge Analytica scandal</url>, allowing foreign governments to influence elections, and its repeated failings to protect and make clear how it treats user data, the public has had every reason to flee the platform en masse. </p><p>For Hughes and many Democratic candidates, the trick to reining in Facebook's influence is to strip it for parts and heavily regulate what remains. Spinning the companies under its umbrella-such as Instagram and WhatsApp-into separate businesses would certainly spur more competition and perhaps birth an upstart capable of cutting into Facebook's outsized digital territory. Or so the thinking goes. </p><p>Matt Stoller, an antitrust expert and fellow at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://openmarketsinstitute.org\">Open Markets Institute</url>, has written in favor of using antitrust law to cut down on Big Tech's power. It's an approach that would use the government to enforce data protection and to smash down the walls that make interoperability between platforms impossible, among other things. </p><p>\"This isn't rocket science,\" Stoller told Observer. \"The government should just hire an investment bank to break up the company. Then regulate the data practices and interoperability so that social networking is a neutral communications platform instead of a predatory one.\"</p><p>But <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/23/big-tech-google-facebook-unions-public-ownership\">as many have argued</url>, throwing a capitalist solution at the ultra-capitalist problems posed by Big Tech might not be an easy fix. Since competition is what gave rise to the current wave of Big Tech domination, unleashing more data-hungry platforms onto the market might serve to cause more of the issues that Facebook created. </p><p>What then, is needed to mitigate the concerns sparked by Facebook and its unabated growth? </p><p>Diana Moss, president of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.antitrustinstitute.org\">American Antitrust Institute</url>, thinks that antitrust regulation only serves to tackle the singular issue of competition between platforms. To tackle privacy-a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/27/americans-complicated-feelings-about-social-media-in-an-era-of-privacy-concerns/\">marquee issue for most people who use social media</url> and one that has sparked rare instances of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/384550-senators-introduce-bipartisan-internet-privacy-bill\">bipartisan accord</url>-something else is needed. </p><p>\"It's not even clear that breaking up a Facebook or any sort of platform into separate individual companies would do anything to enhance incentives to protect privacy,\" Moss explained. </p><p>It's true that the slurping of user data is integral to the growth of Facebook and any other social media platform offered for free in today's market. The social network's business is inextricably tied to its pursuit of user-generated information; acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp only broadened the scope and power of Facebook's advertising networks in this regard.</p><p>In that sense, antitrust wouldn't really crack down on the likelihood of catastrophic data leaks and hacks that expose users to the void. Nor would it fundamentally alter Facebook's business model to stop prising away as much data from you as possible. </p><p>\"Antitrust isn't going get to that problem because privacy is more of a social regulation problem,\" Moss said. \"So just like we have health and safety regulation to protect consumers, we would have social regulation designed to protect the privacy of users.\"</p><p>The most obvious parallel of how this might work is the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which imposes standards of compliance for data use and the potential of steep fines if those standards are violated. (Facebook is currently awaiting a <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/2019/04/facebooks-ftc-2020-candidates-internet-privacy/\">$5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</url> over allegedly violating its users' privacy.)</p><p>But levying fines on Facebook is only one way to compel the company into obedience. What's ultimately needed, Moss argues, is a new kind of multi-layered legislative framework. </p><p>\"You would need a major piece of legislation,\" to rein in Facebook's abuse, she said, \"to motivate and to put into place a sort of social regulatory framework to address\" this problem. </p><p>That idea was recently studied in great detail by the Roosevelt Institute. The think tank published an extended look at what a landmark piece of legislation could do to limit the hegemonic power of Big Tech in its report, <url normalizedValue=\"http://rooseveltinstitute.org/the-case-for-the-digital-platform-act/\">The Case for a Digital Platforms Act</url>. In a sense, the Roosevelt Institute and Moss are both advocating for a new kind of legislation to deal with the dilemmas posed by new technology. </p><p>\"If there needs to be more intervention and oversight in these platform markets, and to rein in the platforms, then I think there's going to have to be some sort of proposal to create a new form of regulation that's sort of a hybrid, or a hybrid oversight process,\" Moss said. \"There would have to be new acts introduced, we'd need a new sector regulator that's responsible for overseeing and regulation and compliance.\"</p><p>Even though that kind of strict legal framework might be a long way out, it's hard to deny that it's needed. In the meantime, you might want to get ready for more of the same from Facebook as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-setting-rules-on-political-ads-isnt-facebooks-job/\">we approach the 2020 elections.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYOBSR-Tue21May2019155820+0000WhatBreakingUpFacebookWouldActuallyEntailAccordingtoExperts</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYOBSR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5B-JT51-DY6Y-M1WN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241959</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"940\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Observer, L.P.

That question has sparked widespread debate ever since it emerged last year that the now-defunct consultancy tried to sway voters by using \u00adpersonal data illicitly harvested from Facebook.</p><p>As the controversy has raged, plenty of possible solutions have been tossed around by politicians and pundits concerned about Big Tech\u2019s power. Their proposals include clamping down on data brokers (the shadowy middlemen who buy our personal information from companies and then sell it on) and banning political lobbyists from using targeted ads. </p><p>This month, political voices ranging from Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat senator and US presidential hopeful, to Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister of France, have lambasted the tech giants again \u2014 and the US\u2019s Federal Trade Commission has approved a $5bn fine on Facebook for privacy breaches.</p><p>However, as recriminations fly, it is worth pondering the ideas emanating from another source \u2014 some of the people who worked at CA. </p><p>Yes, that may seem an odd suggestion, given the company has been so pilloried that few observers would trust its former staff. But just as a poacher can give good advice to a gamekeeper on how to find holes in a fence, so some of CA\u2019s former staff are well placed to spot society\u2019s shortcomings when it comes to data laws.</p><p>This week sees the release of the Netflix documentary The Great Hack (made by friends of mine), which shines new light on the CA story. It includes insights from former employees such as Brittany Kaiser and Julian Wheatland, who have striking things to say about the past and the future.</p><p>Wheatland was chairman of parent company SCL and became chief executive of CA during its dying days. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Great Hack</emphasis>, he argues that the data-mining and manipulation techniques the company used were not actually that unusual, since variants of them are endemic in the ad tech industry.</p><p>Some will dismiss this as special pleading. But if Wheatland is correct, it follows that you cannot solve the problem just by shutting down one company. Indeed, he argues that the only solution is not just tighter regulation but a wholesale change in business culture too.</p><p>Most notably, Wheatland thinks all companies today must recognise that they are \u201cdata companies\u201d \u2014 even if they don\u2019t label themselves as \u201ctech\u201d \u2014 because corporate life in any field generates data. It should therefore be mandatory, he says, for companies to have a \u201cchief ethics officer\u201d to drive debate about how personal data is used. Should it be sold to data brokers, for example?</p><p>\u201cHaving a chief ethics officer won\u2019t prevent anything by itself, but it\u2019s part of building a governance infrastructure of controls and processes that can prevent data from being misused,\u201d Wheatland told me after the release of the film. \u201cA quick look at Cambridge Analytica or Facebook should be enough to convince anyone that these matters are of existential significance, and have the power to impact brand value on a huge scale. What we\u2019re really talking about is how to win \u2014 and maintain \u2014 public confidence and trust.\u201d</p><p>Kaiser, a former director at CA, proposes a different solution: she thinks digital consumers \u2014 all of us, in other words \u2014 should \u201cown\u201d our data, to ensure that no company can take it without paying first. She hopes entrepreneurs will create systems that enable us to store, track and trade our personal data, and is working on some solutions herself. \u201cWe need \u00addigital property rights,\u201d she says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It would be naive</emphasis> to think these ideas alone could \u201cfix\u201d the problem; tougher regulation is needed too. But, for my money, they are certainly worth debating, whatever you think of the source. </p><p>The idea of creating a digital chief ethics officer, for example, is sensible, since it would at least force shareholders, employees and boards to discuss the issue openly \u2014 and might make voters and politicians realise that the only reason we have a flourishing data-brokerage sector is because so many companies sell our personal data. Data ethics should almost certainly be placed on business school courses.</p><p>Kaiser\u2019s idea about digital property rights also deserves attention. Right now it is not clear that consumers want the inconvenience of having to \u201csell\u201d their data in order to offset the need to pay for services that they currently get for \u201cfree\u201d (in exchange for having their data harvested). Indeed, when tech companies have offered more control to consumers, for a fee, there has been relatively little take-up. But it is possible that a tech entrepreneur will eventually find an attractive and easy system to provide this \u2014 some Silicon Valley techies are already funding attempts to do so.</p><p>Either way, the key point is this: tackling Big Tech\u2019s privacy issues will require a mature conversation about how to learn from the past, as well as action from companies, academics, regulators \u2014 and consumers. </p><p>Political rhetoric and billion-dollar fines make neat headlines but they are not a magic wand, especially as data continues to proliferate and other companies keep aping the tactics that Cambridge Analytica used.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Gillian will be speaking at the FT Weekend Festival on September 7 at Kenwood House, Hampstead Heath, London NW3; <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftweekendfestival.com/\"> ftweekendfestival.com</url></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Gillian on Twitter <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/gilliantett\"> @gilliantett</url> or email her at </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"> @FTMag</url> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

I recommend watching the hearing; it's long but worth it if you want insight into what we need to do to avoid damaging our economy and society further.</p><p>Big Tech has been in the political crosshairs for several years, but public condemnation has not negatively impacted these firms. Today, the top five firms in the American S&amp;P500 comprise Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook, representing 22 per cent of total market capitalization. Criticism has barely dented investor confidence in them. We'll have to wait and see whether this recent hearing will do more.</p><p>What does all of this mean for Canada?</p><p>Well, the Canadian federal government launched its Digital Charter last year in order to rethink the way we should regulate the digital economy. Not much has emerged since, however, although the U.S. hearing provides us with some sense of the rethinking we need to do.</p><p>First, no one knows how to value our personal data properly, which means we don't know how to govern its use. Current accounting standards don't allow firms to treat data as an asset. We're left with a simple assumption that more data is better. It's critical to establish standards for treating data as an asset, as it will better illuminate the data monopolies in the digital economy.</p><p>Second, once we know where the data is and its value, we can regulate Big Tech firms properly. Regulating the use of our data requires us to know who has it, what they have, and how they plan to use it, all of which should be included in any new standards. We'll then have a better sense of whether a particular merger or acquisition leads to a greater concentration of data or not.</p><p>Third, standards and regulations will enable us to make alternative choices about how to govern our data. Currently, we leave it to technology firms to do as they wish. With a clearer sense of our data we can make choices about whether we want a more collective regulation of our data, treating it less as an economic resource and more as a social good. The data trusts proposed for Sidewalk Toronto are one example, but there are many ways we could manage our data for collective benefit.</p><p>Finally, we can't assume that all Big Tech firms are the same: they collect different types of data and use it in different ways. As platforms, though, they tend to create enclave economies in which they control data collection and use, competition, fees and costs, and even the rules of the game. They reflect a broader trend in America identified by the economist Thomas Philippon away from competition and towards monopoly, resulting in higher consumer costs and the corruption of politics.</p><p>Canada needs to avoid this American path, and we can build that into the Digital Charter.</p><p>Kean Birch is an associate professor in the department of geography at York University.\u00ee\u0153\u00a3</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020081058576255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JM-3PP1-DY91-K3WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"495\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I recommend watching the hearing; it's long but worth it if you want insight into what we need to do to avoid damaging our economy and society further.</p><p>Big Tech has been in the political crosshairs for several years, but public condemnation has not negatively impacted these firms. Today, the top five firms in the American S&amp;amp;P500 comprise Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook, representing 22 per cent of total market capitalization. Criticism has barely dented investor confidence in them. We'll have to wait and see whether this recent hearing will do more.</p><p>What does all of this mean for Canada?</p><p>Well, the Canadian federal government launched its Digital Charter last year in order to rethink the way we should regulate the digital economy. Not much has emerged since, however, although the U.S. hearing provides us with some sense of the rethinking we need to do.</p><p>First, no one knows how to value our personal data properly, which means we don't know how to govern its use. Current accounting standards don't allow firms to treat data as an asset. We're left with a simple assumption that more data is better. It's critical to establish standards for treating data as an asset, as it will better illuminate the data monopolies in the digital economy.</p><p>Second, once we know where the data is and its value, we can regulate Big Tech firms properly. Regulating the use of our data requires us to know who has it, what they have, and how they plan to use it, all of which should be included in any new standards. We'll then have a better sense of whether a particular merger or acquisition leads to a greater concentration of data or not.</p><p>Third, standards and regulations will enable us to make alternative choices about how to govern our data. Currently, we leave it to technology firms to do as they wish. With a clearer sense of our data we can make choices about whether we want a more collective regulation of our data, treating it less as an economic resource and more as a social good. The data trusts proposed for Sidewalk Toronto are one example, but there are many ways we could manage our data for collective benefit.</p><p>Finally, we can't assume that all Big Tech firms are the same: they collect different types of data and use it in different ways. As platforms, though, they tend to create enclave economies in which they control data collection and use, competition, fees and costs, and even the rules of the game. They reflect a broader trend in America identified by the economist Thomas Philippon away from competition and towards monopoly, resulting in higher consumer costs and the corruption of politics.</p><p>Canada needs to avoid this American path, and we can build that into the Digital Charter.</p><p>Kean Birch is an associate professor in the department of geography at York University. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020081058576255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JM-3F71-JDH1-C344-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"495\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

Contrary to what it may seem, the demand for computer scientists is not limited to positions in Silicon Valley technology companies, according to computer science professors. Instead, the increasing use of technology throughout the business world means that companies in many industries are hiring grads of computer science programs. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's a golden age right now for computer science, and we're very fortunate in this field,\" says Salvatore Stolfo, a professor of computer science at <url normalizedValue=\"https://premium.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/columbia-university-190150\">Columbia University</url> in New York City. \"For people who study computer science in their education, it's a great, great time, and essentially the sky is the limit.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An April <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm\">employment forecast</url> from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website indicates that the number of job opportunities for computer science grads is growing. According to the forecast, employment within computer and information technology occupations is expected to increase by 13% between 2016 and 2026, which is faster than the average among all occupations. </p><p>Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also shows that some careers common among computer science degree-holders frequently lead to six-figure salaries. For instance, in May 2018, the median salary among computer and information research scientists was $118,370, and the median salary among computer network architects was $109,020. Software developers also typically received generous paychecks: their median salary in May 2018 was $105,590. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/articles/2018-03-20/computer-science-grads-can-earn-more-than-mbas\">Computer Science Grads Can Earn More Than MBAs.</url>]</p><p>Sam Gavis-Hughson, the CEO and founder of Byte by Byte, a company that helps aspiring software engineers prepare for job interviews at prestigious tech corporations like Amazon and Facebook, says people who lack a genuine interest in technology should not pursue a computer science degree simply because of the allure of high salaries. \"I think that a lot of people are doing it for the money and not doing it because they enjoy programming,\" says Gavis-Hughson, who earned a bachelor's degree in computer science from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/princeton-university-2627\">Princeton University</url>. </p><p>He says programming is only fun for people who have a knack for problem-solving, adding, \"Not everyone has that really analytical sort of mind.\" </p><p>However, Gavis-Hughson acknowledges that a computer science degree is broadly applicable. \"One of the greatest things about a (computer science) degree is that it allows you to work in whatever industry you desire,\" he wrote in an email. \"Every single industry requires programmers, so you can decide what path you want to pursue. For example, you could do software development and work for Warby Parker and be in fashion, or work for Google doing (artificial intelligence) type projects.

He says it's important for computer science degree-holders to know that there are degrees in computer science outside of San Francisco. \"There's no particular region of the U.S. where computer science is not in demand,\" he says. \"Choose where you want to live, choose who you want to work for, and pretty much you will find a job or position there and for them.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Searching for a grad school?

That valuation puts it behind onlyMarriott (NASDAQ: MAR) in the hotel space. Here's the potential -- and the potential risk -- with this company, and its possible IPO this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A full transcript follows the video.</p><p>10 stocks we like better than\u00a0Wal-Mart</p><p>When investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they\u00a0have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*\u00a0</p><p>David and Tom\u00a0just revealed what they believe are the\u00a0ten best stocks\u00a0for investors to buy right now... and Wal-Mart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they\u00a0think these 10 stocks are even better buys.</p><p>Click here\u00a0to learn about these picks!</p><p>*Stock\u00a0Advisor returns as of December 12, 2016</p><p>The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned.</p><p>This podcast was recorded on Jan. 25, 2017.</p><p>Vincent Shen: I think the question that a lot of people have on their mind around Airbnb with this news and in general, the company having at this point a $30 billion valuation, is: When is the IPO going to happen? I know a lot of this is going to be coming from rumors and the momentum of other deals, but what do you think?</p><p>Seth McNew: Yeah, exactly! It's really all speculation at this point. The company hasn't announced any specific plans other than saying that they are working to shore up their financial position so that they're ready for an IPO, but pretty much, the CEO says it's not in their near-term plans. Now what \"near term\" means, none of us know. Does that mean late 2017? We're not really sure. I think the really interesting part is that the valuation is there. Their most recent round, which was in part by an arm of\u00a0Alphabet, lists them as valuing at $30 billion, second largest right behind\u00a0Marriott.</p><p>Shen: The company at this point has raised over $3 billion in it's eight, nine years of existence. With that $30 billion valuation, for the numbers that I could find, it's really hard, obviously, because they haven't filed an S-1 or anything like that, but the 2015 revenue number that I could find was $900 million. Estimates of 2016 revenue at $1.7 billion, which is 90% year-over-year top-line growth -- pretty incredible. Definitely seems like they're managing to maintain that momentum behind new listings being added, guests buying into the service. But the core issue for a lot of these unicorns still is on the bottom line -- not surprisingly -- the company is still operating at a loss. The most recent number I could find was for 2015. The operating loss was estimated as $150 million. You're absolutely right, company management could be biding their time trying to figure out when. The process might take six months, but you want to know what the market is like for IPOs. One bad deal from a big tech start-up could spell bad news for a lot of deals that are expected to come after that.</p><p>Beyond the IPO, I think another issue is of the legal challenges and regulations. You mentioned to me before the show that when you just search news for Airbnb, the majority of the content is around some legal challenge or hearing in some city abroad or even within the States, like New York City. What are they facing right now? What's the big challenge?</p><p>McNew: I think you're right, and it's coming from cities internationally as well. Europe, they're having huge issues with that, some of the government regulations there. I think the big challenge is, how are you going to maintain that top-line growth if your biggest markets, New York, San Francisco, if the governments there are working to limit how much people can make using Airbnb, how long they can list properties for -- those kinds of things.</p><p>I think they're doing the right things to try to combat this. They're diversifying a little bit. They're working with regulators to make sure that they can get the right tax information. They recently, last year hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to be on their board to help them navigate some of these things. I think they're doing the right things. It's certainly a risk, but we'll just have to see how that shakes out.</p><p>Shen: For anyone who's traveled with Airbnb and you love the service, some of the qualms that local governments have had are around the issue of the short-term rentals potentially limiting housing availability in already very high demand metropolitan cities. Also, driving up pricing for a lot of housing. I think the company has made efforts as a result of all these lawsuits and hearings to try and crack down a little bit on what essentially amount to professional Airbnb landlords. People who have multiple listings. The property, instead of being somewhere they live, and that they rent out on occasion -- I think the limit in certain places for example is 90 days a year; no more than 90 days in the U.K. -- but some of these properties are available 40 weeks a year. Obviously, that is their business -- to rent it out on a regular basis. That's having issues on housing market in general in these cities. That seems to be the issue people are trying to figure out.</p><p>Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Seth McNew owns shares of MAR.

On Friday, Britain will officially leave the European Union, after more than four decades with the closest of ties.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What will change? Nothing! At least, at first.</p><p>For the rest of 2020, free trade and free movement between the United Kingdom and the E.U. will continue. Britain will still contribute to the E.U. budget. And it will still have to abide by E.U. laws - even though British members of the European Parliament will have packed their bags and lost their say in how those laws are determined. </p><p>The biggest jolt to British politics in a generation won't be felt by most until the end of an 11-month transition period. That's when everyone will see a profound change in Britain's relationship with Europe and the world. And there's still lots that needs sorting between now and then. Here's what's on the to-do list.</p><p>It's all about cod.</p><p>British fishing folk, and the folk who love them, have been banging on for years about rapacious Irish, French and Danish fleets over-exploiting rich British waters. </p><p>Fisheries account for a tiny percent - a mere minnow - of Britain's gross domestic product and employ just 24,000 people. But the issue is highly emotional, stirring up nationalist fervor.</p><p>Johnson has vowed that Britain will - no matter what else - reclaim its \"spectacular maritime wealth.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Ireland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, warned on the BBC on Monday: \"You may have to make concessions in areas like fishing in order to get concessions from us in areas like financial services\" in a post-Brexit trade deal.</p><p>The Cod War of 2020 is just beginning.</p><p>During the transition period, Britain will remain in the E.U.'s custom union and single market, but after that, everything is up for grabs.</p><p>Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has declared that the U.K. wants a \"zero tariff, zero quota\" trade pact with the E.U. by the end of the year.</p><p>But the new president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has warned - in a very friendly, very warm, very public way - that it is almost certainly \"impossible\" for the two sides to complete a comprehensive agreement within this \"very tight\" schedule. She suggested that Johnson will have to ask for a delay. Or accept a partial deal - and keep talking.</p><p>The prime minister insists he will walk away if his deadlines are blown and head (again) for the dreaded cliff edge of a no-deal departure. Not everyone believes this.</p><p>Once the U.K. is officially out of the E.U., it can start to negotiate with countries that don't already have trade deals with the E.U. At the top of that list is the United States.</p><p>President Trump, a fan of Brexit, has promised a \"massive\" deal. Both sides have said they want to hammer something out quickly. But there could be stumbling blocks, including over drug prices and taxes on big tech companies.</p><p>There's also the debate about \"chlorinated chicken.\"</p><p>Believe it or not, this is a big thing. Bigger than cod. </p><p>To have easy, free trade of agricultural goods, Europe is pressing Britain to remain aligned with E.U. rules on food safety and animal welfare. But that puts Britain on a collision course with the United States and its relatively lax regulations on industrial farming. American food processors rinse their poultry in a chlorine bath and shoot up their beef with antibiotics - both no-nos in Europe.</p><p>Whether Johnson will bow to the Americans on chlorinated chicken and on allowing U.S. pharmaceutical companies access to the U.K. health-service market were both points of contention in last month's general election. Brits will be watching what he does.</p><p>As Britain goes its own way, it will effectively withdraw from hundreds of pacts signed between the E.U. and the rest of the world.</p><p>The Financial Times counted more than 750 treaties \"running to hundreds of thousands of pages and spanning 168 non-EU countries. Within them are covered almost every external function of a modern economy, from flying planes to America and trading sows with Iceland to fishing in far-flung seas.\"</p><p>Johnson's government has said most of these treaties will be quickly dispatched with a few added lines of text and rubber-stamped by the sides. </p><p>In any case, Britain will need lots of ink.</p><p>Britain will begin introducing spiffy new passports - blue, like in the good old days - early this year. By mid-2020, all new British passports will be blue.</p><p>But they won't have that \"European Union\" stamp on the front cover, which allows the 500\u00a0million citizens of the bloc to travel effortlessly across the member states. </p><p>Free movement will continue through the transition period. Londoners can still freely move to Lisbon, and Berliners can take jobs in Birmingham.

He says the findings also show that marketers still predominantly focus on metrics that hold little meaning outside of their own departments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For instance, only 16% of those surveyed cited \u201ccustomer acquisition\u201d (via paid-for media) as a top-three capability. McIntyre says marketers should start to lean in on KPIs that demonstrate real value to their wider enterprises.</p><p>In doing so, CMOs will foster a greater internal appreciation for the value of marketing efforts and investment, and a greater understanding that using ad tech to acquire new customers is the key to demonstrating such ROI.</p><p>Simply put, all customer experience (CX) programs must create business value, which is gained through acquiring and retaining profitable customers, argues McIntyre. Achieving that value requires better synchronization of ad tech and mar tech. Knowing how to successfully synthesize the two will prove a valuable skill for marketers looking to further their careers.</p><p>Ahead of this year\u2019s Dmexco (short for Digital Marketing Expo and Conference) in Cologne, Germany, Adweek held an online panel conversation via Slack with four experts in the field to gauge their insights on how the intersection of ad tech and mar tech plays out. (The following transcript has been edited for brevity and narrative flow.)</p><p>Panel participants:</p><p>Ronan Shields, programmatic editor, Adweek</p><p>Des Cahill, vp, CMO, Oracle CX</p><p>Bobby Jania, vp, product marketing, Salesforce</p><p>Arun Kumar, CTO/CDO, IPG</p><p>Suzanne O\u2019Kelley, vp, product for buyers, Xandr</p><p>Adweek:The intersection of ad tech and mar tech has been much debated recently. Can you offer your assessment as to what this actually means? For instance, what will the tangible benefits for marketers be? Less wastage on media spend, etc.?</p><p>Des Cahill: Technically, it\u2019s the capability to manage customer and prospect identity and data across the journey. \u2026 Marketers can benefit by personalizing to the customer from unknown to known\u2014across customer journey/lifecycle. More personalization equals more conversion.</p><p>Bobby Jania: The continued merger of ad tech and mar tech represents a desire on the part of marketers to unify their strategies across all customer touch points and deliver personalized engagement. Marketers continuously tell us they want to consolidate the view they have of their customers and be able to act on immediate insights across multiple channels, including digital advertising.</p><p>Cahill: I think Bobby\u2019s point on \u201cact on immediate insights\u201d is a key thing. Also, the ability to act across channels with the same insights.</p><p>Arun Kumar: One of the tangible benefits of a fully connected data technology and services solution is that it can constantly optimize consumer engagement and media spend for marketers. We see this when our clients take advantage of our integrated stack and publisher marketplace as a singular solution.</p><p>@Arun Kumar, can you explain how the integration of Acxiom is helping marketers to get better efficiency out of their media budgets with you?</p><p>Kumar: Like some have said before, it helps us bring the known and the unknown worlds together. For example, we have an automobile client who spends budgets on both advertising and incentives. \u2026 The two were never connected. Why would you bombard a person who is a lifetime buyer of your product repeatedly instead of going after growth and new customers? This results in massive efficiencies but also a better experience for customers and better conversion for clients. Ultimately, suppression in media is hugely important.</p><p>@Suzanne O\u2019Kelley, your outfit [Xandr] is in the process of putting together what some might call a \u201cunique offering\u201d in this respect. Do you care to offer more on how the integration of the AppNexus ad tech assets is progressing the Xandr offering?</p><p>Suzanne O\u2019Kelley: Regardless of the technology they\u2019re using, marketers are continuously looking for opportunities to better understand their customers\u2019 needs. \u2026 Mar tech platforms generally provide visibility for a marketer\u2019s engagements with their customers across a swath of touch points, and may enable engagement in certain areas\u2014say, blogging or email marketing.</p><p>Ad tech platforms have typically been more limited to helping marketers engage with customers through ads, and with the work we\u2019re doing on the Xandr Invest platform, we\u2019re looking to blur those lines.</p><p>[At Xandr], we\u2019re working on pulling together all the insights we have access to across a broad swath of AT&amp;T and other touch points to help marketers improve their engagements with their customers, similar to the stories @Arun Kumar\u00a0referenced above [through new ad formats].</p><p>In my research for this conversation, I came across an analyst presentation that asserts that this convergence has to happen because the \u201cad tech/mar tech ecosystem is broken\u201d\u2014their theory being that there are fundamental cultural differences between the pair. For instance: ad tech is focused on a media model; mar tech has a customer-centric model. Some would even argue there are fundamental cultural differences between both constituencies.</p><p>Cahill: Agree on the cultural differences between ad tech and mar tech on the practitioner side and the vendor side as well. But \u2026 customers are customers, and I am unhappy that I am still being retargeted four months after buying a new car. How many times do they want me to buy it?</p><p>It\u2019s all about creating a central customer profile \u2026 and bringing those together via DMP and ID Graph integration. We think of this [Oracle\u2019s suite of tools] as a customer intelligence platform that spans ad tech and mar tech.</p><p>Jania: Brands are recognizing that they need to put the customer at the center of every interaction, which means that mar tech and ad tech have to leverage the same customer profile. A brand can\u2019t meet today\u2019s customers\u2019 expectations without mar tech and ad tech campaigns being aligned.</p><p>@Arun Kumar, @Suzanne O\u2019Kelley, from your insights, would either of you care to elaborate with observations from your own experiences?</p><p>O\u2019Kelley: It\u2019s hard to underestimate the challenge at hand in actually pulling together consumer insights across all the various engagements and making sure the resulting view is clean and complete.</p><p>It\u2019s extremely complex to ensure that all these different ways marketers are interacting with their consumers are being captured and synthesized in one source-of-truth system in a hygienic and privacy-safe fashion. Because that\u2019s so much to try to cast a net around, there is truth to the observation that many mar tech and ad tech companies have chosen smaller channels to try to get right end to end.</p><p>So you can give a marketer a pretty good sense of their email marketing engagements over here, and a pretty good sense of their digital advertising engagements over there, and maybe there\u2019s even connective tissue (like we offer with Xandr Invest) to enable cross-engagement between an email marketing effort and a digital advertising campaign.</p><p>But despite there being grand aspirations toward unity, in practice the ecosystem is still in the early days of being able to pull all the other touch points together and enable a marketer to influence (and prove they\u2019ve influenced) the user holistically across the full journey.</p><p>Kumar: There are some truths in these generalizations. However, the two do operate with differences in speed as well. It\u2019s not just culture alone.</p><p>Mar tech has been associated historically with greater regulation, while ad tech has been more agile and a little less concerned around privacy and other issues. There is a greater element of distrust in some parts of the ad tech ecosystem which needs to be dealt with.</p><p>Cahill: Enter GDPR \u2026</p><p>Kumar: @Des Cahill, bingo.</p><p>I\u2019d be interested to hear your thoughts on GDPR/CCPA, etc., and the effect such regulations will have on the space. Do you all believe that such regulations are playing into the hands of the \u201cbig tech\u201d platforms\u2014i.e., walled gardens?</p><p>Jania: I think privacy regulations will propel the convergence of ad tech and mar tech.</p><p>Cahill: Organizations want to provide better experiences while also ensuring compliance and brand safety and measurement. \u2026 Easier to do that with centralized customer data governance.</p><p>Kumar: If we are not careful, then, yes, badly drafted legislation can make it onerous for smaller companies to comply. \u2026 And while I am on my soapbox, we have publicly stated that we need one federal set of regulations around privacy and data protection.</p><p>O\u2019Kelley: Ideally, industry collaboration resulting from privacy regulation could enable greater interoperability between marketing solutions, in order to meet market needs and requirements, which would be a positive for marketers.</p><p>What do you all think are the downstream effects of the dominance of walled-garden players in the space?</p><p>O\u2019Kelley: From my perspective, walled gardens may tend to dominate specific media channels (search, social, video). But we haven\u2019t yet seen the rise of walled gardens that have achieved the breadth of footprint across channels that would enable them to be the single source of truth for a marketer looking to understand all their engagements with their customers.</p><p>Kumar: You will have an ecosystem which optimizes toward the interests of the walled gardens as opposed to the interests of consumers or businesses. It will lead to a situation where only those with valuable and/or unique data assets will thrive and negotiate from a position of strength with the gardens.</p><p>Cahill: Forcing better management of first-party data, for sure. Otherwise, companies have to pay a toll to walled gardens to connect with their own customers\u2014not sustainable.</p><p>As my final question, what stage are we at in the intersection/merger of ad tech and mar tech, and what is the next necessary step, in your opinion? And would you care to put a timeline on any of this?</p><p>Jania: To use a sports analogy, I\u2019d say we\u2019re probably in the first half of the game. The convergence of ad tech and mar tech has been going on for a little while now. In the past several years, Salesforce has acquired Krux and Datorama. We\u2019re now in the stages of integration and execution.</p><p>Cahill: We\u2019re in the early stages, but we are consistently hearing this need from our customers and partners. So this is very real. This will be the most interesting vendor and customer growth space for the next five years in the enterprise market. We\u2019re going to see the emergence of the customer intelligence platform (CIP\u2014new acronym. Heard it here first!) that brings together ad tech and mar tech capabilities around a single customer profile.</p><p>Kumar: In the next year or two at best, we should not be talking about ad or mar but just about the application of technology. Making this work best will ultimately require an open-garden framework and transparent approach to data, tech and partnerships to ensure marketers can realize the biggest benefit of their tech and media investments.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1072902</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYM-MJP1-JC8H-T2HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1886\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 2, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The companies cited concerns about the potential for unethical use of the technology and its discriminatory patterns in misidentifying people, and called for Congress to create regulations. Coming amid nationwide scrutiny of policing practices, and following years\u2019 worth of concerns from tech experts and civil liberties advocates about the risks facial recognition poses, it\u2019s significant that companies that develop and sell the tech are finally acknowledging its problems are so serious that they\u2019re now asking for regulations.</p><p>So the next move is clear: Congress needs to step up and pass legislation that will prevent government use of facial recognition that is susceptible to misuse and costly mistakes. The best way to begin is by pressing pause and by placing a moratorium on all government use of the technology, so that it cannot be used improperly while lawmakers examine what uses might be permissible within a strict set of limits.</p><p>In a country where at least one in four police departments already have the ability to use facial recognition, it\u2019s long past time for Congress to act. As The Constitution Project at the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) has been highlighting for years, facial recognition\u2019s threats to civil rights and civil liberties should be of great concern to lawmakers and the general public alike. That this surveillance tool has gone almost wholly unregulated is concerning both because of its potential for abuse, and because its algorithmic biases make it inherently more likely to misidentify people of color, particularly Black Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Misidentifications can lead to improper police action, such as stops, searches, and even arrests targeting innocent people. And at protests in Baltimore in 2015 following the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, police used facial recognition to build lists of individuals at protests for future retaliation. It is not difficult to imagine that happening again, especially during the current wave of police misconduct against protesters.Serious Questions Remain for IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon</p><p>The temporary holds on new sales of facial recognition software leave open a series of important questions whose answers will have a significant impact on how meaningful the companies\u2019 actions are.</p><p>First, will these companies\u2014which now acknowledge the need for regulation\u2014publicly disclose which law enforcement entities they\u2019ve already sold facial recognition to? If the moratoriums are more than a public relations stunt and are based on a genuine belief that regulations are critical, the companies behind them should also demonstrate they believe that the communities where facial recognition is already deployed have a right to know and to respond. There\u2019s no excuse for companies\u2014or law enforcement\u2014to keep the public in the dark. IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon shouldn\u2019t get credit for helping guard against irresponsible uses of facial recognition unless they provide transparency about the agencies they have sold their wares to. And Congress should consider enacting transparency requirements so that all law enforcement agencies using facial recognition\u2014regardless of the vendor they purchased it from\u2014must disclose its use.</p><p>Second, will these moratoriums apply to federal law enforcement agencies as well as state and local police? It would be nonsensical to block sales to municipal police departments but still sell to federal law enforcement, yet all three company announcements were ambiguous as to how broadly their new policy would apply. Heightened skepticism is also warranted given that Amazon has been deceptive in its responses to research that has proven that facial recognition systems, including its own, tend to misidentify people with \u201cdarker-skinned faces\u201d at higher rates. The FBI has built up its own massive facial recognition system, but other federal agencies could well be interested in buying the tech. This question is particularly significant given that a 2018 POGO investigation revealed that Amazon was pitching its facial recognition tech to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which former ICE officials have said could lead to abuse. And documents recently obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union show that Microsoft similarly tried to sell its software to the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p><p>Third, will these companies submit to independent assessments of their facial recognition systems before they resume sales to law enforcement? IBM and Microsoft currently allow the National Institute of Standards and Technology to examine their systems for general accuracy and algorithmic bias, but Amazon thus far has refused to allow the institute, which is part of the Commerce Department, to test its software. This is unacceptable for any company that wishes to sell facial recognition. If policymakers are going to confront problems of algorithmic bias in facial recognition software, it\u2019s essential to know exactly how serious those problems are. Research on algorithmic bias in these systems, such as that of Joy Buolamwini, has already brought much-needed attention to this issue, and underscores the need for continuing scrutiny and testing. (And although the companies did not acknowledge this research, it likely played a role in their decisions to pause sales to police.)</p><p>And finally, how long will these moratoriums last? While Amazon has stated its moratorium will last one year in order to allow lawmakers to create effective rules and limits, IBM and Microsoft have not provided any information on the duration of their bans, something they need to do as a starting point. We also need answers from all three companies about whether they would consider extending their moratoriums if, for example, laws are still under development when the clock runs out. It would be unjustifiable for these companies to dive back into selling facial recognition if regulation is not yet in place when they now appear to admit that it is too dangerous to be used absent regulation.</p><p>At least one lawmaker has taken note of the too-limited information the companies provided. Last week, Representative Jimmy Gomez (D-CA) sent Amazon a letter asking for answers on these and several other questions about its facial recognition software and moratorium announcement.Congress Needs to Step In</p><p>Even if the companies address all of these questions, any actions they may take to increase transparency or mitigate harms would not be an adequate substitute for congressional action. Facial recognition poses enormous threats to civil rights and civil liberties, and we cannot rely on Big Tech to regulate itself in the face of these threats.</p><p>The most straightforward step Congress can take is to place a moratorium on federal law enforcement use of facial recognition, not just on new sales.</p><p>There are dozens of facial recognition vendors; many focus solely on law enforcement clients and so seem unlikely to be motivated to enact a moratorium that would hurt their bottom line. And even if all vendors did enact an indefinite moratorium, some government entities could simply develop their own facial recognition software, such as the powerful system that the FBI maintains, or piggyback off of the FBI\u2019s system.</p><p>The Constitution Project at POGO has long called on Congress to enact a comprehensive set of laws that impose strong limits on facial recognition (you can check out our task force report and recent testimony for more details). Fortunately, we are seeing movement in the right direction. On June 25, Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Ed Markey (D-MA) and Representatives Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) and Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) introduced legislation\u2014which POGO endorsed\u2014to place a moratorium on government use of facial recognition.</p><p>Lawmakers have also proposed strong regulatory limits on the use of the technology. Last year, Representative Yvette Clarke (D-NY) and Senator Corey Booker (D-NJ) introduced a bill to prohibit any use of facial recognition in public housing. Earlier this year, Senators Booker and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) introduced legislation that would prohibit the use of facial recognition without a warrant. And this month, Representative Don Beyer (D-VA) put forward a bill to ban the use of facial recognition in combination with police body cameras. This is a valuable measure that our task force also recommended, as facial recognition in body cameras is especially dangerous because it could prompt officers to act immediately on unreliable \u201cmatches.\u201d There are numerous other areas where facial recognition can cause serious harm. These measures encompass only some of the policies required to prevent the dangers facial recognition poses, but they would nevertheless be a strong start.</p><p>We and other civil society advocates are working to ensure that any laws Congress passes constitute substantive reforms, rather than measures that would do little or nothing to address the dangers facial recognition poses. One particularly concerning piece of legislation, introduced by Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Mike Lee (R-UT), would only require law enforcement to obtain a warrant for using facial recognition to continuously track individuals for three or more days. This means that all targeted use of facial recognition and dragnet real-time facial recognition systems that scan entire crowds\u2014all of which requires far less than three days of tracking\u2014would be permitted without any restrictions. The bill amounts to a rubber stamp for surveillance technology that is prone to error and easily abused.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3476258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6085-6MR1-F0YC-N2CP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1643\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As the result, the final report focuses on both fake news and its ability to influence political opinion, and the misuse of user data to ensure that \u201cpeople stay in charge of the machines\u201d.Unsurprisingly, Facebookis the main focus, with the committee criticising the company for being \u201cunwilling to be accountable to regulators around the world\u201d after <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>refused to appear before parliament, and failing to act quickly to prevent the spread of misinformation on the platform.What does the fake news report recommend?The report has made a series of recommendations as to how the UK government should protect citizens from fake news and control the rate at which it spreads.Although the report may influence government policy, it is not binding, meaning its recommendations may not come to fruition. The government is due to publish a white paper on online harms this year.Following \u201cRussian activity on Facebookand knowledge of Russian advertisements that ran during the presidential election in America in 2016\u201d, the report calls on the government to reform current electoral communications laws and rules on overseas involvement in UK elections due to fears that fake news could be used to influence election results.It also recommends that social media companies should have an obligation to take down known sources of harmful content, including proven sources of disinformation or fake news.This follows recent statements by Ministers indicating the government is prepared to regulate social media companies following the death of teenager Molly Russell, who took her own life after viewing images depicting self-harm on Instagram.However, perhaps the most meaningful recommendation is the call for greater regulation in the face of \u201cmalign forces intent on causing disruption and confusion\u201d. The 108-page report calls for a compulsory Code of Ethics defining what constitutes harmful online content. </p><p>It recommends that an independent regulator should be responsible for monitoring tech companies, backed by statutory powers to launch legal action against companies that breach the code with the power to issue hefty fines.It also repeats its recommendation for this new independent regulation to be funded by a levy on tech companies operating in the UK.Damian Collins MP and Chair of the DCMS Committee believes that the actions of social media companies should be more closely policed:\u201cIt\u2019s time for a radical overhaul of our relationship with big tech companies. For too long we\u2019ve let them live in a world of self-regulation and non-compliance and its citizens who are the victims of that. That\u2019s why in our report we\u2019re recommending the most robust system of regulation on content online we\u2019ve ever seen. I believe the UK can be a world-leader in content regulation. We should have statutory powers to act against companies like Facebookwhen they fail to act against harmful content.\u201dWhat could a code of ethics mean?The fake news report makes it clear that there is an \u201curgent need \u201cfor regulation to prevent tech companies from expanding \u201cexponentially\u201d. But what could UK-specific regulations mean?If social media companies are required to adhere to additional regulations in the UK, it may deter them from investing in the country, or may lead to some companies removing their sites from the country altogether to avoid additional regulation or hefty fines.A less extreme scenario could also result in UK-specific versions of certain sites, similar to those that exist in countries that already have their own rules governing online content. As was the case after the introduction of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR&amp;shy;) in the EU, this could mean that access to some websites is temporarily disrupted as they work to comply.In the case of GDPR, the impact of losing out on the European market was enough that many sites have adopted GDPR compliance as standard. However, with the UK representing a much smaller market, it may risk missing out if companies chose to make their sites inaccessible in the region rather than comply.However, James Monckton, Strategic Communication Director at Verbalisation, believes that the risk of this is small:\u201cI doubt the websites that exist now will be blocked in a Russia-esque move of control. The British public would not allow it. It is possible that the exiting Social Media companies will have to rebrand to a degree and deal with the backlash. As to UK-specific domains, I again doubt that this will be a move they try and make. If they did so, they would be saying ethical standards in the UK are different to those globally, which goes against fundamental principles of ethics.\u201dHe believes that it may instead prompt marketing campaigns from social media platforms:\u201cIt is more likely that they will re-brand and launch new campaigns that speak to a global ethical standard (they are all about community building after all!).\u201dRafael Laguna, CEO of Open-Xchange believes that a code of ethics is not the best solution, and that others should be considered:\u201cThis is not the first time we have heard calls for a code of ethics for tech companies. As recently as last year, Tim Berners-Lee \u2013 inventor of the World Wide Web \u2013 endorsed a \u201cMagna Carta\u201d for the Internet, which was immediately jumped on by Google and Facebook\u2013 the two outstanding creators of the problems outlined in his paper. But I fail to see how it is possible for an independent body to regulate the tech giants while they continue to operate in closed, proprietary systems.\u201cTrust is the biggest threat facing these platforms today, and with consumer awareness at an all-time high, there is now increasing societal pressure for companies to treat data responsibly and ethically. Only a fully open source-based model could provide the transparency necessary for the regulation proposed by UK MPs \u2013 and this would also go a long way in re-establishing trust with users. After all, privacy is not a business model, but a fundamental human right.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-C7BEF40540B345399F6F184FBEAE0F8A</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFY-MGS1-DYG0-7146-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1064\"/><timeReceived>4:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In 2020, it is even more likely than it has been every year since the financial crisis that the global economy will continue growing, interest rates will remain at rock-bottom levels, and stock markets will keep rising.So, instead of predicting the most probable scenario, which is fairly obvious, it is more useful to consider unlikely events that would alter the likely benign scenario. I believe ten risks could cause the most economic and financial trouble in 2020. These are not predictions: Continuing global expansion is more probable than any combination of these setbacks. And they are not 'surprises', which, by definition, are impossible to foresee. Rather, they are 'known unknowns', arranged from the lowest risk to the highest, in my view.The smallest risk is the one that many economists predict every year: a\u00a0global recession, caused by the United States or China. </p><p>A recession is inevitable, but less likely in 2020 than in any of the previous ten years. While investment and manufacturing worldwide have suffered from the US-China trade war, macroeconomic policies in both countries have boosted housing, services, and public spending. The world economy will continue to benefit this year from a tailwind from last year's US interest-rate cuts and China's efforts to support roughly 6 per cent growth. Absent some powerful new shock, recession in 2020 is therefore extremely unlikely.Likewise, there is a negligible risk of\u00a0higher interest rates. Many investors and businesses are worried that today's low-interest-rate environment may soon end, at least in the US. Inflation and long-term interest rates will probably rise somewhat this year, but it is almost out of the question that central banks will tighten monetary policy. The Fed would lead this process, and it will not raise rates in an election year.In Europe, instead of triggering an epidemic of Euroskepticism, Brexit has acted like a vaccination. Even the populist leaders in Italy, France, and Germany seem deterred by the Brexit experience, and this year's negotiations on a post-Brexit trade deal will reinforce Europeans' negative perceptions of the process. But politics is always volatile, especially in Italy, so a\u00a0politically driven euro crisis\u00a0remains a low but non-negligible risk.Although the US-China trade war grabbed the most attention in 2019, Europe was actually the weakest link in the world economy. Recently, Europe's economic performance has stabilised, and policy has improved dramatically, with the European Central Bank restarting quantitative easing and political sentiment turning against fiscal austerity. But Germany's economy still faces an existential crisis, and European politicians have an almost unbroken record of foolish efforts to cut budget deficits when their economies need fiscal support. A\u00a0European recession\u00a0therefore remains the biggest macroeconomic risk in 2020, just as it was last year.Then there is the threat of a major energy disruption. Since the US assassination of Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Suleimani, financial markets have been worrying about a spiral toward war and a spike in oil prices. Every global recession in the past 50 years been preceded by a doubling of the oil price, although not every doubling of the oil price has been followed by a recession. To double year on year, oil prices would have to soar above $110. This is unlikely, but possible if a US-Iran war stopped shipping in the Persian Gulf. An\u00a0oil-induced recession\u00a0is therefore a moderate risk.There is also a moderate risk of\u00a0increased protectionism. The US-China trade war has been a market obsession long enough for the bad news to be largely priced in, and the 'phase one' agreement suggests no further escalation this year. That still leaves several trade risks on the horizon, especially for Europe, which is vulnerable to a breakdown in the Brexit talks or to a diversion of Trump's protectionist instincts from Chinese electronics to German cars. But Trump will probably be too busy this year with the Iran confrontation and the election in November to start a US-EU trade war. Meanwhile, UK-EU trading relations will remain completely unchanged until December 31. As a result, greater global protectionism is a smaller risk this year than it was in 2018 and 2019.There are two other moderate risks to growth this year. One is that debt ratios in US corporations have risen to unprecedented levels, far exceeding the levels that preceded the financial crisis. But this is hardly surprising, given that interest rates have never been so low for so long. While a leverage bubble will probably be a risk sometime in the future, there is no reason why it should burst, or even deflate, until interest rates significantly rise. This is whycorporate leverage\u00a0seems only a modest threat in 2020.The last moderate risk is of an\u00a0auto industry collapse. Sales collapsed worldwide last year, devastating the German economy, which is by far the biggest exporter of cars and machinery for making them. Production in Germany is now below its trough in the 2009 recession, and the industry's decline is not just a cyclical problem. A perfect storm of environmental concerns, social changes, and energy and technological transitions means that the auto and engineering industries, not only in Germany, but also in the US, Japan and Western Europe, are probably in a secular decline that could prove as profound as the deindustrialisation of the 1980s. But the collapse in demand last year was so extreme that a temporary recovery is likely, which is why the auto and engineering industries should not cause as much trouble this year.The risk to the\u00a0technology sector, by contrast, is political, and high. Big Tech firms can no longer rely on policymakers' deference. Once regarded as innovators and agents of progress, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google are now viewed as ruthless monopolists that manipulate politicians and exploit consumers. These companies have been the main driving force of the US economy and stock market, and serious political challenges to their business models, in the form of regulation, special taxation or breakup, could cause a repeat of the 2000-02 dot-com bust. A reckoning could begin this year.The highest of the ten risks stems from\u00a0the US presidential election. Global markets' consensus that President Donald Trump will win exposes them to two potential shocks. A victorious Trump could become even more protectionist, belligerent and unpredictable in a second term. And if his opponent is Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, the US economy's four biggest sectors; health care, finance, technology and energy, will face unprecedented threats of disruption. Given that Trump is bound to make statements that alarm investors, and that some opinion polls will suggest a possible Democratic victory at some point in the campaign, US politics is almost certain to trigger occasional bouts of panic before November 3.\u00a0Anatole Kaletsky is chief economist and co-chairman of Gavekal Dragonomics.

In 2020, it is even more likely than it has been every year since the financial crisis that the global economy will continue growing, interest rates will remain at rock-bottom levels, and stock markets will keep rising. So, instead of predicting the most probable scenario, which is fairly obvious, it is more useful to consider unlikely events that would alter the likely benign scenario. I believe ten risks could cause the most economic and financial trouble in 2020. These are not predictions: continuing global expansion is more probable than any combination of these setbacks. </p><p>And they are not \"surprises,\" which, by definition, are impossible to foresee. Rather, they are \"known unknowns,\" arranged from the lowest risk to the highest, in my view. The smallest risk is the one that many economists predict every year: a global recession, caused by the United States or China. A recession is inevitable, but less likely in 2020 than in any of the previous ten years. While investment and manufacturing worldwide have suffered from the US-China trade war, macroeconomic policies in both countries have boosted housing, services, and public spending. The world economy will continue to benefit this year from a tailwind from last year's US interest-rate cuts and China's efforts to support roughly 6% growth. Absent some powerful new shock, recession in 2020 is therefore extremely unlikely. Likewise, there is a negligible risk of higher interest rates. Many investors and businesses are worried that today's low-interest-rate environment may soon end, at least in the US. Inflation and long-term interest rates will probably rise somewhat this year, but it is almost out of the question that central banks will tighten monetary policy. The Fed would lead this process, and it will not raise rates in an election year. In Europe, instead of triggering an epidemic of Euroskepticism, Brexit has acted like a vaccination. Even the populist leaders in Italy, France, and Germany seem deterred by the Brexit experience, and this year's negotiations on a post-Brexit trade deal will reinforce Europeans' negative perceptions of the process. But politics is always volatile, especially in Italy, so a politically driven euro crisis remains a low but non-negligible risk. Although the US-China trade war grabbed the most attention in 2019, Europe was actually the weakest link in the world economy. Recently, Europe's economic performance has stabilized, and policy has improved dramatically, with the European Central Bank restarting quantitative easing and political sentiment turning against fiscal austerity. But Germany's economy still faces an existential crisis, and European politicians have an almost unbroken record of foolish efforts to cut budget deficits when their economies need fiscal support. A European recession therefore remains the biggest macroeconomic risk in 2020, just as it was last year. Then there is the threat of a major energy disruption. Since the US assassination of Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Suleimani, financial markets have been worrying about a spiral toward war and a spike in oil prices. Every global recession in the past 50 years been preceded by a doubling of the oil price (although not every doubling of the oil price has been followed by a recession). To double year on year, oil prices would have to soar above $110. This is unlikely, but possible if a US-Iran war stopped shipping in the Persian Gulf. An oil-induced recession is therefore a moderate risk. There is also a moderate risk of increased protectionism. The US-China trade war has been a market obsession long enough for the bad news to be largely priced in, and the \"phase one\" agreement suggests no further escalation this year. That still leaves several trade risks on the horizon, especially for Europe, which is vulnerable to a breakdown in the Brexit talks or to a diversion of Trump's protectionist instincts from Chinese electronics to German cars. But Trump will probably be too busy this year with the Iran confrontation and the election in November to start a US-EU trade war. Meanwhile, UK-EU trading relations will remain completely unchanged until December 31. As a result, greater global protectionism is a smaller risk this year than it was in 2018 and 2019. There are two other moderate risks to growth this year. One is that debt ratios in US corporations have risen to unprecedented levels, far exceeding the levels that preceded the financial crisis. But this is hardly surprising, given that interest rates have never been so low for so long. While a leverage bubble will probably be a risk sometime in the future, there is no reason why it should burst, or even deflate, until interest rates significantly rise. This is why corporate leverage seems only a modest threat in 2020. The last moderate risk is of an auto industry collapse. Sales collapsed worldwide last year, devastating the German economy, which is by far the biggest exporter of cars and machinery for making them. Production in Germany is now below its trough in the 2009 recession, and the industry's decline is not just a cyclical problem. A perfect storm of environmental concerns, social changes, and energy and technological transitions means that the auto and engineering industries - not only in Germany, but also in the US, Japan, and Western Europe - are probably in a secular decline that could prove as profound as the deindustrialization of the 1980s. But the collapse in demand last year was so extreme that a temporary recovery is likely, which is why the auto and engineering industries should not cause as much trouble this year. The risk to the technology sector, by contrast, is political - and high. Big Tech firms can no longer rely on policymakers' deference. Once regarded as innovators and agents of progress, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Google are now viewed as ruthless monopolists that manipulate politicians and exploit consumers. These companies have been the main driving force of the US economy and stock market, and serious political challenges to their business models - in the form of regulation, special taxation, or breakup - could cause a repeat of the 2000-02 dot-com bust. A reckoning could begin this year. The highest of the ten risks stems from the US presidential election. Global markets' consensus that President Donald Trump will win exposes them to two potential shocks. A victorious Trump could become even more protectionist, belligerent, and unpredictable in a second term. And if his opponent is Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, the US economy's four biggest sectors - health care, finance, technology, and energy - will face unprecedented threats of disruption. Given that Trump is bound to make statements that alarm investors, and that some opinion polls will suggest a possible Democratic victory at some point in the campaign, US politics is almost certain to trigger occasional bouts of panic before November 3.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Statesman.

Authored by Anatole Kaletsky, op-ed via Project Syndicate,[3] The traditional January game of economic forecasting for the year ahead hardly seems worth playing when the predictions have been the same for a decade. In 2020, it is even more likely than it has been every year since the financial crisis that the global economy will continue growing, interest rates will remain at rock-bottom levels, and stock markets will keep rising.    So, instead of predicting the most probable scenario, which is fairly obvious, it is more useful to consider unlikely events that would alter the likely benign scenario.  I believe ten risks could cause the most economic and financial trouble in 2020. These are not predictions: continuing global expansion is more probable than any combination of these setbacks. </p><p>And they are not 'surprises,' which, by definition, are impossible to foresee. Rather, they are 'known unknowns,' arranged from the lowest risk to the highest, in my view.  The smallest risk is the one that many economists predict every year: aglobal recession, caused by the United States or China. A recession is inevitable, but less likely in 2020 than in any of the previous ten years. While investment and manufacturing worldwide have suffered from the US-China trade war, macroeconomic policies in both countries have boosted housing, services, and public spending. The world economy will continue to benefit this year from a tailwind from last year's US interest-rate cuts and China's efforts to support roughly 6% growth. Absent some powerful new shock, recession in 2020 is therefore extremely unlikely.  Likewise, there is a negligible risk ofhigher interest rates. Many investors and businesses are worried that today's low-interest-rate environment may soon end, at least in the US. Inflation and long-term interest rates will probably rise somewhat this year, but it is almost out of the question that central banks will tighten monetary policy. The Fed would lead this process, and it will not raise rates in an election year.  In Europe, instead of triggering an epidemic of Euroskepticism, Brexit has acted like a vaccination. Even the populist leaders in Italy, France, and Germany seem deterred by the Brexit experience, and this year's negotiations on a post-Brexit trade deal will reinforce Europeans' negative perceptions of the process. But politics is always volatile, especially in Italy, so apolitically driven euro crisisremains a low but non-negligible risk.  Although the US-China trade war grabbed the most attention in 2019, Europe was actually the weakest link in the world economy. Recently, Europe's economic performance has stabilized, and policy has improved dramatically, with the European Central Bank restarting quantitative easing and political sentiment turning against fiscal austerity. But Germany's economy still faces an existential crisis, and European politicians have an almost unbroken record of foolish efforts to cut budget deficits when their economies need fiscal support. AEuropean recessiontherefore remains the biggest macroeconomic risk in 2020, just as it was last year.  Then there is the threat of a major energy disruption. Since the US assassination of Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Suleimani, financial markets have been worrying about a spiral toward war and a spike in oil prices. Every global recession in the past 50 years been preceded by a doubling of the oil price (although not every doubling of the oil price has been followed by a recession). To double year on year, oil prices would have to soar above $110. This is unlikely, but possible if a US-Iran war stopped shipping in the Persian Gulf. Anoil-induced recessionis therefore a moderate risk.  There is also a moderate risk ofincreased protectionism. The US-China trade war has been a market obsession long enough for the bad news to be largely priced in, and the 'phase one' agreement suggests no further escalation this year. That still leaves several trade risks on the horizon, especially for Europe, which is vulnerable to a breakdown in the Brexit talks or to a diversion of Trump's protectionist instincts from Chinese electronics to German cars. But Trump will probably be too busy this year with the Iran confrontation and the election in November to start a US-EU trade war. Meanwhile, UK-EU trading relations will remain completely unchanged until December 31. As a result, greater global protectionism is a smaller risk this year than it was in 2018 and 2019.  There are two other moderate risks to growth this year. One is that debt ratios in US corporations have risen to unprecedented levels, far exceeding the levels that preceded the financial crisis. But this is hardly surprising, given that interest rates have never been so low for so long. While a leverage bubble will probably be a risk sometime in the future, there is no reason why it should burst, or even deflate, until interest rates significantly rise. This is whycorporate leverageseems only a modest threat in 2020.  The last moderate risk is of anauto industry collapse. Sales collapsed worldwide last year, devastating the German economy, which is by far the biggest exporter of cars and machinery for making them. Production in Germany is now below its trough in the 2009 recession, and the industry's decline is not just a cyclical problem. A perfect storm of environmental concerns, social changes, and energy and technological transitions means that the auto and engineering industries - not only in Germany, but also in the US, Japan, and Western Europe - are probably in a secular decline that could prove as profound as the deindustrialization of the 1980s. But the collapse in demand last year was so extreme that a temporary recovery is likely, which is why the auto and engineering industries should not cause as much trouble this year.  The risk to thetechnology sector, by contrast, is political - and high. Big Tech firms can no longer rely on policymakers' deference. Once regarded as innovators and agents of progress, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Google are now viewed as ruthless monopolists that manipulate politicians and exploit consumers. These companies have been the main driving force of the US economy and stock market, and serious political challenges to their business models - in the form of regulation, special taxation, or breakup - could cause a repeat of the 2000-02 dot-com bust. A reckoning could begin this year.  The highest of the ten risks stems fromthe US presidential election. Global markets' consensus that President Donald Trump will win exposes them to two potential shocks. A victorious Trump could become even more protectionist, belligerent, and unpredictable in a second term. And if his opponent is Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, the US economy's four biggest sectors - health care, finance, technology, and energy - will face unprecedented threats of disruption. Given that Trump is bound to make statements that alarm investors, and that some opinion polls will suggest a possible Democratic victory at some point in the campaign, US politics is almost certain to trigger occasional bouts of panic before November 3.

Many Democrats who have announced bids have already made their opinions on big tech known. Senator Bernie Sanders played a significant role in getting Amazon to pay its workers $15 an hour, while Cory Booker once took a $100 million donation while he was mayor of Newark from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Here is what Democrats running for president in 2020 have said about big tech. </p><p> President Donald Trump[1] has not been shy about sharing his views on tech companies, with frequent tweets alleging political bias at Google and tabloid-worthy attacks on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos[2]. But what about his opponents in 2020? Storied politicians like Senators Bernie Sanders[3] and Elizabeth Warren[4], who recently announced presidential bids, have already made well-documented criticisms on companies like Google[5], and Apple[6], while up-and-comers Senator Cory Booker and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg have been friendly with Facebook[7] founder Mark Zuckerberg. As the list of hopeful Democratic presidential nominees grows, the debates about what to do with big tech will only become more contentious. Here's what the presidential candidates have said about artificial intelligence, automation, privacy, and policy: Cory Booker, the senator from New Jersey and the former mayor of Newark, has been outspoken about the inequality in Silicon Valley. Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesBooker went on Recode's podcast in July 2017 and said the government should be fighting \"corporate villainy\" in the tech sector. He was also one of many lawmakers who grilled Zuckerberg during last year's joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees on the social media site's Cambridge Analytica scandal. But Booker isn't inherently hostile to tech. He was himself once the co-founders of web-based video startup Waywire, and as mayor of Newark he even received $100 million donation from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for the city's public schools.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/983838567855161345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Mark Zuckerberg tells Sen.

REUTERS/Joshua RobertsAccording to the Washington Post, Buttigieg has already begun to express empathy, as part of his high-tech economic platform, for workers who may soon be replaced by automation and robots. At a recent Technology 202 sponsored by the Post, Buttigieg said on the topic of tech policy, \"We need to make sure that these don't sound like abstract conversations.\" He also took to Twitter last April when Zuckerberg appeared before lawmakers amid various privacy scandals, lambasting politicians for their inability to grasp what tech companies do.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/983866074281148417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw This isn't funny, it's stunning. How can tech be wisely regulated if policymakers have no grasp of the basic concepts?       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/dRbezFakxP\">https://t.co/dRbezFakxP</url>[13] Source: The Washington Post[14] Julin Castro was once the youngest member of President Barack Obama's cabinet, serving as his housing secretary. Castro is also the former mayor of San Antonio, Texas. J. Scott Applewhite/APWhile Castro hasn't given many mainstream interviews about his thoughts on big tech, he has taken to Twitter to criticize New York and Virginia for \"throwing billions of dollars at Amazon\" in pursuit of its HQ2 bid.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1062435276038070273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw There are so many more effective ways that New York and northern Virginia could build prosperity than by throwing billions of dollars at Amazon. I'm willing to bet they have not set aside resources to invest in more affordable housing, infrastructure, classrooms and 1/Castro remained rather vague with his criticism, and said without investment in affordable housing and education, \"you're just going to build greater inequality.\"  Source: Twitter[15]   See the rest of the story at Business Insider[16] See Also: I've owned an Amazon Echo for

That's because technologies like smartphones, the internet and its phenomena \u2014 social media and ecommerce for example \u2014 has started to permeate our lives so readily and effortlessly, that concepts that seemed outrageous a few years ago now seem everyday. The democratisation of news? Meh. The death of TV. Likely.</p><p><br/> In 2013 technology has continued its relentless development pace and brought us many new services and things, but it's also made us think about topics like privacy, what kind of future we want to live in and what still has the ability excite us and rattle our desensitised, information-numbed cages.<br/> Perhaps most importantly, as technology settles into our lives, rather than it appearing distinct from us, technology has started taken on more subtlety, allowing us to document life more seamlessly, setting us free to experience humanity and forget about the tools that make that possible. Bring on the smart watches and GoogleGlass. We're ready.<br/> With 2014 poised to finally be the year of 'the internet of things[1],' a future where technology disappears completely and helps us to thrive appear to be near.<br/> Let's take a look at how exactly technology shaped our lives this year.<br/> It made us think about how it affects our privacy, more than ever before<br/><br/>The undisputed king of 2013 tech stories, is the revelation by former US National Security Agency (NSA) <person><nameText>contractor, Edward Snowden[</nameText></person>2], that the NSA and other international bodies are involved in a structured, government-backed, mass surveillance programme[3]. In short, everything that passes through US-based servers are stored for a certain amount of time and can be inspected without a warrant. That includes email, video and voice chat, videos, photos, file transfers, and social networking posts.<br/> While the news probably came as no surprise to veteran security experts, online privacy once again[4], took the spotlight when Snowden leaked 200,000 classified documents to the press, detailing how the NSA's PRISM programme monitors the world's live communications and stored information. It especially piqued the world's interest when the documents referred to the cooperation of Google, Microsoft and Yahoo and Facebook.<br/> While the NSA maintains that its surveillance efforts are aimed at protecting US citizens, the revelations stirred people to discuss their views on online privacy. On the one side, some view data collection as the price we way pay for security and on the other side, some wonder about how much we still don't know about how our data is being used.<br/> Eager to mend their blemished reputations, the year drew to an end with eight big tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Facebook, calling[5] for governments to address the practices and laws regulating government surveillance of the companies' customer bases.<br/> With the demise[6] of Tor-based, not-so-secret online black market, Silk Road and Googledropping support for pseudonyms[7] on YouTube, 2013 might be remembered as the year we realised that there is no such thing as privacy on the internet.<br/> A ray of light however, is that privacy watchdogs are not letting CISPA[8] the controversial US bill that would allow data about digital threats to be shared between government , slip through the cracks. It's receiving strong resistance, despite landing up in the US senate (again).<br/> Finally, taking everything into account, it makes sense that Snapchat, the temporary social media king of the moment is attracting so much attention \u2014 shunning a US$3-billion offer[9] from Facebook and securing another US$50-million in funding. Too bad it's so fallible[10].<br/> It reminded us of the importance of the human element in the Information Age<br/><br/>At least 55 different contractors had a hand in building HealthCare.gov, the centerpiece of the US's plan to overhaul its healthcare system.<br/> It is considered to be one of the most complex pieces of software ever created for the federal government, and yet, despite the complexity and intended scale \u2014 it received 14.6 million unique visits \u2014 its failed launch[11] could have been avoided if its development had been better organised.<br/> The project had no lead contractor. While 55 companies collaborated on the project, each perfected their task in isolation, without an overall view of how the system would operate and perform as a whole. When it was time to run it all came tumbling down.<br/> The White House called on Silicon Valley big shots like Oracle, Googleand HP to clean up the mess and signups were delayed into 2014.<br/> It was a people problem. Not a technology problem.<br/> It showed us that people still care about console gaming. A lot.<br/><br/>Despite reports[12] of a decline in console gaming, 2013 reminded us that there is still great demand for couch-based interactive entertainment.<br/> Both Microsoft and Sony reported record sales for their next generation consoles. Sony lead the charge with a jaw dropping 2.1 million sales in the first two weeks of launching the PlayStation 4, while Microsoft just about matched sales of its Xbox One at 2 million units sold in roughly the same time frame.<br/> While Nintendo's Wii U hasn't been as popular as its predecessor and the quirky $99 Kickstarter-backed Ouya[13] console getting off to a slow start, 2013 hasn't stopped new contenders from stepping into the ring. Steam announced its Steam Machine[14], a console set to compete against Sony and Microsoft by luring PC-gamers into the living room.<br/> It reminded us of the pace at which the technology advances and that nothing is forever<br/><br/>BlackBerry continued its extraordinary fall from grace, and is now on life-support. Despite axing another CEO[15], failing to woo consumers with BlackBerry 10, and not attracting buyers when it briefly explored a sale as a 'strategic alternative', the embattled company is still defying reports of an imminent death[16]. Ex-Sybase CEO, John Chen is the latest man saddled with the monumental task of resurrecting the company \u2014 his main play at for moment, going back to BlackBerry's roots, the enterprise, a real challenge[17] for iOS.<br/> In the world of Android, HTC have found itself in an increasingly uphill battle[18] against the juggernaut that is Samsung. In a effort to reverse a market share slide that recently resulted in the company's first quarterly net loss (US$101-million) in more than 10 years, staff cutbacks and CEO Peter Chou giving the reins to Cher Wang in and attempt to focus on innovation and product development.<br/> Then there's Dell. Its founder, Michael Dell paid US$25 billion to take the company private[19] in an attempt to stunt the spiralling fortunes Dell largely incurred as a result of failed consumer devices.<br/>Dell, like BlackBerry will re-focus on enterprise services as the PC industry continues to slow in the wake of tablets and smartphones.<br/> Halfway through the year, Yahoo went on to pay US$1.1 billion for Tumblr[20] in an attempt to inject new life into the ageing tech company, but its profit shrank in the quarter ending in September, showing that it might be a while before we see Marissa Mayer's strategy paying off.<br/> Finally, Microsoft's Steve Ballmer bid farewell[21] to the company he's lead for over decade. While his tenure saw Microsoft's revenue grow from US$22 billion to US$78 billion, Ballmer admits that Microsoft missed the boat on mobile while he was in charge. His departure was more sudden than expected, with apparent reasons[22] such as the company's stagnant stock price, falling business performance and Ballmer's form of leadership accelerating his resignation.<br/> It showed us the future<br/><br/>Elon Musk shared his dream for the future of public transportation with the Hyperloop[23] and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos made us think about an imminent future where the sky is filled with delivery drones[24] \u2014 a sky, that according to New York's Mayor Bloomberg, will inevitably accommodate surveillance drones[25].<br/> Destined to operate under a different sky, NASA showed us Valkyrie[26], a six foot two robot called that will pave the way for human Mars exploration.<br/> While some accepted these big ideas readily, there were signs that we remain reluctant to embrace change. Apple's iOS redesign was met with resistance[27], Windows 8 continued to show slow adoption[28] and Google's most determined attempt at an everything-in-the-cloud desktop computer, the Chromebook Pixel[29] remained an interesting concept rather than gaining mainstream adoption.<br/> Perhaps 2013\u2032s most uneasy preview of the future came with the introduction of the first lab grown hamburger[30] and miniature human brain[31].<br/> A technology that people does seem to be unanimously excited about however, well apart perhaps from intellectual property watchdogs, is 3D printing. The technology arguably had its best year yet[32] with Stratasys Incorporated acquiring MakerBot in a stock deal worth US$403 million.<br/> Oh, and if LG's G Flex[33] is anything to go by, 2014 will be the year where the iPhone's likeness might finally no longer lead the industry, as flexible displays go mainstream.<br/> It reminded us that online security is a myth<br/><br/>If the NSA's exploits didn't convince you that little is safe online \u2014 not even under SSL[34] \u2014 just about every major tech company[35]'s online facing services suffered a security breach in some form or another.<br/> 38 million user accounts were affected during an Adobe security breach and for a hot minute, hackers had access to the internal networks of Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter when malware from an iPhone development site found its way into corporate networks.<br/>Apple had a particularly rough year with iOS 7 leading to security lapses, and its push for biometric security proving to be easily circumventable, when the fingerprint reader on the iPhone 5s was bypassed[36] soon after the phone's launch.<br/> Seemingly in perpetual hot water, Facebook made headlines when it scrambled to fix a bug that inadvertently exposed the private information of over six million users.<br/> Evernote, LivingSocial, Drupal, Yahoo Japan, LinkedIn, Last.fm and eHarmony also suffered breaches.<br/> While not as loud as previous years, hacker groups continued to infiltrate large private and government organisations[37]. From newspapers (The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal) to government institutions like the US Federal Reserve, The Department Of Homeland Security and the Washington State Court System, hackers continued to breach security systems for fun or for causes.<br/> The year raised a debate on the severity of punishments doled out to convicted hackers. NSA-leaker <person><nameText>Edward Snowden </nameText></person>was forced to become a fugitive, Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning) was sentenced to 35 years confinement following the leaking of classified documents to Wikileaks in 2010, and digital activist Aaron Schwartz[38] committed suicide after facing a lengthy jail sentence many considered unfairly harsh.<br/> The aforementioned Federal Reserve hack was done in retaliation to Schwartz's punishment and exposed the credentials of more than 4000 American bank executives.<br/> It made us excited about wearable tech<br/><br/>While there probably is a loftier ideal for the category \u2014 GoogleGlass \u2014 seemingly every large and indie consumer product company[39]'s idea of wearable tech in 2013, was a smart watch.<br/> Illustrating demand, Samsung managed to sell over a million of its Galaxy Gear, despite less than favourable reviews[40], and 190,000 Kickstarter-funded Pebble[41] watches found their way to people's wrists.<br/>Qualcomm and Sony both put out smart watches, and although rumours of imminent releases from Apple, Google, Microsoft and Nike are making the rounds, we'll have to wait for 2014 to hear anything official.<br/> It put us in the front row of major world events<br/><br/>Do you remember the spectacular meteorite explosion[42] over Chelyabinsk in Russia?<br/> Like the recent years before it, technology brought us closer to the news and even gave us a few new ways to document our lives and the world around us. Twitter, which had a breakout year with its successful IPO[43] \u2014 despite still not being profitable \u2014 launched Vine[44], and Facebook rolled out Instagram Video[45].<br/> The Boston Marathon bombings[46], the hostage nightmare in Kenya[47], Super Typhoon Haiyan[48], Syria's civil war, the Egyptian revolution[49], were viewed in unprecedented detail through high definition smartphone cameras and reported through social media channels by people who inadvertently found themselves in the middle of it all.<br/> Photos, videos and messages became digital clues that gave rise to the word 'clicktivism' and provided an extra layer on which authorities could build their manhunt for bombing suspects, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev.<br/> It reminded us that there is still work to be done to bring about gender equality<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://s3.cdn.memeburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/s4launch.jpg\">http://s3.cdn.memeburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/s4launch.jpg</url><br/> Let's see.<br/> There were no women[50] on stage at Sony's PlayStation 4 preview event.<br/> A month later at the Galaxy S4 launch, Samsung was lambasted for its one-sided portrayal of women[51] \u2014 it included women noting how the phone's Air Gesture feature would come in handy while their nails dried and an intoxicated woman lewdly staring at a shirtless gardener.<br/> Days following the fiasco, Samsung committed another faux pas[52] in at the Africa Forum in Cape Town when it 'demoed a range of fridges with bikini-clad dancers handing out water bottles and launched a range of 'Wobble' washing machines complete with the same barely pubescent dancers shaking their stuff in swimsuits.'<br/> A situation spiralled out of control, causing people to lose their jobs when a woman, Adria Richards, took to the internet to shame two male Python PyCon attendees[53] for telling jokes about 'forking a repo,' and the benefits of a large dongle. Tweeting a picture of the two, sent the internet into a frenzy, sparking the most vicious of flamewars. Richards as well as Alex Reid, one of the men in her picture lost their jobs and suffered criticism, but that didn't stop the tide from turning unjustly against her, leading to death threats, racial slurs and a disruption in her online life following DDOS attacks of her personal blog.<br/> The Wall Street Journal noted a n in-depth study by Fenwick West which showed that just 11.5% of top executives in top publicly traded Silicon Valley firms are women, but the year ended with a positive signal as Twitter gained its first female board member after mounting accusations of sexism[54], but there is work yet to do.<br/> It brought us a new bubble to consider<br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://s2.cdn.memeburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bitcoin.jpg\">http://s2.cdn.memeburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bitcoin.jpg</url><br/> Bitcoin's popularity rose to great heights in 2013, which meant that much of the year was spent educating people[55] on what exactly it is and isn't[56].<br/> The increased interest in the crypto currency lead to what can be considered a bubble of epic proportion. The buzz around Bitcoin sparked a gold rush with online prospectors doing their damnedest to secure these virtual bartering chips, subsequently leading to the value of a whole unit of Bitcoin increasing from US$20 at the beginning of the year to around US$1 200 in December.<br/> The volatile currency played with early adopter hearts when Bitcoin value fell to US$660 when China's central bank, and five government ministries stood up against the adoption of Bitcoin as a real currency.<br/> [1]:       \u00a0    <url

Tech's Long Arms: The tech industry's lobbying in Washington shows its vast reach into many aspects of American life. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. Russian Reconnaissance: It may be safe to assume that all 50 states were targeted by Russian entities in the 2016 elections, a top Homeland Security official says. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3.

Gmail, Twitter Changes: Twitter and Gmail step up privacy protections. </p><p>5. New AI Brain at the Pentagon: The Pentagon's No. 2 official said the Defense Department may set up a centralized office for artificial-intelligence programs. </p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Tech Companies Lobby Far Beyond Just Tech </p><p>It may be obvious to say that technology companies and their products are all-pervasive in our lives. </p><p>We wake to an alarm on our smartphone made by Apple. We check our email on the phone via Google. We see that the item we ordered via Amazon is arriving today. We go to work on a computer made by Apple or Hewlett-Packard, relying on software from Microsoft and Oracle, a microchip from Intel, using a networked system backed up by Amazon Web Services, using Cisco servers.</p><p>And yet, or maybe because of their pervasiveness, tech companies care about a wide variety of public policy issues and legislation -- including internet and privacy issues, labor, immigration, copyright, patents and even agriculture. </p><p>The latest quarterly lobbying reports show the financial muscle and reach of the top tech companies. CQ Cyber Editor Patrick B. Pexton dug through them and has this report.</p><p>2. How Many States Did Russia Target? </p><p>It seems like every time a top Homeland Security official appears before Congress, a new kernel of information emerges about election security. It all depends on how a lawmaker frames the question. </p><p>Jeanette Manfra, the assistant Homeland Security secretary for cybersecurity, appeared this week before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the panel's top Democrat, asked once again about how many states were targeted by Russian entities during the 2016 election. </p><p>Although Manfra has previously said Russian entities had scanned the election systems of 21 states, McCaskill asked a different question: \"My understanding is that number only reflects the states where there were sensors [or] tools in place to capture the Russian activity. Is that correct?\"</p><p>Manfra agreed. That means states other than the 21 noted by DHS may not have had the tools to detect the Russians and could have missed the scanning or targeting altogether.</p><p>Of those 21, only in six cases did the attackers manage to breach the perimeter and gain access to any databases, and in even in those cases, the DHS has said, no records were changed or damaged. </p><p>Because elections are states' responsibility, the DHS has no complete account yet of how many states were targeted by Russian entities. </p><p>\"I think we can assume that the majority of states were probably a target,\" Manfra said. \"What we have is the visibility that we had at the time.\"  </p><p>But since the targeting came to light, \"many more states\" have deployed sensors that can detect targeting by unauthorized actors, Manfra said. </p><p>As McCaskill put it, the bottom line is, \"it's likely that all 50 states were likely affected and that states that were not on that list [assumed they] were less vulnerable. But, that's simply not true. I mean, states that were not on that list, in fact, might be more vulnerable,\" because they didn't even know they were being targeted.</p><p>Separately, of the 17 states and eight local jurisdictions that have sought the help of the DHS to beef up their election systems, the department has completed assessments for nine states and expects to complete the rest by the end of May, Christopher Krebs, the nominee to become the undersecretary at DHS, told the committee Wednesday. </p><p>Even as midterm elections are approaching this fall, some states may still be unprepared to face up to potential risks. </p><p>At Wednesday's hearing, Krebs said top election officials at five states had declined to seek top-secret clearances that would help them get from federal agencies classified information on threats to election systems. </p><p>In the aftermath of the Russian interference in the 2016 elections, federal officials were unable to share classified intelligence information with state officials who lacked security clearances. DHS officials and lawmakers have since tried to speed up the process. </p><p>Officials from 30 states have received the top-secret clearances and 15 are in the pipeline, Krebs said. He refused to name the five states where officials declined to seek such clearances. </p><p>3. Turf Wars Slow Down Name Change at Cyber Agency </p><p>Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., twice this week bemoaned that turf wars between federal agencies had prevented the renaming of the Department of Homeland Security's National Protection and Programs Directorate. The new name would be the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. </p><p>The House approved the name change last year when it passed the relevant legislation (HR 3359). The Senate Homeland Security panel approved the bill in February, but it has yet to come to the Senate floor. </p><p>At Tuesday's hearing, Johnson sounded incredulous about unnamed agencies' objections to the name change. </p><p>\"It's ridiculous that it requires an act of Congress for Department of Homeland Security to rename an agency and restructure it so it actually does a better job,\" Johnson said. \"I don't get that, but that's the way it is. I don't know what the objection was. I think that might indicate further future problems in terms of lack of cooperation [and] coordination within the agencies, within committees, within Congress. But it's just unfortunate. We're going to do everything we can.\" </p><p>Johnson said on Wednesday he had discussed with Sen. Richard M. Burr, R-N.C., who as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has jurisdiction over all U.S. intelligence agencies, about some of the friction between agencies, and hopes to resolve the matter. </p><p>4. Changes Coming to Gmail, Twitter</p><p>Google and Twitter this week made changes designed to increase security and privacy.  </p><p>Twitter's new privacy rules and settings come in light of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulations, which take effect May 25. </p><p>Twitter said users could choose what information they share with the company, how Twitter can use that data, and what access outside apps have to users' accounts. The new features also allow users to get a full list of all companies that target users based on their browsing and tweeting preferences.</p><p>Google is changing many features on its Gmail service, which has about 1.4 billion users worldwide. One of the biggest changes rolled out on Wednesday will allow users to designate emails as confidential, which will allow the email in question to self-destruct within a set period of time.</p><p>Unlike standard email practices, under which the content of an email is sent in its entirety to a receiver, with the new confidential setting the recipient will only get a link to the message while the content remains in the sender's outbox.</p><p>Gmail also plans to roll out a couple of other privacy settings. The Integrated Rights Management feature will allow business users, in particular, to restrict emails from being forwarded, copied, downloaded or printed.</p><p>The other setting would allow users to require recipients to use a two-factor authentication in order to open an email. The user then would send a passcode via text message to the recipient, who would have to enter it to unlock a confidential email. </p><p>Google said its artificial-intelligence algorithms would step up policing of phishing scams and alert users to potentially fraudulent messages.    </p><p>The AI also will prompt or nudge users to respond to certain emails based on how users responded to similar emails in the past, based on the sender and the content, Google said. </p><p>5. Pentagon Eyes an AI Center</p><p>Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said Tuesday that the Pentagon hopes to establish a center of excellence for artificial intelligence within five months. Centralizing the Pentagon's efforts on AI will help integrate them across the Pentagon, he said. That could mean reducing pet projects at the various service branches and defense agencies, and focusing on developing basic skills, he said. </p><p>\"It doesn't mean we don't want to innovate. But [instead] it's, 'How do we get to scale on artificial intelligence?'\" Shanahan said. He did not provide details about where an AI center of excellence might be located, or what kind of staff it might require. </p><p>-- Andrew Clevenger</p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ's up-to-date daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

Microsoft and Google create products just for schools-and give them away for free. All four spearhead efforts to expand computer science courses, teach kids to code, or join the engineering profession. Some enlist educators to serve as representatives and sounding boards for the companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That level of influence is front and center at ed-tech conferences such as ISTE and SXSWedu, where Google professional development sessions often attract standing-room-only crowds, and the presence of Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft is everywhere. But that near-ubiquitous presence in K-12 is not welcomed by many educators, some of whom see these companies as bad neighbors with little regard for the true needs of schools.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alyson Klein</emphasis> Our recent, nationally representative survey of teachers echoes those concerns. It found that 60 percent of teachers think Big Tech has too much influence in K-12 schools.</p><p>But is that influence really all negative, and all driven by profit motives, as some critics of Big Tech suggest? Let's take a look.</p><p>Sure, Big Tech's expansion into K-12 may help Amazon sell its cloud storage to schools, or broaden the market for Google's Chromebooks. But that activity isn't just about profits, at least not in the traditional sense (and umm, dollars). The reality is K-12 schools aren't offering these tech companies a bottom-line bonanza, market analysts say.</p><p>\"Generally, the K-12 education market is not a core profit center compared to wider business,\" said Andreas Olah, a senior analyst for education technology at Futuresource Consulting, based in the United Kingdom, which studies K-12 markets. \"It's a lot smaller than most other corporate areas,\" including telecommunications and financial services, he said.</p><p>What Big Tech does see is an investment in the future, both of workers and customers. \"The reason why they are still in this segment is they try to insert their influence as early on as possible,\" Olah said. \"They want to make sure their operating system, their whole ecosystem, gets really ingrained in students' lives.\"</p><p>The idea that tech companies are trying to gain a foothold in the next generation of users by reaching out to schools is probably a bit troubling to that 60 percent who cite too much influence. But does it suggest profiteering motives or just smart business practices?</p><p>\"K-12 is not a big moneymaker but it's a big branding opportunity,\" said Larry Singer, the former CEO of the nonprofit Open Up Resources who has had leadership roles in large education companies, including Pearson. \"It's a good hedge against public policy interference. It's a good shareholder branding opportunity. And it makes the employees feel good. It's a hell of a motivator for your sales force and marketing team.\"</p><p>Yet that's not how any of the four companies describe the catalyst behind their involvement in K-12. All four describe their work as mission-driven. They want to provide products and services that help kids learn better.</p><p>All four companies declined to say just how much of their revenue comes from K-12 schools. In fact, they said that profits aren't really what's important here. Microsoft, for instance, just doesn't \"look at dollars and profit margins in K-12,\" said Eran Megiddo, the corporate vice president for education at Microsoft.</p><p>Global Silicon Valley, an investment firm that works with education technology companies, estimates that the entire market for learning devices, digital textbooks, and supplemental materials in K-12 stood at about $5.8 billion annually in 2015. That doesn't sound like chump change. But consider those costs are split between not just the four big tech companies, but also countless others.</p><p>And then compare that to a company the size of say, Apple, whose brand was valued at $205 billion in 2019, according to Forbes. Or put it against Microsoft's $110.4 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2018, Google parent company Alphabet's $38.9 billion in revenue for just a quarter of 2019, or Amazon's nearly $60 billion in sales in merely the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>You're left with the proverbial drop in Big Tech's bucket.</p><p>But the companies' efforts may pay off later.</p><p>Children may get used to using say, an iPad, in school and beg their parents for Apple products. Or they may get so accustomed to Google's interface that they'll turn to the company for years to come\u00c2\u00ad\u00c2\u00ad-and urge their employers to adopt their products, too.</p><p>\"The reason the market is attractive is different than why it is for [education company] Renaissance\" or other businesses that focus primarily on the K-12 marketplace, said Adam Newman, a founding partner at Tyton Partners, a consulting organization, who has worked with K-12 companies and entrepreneurs. \"For a lot of the big tech companies, it is a market, but it's really an access to a relationship with a customer that has a much greater lifetime value for them than simply their time in elementary school or their time in the K-12 system.\"</p><p>Representatives from the four tech companies dismissed the idea that they were in the K-12 market primarily to get in early with the next generation of users.</p><p>\"We are doing it for people,\" said Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, in a speech cited by the company. \"If it has an indirect effect on our business that's fine, but frankly this is from the heart. This isn't something that I'm saying I expect a return of investment.\"</p><p>And Zach Yeskel, a product manager for Google, said his company's investment in K-12 schools wasn't motivated by the desire to bring on future customers. But he noted that, \"businesses are choosing G-suite. They want to have tools that their workforce will thrive on.\" Newly minted college graduates, he said, urged their employers to bring on Google operating systems, because that's what they were comfortable and familiar with.</p><p>\"We want them to know and love our tools and bring them into the workforce with them,\" said Yeskel, a former high school teacher. \"I don't think that means not knowing other tools, but really preferring ours.\"</p><p>Beyond their proprietary tools, what Big Tech shares in its involvement in K-12 is a big and growing concern about the pipeline of tech-savvy, problem-solvers who will fill the jobs of the future at their companies and others.</p><p>\"I think it's really about the evolving business needs of the global workforce,\" Yeskel said. \"When you look at the skills that people will need in today's workforce, it's about problem-solving, it's about working as a team, it's about communicating effectively. It's about speaking the language of computing and being tech savvy.\"</p><p>Singer added: \"They want kids to be successful in K-12.

That means 'stepping up' in some areas. But exactly which areas? To answer that question, the European Union needs to identify, and convincingly articulate, what it has to offer the rest of the world.This is easier said than done, particularly at a time of rapidly shifting global power dynamics. </p><p>The night of von der Leyen's speech, I put the question to a European business leader and to a former senior public official. Neither had a ready answer.Representatives of the world's other major powers would not face the same struggle. The United States is a leader in innovation and technology, and boasts deep and broad financial markets. It also possesses the world's\u00a0strongest\u00a0military, virtually guaranteeing America's global primacy for the foreseeable future.China, for its part, has established itself as a formidable economic and political counterweight to the US, largely by capturing a critical position in global value chains and, increasingly, as a major source of foreign direct investment. This soft-power offensive, which includes ambitious transnational infrastructure projects like the Belt and Road Initiative, has won China many friends, though it has also raised fears of an inevitable military confrontation with the incumbent hegemon, a dynamic known as the Thucydides Trap.Yet, today's Europe seems unsure of its global role. The United Kingdom has officially exited the EU. Rising populism is producing polarisation, paralysis and internal pressures so severe that the Union's very survival no longer seems certain. And investors have noticed: the region's stock markets have consistently underperformed for two decades, implying a lack of faith in the bloc's long-term prospects.But it is far too soon to write off Europe. In my view, there are four key areas where the EU could establish itself as a global player.The first and most obvious is trade. According to the World Bank, the post-Brexit EU remains home to nearly 450 million people, and boasts an average\u00a0per capita\u00a0GDP of roughly $36,000. It thus remains a highly desirable trading partner.The second area where Europe can lead is in regulation, particularly of Big Tech. In many ways, Europe has already established itself as a regulatory pioneer. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), implemented in 2018, gave EU residents unprecedented control over their personal data, setting a new standard for data-privacy rules. At the national level, France has strict defamation and privacy laws.To be sure, there are questions about whether robust regulation constrains innovation and economic dynamism. The GDPR, for example, can be viewed as excessively burdensome, and thus as undermining investment and growth, particularly among small and medium-size companies. But, as public suspicion of Big Tech intensifies, European leadership in this area is both critical and warranted.The third area where Europe can play a vital global role is in the competition between the US and China. The Thucydides Trap, already manifest in the US-China trade and technology war, need not lead to military conflict, particularly if the EU could act as a kind of referee, helping to determine whether and how the two heavyweights engage. To succeed, Europe would need to navigate not only economic matters, such as the ongoing trade war, but also the more fundamental ideological clash between America's democratic capitalism and China's state-led model.In doing so, Europe would have to bring to bear its unique capacity in a fourth area: the defence of Western values, especially individual economic and political freedoms. Already, many countries view the Chinese model, which eschews competitive elections and grants the political class considerable control over the economy, as an alternative route to development. It is up to Europe to highlight the shortcomings of this approach and make the case for liberal-democratic values.There is reason to hope that the EU will, as von der Leyen urges, 'step up'. In fact, her Davos proclamation reflects a consensus that has been emerging among European political leaders, most notably German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President\u00a0Emmanuel Macron, for a few years now. For example, Macron\u00a0pledged\u00a0to 'rejuvenate' the EU in his 2017 inauguration speech, and has been emphasising the need to recover the spirit of progress ever since.It is time to transform this rhetoric into action. The world is facing powerful economic headwinds, including the Sino-American rivalry, rapid technological change, population aging in the advanced economies, worsening income inequality and deteriorating social mobility, and environmental degradation. Europe can help the world to overcome them.

While the ban is focused on curbing the use and promotion of tobacco-related vaping products, it has many cannabis-related influencers thinking they'll even more obstacles than they already do when it comes to their professional and network development on social media. Benzinga reached out to influencers in the cannabis space and asked what the ban means for them, and contacted Instagram parent company Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB[4]) for comment.Instagram's Cannabis StanceThe battle between Instagram and cannabis is not new. </p><p>Although Instagram's latest initiative is not focused on cannabis products, but rather on nicotine vaping products, the move came as no surprise for cannabis influencerswho are already used to all kinds of restrictions. As explained by Facebook, the company seeks to filter certain types of contentto avoid encouraging the use of products that threaten the health of its users. \"Content that attempts to buy, sell or trade marijuana, including marijuana vape products, is not allowed on Instagram,\" a Facebook spokesperson told Benzinga. \"Our policy prohibits any marijuana seller, including dispensaries, from promoting their business by providing contact information like phone numbers or street addresses. We do allow marijuana advocacy content as long as it is not promoting the sale of the drug.\" Where does Facebook draw the line? How does it make sure to stop harmful promotions while still allowing those who seek to generate awareness around products with medical properties? How does it ensure cannabis consumers and influencers do not see their speech restricted? Here's what top influencers in the space think.Steve DeAngelo - @steve.deangelo[5]; For Harborside Inc's(OTC: HSDEF[6]) Steve DeAngelo, Facebook and Instagram are not 'really serious about protecting the public from contaminated vape pens.' Otherwise, 'they would allow legal, licensed cannabis companies to advertise on their platforms \u2014because every single case of a contaminated pen has been traced to unlicensed, underground sources,' he says. 'Until that happens, influencers will find a way to drive traffic to unlicensed suppliers, no matter what steps Facebook takes. It's more effective to use market forces than brute force.'Alice Moon - @thealicemoon[7] Alice Moon is a cannabis entrepreneur who was deleted from Instagram when she had 14,000 followers. She's now back up to almost 9,000. Moon points Benzinga toward Instagram's history of deleting cannabis-related accounts. 'I'm afraid that this new policy will open the door for Instagram to target cannabis influencers even more so than before,' she says. 'The AI may be trained to delete posts that contain smoke, so how will it know the difference between vape smoke and dab smoke?' Moon says she hopes Instagram will 'consider creating a pathway for cannabis influencers to safely exist on their platform. Otherwise, every person who smokes on their page is at risk for deletion.' The Facebook spokesperson tells Benzinga that the sale or promotion of marijuana has long been prohibited on Instagram: \"these new policies apply to tobacco vapes.\"Rachel Wolfson - @wolfiecomedy[8] and @wolfiememes[9]  With a combined Instagram following of roughly 100,000, Rachel Wolfson, weed comedian[10], is as Insta-savvy as one can get. She was not surprised at all when she learned about Facebook and Instgram's new policy. \"It will definitely affect the way cannabis companies advertise products on social media,\" she tells Benzinga. 'It's just their latest effort in censoring cannabis content. It's hilarious alcohol [which kills people]only gets 'special restrictions,' yet weed and vaping get categorized with weapons,' Wolfson says. 'It will be interesting to see how they choose to control the content once it becomes federally legal.' Facebook tells Benzinga that dispensaries can promote the use and federal legalization of marijuana on Instagram so long as they do not promote the sale of the drug or contact information for the store.Andrew DeAngelo - @andrew_deangelo[11] Andrew DeAngelo, Steve's brother, has a smaller, but engaged Instagram following. He was not surprised to see 'Big Tech banning vape ads' either, he says. 'Many cannabis companies have had multiple Instagram accounts closed for years now just for being cannabis companies,' DeAngelo says. \"We have learned how to get around the bans by Big Tech with decentralized messaging and community influencers, but it's hard and presents constraints.\" Bans like these ultimately drive more activity to the illicit market by \"confusing consumers and constraining operators,\" he says. \"It's a great way to get more people sick.\"Jon Cappetta - @joncappetta[12] and @hightimesmagazine[13] Jon Cappetta is the vice president of content for High Times Holdings. This means he's ultimately responsible for numerous social media accounts beyond his own that boast more than 33,000followers, including those for High Times Magazine, Dope Magazine and others. 'Blanket enforcements like this are intentionally vague so the platform has as much freedom to flag or remove as it likes,' he says.While Instagram may say it's concerned about nicotine right now, there's no way to know where their priorities will be tomorrow, Cappetta says. Think about it: glass art like bongs or pipes are technically tobacco products; 510 thread batteries are technically vape products.Brands that make anything associated in any way with either category could now be in danger of losing their pages if they gain any momentum with this ban.' These limitations, in addition to the ban on traditional cannabis advertising, make Capetta think this it's 'a clear signal of 'we don't want your kind on our platform.''Bess Byers - @imcannabess[14] One of the top influencers in the cannabis space is, without a doubt, Bess Byers. She's been in a battle of sorts with Instagram for quite some time now: her account has been deactivated and reactivated so many times it's impossible to keep track. As founder of Blaise Creative, Byers creates content under the premise that she cannot pay for advertising \u2014and does not intend to either. 'This forces me to think outside the box and build an authentic audience. Moreover, I don't like or trust Facebook Inc., so I don't want to give them money in addition to the data they already collect from me,' she tells Benzinga. 'I do wonder if Instagram's ban also includes artificial intelligenceor image recognition software. I've theorized posts with smoke clouds get shadow banned or suppressed in their reach.' Other creatives Byers knows have noticed the same issue, she says. Instagram does use AI to find content promoting the sale of marijuana, the spokesperson told Benzinga, while emphasizing that the new vape policy solely targets tobacco. Data on the amount of drug sales removed from Instagram is available in its Community Standards Enforcement report[15], according to the company.Bentley Rolling - @bentleyrolling[16] Bentley Rolling might have one of the coolest jobs on earth[17]: cannabis photographer and videographer. One of the ways he landed it was by building a strong social media presence. He expresses frustration about seeing legal cannabis being grouped in with tobacco vaporizers. 'Vaporization is one of the more healthy ways for people to medicate,' he says. \"There are many companies dedicated to providing patients with high quality, compliant vaporizers. They are already taking a huge hit to their sales based on the misinformation and false propaganda around vaping.\" The regulation around legal cannabis is more strict than for organic food, Rolling says, adding that both the extract and the cartridge and hardware are tested. He was unsurprised to learn that Instagram hasstarted cracking down on posts promoting vaping. 'With the extreme uproar around vaping-related illnesses, it was only a matter of time. As a community, we've gotten used to living in a perpetual gray area. What we've come to learn over the years is to never give up. They can try to silence our community, but we're here and we're not going anywhere. The key to legalization is education.'Jonathan Hirsh - @weedstagram416[18] In Jonathan Hirsh's view, social media is, unfortunately, 'not a place for free speech. 'As Facebook is a private company, they have the right to govern their property as they see fit,' he says, noting he that he is unsurewe'll ever see true free speech for cannabis communicators. These issues are compounded by unclear rules, he says. He does suggest cannabis influencers use the 'Age Gate' option when it's available. 'I have generally avoided discussing cannabis e-vapes as I have always had a suspicion that they were incredibly unhealthy for a multitude of reasons. From the cartridges themselves, to the material being processed into oil, to the terpenes being added back in at unknown ratios, and yes, even the cutting agents,' Hirsh says. 'So for now I will continue avoiding discussing cannabis e-vapes and posting educational content surrounding the industry, growing, extractingand all the cannabis gadgets.'Jacqui Childs - @jacquichilds[19] Boasting 136,000followers on Instagram, more than 2 million on Facebookand 30,000 more on Twitter, Inc.(NYSE: TWTR[20]), Canadian Jacqui Childs has a big reach in the cannabis space. In an already challenging spacewhere brands and influencers need to think outside of the box to get their message across, the new ban will only force them to get more creative, she says. 'First they took the likes away, then deleted posts and shadow bans. The rules are the rules whether we like them or not, but I'm up for the challenge and I believe other creative geniuses in the space will be able to work within these new guidelines, as long as the guidelines are made clear \u2014social platforms are famous for draconian behavior.' She suggests that influencers not put all their eggs in one basket and perhaps focus on other online platforms. 'As an influencer you want and need your voice to be heard. Add all the apps and platforms to your voice and become a choir.'Tyler Knight - Herbfluence Finally, we spokewith Tyler Knight, founder and CEO of Herbfluence, an online platform that connects cannabis social media influencers with brands looking to advertise to the millions of cannabis consumers in the U.S. and Canada. Herbfluence launched last month and already has more than 120 of the leading cannabis influencers on board, with a combined reach of over 15 million cannabis consumers, as well as several client brands. Facebook makes it 'incredibly difficult' for businesses in the cannabis space to advertise their products, communicate with their customersand grow their sales, Knight says. \"Moreover, many of their cannabis policies are unclear and often arbitrarily enforced,' he says. 'I believe Facebook's cannabis advertising policies are stifling the sales of thousands of small businesses, making it more difficult for hundreds of influencers to make a living, and hampering the legalization movement.\" The more this friction and frustration is alleviated, the more the industry will be able to move forward, Knight says.

To a post that promoted untrue claims about mail-in ballot fraud, Twitter added a small exclamation mark and warning, 'Get the facts about mail-in ballots,' that linked to a page fact-checking the president's statements. The president responded, two days later, with an executive order[1] targeting Section 230, the piece of federal code social media companies more or less live by when it comes to moderating content on their sites. The law allows Twitter to regulate, flag, and remove content posted by anyone, even the president. </p><p>Many legal experts criticized the president's move as a violation of the First Amendment[2] and unenforceable because it cannot alter a law enacted by Congress.[3] It was also pretty toothless\u2014the order could only suggest that the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission 'should' go after techcompanies for bias, since the president has no authority to order those independent bodies to do so. Yet while the legality of and motivation behind the executive order are problematic, across the political spectrum lawmakers and academics say that the statute has issues that need to be addressed.What is Section 230?In 1996 two congressmen\u2014Ron Wyden, a democrat from Oregon and Chris Cox, a republican from California\u2014wrote Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Congress dreamed up the CDA as an early, some say 'panicked[4],' attempt to regulate pornography on the internet and, particularly, to keep children from stumbling across pornographic images online. But Wyden and Cox wanted to make sure any regulation wouldn't stifle the internet's growth and innovation. In a recent discussion hosted by the Aspen Institute[5], Wyden, now a U.S. senator, described Section 230[6] as a 'sword and a shield.' The law shields websites from liability for the content users post, so that if someone writes a defamatory Yelp review or posts something untrue on Twitter, it's the user who could be sued, not the platform. And it gives the platforms a 'sword' by allowing them broad leeway to take down anything they deem offensive. Section 230 has been heralded as 'the 'Magna Carta' of the internet[7]' and the 'most important law protecting internet speech[8].' Proponents of the law say it has allowed the internet to flourish, making sites that rely on user-generated content, like Facebook, Yelp, Reddit, and YouTube, possible. If these sites were liable for users' posts, platforms would be overly cautious, refusing to host any content that could get them sued. Instead, the internet has allowed many communities to thrive and has amplified the voices of LGBTQ+ advocates, BIPOC movements, women, and those who otherwise wouldn't have the resources to project their message to millions of others. 'Without 230, it's a certainty that not a single #metoo post would have been allowed on moderated sites,' said Wyden during the Aspen Institute call. And he argues Section 230 helps diversify the internet by helping smaller platforms that can't afford to build elaborate filtering systems to moderate content. But Section 230 has also been the center of intense scrutiny from both liberals and conservatives, who complain that tech companies use the law to, on one hand, suppress users' free speech and, on the other, absolve themselves of any responsibility for the content on their sites. These critics have identified two main problems with Section 230.Problem one: Tech companies set their own rules for acceptable speechWhile Section 230 shields platforms from liability for their users' posts, social media sites are not bastions of unfettered free speech. Companies like Twitter[9] and Facebook[10] actively meddle in content, from elevating certain posts over others, to burying others, to flagging or removing content or users altogether. Daphne Keller, director of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center's Program on Platform Regulation, writes that social media platforms have[11] an 'unprecedented technological capacity to regulate individual expression. Facebook and other large internet companies can monitor every word users share and instantly delete anything they don't like. No communications medium in human history has ever worked this way.' President Trump's tiff with Twitter centers on his belief that the platform discriminates against conservative voices[12], particularly his own. Critics of the president, however, complain Twitter has wrongly held back on flagging or even removing[13] Trump's more untruthful and incendiary posts. Twitter responded to the executive order wit[14]h a tweet[15] calling it 'a reactionary and politicized approach to landmark law.' The response also went on to laud Section 230, saying it 'protects American innovation and freedom of expression,' and that 'attempts to unilaterally erode it threaten the future of online speech and Internet freedoms.' Facebook has taken a different approach. CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook and Instagram would not label the president's inflammatory posts about protests in Minneapolis, spurring employees to stage a virtual walkout[16]. In a note that he later made public on Facebook[17], Zuckerberg wrote, '[W]e will continue to stand for giving everyone a voice and erring on the side of free expression in these difficult decisions.' He also promised that the company will review its policies on voter suppression and on content that threatens state violence. In an email to The Markup, Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said the company believes altering or repealing Section 230 would be a mistake. 'By exposing companies to potential liability for everything that billions of people around the world say, this would penalize companies that choose to allow controversial speech and encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone,' he wrote. Prager University[18], a conservative nonprofit, and a group of LGBTQ+ content creators[19] have separately sued Google/YouTube for bias after the platform labeled their videos 'restricted,' a designation that makes the content harder to find and is meant to help parents keep their kids away from extreme content. Increasingly, scholars worry that meddling has less to do with making platforms safer or freer and more to do with elevating the companies' commercial interests[20]. In 1996, when the law was passed, the internet was largely chat rooms run by small startups. Now, tech companies like Google and Facebook have become information gatekeepers that have huge control over what information users see and how it's organized. Stone said Facebook actually changed its feed in 2018[21] to promote content from friends and family over posts from businesses and news sites. 'I don't think we know enough about the details of commercially driven ranking and promotion or demotion of content,' said Marietje Schaake, policy director for Stanford's Cyber Policy Center during a panel discussion[22] about Trump's executive order. 'A lot of the decisions companies make every day are not very clear or accountable.'Problem too: Guns, stalkers, and child predatorsSection 230 is meant to protect discourse, but online it can be hard to distinguish where speech ends and action begins. Tech companies have used Section 230's immunities to protect themselves from liability against accusations of discriminatory advertising, illegal activity, and harassment taking place on their platforms. When housing advocates sued Facebook for violating the Fair Housing Act by allegedly allowing housing, credit, and employment advertisers to target or exclude certain racial groups, Facebook use[23]d Section 230 as a defense[24]. The case settled out of court, and Facebook agreed to change its system. Backpage, a classifieds website that frequently hosted advertisements that featured child prostitution, us[25]ed Section 230 to protect itself from liability for years[26] before federal law enforcement shuttered the site in 2018. Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram tried a similar defense when a Texas lawyer sued the companies[27] for allegedly allowing pimps to operate on their platforms, allegedly luring children into prostitution. (That case is ongoing.) Armslist.com, which describes itself as a 'firearms marketplace,' allows people to sell guns without a license and to sell to buyers who might not pass mandatory background tests. In one case, Radcliffe Haughton, who was the subject of a restraining order forbidding him to own a firearm, purchased a gun on Armslist and used it to kill his estranged wife and two of her coworkers, according to court papers filed in the subsequent lawsuit against Armslist. The Wisconsin Supreme court ruled that, because of Section 230's protections, Armslist was not liable[28]. 'Invoking Section 230 to immunize from liability enterprises that have nothing to do with moderating online speech, such as marketplaces that connect sellers of deadly weapons with prohibited buyers for a cut of the profits, is unjustifiable,' wrote legal scholars Danielle Citron and Mary Anne Franks for a forthcoming article[29]. Similar issues come up with sites like Grindr, where features like geolocation can facilitate harassment offline. According to court papers filed in a lawsuit against Grindr, a user named Oscar Juan Carlos Gutierrez allegedly created a fake account[30] to impersonate his ex-boyfriend, Matthew Herrick. Gutierrez allegedly sent more than a thousand men to Herrick's apartment and office, all of whom thought Herrick had invited them for sex. Herrick alleged that he repeatedly petitioned Grindr to remove the account but the company did nothing. But when Herrick sued, the case was thrown out based on Section 230 protections. There's also worry among legal scholars that women and people of color are the ones who suffer most when online harassment and stalking aren't properly regulated. Franks and Citron have argued that when tech companies fail to control behavior like cyber mobs and nonconsensual pornography on their platforms, it interferes with equal access to online spaces[31]. 'There are no civil rights without cyber civil rights,' they wrote in a Harvard Law Review blog post.Is there a solution?Proponents of changing or replacing Section 230 have struggled with the same problem regulators had back in 1996: how to dampen the worst of social media while protecting the rest. In 2018 Congress passed two laws, Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FO[32]STA[33]) and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SE[34]STA[35]), which amend Section 230 and make websites that enable sex trafficking liable in both civil and criminal cases. After the law passed, many platforms did start to moderate certain content more actively. Reddit banned multiple forums[36], including r/escorts and r/SugarDaddies, and Craigslist shu[37]t down its personals listings[38], but so far there have been no high-profile prosecutions.(Craigslist founder Craig Newmark is a funder of The Markup.) And many sex workers say the law has done the opposite of what it was intended to do. Now, sex workers can no longer use the internet to safely find and vet clients, or to share information among themselves about clients who could be dangerous, according to a study conducted by the advocacy group Hacking//Hustling[39]. In March, a pair of bipartisan senators, Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, introduced the EARN IT Act[40], aimed at preventing online child exploitation. The law would compel companies to comply with certain 'best practices' or risk losing their Section 230 protections. But critics say the law violates users' privacy and free speech. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for privacy online, characterizes these 'best practices' as first amendment violations[41]. Other approaches have focused on content moderation, rather than on preventing specific crimes. In 2019 Republican senator Josh Hawley proposed an amendment [42]to the Communications Decency Act that would require content moderation decisions to be politically neutral if companies wanted Section 230 protections. But critics say the law is overly vague. 'It assumes there is such a thing as 'political neutrality' and that the FTC can define and enforce what that is,' tweeted[43] Stanford's Keller. Democratic congressman Adam Schiff[44] and senator Mark Warner[45] have both suggested Section230 immunities should be limited, particularly when it comes to hosting deep fakes or misinformation, but neither lawmaker has proposed legislation yet. Changing or repealing Section 230 is tricky because it protects some of the best and worst parts of the internet. As legal scholar Eric Goldman wrote[46], when we focus on the nastiest tendencies of the internet, we're more likely to want to change Section 230. But if we focus on the internet's good contributions to society, we're less apt to change the law.

In 2016, there were 325 million of the small gadgets, slipped onto wrists or fingers around the world - and by next year, that figure is projected to hit over 830 million.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We've come to rely on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/activity-monitors-dogs-cats-quantified-pet/\">fitness trackers</url> to harvest a field of data: they track the miles we run, the calories we burn, and even the minutes we spend in deep sleep. But now, 10 years after the first Fitbit (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/activity-monitors-dogs-cats-quantified-pet/\">the Classic</url> - it clipped onto your belt) hit shop shelves, the wearables market is looking towards the next big thing, propelled in part by the fact that the industry noticed a slow down in sales last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, what will the fitness tracker of the future look like?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CES 2019 gave a tantalising glimpse of the answer, featuring a smart-belt, headphones that help you to exercise better, and a wrist-mounted calorie counter.</p><p>\"A decade ago, the devices were very cumbersome and you could tell someone was wearing one,\" says Mathieu Letombe, general manager of health technology brand Withings. \"Today's wearables have developed to where some activity trackers are now worn in more discreet locations.\" Take, as example, L'Oreal's lapel-mounted My Skin Track UV sensor, which links to an app to tell you when you've been in the sun for too long. Or the Oura sleep tracking ring, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/activity-monitors-dogs-cats-quantified-pet/\">as worn by none other than Prince Harry</url> .</p><p>To an extent, the shrinking size relates to a concern within the industry that the slowdown in sales is due to trackers being too 'invasive' - which is to say that they're still quite bulky, and you have to do things like charge them up, adapting your routine to suit theirs. But it's also the ineluctable path that fitness tracking technology was always going to take: from big units that attached to belts, to embedded in the belts themselves.</p><p>\"The easiest way to build something into people's lives is to do so in their clothing,\" says Tim Brownstone, founder and CEO of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/activity-monitors-dogs-cats-quantified-pet/\">Kymira</url>, a sportswear brand which uses NASA technology to convert energy from the body into infrared to promote oxygen absorption in muscles. \"Pretty much everyone in the world gets dressed in the morning, you don't have to adapt your life to fit the tech, it's just built into what you're doing already.\"</p><p>Alongside the ever-decreasing size of the things, expect trackers to start looking at different metrics. If the pedometers evolved into the fitness trackers by adding heart rate and GPS systems, then the tracker looks set to evolve into a holistic health monitor, measuring everything from blood sugar levels to stress.</p><p>\"When wearables became popular, the goal of the industry was adoption,\" says LeTombe. \"Now we are at a pivotal point between activity tracking and health monitoring. Devices now go beyond just tracking steps and actually monitor serious health issues and habits.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/activity-monitors-dogs-cats-quantified-pet/\">365 EOA</url></p><p>But with this increased field of view comes obvious questions around ethical data usage. \"One risky trend we may see is companies using our wearables' data to monitor our behaviour without our knowledge,\" suggests Tim Hoctor, VP of professional services at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/activity-monitors-dogs-cats-quantified-pet/\">Elsevier</url> . \"An insurance firm could offer, for instance, higher premiums to those it deems a greater risk based on lower levels of activity.\" Indeed, US insurers are already moving in on the game, offering plans tied to data they read from individual's wearables.</p><p>One potential solution to the data issue can be found in products like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/activity-monitors-dogs-cats-quantified-pet/\">Digi.me</url>, a cloud-based app where users can collect all their personal data in one place and share it wherever they wish. Its founder, Julian Ranger, explains that putting users in the driver's seat will be key to leveraging health data from wearable devices: \"The way to get people comfortable with the idea of sharing health data is to put them at the heart of the consent process. It is entirely possible to build apps and platforms that allow the user to dictate what data they want to share, and with whom - with the power to revoke that consent at any moment.\"</p><p>Ultimately, both wearable technology brands and healthcare systems will have to work in cooperation with one another, thinks Hoctor: \"The reality is that while tech companies that make wearables are good at gathering data, they are less able to understand true scientific context and actually uncover insights about our health from it. Ultimately, wearable devices will still require the input of experts that can collate and make sense of the data.\"</p><p>While we may see healthcare systems using the data from health monitors indirectly as research tools, there's also plenty of wearable devices already being developed to help treat illnesses more directly.</p><p>In this regard, wearable technology could allow people to play doctor for themselves, allowing them to self-monitor and, where there is technology available, even treat their own symptoms. In an age where health-care systems are being squeezed ever tighter, this could save both time and money for resource-stricken doctors.</p><p>And it's here, in the medical realm, where we find the ultimate extension of fitness trackers. Ingestibles and transferrables. Tech that we 'wear' on the inside.</p><p>Ingestibles are a new sphere of tech sometimes known as smart pills: tiny electronic devices small enough to enter the bloodstream. These can beam back health information from within the user's body for doctors to act on from the outside. \"Ingestibles are short term measures but being used quite broadly,\" says Brownstone. \"You've got medical applications through to the likes of England Rugby, who were using ingestible temperature sensors to measure core body temperature in climate regulation ahead of the World Cup because Tokyo, where it's being held, is very different in climate to what we're used to here in the UK.\"</p><p>Transferables take the form of temporary tattoos. They're already being used as passes into nightclubs or festivals, and now the same technology which allows Kymira's wearables to harvest energy from the body could be adapted to create tattoos for \"long-term health monitoring\"; technology which is \"not yet commercialised but is being conceived at an academic research level.\"</p><p>And then there's implantables. Ranger already has a chip buried in his hand which contains contact information, speculating that it may not be long until this technology can be used to monitor health data.</p><p>Does this herald the start of the Cyborgs? \"In the short term, I don't think you're going to see mass-augmentation because current social norms make it feel a step too far,\" says Brownstone. \"That's not to say it'll never become a thing; for those that want it, it already is.\"</p><p>Ultimately, the mood in the industry seems more focused on rewarding users for their efforts and continuing to motivate them to take an interest in their health. If big tech can find a way to work in tandem with ordinary users, there's no reason to think wearable technology can't continue to evolve and improve our health, becoming smaller, easier to use, and less invasive to its users' lives.</p><p>For the moment, this is mostly limited to wearable devices but as the facilities become available to miniaturise health technology, we're already starting to see the next evolutions: ingestibles and transferrables.</p><p>The latter are a new sphere of tech sometimes known as smart pills.

That's a question[2] that's been getting[3] increased attention[4] recently[5], with growing pressure from state regulators and legislators for antitrust action against big tech companies. While the U.S. still has a long debate ahead on this issue, European regulators have already been investigating, and in some cases fining[6], large tech companies for their data practices. Part of the debate in the U.S. centers on whether the control of big data is an antitrust issue, a consumer protection issue, or both. </p><p>But there are indications that the FTC, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, and State regulators will not sit idly while the debate continues. Last month's announcement that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has created a new Technology Task Force to more closely monitor a tech companies signals that enforcement by U.S. antitrust regulators could be on the way. The FTC's newTechnology Task Force will focus on 'examining industry practices and conducting law enforcement investigations . . . on technology-related matters, including prospective merger reviews in the technology sector and reviews of consummated technology mergers.' The Task Force will be comprised of agency attorneys who will coordinate with the agency's Consumer Protection Bureau as well as agency technologists. This new federal enforcement tool is the latest effort by the FTC to monitor the impact of technology markets on competition and is also the most significant of several steps U.S. federal and state regulators have taken to date on this front. One particular concern regulators have is that anticompetitive behavior could negatively impact consumer privacy. In Last September, the DOJ, including Assistant Attorney General for Antirust Makan Delrahim, hosted a meeting with attorneys general from eight states and the District of Columbia and law enforcement representatives from five other states. The DOJ stated, and several state AGs confirmed, that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss whether technology companies 'may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms' and to ensure that consumers' personal information is protected as much as possible. Unlike regulators in Europe, neither the DOJ nor the FTC has had any real cases yet that address these issues, While U.S. regulators have commented on the potential overlap between consumer privacy and antitrust concerns, neither the DOJ nor the FTC has had a concrete case to decide tied to anticompetitive issues related to consumer data. One challenge U.S. regulators face is that it may be difficult to articulate the theory of harm. Generally, harm to a group of consumers as a whole would be best addressed through antitrust laws, while harm to individual consumers is best resolved by consumer protection laws. Some have theorized that big data could allow a big tech company to raise prices and exploit consumers, or that the accumulation and control of data has an impact on privacy and data security, thus lessening the quality of a product or service offered to consumers. But antitrust laws do not make it illegal to charge high prices. And competition theories should not be based on unfairness, which does not constitute harm to competition. In addition, if a tech company's platform serves two markets, e.g., consumers and merchants, and if transactions on each side are bound to one another (the so called 'two-sided market'), a viable antitrust claim would have to involve harm to both sides of the platform. When it comes to mergers, there is an argument that combining big datasets could pose potential barriers to entry. But any company can begin collecting consumer data, and that data is not unique in any way to constitute a single product market. This means the focus of any merger analysis would likely be on whether the combination will reduce the incentives of merging entities to protect data. To date, the FTC has not challenged a merger on the basis of a reduction in non-price competition over privacy protections, but it noted as far back as June 2015 that it has 'explicitly recognized that privacy can be a non-price dimension of competition.' At the FTC hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century held in the fall of 2018, panelists explained that it would be hard to prove a company's data collection practices violate any antitrust rules. What was evident from the hearings is that no one yet can point to conduct and results that would make a case of monopolization or exclusionary conduct due to data aggregation. Indeed, there seems to be a consensus among economists and antitrust practitioners that acquiring or possessing big data, on its own, is not enough for regulators to show any violation. Nonetheless, state regulators and legislators are pressuring the FTC to pursue such cases. In an October 2018 letter to the FTC, attorneys general from 11 states and the District of Columbia asked the FTC to aggressively enforce the antitrust law at the 'intersection between privacy, big data, and competition.' The state AGs argued that there can be 'possible long-term anticompetitive harms arising from the aggregation of big data by a small number of dominant platforms,' including the possibility that data aggregation can become a barrier to entry. The state AGs argued that dominant firms could stifle competition in 'new lines of business, and perhaps particularly in the context of new services' and asked for '[c]reative and vigorous enforcement efforts.' In particular, the state AGs criticized the 'misguided application of the consumer welfare standard' and indicated that they thought it may be applied 'too narrowly' in some circumstances. Notably, federal and state regulators do not list what specific statutes or regulations they should be enforcing or how the accumulation of big data by tech companies may violate those statutes and regulations. Unlike the EU's competition laws, U.S. antitrust laws do not punish dominant market power unless there is also some anticompetitive behavior that has enabled the target to maintain or extend its monopoly. In the United States, the acquisition and collection of consumer data, while certainly valuable and competitively significant, may not raise exclusionary concerns. And the growth of tech companies that focus on gathering information on internet users and consumers does not necessarily indicate that there has been any violation of antitrust laws. Indeed, if a firm is gaining market power through legal means, there is no violation of U.S. antitrust laws. To that end, none of the literature on the antitrust concerns over big data lays a roadmap for how an enforcement action would be handled in the U.S. Despite the ongoing debate, scrutiny of technology companies \u2014 and big tech in particular \u2014 will continue to grow. The European Commission and other European competition authorities have laid the groundwork for future antitrust investigations and have been trying test antitrust theories by bringing enforcement actions against tech companies in Europe. The creation of the FTC Tech Task Force signals that U.S. regulators intend to take a similar approach \u2014 especially when it comes to data aggregation. What it also means is that the FTC has now dedicated personnel and resources to investigate potential misconduct and test antitrust theories. To the extent a tech company accumulates and maintains large volumes of consumer data but has not yet evaluated how regulators may perceive its business model and data-related practices, now is the time. While the debate continues and there are significant doubts about whether regulators, both federal and state, would be able to frame data practices as an antitrust issue, the very risk of being embroiled in a lengthy and costly investigation deserves careful consideration.

It is also opening up new revenue streams, both for existing financial services players and companies new to the sector. The key transformational technologies underpinning change will include open APIs [application programming interface], artificial intelligence, data science, robotic process automation, augmented reality and blockchain. These will impact across the breadth of the fintech sector whether it be in wealthtech, insurtech, paytech, capital markets tech or other sub-segments.<br/>Meet the panel<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Sam Ryder: We are believers that emerging fintech solutions that partner with the incumbent providers, rather than replace, are best positioned to succeed. Incumbents bring distribution and regulatory know-how, while emerging technologies can be nimbler and expand an incumbent's product offering. Recent examples include banks partnering with fintechs to deliver a fully digital banking environment and financial advisors leveraging robo-advisors to bring efficiencies to their practice.<br/><br/>Christopher Cruz: Although we are experiencing significant innovation on the edge of payments (devices, applications, integrations) there is still much to improve about the core infrastructure of payment systems. Globally, we are still reliant on processing platforms that are based on legacy architectures. These include messaging systems with capacity limitations and a reliance on credit-like arrangements to make payments appear real-time. Improvements in payment infrastructure and interoperability could unlock significant transformations across the payments sector within fintech.<br/><br/>Blythe Masters: We have been talking about the application of big data, AI and distributed ledger technology to financial services for some time. In many areas we are reaching tipping points where these technologies will become pervasive. Combining real-time data flows and advanced analytics that leverage AI and machine learning has the potential to transform personal and institutional financial services. Both capabilities have so far been adopted largely as point solutions; by putting them at the heart of a financial organisation it is possible to open fundamentally new business models that are truly transformative.<br/><br/>From the perspective of enterprise, DLT and the resulting operational advances from straight-through processing and elimination of reconciliation offers great untapped potential that will depend on the large-scale platform fintech businesses offering sufficiently compelling network effects to offset the costs of adoption.<br/>The crisis and shift to remote working have heightened cybersecurity concerns; what does this mean for fintech going forward?<br/>SR: With the recent shift to remote work and the corresponding acceleration of financial services to a more digital environment, awareness and attention to cybersecurity will continue to accelerate. In payments, as an example, fraud is increasingly moving online given higher e-commerce transaction volumes. Security solutions that help merchants and processors prevent and manage fraud are well-positioned to capitalise on a growing market opportunity.<br/><br/>BM: Cybersecurity is of critical importance to all financial services firms, and the recent changes have only heightened focus on this space. A less explored area where we believe fintech has potential is on the insurance side of cybersecurity. Being able to more accurately predict, size and transfer the risk of systemic cybersecurity events is a structural need that fintech can help to address.<br/><br/>CC: Fintechs with distributed operations are nothing new but this trend has certainly become more pronounced as a result of covid-19 precautions in the workplace. The need for advanced cybersecurity solutions will not only exist as a result of this event but will be an ever-changing concern requiring continuous investment to ensure adequate protections for customers and employees.<br/><br/>OB: The rapid growth in digital propositions will make companies and customers more vulnerable to breaches of their IT systems. The rise of open banking will also mean that more customer data is shared and used by third parties, which again creates a challenge for IT security. This will in turn create an opportunity for those who can address the challenge.<br/>Which sub-sectors offer the most interesting prospects in the near-to-medium term?<br/>CC: The convergence of payments and software will continue to be a key theme, having achieved various stages of maturity depending on industry vertical. Integrating the increasingly complex web of commerce point solutions with payment processing capability will improve the customer transaction experience at a time when customer demands for frictionless transacting is highest.<br/><br/>OB: The combination of open banking and open APIs will change the entire retail financial services ecosystem, from the products and services offered, to who \"owns\" the customer and the distribution channels used. There will be a lot of innovation and disruption which will create new businesses and interesting opportunities for venture capital and private equity investors. Insurtech is also a really exciting area for investment. Technology is changing the way that customers are served, risk is priced and claims managed. The rise of the sharing economy and peer-to-peer insurance is also fascinating.<br/><br/>BM: Our focus is on infrastructure-like technology businesses that have the capacity to scale and offer the business services and insights needed to drive transformation within financial services. Within this space we see a lot to be excited about. The current climate is accelerating the shift to a more digital financial services industry, with greater personalisation for the individual and greater efficiency for enterprise. We are exploring exciting prospects that fit within this trend, running from next-generation core banking technologies, through to capital markets platforms offering straight-through processing and end-to-end transaction lifecycle management.<br/><br/>SR: LLR's fintech team focuses on payments, including merchant processing, B2B payments and payment security, as well as wealth technology and bank technology. In each of these subsectors, we bring a long history of investing and believe that the underlying trends are strong - with the consistent theme being accelerating digitisation.<br/>What do you expect the industry to look like by 2030? And what do you see as private equity's role in shaping that?<br/>CC: The fintech sector combines the best of technological innovation with the scale and profitability of global financial services. I believe that the sector will be as attractive an area of investor focus in 2030 as it is now. The role of private equity investors in supporting companies through transformational change, while achieving growth at scale, is a natural fit for a sector inherently known for disruptive convergence.<br/>\"The fintech sector combines the best of technological innovation with the scale and profitability of global financial services\"<br/>Christopher Cruz, Searchlight Capital Partners<br/>SR: Private equity is fundamental to providing capital that helps emerging fintech players invest in their product, fund sales and marketing, and drive growth. According to data from PitchBook, 2019 set a record high with around $150 billion of investment into the fintech sector across private equity, venture capital and M&amp;A. We expect investment into fintech to continue to be strong over the long term with a focus on technologies that make financial services more accessible, easy to use, transparent, and secure for businesses and consumers alike.<br/><br/>OB: By 2030 I expect the terms fintech and financial services to have merged. There will be no area of financial services that is not fundamentally technology enabled and technology driven. Private equity will have a role to play in this growth, both by investing in fintech 'disruptors' and by investing in the technology capabilities and new business models of incumbent players.<br/><br/>BM: The value of data monetisation and business facilitation derived from large-scale platform businesses has been more than proven over the prior decade. Indeed, the world's most valuable companies are such Big Tech platforms. By 2030 we believe more fintech platforms will join that roster.<br/><br/>The consumer will look for a solution to their problem, not a particular product. The well-defined platform will deliver that solution, which will be far more important than the particular wrapper of insurance or wealth management. The traditional verticals across the industry will begin to blur, and scale and ability to access and process data will be increasingly essential. Individual data sovereignty and privacy protection will also likely be a feature of winning financial services platforms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PEIONL-514662</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PEIONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C7-TBV1-F0CX-91TW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">342670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1594\"/><timeReceived>2:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 PEI Media Ltd.

Of course, privacy concerns were on everyone's minds after the well-known recent hack that led to millions of users' information leak - plagued Facebook's[1] public relations team and an enormous spotlight was directed at not only the company, but the world of 'big tech'. Suddenly, consumers started to be concerned with what data was being collected on them and what was being done with the data that they were freely handing over to big tech companies. Obviously, they were not fond of the idea that 'big tech' companies like Facebook and Google, which were providing a platform free of charge, were then turning around and capitalizing off of the data collected on their users without their (reasonable) permission. In many ways, these platforms that offered their services free to consumers changed the dynamic of the customer-provider relationship. </p><p>Rather than paying for a product, the consumers who were using the 'product' for free now found themselves acting as the product that the tech companies could offer third-parties and the marketing world. In theory, trading one's personal data for a top-notch service completely free of charge doesn't (necessarily) seem like a terrible trade-off. Of course, the problem here is that not everyone is comfortable with, or in agreement on, what data may be used (or should be used) as that very 'product.' As was the case with so many users, no one really knew which parts of their data were being shared[2] either internally within the company or externally with third-parties (especially when utilizing the 'Sign Up with Facebook'[3] options so many services offered). In addition, most consumers didn't know much about the process of limiting or controlling what part(s) of their personal data could be shared or accessed by other parties. Enter: GDPR.GDPR Though it was in the works before the Facebook revelations and public outcry, the European Union passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[4], which transformed the way companies interact with their users and how they treat the collection of users' personal data. The GDPR is a large piece of regulation that outlines what consumers' rights are in relation to companies handling their personal information in the European Economic Area (EEA). With the passing of the GDPR, consumers in the EEA now have the ability to receive a copy of what information a company has on them as well as control what may remain in the company's possession, along with much more.  The main takeaway from the passing of the GDPR is the ability for consumers to have more control over their personal information. Along with knowing what personal data a company has collected from them and held onto, consumers also have the right to access, correct/adjust, and even delete information. But with these changes coming to the world of big tech, what does the future hold for the way consumers and companies interact with each other? After all, many would argue that something as simple as seeing targeted advertising is ultimately more useful than random online advertising that's likely to not be anything the consumer is interested in. How do the two industries reconcile the new changes and ensure relevance in the future?Putting Control in the Hands of ConsumersTo ensure large tech companies, advertisers, and marketing teams are still able to access value in the online marketplace, there's one distinct direction the world of privacy may likely head to. The best outcome for all parties seems evident in that it requires putting control over personal data back into the hands of consumers. Rather than companies offering a 'free' model for their services (where consumers are actually paying with their personal information), there are some new startups working to make the entire process more transparent and beneficial for all parties involved. Advertisers still value access to personal data and information, but that information doesn't need to necessarily come from a third-party service. In fact, first-party data providers (the consumers themselves) are able to offer even more valuable data than aggregators because of its validity. New startups are focusing on the problems the current data market is experiencing and are putting data providers (i.e. the users/consumers) back in the driver's seat. To accomplish this, we're seeing an increased number of ways for users to sell access to their information and benefit from it directly, rather than a site collecting information on them and benefiting from it.[5] Some recent examples include two blockchain-based startups that are cutting out the middleman (who may actually be collecting the data you provide in the marketplace as well) by creating decentralized ways for users to connect with buyers interested in their data (of which there are a lot). Datum[6] and Zinc[7] are two of these blockchain startups making it happen. Both teams are focusing on switching the paradigm and ensuring that users not only decide who has access to their information, but that they're rewarded for sharing it as well. Companies like Zinc see that the way consumers think about their data is changing, and that people want more value when they hand over personal information; they don't want to be taken advantage of. The best way to connect the two parties (consumers and those who want their data) is to allow them to interact directly. With the system, users will be able to control what is done with their data, to what extent it can be used, and what information they consider to be off limits, all while being rewarded for sharing it. On the other side of the arrangement, those looking to utilize user data will be able to access data from first-party providers, meaning an increased level of accuracy in the data market, which is crucial for effective marketing strategies. Additionally, companies seeking data can market more effectively and efficiently, limiting ad spend waste, by engaging directly with relevant consumers. As Zinc explains, users are 'getting rewarded for their attention.' That attention is incredibly valuable.Future of the IndustryGiven the events of 2018, there's clearly been an increased interest in consumers protecting their personal data and, at the very least, wanting to know how it's being collected and used by big tech companies. In response to the movement, the industry is seeing new innovators offering consumers alternatives to the model created by big tech and we may likely see the industry as a whole shift in that direction. The future is looking towards more privacy control in the hands of consumers (and benefiting directly from their decision to share).Read next:  Exomoon the size of Neptune[8] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html%3ECambridge%20Analytica%20scandal%3C/a%3E%20and%20the%20%3Ca%20href=\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html%3ECambridge%20Analytica%20scandal%3C/a%3E%20and%20the%20%3Ca%20href=</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-your-personal-info-for-sale/\">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-your-personal-info-for-sale/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-you-sharing-when-you-sign-in-with-facebook-or-google/\">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-you-sharing-when-you-sign-in-with-facebook-or-google/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/07/11/485571291/firms-are-buying-sharing-your-online-info-what-can-you-do-about-it\">https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/07/11/485571291/firms-are-buying-sharing-your-online-info-what-can-you-do-about-it</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://datum.org\">https://datum.org</url>/ [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://zinc.co\">https://zinc.co</url>/ [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/10/exomoon-the-size-of-neptune.html\">https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/10/exomoon-the-size-of-neptune.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NXBF130278153875915876125176100056</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NXBF-130278</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDR-NWX1-F03R-N1J6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1288\"/><timeReceived>5:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Next Big Future</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 5, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Second, the fact that smaller and mid-cap firms continue to offer strategic opportunities to be acquired for their innovation. Third, the increased regulatory pressure from governments to lower drug prices. And fourth, the onward march of big tech into big pharma's traditional patch.</p><p>It's worth looking at them all in more detail to understand how these trends look set to continue throughout 2020.</p><h>Big pharma scales up</h><p>As alluded to, mega-mergers have become a mainstay in pharma M&amp;A. In fact, Bloomberg figures show the pharma industry has seen more $40 billion-plus deals in the past 10 years than any other sector, including tech.</p><p>In 2018, this trend included Takeda's (TYO: 4502) $62 billion purchase of Shire, launching it into the global top 10 pharma firms by revenue. Importantly, this disrupted the American and European dominance in the area and will likely be a sign of things to come.</p><p>The year was also a busy one for GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK), not least because of its buyout of Novartis' (NOVN: VX) stake in their consumer health joint venture for $13 billion, and their acquisition of Tesaro for $5 billion to strengthen their oncology capabilities.</p><p>And things only intensified in 2019, with the top 10 transactions of the first six months being 47% more valuable than a year earlier.</p><p>Notable deals included: Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE: BMY) $74 billion purchase of Celgene, helping to expand its oncology capacity and immunotherapy capabilities; AbbVie's (NYSE: ABBV) takeover of Allergan for $63 billion, growing the combined portfolio to include the world's top-selling drug Humira (adalimumab) and Allergan's flagship product, Botox (botulinum toxin); and also CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) and Aetna agreeing a $69 billion deal - which was significant not only for its size but also its sanctioning by the authorities.</p><p>However, the past years haven't exclusively been about scale-ups. Bolt-ons, where bigger companies buy smaller ones that offer (or have the potential to offer) innovative products, have become an increasingly attractive proposition. Such transactions enable these companies to expand and diversify their offerings without having to spend extensively on R&amp;D - which of course has no guaranteed results.</p><h>Acquisitions increasing to drive innovation</h><p>Many of these smaller companies are coming in the form of small and mid-cap biotech firms in the cell and gene therapy and immuno-oncology areas. And much of the reason for this is that early stage drug development of course requires extensive investment but with low success rates.</p><p>Late-stage trials, also expensive and often unaffordable for smaller firms, therefore become more attractive to big pharma firms given the higher probability for success.</p><p>Naturally, such innovation focused acquisitions are attractive to both sides. Big pharma increases its chances of success, and smaller firms are given the chance they likely wouldn't have otherwise had to see their product through to market.</p><h>Regulation and big tech means big change</h><p>But another trend that looks like it is not going away anytime soon is the propensity for US lawmakers to continue to respond to increased political pressure to reduce the drug prices which have historically provided healthy returns for big pharma. Hence, it's not surprising that innovation M&amp;As - aimed at diversifying the range of products the firms can offer - have become the next vital revenue stream.</p><p>And the other adaption that big pharma will have to continue to make is the potentially disruptive arrival of big tech on the healthcare scene. For example, Google's parent company Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) founded Verily Life Sciences in late 2018, and partnered with GSK to establish Galvani Bioelectronics to research, develop and market bioelectric medicines.</p><p>For the moment, these moves appear more collaborative than disruptive, but that may not always be the case judging by big tech's appetite for shaking up other sectors in recent years.</p><p>Longer term, big pharma will also have to invest in and build its own digital capabilities - notably AI - if the industry is to truly benefit from the vast increase in healthcare data now available, not least the potential for it to transform drug development pathways. Such investment and capacity building will also be vital if big pharma is to keep in check big tech.</p><h>2020: A familiar story with a new setting?</h><p>So what does all this mean? My bet is that M&amp;A will continue to be at the forefront of pharma's attempts to stay on top of the competition and maintain revenue streams.</p><p>But that has undoubtedly been given added impetus given the arrival of big tech on the scene, and the reshaping of revenue streams due to increased regulation. In other words, competition looks set to remain fierce, and in such an environment, don't be surprised to see even more interesting M&amp;As in the months ahead.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHARML-393013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHARML2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3R-4F41-JCDR-J2DD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"962\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Pharma Letter All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Pharma Letter</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33372\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002EAL</classCode><className>ALLERGAN INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001QM1</classCode><className>GLAXOSMITHKLINE PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001UBB</classCode><className>CVS HEALTH CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002JOI</classCode><className>NOVARTIS AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002M65</classCode><className>BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000920V</classCode><className>TAKEDA PHARMACEUTICAL CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000D7YH</classCode><className>TESARO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000DAD1</classCode><className>ABBVIE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS333314 OPTICAL INSTRUMENT &amp;

AP</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There once was a time when the outcome of a US election had minimal impact on stock markets. Deep down, investors knew the result wouldn't change that much and stock markets would largely rattle on as before. But that was because the gulf between Republicans and Democrats was not as outrageously wide as it is today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the nation's divisions grow even more extreme, those days are over. Elliot Hentov, head of policy research with the global macro policy research team at State Street Global Advisors, says US political risk is now a major issue for investors. \"The US no longer behaves like a developed country but an emerging economy, where markets respond far more aggressively to political outcomes,\" he says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read More</p><p>What does the weaker US dollar mean for you?</p><p>How will low interest rates in the US affect you?</p><p>Are US stocks destined to repeat history?</p><p>While past presidential elections were fought on the centre ground, both parties are now flying off to the extremes to placate their increasingly angry electoral base.</p><p>The economic policies they pursue in power are also likely to differ widely, as will the impact on share prices.</p><p>President Donald Trump and his rival Joe Biden are likely to set off on very different policy trajectories, Mr Hentov says, and markets will be volatile while they wait for the results.</p><p>There is another worry. When the world wakes up the day after the November 3 election, we may not even know who the winner is.</p><p>While State Street's research suggests a win for Mr Biden is the most likely outcome, it is far from assured. \"The second most likely outcome, and the biggest risk, is that the result will be disputed,\" Mr Hentov says.</p><p>Mr Trump has indicated that he may challenge any defeat, which could lead to months of political and legal wrangling in a country that is already on edge.</p><p>If that happens, Mr Hentov predicts a major sell-off of the US dollar in November and December as investors flee political risk. \"This would be a reversal of the usual trend because in a crisis, money usually flows into the US dollar as a safe haven. This time, though, the US is the crisis.\"</p><p>In a crisis, money usually flows into the US dollar as a safe haven. This time, though, the US is the crisis</p><p>Elliot Hentov, State Street Global Advisors</p><p>He predicts long-term depreciation in the dollar regardless of the result, but this could become \"disorderly\" if there is no clear winner.</p><p>This would spell bad news for UAE expats and residents, as the US dollar-pegged dirham would also fall, hitting the value of their earnings relative to other currencies.</p><p>Mr Hentov warns of a double whammy for the Gulf region. \"The oil price could fall, too, because demand is less likely to recover if political uncertainty drags on.\"</p><p>President Trump's tenure may have been controversial, but the stock market still wants him to win. Mr Hentov says: \"With the exception of the US trade war with China, his actions have been supportive for shareholders. This will be the case in the second term, although to a lesser extent.\"</p><p>Mr Biden's legislative programme could weigh on share prices, as it includes tax increases on businesses and the wealthy, closer regulatory scrutiny and potential anti-trust laws to rein in big companies and boost low pay.</p><p>Mr Hentov says a clear win for either candidate would nonetheless trigger a year-end \"relief rally\", by removing the uncertainty of interminable court disputes. \"It might be slightly bigger if Mr Trump wins.\"</p><p>Over the four-year term, a win for Mr Biden might prove more rewarding. \"Trump has very few policy ideas and battles with Congress could get worse.\"</p><p>The US has been a great place to invest your money over the past decade, despite political volatility, as the S&amp;P500 has been driven by tech behemoths such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google owner Alphabet. Mr Hentov expects that to continue, whoever wins.</p><p>Saikat Kumar, chief executive of Skycap Investments, says although Mr Biden is leading in the polls, Mr Trump cannot be written off. \"History suggests that laggers can significantly make up for lost ground in the final weeks.\"</p><p>The US-China trade tensions have cast a shadow over global stock markets during his term, especially in 2018 when tensions came to a head.</p><p>Mr Kumar says President Trump is likely to intensify his anti-China stance in a second term, while Mr Biden would take a less confrontational approach. \"If so, this could give stock markets a boost.\"</p><p>Read More</p><p>Why markets shunned the Fed's dovish stance</p><p>How negative interest rates influence our investment decisions</p><p>The risk for investors is that Mr Biden will partly reverse President Trump's corporation tax cuts. \"This could hurt economic growth and snuff out the recovery.\"</p><p>After the tech-led success of the US economy, investors need to check their portfolios to make sure they do not have too much exposure, Mr Kumar says. \"You should remain diversified during what looks set to be a volatile time for the US.\"</p><p>Arnab Das, global macro strategist, EMEA, at fund manager Invesco, says the Covid-19 pandemic and now the controversy over replacing the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg have raised the stakes further, as the Supreme Court may have to adjudicate if we get a contested result.</p><p>Mr Das predicts marked \"asset price volatility\", especially if the result is close and contested, and Mr Trump does not accept his defeat as legitimate.</p><p>Devesh Mamtani, chief market strategist at Century Financial, sets out three potential outcomes, and says investors could play them in three ways.</p><p>You should remain diversified during what looks set to be a volatile time for the US</p><p>Saikat Kumar, Skycap Investments</p><p>The first is a clean sweep for Mr Trump, with Republicans seizing control of the Senate and House of Representatives, and maintaining today's corporate-friendly stance. \"Big tech, defence, banks and energy stocks will benefit from pro-business competition, regulatory and taxation policies, as will smaller US businesses.\"</p><p>These themes can be captured by investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Mr Mamtani tips Invesco QQQ Trust Series I, Financial Select Sector SPDR, iShares US Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF and iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF.</p><p>He adds: \"One negative factor of Trump re-election is a rise in trade tensions with China. This could negatively affect the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF.\"</p><p>A clean sweep for Mr Biden would see corporate and higher rate income tax increases, hitting the stock market. \"If he raises the minimum wage, this could squeeze profit margins at gig economy companies like Uber and labour-intensive firms like McDonalds.\"</p><p>Mr Mamtani says stock markets could fall by up to 5 per cent on a Mr Biden sweep, but investors should treat this as a buying opportunity, since US Federal Reserve monetary policy is so \"dovish\" that shares are likely to recover.</p><p>One negative factor of Trump re-election is a rise in trade tensions with China</p><p>Devesh Mamtani, Century Financial</p><p>There will be some investor benefits to a win by Mr Biden. \"Democrat administrations tend to increase government spending, which should put a floor under share prices.\"</p><p>The Democrats are also likely to increase investment in infrastructure and clean energy, Mr Mamtani says. \"ETFs to consider include iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF and Global X US Infrastructure Dev ETF.\"</p><p>The third possible outcome is Mr Biden winning but Republicans keeping the Senate. \"This could be the most bullish scenario for stocks as history shows that a Democrat President with split Congress has delivered an average 8 per cent annual gain for Dow Jones Industrial Average,\" Mr Mamtani says.</p><p>Amid short-term and certainty and volatility, Mr Das at Invesco urges investors to take a long-term view. \"Timing markets is always tricky, you should always look to build a balanced portfolio with a diversified spread of assets.\"</p><p>US capitalism is so vibrant that it seems able to shake off all the uncertainty the politically divided country can throw at it. That is likely to continue, and investors should always retain US exposure in their portfolio, regardless of who wins in November. Or even if neither candidate does.</p><p>Updated: September 27, 2020 04:37 PM</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/41/160127295973.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/41/160127295973.jpg</url></p><p>Donald Trump and Joe Biden are likely to pursue widely different economic policies in power, and this will have an impact on share prices.

Since the Democratic Party achieved a majority in the United States House of Representatives, they may hold hearings and propose legislation that threatens U.S. dominance in the technology sector. Given statements in the past, here are a few things to look forward to, or to apprehend.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hearings looking into big tech or proposed regulations of the industry.</emphasis> It is no secret that the Democrats have wanted to target big tech for a while. Senator Warner drafted a white paper that included twenty different ways to regulate technology. Since 2016, Democrats blamed Hillary Clinton's loss on platforms' spread of \"fake news\" and inability to detect foreign involvement.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More talk of antitrust regulation. </emphasis>Senator Warren has called, on multiple occasions, for the break up of big tech companies, such as Amazon and Google. The government uses antitrust powers granted to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice to do this. Leftists, generally, hate anything that is \"too big.\" Tech platforms, such as Google and Facebook, dwarf traditional telecommunications companies. Many tech platforms also have divisions, for lack of better term, with Facebook also owning Instagram and WhatsApp, while Google has irons in many fires, such as advertising, driverless cars, artificial intelligence, and so on. Antitrust activists are also vocal on the right, with similar claims- that the tech platforms harm consumers by monopolizing the ecosystem, and notably access to speech online.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More proposed restrictions on free speech.</emphasis> Since the 2016 election, Democrats and some Republicans have been calling for more restrictions on online speech. In the past session, Democrats introduced, for example, the Honest Ads Act. The Act supposedly seeks to address the problem of foreign money corrupting U.S. elections. The problem is that the Act places more restrictions on domestic speech, and specifically online political advertising, than it regulates foreign money spent for the purpose of influencing elections.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Privacy legislation</emphasis>. Democrats in California passed a privacy bill in late 2018 that rivaled Europe's General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR). That privacy bill will have significant impacts on California's economy, and perhaps the economy of the country, in general. Look for them to introduce legislation that will preempt state laws, but place burdensome, GDPR-type regulations on tech platforms. As some outlets are predicting, Republicans may concede some points, but try to fight others. Republicans, for example, may be willing to provide the Federal Trade Commission.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net Neutrality legislation.</emphasis> At a Cyber event hosted by the Washington Post, California Representative Ro Khanna promised that the House would look at restoring Obama-era Title II regulations on the internet. He claimed that the rules would keep the internet open and free while helping close the digital divide. For those not paying attention, since the repeal of the Title II reclassification, infrastructure investment has increased $1.5 billion between 2016 and 2017.<br/>These are all bad ideas. The technology sector is huge. It adds trillions of dollars to the American economy and employees hundreds of thousands of people. Many 401k's, IRAs, and other retirement accounts have invested heavily in the tech sector. Subjecting the sector to heavy-handed government regulations will only dissuade companies from investing in the U.S. economy and will serve as a warning to innovators: \"Become too big, according to the government, and we will start regulating you.\"<br/>While Democratic control of the House may loom large for the tech sector, some Republicans appear to just need cover to support big government regulations. If the House, under new leadership, decides to support the regulation of the tech sector, free-market advocates will have their work cut out for them over the next two years.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-42476</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRK1-F03R-W0PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"659\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 ALEC, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>American Legislative Exchange Council</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 14, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

When the directive comes into effect, it will be the biggest change to internet regulation since <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/21/what-is-gdpr-and-how-will-it-affect-you\">General Data Protection Regulation</url> (GDPR).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The copyright changes are best known because of their two most controversial clauses, articles 11 and 13, which have been the nexus of a ferocious battle between corporate lobbyists, online activists and freedom of expression groups.</p><p>What do the changes mean for the internet?</p><p>                   Will I still be able to upload content online?                   </p><p>The legislation emphasises people will still be able to upload content, but technology firms, including Google, have warned they will have to remove vastly more content automatically.</p><p>Companies such as YouTube and Facebook already remove music and videos that are copyrighted. For example, YouTube scans uploads and matches them up to a database of files submitted by content owners, giving the original creator of the work the option to block, monetise or simply track it. Under the new legislation, tech companies will be more liable for any copyrighted content uploaded on to their platforms, particularly if they already run automated scans.</p><p>                   Why are the big tech firms against the move?                   </p><p>Companies affected by the changes argue the reforms are unrealistic and existing systems already pay artists fairly. YouTube in particular has warned EU-based users could be cut off entirely from videos.</p><p>                   Are others against the changes?                   </p><p>Yes. Many campaigners have argued the copyright directive will be harmful to free expression on the internet, since the only way to guarantee compliance is to simply block any user-generated content that references other copyrighted material in any way, including criticism, remixes, or even simple quotes.</p><p>In fact, some warn the law could paradoxically help big tech, since only the very largest companies will have the resources to comply with the regulations. Raegan MacDonald ,  the head of EU public policy at the independent browser company Mozilla, says: \"With a chance to bring copyright rules into the 21st century the EU institutions have squandered the progress made by innovators and creators to imagine new content and share it with people across the world, and have instead handed the power back to large US-owned record labels, film studios and big tech.\"</p><p>Giles Derrington, the associate director of policy at the industry body techUK, agreed: \"We are particularly concerned about the impact the new copyright directive will have on competition within the digital sector, given the high cost of meeting the requirements the directive now creates.\"</p><p>                   What does it mean for online news?                   </p><p>Where article 13 makes it harder for tech companies to release user-generated content, article 11 relates specifically to the sharing of news articles.</p><p>Publishers argue it is increasingly difficult for news organisations to continue funding quality journalism, and that technology firms which monetise the sharing of news should pay their share.</p><p>The directive introduces a new requirement on \"information sector service providers\" to secure the right to share news articles. The likes of Google News and Facebook will still be able show \"snippets\" of news articles, and non-commercial encyclopaedias like Wikipedia have also be exempt.</p><p>\"The inclusion of news agencies in the text of the directive can also be interpreted as a recognition of the quality of our work and of the importance that news agency journalism has, especially for safeguarding European media as a whole, as European news agencies are the main providers of quality news to most of the other media organisations in Europe,\" said Alexandru Giboi, the secretary general of the European Alliance of News Agencies.</p><p>                   What about memes?                   </p><p>A key argument against the directive is that it could serve as a \"meme ban\", given the strong rules against uploading copyrighted material without permission, and the fact that much shareable content depends on things like TV and movie scenes. </p><p>Tweaks made this year were intended to specifically protect the use of such content \"for purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody and pastiche\". But technology companies say the protection is impossible to uphold, since no automatic filter can usefully determine whether a given upload is parody or simply infringement.</p><p>                   When will it come into force?                   </p><p>EU member states will have two years to implement the new rules, from the date it finally passes out of the European council - probably in May or June this year. It means the UK will essentially be able to decide if it wants to implement the rules if it has left the EU by then.</p><p>Raffaella De Santis, an associate at the law firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis, said the size of the European market meant the UK would probably follow suit. \"Whether the UK leaves Europe with or without a deal, it's hard to see that it would not follow Europe's lead on this.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-52714313</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRD-8591-F021-63P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><timeReceived>5:35 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Perhaps nothing sums up the corporate volatility better than the view of INM company brokers Davy, which late last month changed its recommendation to investors on the stock from \"outperform\" to \"under review\". </p><p>INM appears to be arguing now that many of the ODCE's concerns relate to the man who has left the building: Leslie Buckley, who stepped down as chairman in March. Wisely, there are signs that it is trying to put clear blue water between the Buckley and post-Buckley eras.</p><p>Separately, journalists at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Irish Independent</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sunday Independent </emphasis>have demonstrated their own editorial independence through their coverage, which shared details of an ODCE affidavit with their readers.</p><h>Heightened circumstances Nevertheless, INM can only move on so much. The company remains constrained by the special, heightened circumstances that have applied to it since May 2012, when the stake of its largest shareholder, Buckley's texting partner Denis O'Brien, rose to 29.9 per cent </h><p>- the maximum that he is permitted to own without making an outright bid for the entire company.</p><p>As long as this ownership status continues, and as long as O'Brien also owns national radio stations Newstalk and Today FM, the once oft-stated desire of INM management to grow its business by acquisition will prove next to impossible. </p><p>As the example of the abandoned proposal to buy regional newspaper group Celtic Media suggests, even modest-sized acquisitions are likely to meet regulatory resistance, amid understandable news plurality fears.</p><p>At the same time, INM's assertion that scaling up is a necessity for survival in the newspaper market is not exactly wrong. So how else can it offset the trend of falling circulation, advertising and distribution revenues, if not by acquisition? </p><p>The answer is a word that has fallen out of fashion in some of the more beleaguered quarters of the media: investment.</p><p>New chief executive Michael Doorly, who has worked for INM in other roles for two decades, recently confirmed a strategic shift. While the group's large cash pile of EUR 91.6 million might still be dipped into for the odd bolt-on purchase, money will also be put into INM's digital development.</p><p>It sorely needs this investment. At just EUR 15.1 million, INM's digital revenues are a mere 5 per cent of its total income. The group operates in a market where digital advertising growth is mopped up by Google and Facebook - and a market where higher traffic does not correlate with higher revenues is a dysfunctional one for ad-dependent publishers. </p><p>INM can either sit back and wait for the stranglehold of Big Tech to implode, or it can start chasing consumers for subscription income.</p><p>Don't expect to find a paywall on Independent.ie in the morning: so far, the company has hinted that it plans to \"go niche\" (develop content and products for specialist audiences) and go west (hunt for ways to monetise a US base interested in Irish sport and general shamrockery).</p><h>'Two to three years' The march of time may prove to be INM's second biggest problem. Doorly admitted last month that \"two to three years is the kind of time we will need to change the business\", and with advertising and circulation revenues expected to wane further, he bluntly surmised that INM didn't have any longer than that.</h><p>Issues of trust and reputation now threaten to complicate this commercial predicament. Potential subscribers and potential sources need to have a certain faith in INM as an entity before they will commit personal data or sensitive information to its sales and editorial teams. The origins of INM's \"data security incident\" may be quite specific, but as the allegations are further teased out in both court and the media, a risk of general contamination arises. </p><h>Debt write-offs </h><p>What do \"normal\" day-to-day operations at INM look like anyway? It is increasingly hard to tell. Since 2012, INM has had four chief executives: Gavin O'Reilly, Vincent Crowley, Robert Pitt and now Doorly. There was also a period, between Crowley's resignation and the recruitment of Pitt, where INM had no formal chief executive at all and was run by Buckley and a trio of other directors.  </p><p>Substantial debt write-offs in 2013 should have been the beginning of a new era for the once international media group. Instead, INM seems barely out of the starting blocks when it comes to the necessary process of reshaping the company at a time when the media market is fast reshaping all around it.</p><p>This is a sorry waste.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3464081</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S45-RJC1-JC8Y-81W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"973\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 17, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001925</classCode><className>BUSINESS OPERATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000231</classCode><className>BUSINESS FORECASTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001480</classCode><className>RESIGNATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001561</classCode><className>SHAREHOLDERS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI2QjYxNjkwMTkzNDhFRUExNjlFRjVFRUU3NDhBQkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDQ3M0RFODczN0I4NDg2RjlFRDNFMUNBODRDQTU0Q0E</classCode><className>Shareholders</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001409</classCode><className>PROFIT WARNINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001410</classCode><className>COMPANY PROFITS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N511110MM</classCode><className>NEWSPAPER PUBLISHING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N515110CC</classCode><className>RADIO BROADCAST INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001432</classCode><className>PUBLIC RADIO</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

He and Carl Cederstrom are co-authors of \"The Wellness Syndrome\" and \"Desperately Seeking Self-Improvement.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (CNN) --  At first glance, a packet of cigarettes and a smartphone only have a passing resemblance. They are both perfectly designed rectangles that can be slipped into your pocket to stay within reach. Many users will tell you there is something strangely pleasurable about holding a cigarette pack or a mobile phone.</p><p>Beyond size, these objects are quite different. One is made of a noxious mixture of chemicals. The other is a compact package of modems and sensors. You smoke one. The other allows you to communicate. One increases your likelihood of getting cancer. The other (as far as we know) does not. And while the top executives of America's tobacco companies testified to Congress in the 1990s they did not believe cigarettes were addictive and harmful when they knew the opposite was true, it's not as if we're even close to having representatives from Facebook, Apple, Google and more in a room claiming that smartphones don't rule our attention and our lives.</p><p>While smartphone use is not obviously destroying our physical health, it has become a time-consuming habit, and one that carries a potential threat to mental health. These mental health risks have become so apparent, in fact, that some of Apple's shareholders have urged the tech giant to issue a health warning for their devices and change their systems to allow parents greater control of their children's usage. </p><p>This may not be surprising when we consider the enormous impact these gadgets have on our lives. In 2015, the average American checked their phone 46 times each day. Those 18 to 25 checked them 74 times each day. More recent data show that Americans spend five hours each day on their mobile devices. </p><p>It's hard to think of a place where we refrain from using phones. According to a 2013 survey, almost 20% of adults in the United States report using their phones in a place of worship, while 12% said they have used their phone in the shower. Nine percent have used their smartphone during sex.</p><p>As technology has captured more and more of our attention, some have reported concerns about smartphone addictions. Fifty-nine percent of parents say their teens are addicted to their phones and 50% of teenagers admit to feeling addicted to their mobile device. </p><p>Neurological research has found that dopamine, the same pleasure-related neurotransmitter that is released when we engage in addictive, and sometimes compulsory behaviors, can be triggered by smartphone use. The same thing happens when a smoker takes a drag of a cigarette. </p><p>Smartphone stalwarts would point out their addiction is not going to damage their body like smoking does. They may be right, but there is mounting evidence that heavy mobile phone use is having an impact on our mental health. Consumers who use smartphones to a problematic extent tend to have higher levels of anxiety and depression. They are also more likely to have impaired engagement at work due to adverse effects on sleep. A recent book by Jean Twenge argues heavy mobile use is behind the increasing rates of depression and suicide among young people.</p><p>Apple has defended its technology, saying that since 2008, the iPhone's software has allowed parents to control the content their children can access with their smartphones. In a statement released to multiple media outlets, Apple also said it had new features planned for the future that could enhance these already-available tools.</p><p>But if tech companies such as Apple want to avoid becoming pariahs like tobacco firms are today, they will need to do more to change their ways. And consumer information campaigns are not going to cut it; our will is weaker than our attachment to swiping and scrolling. If we really want to break our addiction, we need concrete regulations. Phone manufacturers such as Apple could limit the time we can use devices for or set phones to go to sleep automatically when we are supposed to be sleeping. </p><p>Big tech is unlikely to be enthusiastic about these measures. Put simply, the more time we spend staring at our phones, the more money the tech giants make. So, it is currently in their interest to keep us addicted. </p><p>But if the demand for less addictive devices remains unfilled by big tech, it will create a massive market opportunity for new companies that are able to create phones that are less addictive. And with the technology in our pockets becoming more advanced, the need for a less addictive alternative will only continue to grow. Across the globe, there are likely millions of parents waiting to buy their kids a phone that won't turn them into a digital zombie. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

That's how many devices Samsung is now responsible for the disposal of. In raw numbers compiled by Greenpeace that means 30 tons of cobalt, over a ton each of both silver and tungsten, 284 pounds of gold, and dozens of pounds of other rare earth elements. For less less-valuable materials like aluminum, cobalt, glass, copper, and plastics, the quantities are even weightier. </p><p>To put it in perspective, that quantity of gold, since it's relatively pure, would be worth close to $5 million. Of course, each individual phone has such a tiny amount of gold that at best you'd be extracting a few dollars' worth of the stuff per device. Plus, you'd have an even bigger pile of leftover toxic metals to dispose of for every phone, and that isn't cheap either. Having ruled out refurbishing the Note 7, Samsung is left with millions of defective products to dispose of. It can choose to simply ditch them wholly, but this would be a tremendous waste of resources. More likely, it will take the devices apart for their still-valuable metal components, recycling these and then disposing of the rest of the body and circuitry. Recycling is increasingly seen as a way forward in the e-waste business, but there is a lot of catching up to do. Only 10-12% of all smartphones get recycled, and the resulting piles of trash are a blight on whatever landscape they end up cluttering. Given the toxicity of the materials, many steps in the process should be automated. Yet, many are still performed by people who lack the proper training and protection. The way forward, big tech companies believe, is in robotics - like Apple's iPhone dismantler - and phasing out unsafe methods, especially cheap dumping of products into developing nations' junkyards when these can be resold domestically after rebuilds for more profit. But even more so than recycling, the manufacturers believe in rebuilding devices to sell in lower-end markets, extending the device's life without the need for advanced technology and energy-intensive recovery processes. Play Video[1] Multibillion dollar efficienciesWhere do our smartphones go? A tracking study by the Basel Action Network found that of those sold in the US, one third goes abroad, ending up in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and East Africa. Much of the e-waste that is exported now ends up in Hong Kong, as China has been cracking down on imports of used consumer electronics. There, though, the processes are not only less safe, but highly inefficient, with up to half of the valuable elements being lost to the processes. This has been driving developed nations to hold onto more of their waste than in the past, when recycling was largely ignored, so they can make the most of it financially. There is an urgent need, as scientists have noted, to educate companies and consumers with, 'Knowledge about which chemicals are used in electronics, as well as information on how they are used, handled, and recycled or disposed of.' (Samsung, for its part, has been an industry pioneer in this respect.)Recycle, rebuild, or repurposePlay Video[2]Most US e-waste is processed domestically now, though the US lags behind other OECD nations in making full use of the recycling option. Within that industry, both in the US and elsewhere, there is a growing recycling and refurbishment business. Companies like Green Citizen in the US or Dowa Eco-System in Japan, for example, caters to this market, which is projected to be worth $5 billion by 2020 worldwide. Indeed, the short cycle of many of our devices remains a boon to the industry. But key companies are taking a lead to recover costs and present a more environmentally friendly face to consumers. Apple, for instance, recovered $40 million in gold from devices last year, part of a larger campaign to recover two-thirds of all the e-waste in its recycling program. Although the recycling and recovery processes aren't cheap, they do have one advantage: They are extracting an already refined resource. That process is nowhere near as energy-intensive or labor-demanding as the initial stages of mining and refining that for every ounce of gold, copper, and cobalt produced tons and tons of useless rock, toxic slurry containing mercury or arsenic, and embarrassing investigations about work conditions for the extractive operations. Repurposing is also an option, and a very environmentally friendly one at that, but for now, recycling and rebuilding are the preferred choices for large companies.Past precedent is not on the tableThe size of the recall, and that it is occurring now rather than the usual cycle where phones drip back to the manufacturers or waste disposal entities over several years, is unprecedented. Samsung does maintain a larger e-waste recycling program in South Korea, for example, which is actually separate from government efforts. With some additional capacity, it could in theory handle the pending Note 7 wave. For now, Samsung is only saying its, 'currently reviewing possible options that can minimize the environmental impact of the recall in full compliance with relevant local environmental regulations.' It has not announced what it will do with the Note 7's cables and cords, or the pen that came with it, though these too will have to be dealt with since they also contain toxic metals and plastics, as well as recoverable pieces. What it most likely will not do, given the 'full compliance' promise, is have another bonfire. In 1995, Samsung burned thousands of malfunctioning consumer electronics devices, including cellphones, worth at least $50 million. Rather than refurbish or recycle them, the company destroyed an entire South Korean factory's output, just to make a point to the employees. Few if any precautions were taken at the time. Video footage of the event shows that devices were smashed to pieces and then set alight. The slag piles were bulldozed as well. This 'example,' set by the company's then-CEO, Lee Kun-Hee, is now widely cited in management tracts as an effective, if wasteful, strategy because the spectacle underlined how unforgiving management would be if further product defects were encountered: This led to a much greater emphasis on quality control. In a more environmentally and cost conscious world, though, this grand gesture is not likely to be repeated. But, just as this set a long-running, and transformative, precedent inside Samsung's workplace culture, how the company lays the Note 7 to rest will impact the e-waste industry for years to come.\u2014 The article What do you do with 4.3 million unsafe smartphones?[3]first appeared on Geektime[4].

And no company epitomizes concentrated economic power quite like Google itself, with its domination of search, of ads, and its use of its privileged role to squash competitors.As it happens, the Justice Department is on the verge of filing an epic antitrust case against Google, which stands to be the biggest such suit since the Microsoft case of the 1990s. The government did not succeed in breaking up Microsoft, but the settlement of the case in 2004 compelled Microsoft to rein in some of its predatory tactics.As Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley wait to see if the Google suit is filed, Google's allies and publicists have been doing their best to confuse public opinion. </p><p>According to Google-funded organizations, the case is a hurry-up political hit job by Trump AG Bill Barr, an all-purpose villain, supposedly because Google and other Big Tech companies lean Democratic.This is nonsense. The Federal Trade Commission has been investigating Google on the merits on and off since 2011. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has repeatedly called for action against Google's monopoly excesses. The Democratic chair of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, David Cicilline, recently said of Google, 'It used its surveillance over web traffic to identify competitive threats and crush them. It has dampened innovation and new business growth and it's dramatically increased the price of accessing users on the internet.'Earlier this month, 13 leading progressive groups including the Open Markets Institute, the Working Families Party, Our Revolution, and the Center for Digital Democracy sent a letter[1] to the nation's state attorneys general, urging them to join the litigation against Google.This, however, does not make Bill Barr a good guy. But even a stopped clock is right twice a day. Barr may let this suit go forward for all the wrong reasons. But the time is long overdue to deal with Google's excesses.
