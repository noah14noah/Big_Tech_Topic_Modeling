Stocks take a breather from their record run as investors gear up for a very busy earnings week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Retirement crisis: 401(k) plans may be safe for now, but that does not change the fact that many Americans have little save for their later years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New bellwethers. You know, GE used to be one, but there may be other companies that better reflect current economic trends.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday, October the 23rd.</p><p>Good evening, everybody. I`m Bill Griffeth, coming to you tonight from the New York Stock Exchange. Both Tyler Mathisen and Sue Herera are off tonight. So, it`s just you and me. Let`s do this, shall we?</p><p>Here on Wall Street, stocks pulled back from record levels to start this week. The Dow snapped its six-day win streak as shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) weighed on investor sentiment and saw their biggest decline in six years. We`ll have more on that story in a moment.</p><p>But, first, the closing numbers. The Dow did hit an intraday high today in record territory, but finally fell 54 points at the close to 23,273. The Nasdaq was down by 42 points, the S&amp;P fell by 10.</p><p>The prospects of tax reform has long been a big driver for this stock market, but one tax proposal that got a lot of a buzz over the weekend was changing popular 401(k) retirement plans. That`s likely not going to happen.</p><p>But the president this morning tweeted: There will be no change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle-class tax break that works and it stays.</p><p>There had been reports that Republicans in Congress were weighing a proposal that would significantly reduce the income that workers could save in these accounts as a way to offset lost revenue with tax reform.</p><p>And all that talk about retirement just highlighted one major problem right now: most Americans don`t have enough save for their later years.</p><p>Bob Pisani has the grim details for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The dust-up over 401(k) is a good opportunity to remind everyone how bad the state of the average person`s retirement plan isn`t cutting 401(k)s. That only make it worse.</p><p>The good news the total value of investment in 401(k)s and other defined contribution plans are at a new high, thanks to the stock market rally. The bad news is the numbers are still terrible. Americans don`t save enough for their retirement with or without 401(k)s.</p><p>According to Vanguard, 94 million Americans are covered by defined contribution accounts like 401(k)s. Assets are in excess to $7 trillion. Oh, sounds like a lot of money. Well, it is.</p><p>But when you really drill down, there`s not a lot in the accounts. The median account for 35 to 40-year-olds has only $23,000 and 65 and over, only have $60,000.</p><p>Let`s assume at 65, you`re going to live another 20 years, $60,000 isn`t much to live on spread out over 20 years. We need personal savings because the contributions from Social Security and pensions are modest. It`s about $13,000 a year for Social Security right now, a little more than $10,000 per year from private pensions, but only a third of Americans collect pensions, so private savings are critical for helping people through retirement.</p><p>But most people don`t even contribute the maximum out to their 401(k)s likely because they either can`t afford to or they`d rather spend the money. There`s been other proposals floated to help investors save money.</p><p>A universal savings account where investors contribute after-tax money, but the gain on the accounts are tax-free, has been successfully implemented in Canada and the U.K. Investors could take out money at any time without paying taxes or penalties.</p><p>One thing`s for sure, if we don`t find some way to get people to save more, a lot of people are going to work into their 80s or they`re going to outlive their money.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Here to talk more about this retirement crisis and what you can do maybe to maximize your savings, joining us tonight, Diane Oakley is executive director at the National Institute on Retirement Security. Eric Aanes is president of Titus Wealth Management.</p><p>Folks, thank you both for joining us tonight.</p><p>Diane, I well remember when defined contribution plans were introduced back in the 1980s, with IRAs and 401(k)s. Here we are at 30 years later, and we see here that the median amount saved by a 65-year-old today is only $60,000.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>DIANE OAKLEY, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON RETIREMENT SECURITY: You know, I think what happened is a lot of Americans just couldn`t afford to say if we hear from people saying that with their salaries being somewhat constrained and not growing that much, they just can`t save enough.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Eric, what do you think? I mean, people are told, save a certain amount, and then let the money grow. But was that a flawed message to Americans?</p><p>ERIC AANES, PRESIDENT, TITUS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Well, people need to start earlier and save longer that`s really the message. In the old school of defined benefit plans where company took care of you, they`re just no longer exist and I think it`s all about education and making sure that really people understand what -- as Albert Einstein call it the eighth wonder of the world, compound interest -- understand what you`d have today and what you could end up in the future if you`re diligent with your plan.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But what about Diane`s point that people just can`t afford to save as much as they should right now?</p><p>AANES: Well, that`s a -- that`s a whole another animal. The end result is you`re going to have to do better budgeting. You`re going to have to figure out where you can make some modifications to your budget and make hard decisions if you do indeed want to reach your retirement goals.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Dianne, the current camp now for a 401(k) to be -- for you to save is, what, $18,000 year? Is that what it is now?</p><p>OAKLEY: Yes, it is.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And they`re talking -- they were talking, I don`t know, they still haven`t taken this back yet that may be reducing that sharply to $2,400. What would that do to the average person saving for retirement right now?</p><p>OAKLEY: You know, the average person just doesn`t have that much to save as it is, and if you cut that back so much when they get towards their later years where maybe the kids have gotten through college and they`ve got an ability to save, and they could finally max out, if they`re going to max out and the new max is $2,400 where it used to be $18,000, and it`s hard to catch up for what they lost over those years.</p><p>You know, people today tell you, you got to start in your 20s saving fifteen percent of your pay. If you don`t do that until you`re 35 or 40, you`ve almost got to do 30 percent of your pay.</p><p>And most people --</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>OAKLEY: -- can`t afford their bills today and do that kind of saving for retirement.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And, Eric, it`s been a sort of a double whammy because we can`t be saved by the bond market, the fixed income market, because interest rates have been so low for the last decade and there`s no sign they`re going to rise that appreciably in the near future, right?</p><p>AANES: That`s true and that`s why you really want to reverse-engineer your plan and that that comes back to the fact of if I`m 25 or 30 today, and I`m going to retire and I`m 65, well, how much do I need to save and what kind of rate do I need to earn and really taking a look at your time horizon to make sure that you can -- you can maybe be a little more aggressive as you said, you know, fixed income if rates do rise. It doesn`t -- doesn`t sound like a wonderful time for bonds. So, folks may have to get a little more aggressive.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I suspect we`re preaching to the choir with our audience here on the NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT they`re very savvy investors to begin with.</p><p>But, Eric, let`s assume we`ve got a 65-year-old out there who has saved the median of $60,000. What do they do now?</p><p>AANES: Well, that`s a great question, Bill, because the safe and secure method of investing just doesn`t exist anymore. You can`t get anything at the bank, and if you put it in bonds, the yields are pretty low. So, they do have to kind of venture into, you know, a bull market that maybe kind of in the third or fourth quarter here. So, that makes the decisions even a little bit harder, but if your time horizon is long enough having a diversified plan can still make some sense for you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Diane, there are many types of plans these days, you know, with the Roth IRAs that are out there, in addition to the traditional IRAs, the catch-up IRAs. I mean, is it too complicated for the average person who just doesn`t pay that much attention to investments these days?</p><p>OAKLEY: You know, it is complicated. It used to be simple when grandpa had a pension plan, and it actually worked pretty well for grandpa. The real question is, as you`re looking at retiring and you`ve got different products to save, if you don`t have it through your employer, it makes it that much harder because you don`t have the convenience of having money come right out of your paycheck and go right into your retirement account.</p><p>And so, that`s a key and an important thing to make sure that people have the access through an employer, and I think if you go to a low cap, you`d end up taking away the incentive for employers to offer plans.</p><p>And quickly before we go, I know some states for small business owners that can`t afford to offer a plan of some kind Oregon, for example, now has these retirement plans much like a college savings plan. Is that a good idea to get into if you can?</p><p>OAKLEY: It is actually a good -- I think a lot of these states are starting to look at the fact of how many people have nothing saved. If you look at the group of people aged 64 to 55, those individuals, you`ve got about 60 percent of them who have less than one times their salary saved. So, how do we get people to nudge into retirement savings by having it be automatic like the plan is in Oregon. And it is in about six other states that are looking to bring these plans on board.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Folks, thank you. Diane Oakley with the National Institute on Retirement Security and Eric Aanes with Titus Wealth Management, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>AANES: Thanks, Bill.</p><p>OAKLEY: Thank you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: As we mentioned, one stock weighing on the market today was General Electric (NYSE:GE). Shares of GE saw their biggest decline in six years today, a number of brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, citing higher chances of a dividend cut following that disappointing earnings report last Friday. The stock was off more than 6 percent on heavy volume.</p><p>GE was once considered a bellwether for the economy and whether it still is or not is up for debate right now. But today, some are looking to a new batch of companies that they say are more reflective of the changing times.</p><p>Dominic Chu has our story tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, bellwether is defined as one that takes the lead or initiative, also an indicator of trends. Now trends in the stock market change over time and so do the bellwethers of the market. In today`s environment, it`s easy to see Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a market bellwether. That`s what Jones Trading chief market strategist Michael O`Rourke says. Not only is it the biggest company out there, it`s also a blend of technology and retail, which means it could be viewed as an indicator of the consumer.</p><p>It`s why Northern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS) chief investment strategist Jim McDonald says he picked Walmart. He says the U.S. is a consumer-led economy and Walmart is a good measure of consumer spending. Some estimates, of course, have over two-thirds of our economy driven by consumer spending.</p><p>Speaking of economic activity, Wunderlich Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan says today`s bellwether is FedEx (NYSE:FDX). Simply put, he feels like it`s impossible to hide economic activity from transportation companies like FedEx (NYSE:FDX), so it acts as a good indicator.</p><p>And when it comes to a conglomerate, look no further than Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A). Huntington Private Bank chief investment officer John Augustine thinks Warren Buffett`s company has a set of businesses that are basically a smaller sample of the American economy, with everything from insurance to retail to railroads to energy, et cetera.</p><p>Now, everyone has a different view on what companies are the best indicators of the market or economy right now, but one thing is for certain, America and its top companies will always have to evolve with the times.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Dominic Chu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: This is the busiest week for earnings, with more than 170 members of the S&amp;P 500 reporting results this week, twelve Dow components among them. And that includes McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD), which has seen its stock rise about percent just this year, and now, investors want to know if there`s a golden opportunity that could send that the shares even higher.</p><p>Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) tells us what to look for when McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) reports first thing tomorrow morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Hurricanes Harvey and Irma could have an impact on McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) results when the fast- food giant reports earnings. The fast food chain has a large presence in both Florida and Texas, but many say that impact could be temporary and are focusing instead on delivery driving sales growth. McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) has been testing delivery in the U.S. via its McDelivery partnership with UberEATS, which is now in countries and locations and could positively impact same-store sales growth.</p><p>R.J. HOTTOVY, MORNINGSTAR: It has potential to add maybe a point, maybe two points of same store sales growth in this quarter particularly with the average transaction size being larger than in-store transactions. That`ll be the big number I think a lot of people be looking for is, you know, what kind of contribution this quarter and more importantly what can we expect going forward.</p><p>ROGERS: Another thing to keep an eye on our sales performance of newer menu items, including buttermilk chicken tenders and the company`s continued push into fresh beef in 2018. Last quarter the company offered in earnings beat, thanks in part to discounts on McCafe beverages and sodas, that national value promotion again will be in focus for tomorrow`s report.</p><p>HOTTOVY: Delivery, the experience of the future kiosk ordering and mobile order and pay, we need to see validation that this is on track and can be a major contributor in the future. Last couple quarters, we`ve seen benefits from these programs internationally, and now start -- and now it`s time for those to start materializing in the U.S.</p><p>ROGERS: Also look out for any mention of the experience of the future he asks should be in 2,500 locations by the end of the year and mobile ordering should be nationwide.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And still ahead, is big tech moving in on the turf of big banks?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: It turns out that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has received -- get this -- more than 230 proposals from cities and regions around the country, hoping to be the home of the company`s second headquarters. Proposals were due last week. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) says that tax breaks and grants would be a big deciding factor and that it promises to bring 50,000 new jobs and to spend more than $5 billion on new construction. The proposals came from states as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, three Mexican states and six Canadian provinces.</p><p>So, how often do you use cash these days? Probably a lot less than you used to, and that`s because more payments are going digital. But it`s not necessarily the banks that are leading the way, but instead big technology firms.</p><p>Deirdre Bosa reports from the Money 2020 Conference in Las Vegas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The future of money big banks aren`t leading the way technology companies are. That`s why some of the biggest speakers that this year`s Money Conference are from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p>Apple`s vision of the future includes buying and selling things through the iPhone and sending money through iMessage.</p><p>Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) sees you ordering from restaurants using its app and paying with the information already stored in your account this was all once the turf of traditional banks but if technology companies have their way, that won`t be the case for very long. Tech giants are increasingly moving further into payments, especially as banks lag behind in the development of technologies like cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data analytics.</p><p>It`s still early days for tech giants and financial services, but they`re growing fast and a big question: would they want to actually become banks and face the same regulations the banking industry does?</p><p>MAX LEVCHIN, AFFIRM FOUNDER AND CEO: As any one of these companies decides to get into anything from banking to a simpler universe of lending or payments, they have to prepare for the entirety of the business to be impacted by the regulatory oversight. I think that that`s a very complex choice.</p><p>BOSA: An Accenture study found that one out of three consumers globally would consider using Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for banking services.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think big tech represents an opportunity for the banking industry to partner and capitalize on a lot of the innovation that`s available in the market, that the banks may not have the ability to innovate around themselves.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, they will offer some banking services, but they don`t have to be a bank to do that because you have regulations and, you know, the regulatory authorities and if the regulations are so strict, it`s hard to be a bank.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you can become a trusted -- it`s around trust, right? If you can establish the trust with a consumer, and I think both of those have the brands and the depths and the history to actually -- to actually establish that trust with consumers, and they don`t compromise that trust, then absolutely, they could become banks, because banks are all built on trust.</p><p>BOSA: Even as companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) push further into financial services, banks are relying on them more heavily for their expertise, and it could prove difficult for them to catch up with those capabilities if the competition heats up.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Deirdre Bosa, Las Vegas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) strikes a deal with BroadSoft (NASDAQ:BSFT) and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The networking technology company is paying nearly $2 billion to acquire BroadSoft (NASDAQ:BSFT), which makes cloud-based communication software. The deal is aimed at growing Cisco`s subscription-based revenue and expanding the company`s services. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares closed fractionally higher today to $34.35, shares of BroadSoft (NASDAQ:BSFT) rose more than one-and-a-half percent to $54.80.</p><p>Meanwhile, toy maker Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) reported stronger than expected earnings despite saying the results were hurt by the bankruptcy of its biggest customer. That would be Toys \"R\" Us. But the maker of Monopoly, which sold nearly 10 percent of its inventory through Toys \"R\" Us in the quarter warned that sales in the future would be pressured during the holiday shopping season because of that Toys \"R\" Us bankruptcy, and as a result, Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) shares felt more than percent today to close at $89.75.</p><p>Under Armour (NYSE:UA) is reportedly considering exiting some of its smaller categories. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says that the athletic apparel maker is exploring getting out of the tennis outdoor gear and fishing, in an effort to combat falling sales. Under Armour (NYSE:UA) also said that its co-founder Kip Fulks will take a sabbatical from the company. Shares were up more than 3 percent today to close at $16.85.</p><p>Restructuring charges cause profits to miss the mark at specialty metals maker Arconic. The company topped analyst revenue expectations, also lifted its guidance for the full year. In addition, Arconic named former GE executive Charles Blankenship as its new CEO. But Arconic shares fell by 10 percent, finished the day at $24.35.</p><p>And during a wide-ranging interview earlier today, Saudi billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said the shares of Citigroup (NYSE:C) could go above $100 and the Tesla`s valuation is as he put it too exuberant. Mr. Alwaleed runs Kingdom Holdings, a massive conglomerate based in Riyadh. He also floated the idea that Saudi Arabia could list more than 5 percent of the state oil giant Saudi Aramco in the coming years.</p><p>But the comments getting the most attention had to do with bitcoin. He says the cryptocurrency we told you about recently, he told Andrew Ross Sorkin, he`s not a fan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRINCE ALWALEED BIN TALAL, KINGDOM HOLDING COMPANY: I just don`t believe this bitcoin thing. I think it`s just going to implode one day. I think this is Enron in the making.</p><p>ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, CNBC: Really? Enron in the making.</p><p>BIN TALAL: I just don`t believe in bitcoin it completely.</p><p>SORKIN: Because?</p><p>BIN TALAL: It just doesn`t make sense. You know, this thing is not regulated. It`s not under control. It`s not under the supervision of any federal -- any, you know, United States Federal Reserve or any other central banks. So, I just -- I don`t believe this whole thing at all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Enron -- of course, the prince was referring to the massive accounting fraud that took Enron, the energy trading company, into bankruptcy in 2001.</p><p>And while the Saudi prince and others are skeptical of bitcoin, it is getting a lot of buzz lately due in part to its recent surge in value. But it`s been slow to take hold as a way to actually buy things. But that may be about to change as a couple of bitcoin investors use their gains to purchase expensive real estate.</p><p>Diana Olick has that story for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): You see it in some restaurants and in some retail. Now, bitcoin is buying into real estate. Over the summer, a Sotheby`s agency in Austin was behind the first single-family home sale in Texas involving a cryptocurrency.</p><p>J. KUPER, KUPER SOTHEBY`S INTERNATIONAL REALTY OWNER: So, we knew that, you know, bitcoin is cryptocurrency. It`s like any other currency. It has an exchange rate. It can be exchanged for U.S. dollars. So, the challenge which actually wasn`t all that challenging was to figure out who would do an exchange that large.</p><p>OLICK: They turned to bitpay, which did the exchange because the seller, a custom homebuilder, didn`t want bitcoin. He wanted dollars.</p><p>KUPER: We had a brief amount of conversation about that, but bitcoin on some level is new to most consumers. So, accepting bitcoin was just not something that they wanted to do.</p><p>OLICK: That will not be the case in Lower Manhattan where one developer is converting this old rental building into new condos. He had several potential buyers who want to pay in bitcoin and he wants to keep the currency think.</p><p>BENJAMIN SHAOUL, MAGNUM REAL ESTATE GROUP PRESIDENT: I`ll be able to use it both personally and as a developer, but I think it`ll become a long-term means to make payment. I`ve been buying some artwork a recent, and personally for me, I`ve had a bunch of sellers of artwork asked me to pay them in bitcoin.</p><p>OLICK: Shaoul says that in a hot market like Manhattan, accepting bitcoin gives him a competitive edge over other sellers.</p><p>SHAOUL: It`s a price point building in the $700,000 to $1.5 million range. There is not a lot of that inventory in the marketplace and, you know, you try to always work and get one extra edge over someone else, and we think the cryptocurrency in offering that to our buyers is certainly an edge.</p><p>OLICK (on camera): It sounds pretty simple now, but the deals so far have been all bitcoin sales, no mortgage. Bringing bitcoin to your average neighborhood where most buyers need a home loan will be a much bigger deal, with far-reaching implications not just for real estate but for banking and borrowing.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Coming up, why this watch is considered the Holy Grail of timepieces.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Welcome back.</p><p>This watch certainly does more than tell time, it has a history -- a history that belongs to the late actor Paul Newman, and the mystery surrounding it could help it become one of the most expensive watches ever sold.</p><p>Robert Frank has the fascinating story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Paul Newman was always in a race against time, as an actor, as a race car driver and as a philanthropist. And now, his wristwatch which some considered to be the holy grail of sports watches is coming up for sale, and it could become one of the most expensive watches ever sold.</p><p>Newman`s Rolex Cosmograph Daytona will be auctioned off by Phillips on Thursday in New York. Watch collectors say it could fetch between $5 million and $10 million, possibly challenging the current highest price for a wristwatch of $11 million.</p><p>Newman wore the watch every day of his life between 1969 and 1984, and used it to time his car races. It is inscribed on the back with a message from his wife Joanne Woodward with the words \"Drive Carefully, Me\".</p><p>Now, in 1984, Newman gave the watch to James Cox who at the time was dating Newman`s daughter Nell. Cox kept the watch and is now selling it with some of the proceeds going to Nell`s charity. Newman made the Rolex Daytona one of the most sought-after watches in the world. Vintage Daytona`s like his have sold for millions at auction.</p><p>Now, watch hunters have searched for Newman`s Daytona for decades, creating a source of mystery and legend in the watch world. Now, the watch worn by Cool Hand Luke is coming on to the auction block, proving once again that Paul Newman is one of Hollywood`s truly timeless.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

You know, GE used to be one, but there may be other  companies that better reflect current economic trends.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday,  October the 23rd.</p><p>Good evening, everybody.  I'm Bill Griffeth, coming to you tonight from the  New York Stock Exchange.  Both Tyler Mathisen and Sue Herera are off  tonight.  So, it's just you and me.  Let's do this, shall we?</p><p>Here on Wall Street, stocks pulled back from record levels to start this  week.  The Dow snapped its six-day win streak as shares of General Electric  (NYSE:GE) weighed on investor sentiment and saw their biggest decline in  six years.  We'll have more on that story in a moment.</p><p>But, first, the closing numbers.  The Dow did hit an intraday high today in  record territory, but finally fell 54 points at the close to 23,273.  The  Nasdaq was down by 42 points, the S&amp;P fell by 10.  </p><p>The prospects of tax reform has long been a big driver for this stock  market, but one tax proposal that got a lot of a buzz over the weekend was  changing popular 401(k) retirement plans.  That's likely not going to  happen.</p><p>But the president this morning tweeted: There will be no change to your  401(k).  This has always been a great and popular middle-class tax break  that works and it stays.  </p><p>There had been reports that Republicans in Congress were weighing a  proposal that would significantly reduce the income that workers could save  in these accounts as a way to offset lost revenue with tax reform.  </p><p>And all that talk about retirement just highlighted one major problem right  now: most Americans don't have enough save for their later years.</p><p>Bob Pisani has the grim details for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The dust-up over 401(k)  is a good opportunity to remind everyone how bad the state of the average  person's retirement plan isn't cutting 401(k)s.  That only make it worse.  </p><p>The good news the total value of investment in 401(k)s and other defined  contribution plans are at a new high, thanks to the stock market rally.   The bad news is the numbers are still terrible.  Americans don't save  enough for their retirement with or without 401(k)s.  </p><p>According to Vanguard, 94 million Americans are covered by defined  contribution accounts like 401(k)s.  Assets are in excess to $7 trillion.   Oh, sounds like a lot of money.  Well, it is.  </p><p>But when you really drill down, there's not a lot in the accounts.  The  median account for 35 to 40-year-olds has only $23,000 and 65 and over,  only have $60,000.  </p><p>Let's assume at 65, you're going to live another 20 years, $60,000 isn't  much to live on spread out over 20 years.  We need personal savings because  the contributions from Social Security and pensions are modest.  It's about  $13,000 a year for Social Security right now, a little more than $10,000  per year from private pensions, but only a third of Americans collect  pensions, so private savings are critical for helping people through  retirement. </p><p>But most people don't even contribute the maximum out to their 401(k)s  likely because they either can't afford to or they'd rather spend the  money.  There's been other proposals floated to help investors save money.  </p><p>A universal savings account where investors contribute after-tax money, but  the gain on the accounts are tax-free, has been successfully implemented in  Canada and the U.K.  Investors could take out money at any time without  paying taxes or penalties.</p><p>One thing's for sure, if we don't find some way to get people to save more,  a lot of people are going to work into their 80s or they're going to  outlive their money.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Here to talk more about this retirement crisis and  what you can do maybe to maximize your savings, joining us tonight, Diane  Oakley is executive director at the National Institute on Retirement  Security.  Eric Aanes is president of Titus Wealth Management.</p><p>Folks, thank you both for joining us tonight.</p><p>Diane, I well remember when defined contribution plans were introduced back  in the 1980s, with IRAs and 401(k)s.  Here we are at 30 years later, and we  see here that the median amount saved by a 65-year-old today is only  $60,000.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>DIANE OAKLEY, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON RETIREMENT SECURITY:  You  know, I think what happened is a lot of Americans just couldn't afford to  say if we hear from people saying that with their salaries being somewhat  constrained and not growing that much, they just can't save enough.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Eric, what do you think?  I mean, people are told, save a  certain amount, and then let the money grow.  But was that a flawed message  to Americans?</p><p>ERIC AANES, PRESIDENT, TITUS WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Well, people need to start  earlier and save longer that's really the message.  In the old school of  defined benefit plans where company took care of you, they're just no  longer exist and I think it's all about education and making sure that  really people understand what -- as Albert Einstein call it the eighth  wonder of the world, compound interest -- understand what you'd have today  and what you could end up in the future if you're diligent with your plan.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But what about Diane's point that people just can't afford to  save as much as they should right now?</p><p>AANES:  Well, that's a -- that's a whole another animal.  The end result is  you're going to have to do better budgeting.  You're going to have to  figure out where you can make some modifications to your budget and make  hard decisions if you do indeed want to reach your retirement goals.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Dianne, the current camp now for a 401(k) to be -- for you to  save is, what, $18,000 year?  Is that what it is now?</p><p>OAKLEY:  Yes, it is.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And they're talking -- they were talking, I don't know, they  still haven't taken this back yet that may be reducing that sharply to  $2,400.  What would that do to the average person saving for retirement  right now?</p><p>OAKLEY:  You know, the average person just doesn't have that much to save  as it is, and if you cut that back so much when they get towards their  later years where maybe the kids have gotten through college and they've  got an ability to save, and they could finally max out, if they're going to  max out and the new max is $2,400 where it used to be $18,000, and it's  hard to catch up for what they lost over those years. </p><p>You know, people today tell you, you got to start in your 20s saving  fifteen percent of your pay.  If you don't do that until you're 35 or 40,  you've almost got to do 30 percent of your pay.  </p><p>And most people --  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>OAKLEY:  -- can't afford their bills today and do that kind of saving for  retirement.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And, Eric, it's been a sort of a double whammy because we can't  be saved by the bond market, the fixed income market, because interest  rates have been so low for the last decade and there's no sign they're  going to rise that appreciably in the near future, right?</p><p>AANES:  That's true and that's why you really want to reverse-engineer your  plan and that that comes back to the fact of if I'm 25 or 30 today, and I'm  going to retire and I'm 65, well, how much do I need to save and what kind  of rate do I need to earn and really taking a look at your time horizon to  make sure that you can -- you can maybe be a little more aggressive as you  said, you know, fixed income if rates do rise.  It doesn't -- doesn't sound  like a wonderful time for bonds.  So, folks may have to get a little more  aggressive.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I suspect we're preaching to the choir with our audience here on  the NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT they're very savvy investors to begin with.  </p><p>But, Eric, let's assume we've got a 65-year-old out there who has saved the  median of $60,000.  What do they do now?</p><p>AANES:  Well, that's a great question, Bill, because the safe and secure  method of investing just doesn't exist anymore.  You can't get anything at  the bank, and if you put it in bonds, the yields are pretty low.  So, they  do have to kind of venture into, you know, a bull market that maybe kind of  in the third or fourth quarter here.  So, that makes the decisions even a  little bit harder, but if your time horizon is long enough having a  diversified plan can still make some sense for you.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Diane, there are many types of plans these days, you know, with  the Roth IRAs that are out there, in addition to the traditional IRAs, the  catch-up IRAs.  I mean, is it too complicated for the average person who  just doesn't pay that much attention to investments these days?</p><p>OAKLEY:  You know, it is complicated.  It used to be simple when grandpa  had a pension plan, and it actually worked pretty well for grandpa.  The  real question is, as you're looking at retiring and you've got different  products to save, if you don't have it through your employer, it makes it  that much harder because you don't have the convenience of having money  come right out of your paycheck and go right into your retirement account.  </p><p>And so, that's a key and an important thing to make sure that people have  the access through an employer, and I think if you go to a low cap, you'd  end up taking away the incentive for employers to offer plans.  </p><p>And quickly before we go, I know some states for small business owners that  can't afford to offer a plan of some kind Oregon, for example, now has  these retirement plans much like a college savings plan.  Is that a good  idea to get into if you can?</p><p>OAKLEY:  It is actually a good -- I think a lot of these states are  starting to look at the fact of how many people have nothing saved.  If you  look at the group of people aged 64 to 55, those individuals, you've got  about 60 percent of them who have less than one times their salary saved.   So, how do we get people to nudge into retirement savings by having it be  automatic like the plan is in Oregon.  And it is in about six other states  that are looking to bring these plans on board.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Folks, thank you.  Diane Oakley with the National Institute on  Retirement Security and Eric Aanes with Titus Wealth Management, thanks for  joining us tonight.</p><p>AANES:  Thanks, Bill.</p><p>OAKLEY:  Thank you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  As we mentioned, one stock weighing on the market today was  General Electric (NYSE:GE).  Shares of GE saw their biggest decline in six  years today, a number of brokerages cut their price targets on the stock,  citing higher chances of a dividend cut following that disappointing  earnings report last Friday.  The stock was off more than 6 percent on  heavy volume.  </p><p>GE was once considered a bellwether for the economy and whether it still is  or not is up for debate right now.  But today, some are looking to a new  batch of companies that they say are more reflective of the changing times.  </p><p>Dominic Chu has our story tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  According to the  Merriam-Webster Dictionary, bellwether is defined as one that takes the  lead or initiative, also an indicator of trends.  Now trends in the stock  market change over time and so do the bellwethers of the market.  In  today's environment, it's easy to see Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a market  bellwether.  That's what Jones Trading chief market strategist Michael  O'Rourke says.  Not only is it the biggest company out there, it's also a  blend of technology and retail, which means it could be viewed as an  indicator of the consumer.</p><p>It's why Northern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS) chief investment strategist Jim  McDonald says he picked Walmart.  He says the U.S. is a consumer-led  economy and Walmart is a good measure of consumer spending.  Some  estimates, of course, have over two-thirds of our economy driven by  consumer spending.  </p><p>Speaking of economic activity, Wunderlich Securities chief market  strategist Art Hogan says today's bellwether is FedEx (NYSE:FDX).  Simply  put, he feels like it's impossible to hide economic activity from  transportation companies like FedEx (NYSE:FDX), so it acts as a good  indicator. </p><p>And when it comes to a conglomerate, look no further than Berkshire  Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A).  Huntington Private Bank chief investment officer  John Augustine thinks Warren Buffett's company has a set of businesses that  are basically a smaller sample of the American economy, with everything  from insurance to retail to railroads to energy, et cetera.  </p><p>Now, everyone has a different view on what companies are the best  indicators of the market or economy right now, but one thing is for  certain, America and its top companies will always have to evolve with the  times.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dominic Chu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  This is the busiest week for earnings, with more than 170  members of the S&amp;P 500 reporting results this week, twelve Dow components  among them.  And that includes McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), which has seen its  stock rise about percent just this year, and now, investors want to know if  there's a golden opportunity that could send that the shares even higher.</p><p>Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) tells us what to look for when McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  reports first thing tomorrow morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Hurricanes Harvey and  Irma could have an impact on McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) results when the fast- food giant reports earnings.  The fast food chain has a large presence in  both Florida and Texas, but many say that impact could be temporary and are  focusing instead on delivery driving sales growth.  McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  has been testing delivery in the U.S. via its McDelivery partnership with  UberEATS, which is now in countries and locations and could positively  impact same-store sales growth.  </p><p>R.J. HOTTOVY, MORNINGSTAR:  It has potential to add maybe a point, maybe  two points of same store sales growth in this quarter particularly with the  average transaction size being larger than in-store transactions.  That'll  be the big number I think a lot of people be looking for is, you know, what  kind of contribution this quarter and more importantly what can we expect  going forward.</p><p>ROGERS:  Another thing to keep an eye on our sales performance of newer  menu items, including buttermilk chicken tenders and the company's  continued push into fresh beef in 2018.  Last quarter the company offered  in earnings beat, thanks in part to discounts on McCafe beverages and  sodas, that national value promotion again will be in focus for tomorrow's  report. </p><p>HOTTOVY:  Delivery, the experience of the future kiosk ordering and mobile  order and pay, we need to see validation that this is on track and can be a  major contributor in the future.  Last couple quarters, we've seen benefits  from these programs internationally, and now start -- and now it's time for  those to start materializing in the U.S. </p><p>ROGERS:  Also look out for any mention of the experience of the future he  asks should be in 2,500 locations by the end of the year and mobile  ordering should be nationwide.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And still ahead, is big tech moving in on the turf of big banks?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  It turns out that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has received -- get this  -- more than 230 proposals from cities and regions around the country,  hoping to be the home of the company's second headquarters.  Proposals were  due last week.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) says that tax breaks and grants would  be a big deciding factor and that it promises to bring 50,000 new jobs and  to spend more than $5 billion on new construction.  The proposals came from  states as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, three Mexican states  and six Canadian provinces.</p><p>So, how often do you use cash these days?  Probably a lot less than you  used to, and that's because more payments are going digital.  But it's not  necessarily the banks that are leading the way, but instead big technology  firms.</p><p>Deirdre Bosa reports from the Money 2020 Conference in Las Vegas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The future of money  big banks aren't leading the way technology companies are.  That's why some  of the biggest speakers that this year's Money Conference are from Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  </p><p>Apple's vision of the future includes buying and selling things through the  iPhone and sending money through iMessage.</p><p>Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) sees you ordering from restaurants using its app and  paying with the information already stored in your account this was all  once the turf of traditional banks but if technology companies have their  way, that won't be the case for very long.  Tech giants are increasingly  moving further into payments, especially as banks lag behind in the  development of technologies like cloud computing, artificial intelligence  and big data analytics.  </p><p>It's still early days for tech giants and financial services, but they're  growing fast and a big question: would they want to actually become banks  and face the same regulations the banking industry does?</p><p>MAX LEVCHIN, AFFIRM FOUNDER AND CEO:  As any one of these companies decides  to get into anything from banking to a simpler universe of lending or  payments, they have to prepare for the entirety of the business to be  impacted by the regulatory oversight.  I think that that's a very complex  choice.</p><p>BOSA:  An Accenture study found that one out of three consumers globally  would consider using Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) for banking services.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think big tech represents an opportunity for the  banking industry to partner and capitalize on a lot of the innovation  that's available in the market, that the banks may not have the ability to  innovate around themselves. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, they will offer some banking services, but they  don't have to be a bank to do that because you have regulations and, you  know, the regulatory authorities and if the regulations are so strict, it's  hard to be a bank.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you can become a trusted -- it's around trust,  right?  If you can establish the trust with a consumer, and I think both of  those have the brands and the depths and the history to actually -- to  actually establish that trust with consumers, and they don't compromise  that trust, then absolutely, they could become banks, because banks are all  built on trust. </p><p>BOSA:  Even as companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  push further into financial services, banks are relying on them more  heavily for their expertise, and it could prove difficult for them to catch  up with those capabilities if the competition heats up.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Deirdre Bosa, Las Vegas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) strikes a deal with BroadSoft (NASDAQ:BSFT)  and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The networking technology company is paying nearly $2 billion to acquire  BroadSoft (NASDAQ:BSFT), which makes cloud-based communication software.   The deal is aimed at growing Cisco's subscription-based revenue and  expanding the company's services.  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares closed  fractionally higher today to $34.35, shares of BroadSoft (NASDAQ:BSFT) rose  more than one-and-a-half percent to $54.80.</p><p>Meanwhile, toy maker Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) reported stronger than expected  earnings despite saying the results were hurt by the bankruptcy of its  biggest customer.  That would be Toys \"R\" Us.  But the maker of Monopoly,  which sold nearly 10 percent of its inventory through Toys \"R\" Us in the  quarter warned that sales in the future would be pressured during the  holiday shopping season because of that Toys \"R\" Us bankruptcy, and as a  result, Hasbro (NYSE:HAS) shares felt more than percent today to close at  $89.75.</p><p>Under Armour (NYSE:UA) is reportedly considering exiting some of its  smaller categories.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says that the athletic  apparel maker is exploring getting out of the tennis outdoor gear and  fishing, in an effort to combat falling sales.  Under Armour (NYSE:UA) also  said that its co-founder Kip Fulks will take a sabbatical from the company.   Shares were up more than 3 percent today to close at $16.85.</p><p>Restructuring charges cause profits to miss the mark at specialty metals  maker Arconic.  The company topped analyst revenue expectations, also  lifted its guidance for the full year.  In addition, Arconic named former  GE executive Charles Blankenship as its new CEO.  But Arconic shares fell  by 10 percent, finished the day at $24.35.</p><p>And during a wide-ranging interview earlier today, Saudi billionaire  investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said the shares of Citigroup (NYSE:C)  could go above $100 and the Tesla's valuation is as he put it too  exuberant.  Mr. Alwaleed runs Kingdom Holdings, a massive conglomerate  based in Riyadh.  He also floated the idea that Saudi Arabia could list  more than 5 percent of the state oil giant Saudi Aramco in the coming  years.  </p><p>But the comments getting the most attention had to do with bitcoin.  He  says the cryptocurrency we told you about recently, he told Andrew Ross  Sorkin, he's not a fan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRINCE ALWALEED BIN TALAL, KINGDOM HOLDING COMPANY:  I just don't believe  this bitcoin thing.  I think it's just going to implode one day.  I think  this is Enron in the making.  </p><p>ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, CNBC:  Really?  Enron in the making.</p><p>BIN TALAL:  I just don't believe in bitcoin it completely.</p><p>SORKIN:  Because?</p><p>BIN TALAL:  It just doesn't make sense.  You know, this thing is not  regulated.  It's not under control.  It's not under the supervision of any  federal -- any, you know, United States Federal Reserve or any other  central banks.  So, I just -- I don't believe this whole thing at all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Enron -- of course, the prince was referring to the massive  accounting fraud that took Enron, the energy trading company, into  bankruptcy in 2001.</p><p>And while the Saudi prince and others are skeptical of bitcoin, it is  getting a lot of buzz lately due in part to its recent surge in value.  But  it's been slow to take hold as a way to actually buy things.  But that may  be about to change as a couple of bitcoin investors use their gains to  purchase expensive real estate.</p><p>Diana Olick has that story for us tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  You see  it in some restaurants and in some retail.  Now, bitcoin is buying into  real estate.  Over the summer, a Sotheby's agency in Austin was behind the  first single-family home sale in Texas involving a cryptocurrency.  </p><p>J. KUPER, KUPER SOTHEBY'S INTERNATIONAL REALTY OWNER:  So, we knew that,  you know, bitcoin is cryptocurrency.  It's like any other currency.  It has  an exchange rate.  It can be exchanged for U.S. dollars.  So, the challenge  which actually wasn't all that challenging was to figure out who would do  an exchange that large.</p><p>OLICK:  They turned to bitpay, which did the exchange because the seller, a  custom homebuilder, didn't want bitcoin.  He wanted dollars.</p><p>KUPER:  We had a brief amount of conversation about that, but bitcoin on  some level is new to most consumers.  So, accepting bitcoin was just not  something that they wanted to do.</p><p>OLICK:  That will not be the case in Lower Manhattan where one developer is  converting this old rental building into new condos.  He had several  potential buyers who want to pay in bitcoin and he wants to keep the  currency think.</p><p>BENJAMIN SHAOUL, MAGNUM REAL ESTATE GROUP PRESIDENT:  I'll be able to use  it both personally and as a developer, but I think it'll become a long-term  means to make payment.  I've been buying some artwork a recent, and  personally for me, I've had a bunch of sellers of artwork asked me to pay  them in bitcoin.</p><p>OLICK:  Shaoul says that in a hot market like Manhattan, accepting bitcoin  gives him a competitive edge over other sellers. </p><p>SHAOUL:  It's a price point building in the $700,000 to $1.5 million range.   There is not a lot of that inventory in the marketplace and, you know, you  try to always work and get one extra edge over someone else, and we think  the cryptocurrency in offering that to our buyers is certainly an edge.</p><p>OLICK (on camera):  It sounds pretty simple now, but the deals so far have  been all bitcoin sales, no mortgage.  Bringing bitcoin to your average  neighborhood where most buyers need a home loan will be a much bigger deal,  with far-reaching implications not just for real estate but for banking and  borrowing.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Coming up, why this watch is considered the Holy Grail of  timepieces.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Welcome back.  </p><p>This watch certainly does more than tell time, it has a history -- a  history that belongs to the late actor Paul Newman, and the mystery  surrounding it could help it become one of the most expensive watches ever  sold.  </p><p>Robert Frank has the fascinating story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Paul Newman was  always in a race against time, as an actor, as a race car driver and as a  philanthropist.  And now, his wristwatch which some considered to be the  holy grail of sports watches is coming up for sale, and it could become one  of the most expensive watches ever sold.  </p><p>Newman's Rolex Cosmograph Daytona will be auctioned off by Phillips on  Thursday in New York.  Watch collectors say it could fetch between $5  million and $10 million, possibly challenging the current highest price for  a wristwatch of $11 million.  </p><p>Newman wore the watch every day of his life between 1969 and 1984, and used  it to time his car races.  It is inscribed on the back with a message from  his wife Joanne Woodward with the words \"Drive Carefully, Me\".  </p><p>Now, in 1984, Newman gave the watch to James Cox who at the time was dating  Newman's daughter Nell.  Cox kept the watch and is now selling it with some  of the proceeds going to Nell's charity.  Newman made the Rolex Daytona one  of the most sought-after watches in the world.  Vintage Daytona's like his  have sold for millions at auction.  </p><p>Now, watch hunters have searched for Newman's Daytona for decades, creating  a source of mystery and legend in the watch world.  Now, the watch worn by  Cool Hand Luke is coming on to the auction block, proving once again that  Paul Newman is one of Hollywood's truly timeless.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) trounced earnings expectations but growth has slowed in one  of its key businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Billions and counting.  Profits fall and costs rise at Boeing (NYSE:BA) as  the CEO stands firm, sticking to his timeline of getting the 737 MAX back  in the air.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) crunch.  Sales slump and its outlook is ugly.  But  investors may be starting to believe that the worst is over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Wednesday, October 23rd.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  Bill has the evening off.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is reeling in the profits.  The most valuable  public company in the U.S. easily beat Wall Street estimates, reporting  earnings of more than $10 billion in sales of more than $30 billion both  double digit increases from a year ago.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may have  made its name in its Windows operating system but its future is in the  cloud.  Its cloud business called Azure has been growing quickly, but its  growth in the most recent quarter was below 60 percent, a big number but  one that gave investors pause.  The stock was volatile in initial after- hours trading.</p><p>Josh Lipton has more now on Microsoft`s quarter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Expectations ran high  into Microsoft`s latest earnings with the stock up nearly 35 percent so far  this year as investors bet that it`s a smart way to capitalize on the shift  to cloud computing.  One big number that investors watch: commercial cloud  revenue.  Now, that includes Azure, Microsoft`s answer to rival AWS, as  well as other cloud properties.</p><p>Commercial cloud revenue clocked in at $11.6 billion with gross margin  spanning to 66 percent.</p><p>Evercore`s Kirk Materne says the growth in the cloud is now translating  into real earnings power.  And that he argues should drive the stock higher  over the long-term.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Let`s turn now to Dan Ives to talk more about Microsoft`s better  than expected earnings.  He is the managing director of equity research at  Wedbush Securities.</p><p>Welcome, Dan.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>DAN IVES, WEDBUSH SECURITIES MANAGING DIRECTOR OF EQUITY RESEARCH:  Great  to be here.  Thanks.</p><p>HERERA:  What do you think of the report?  Specifically, I know you were  going to be focused on the cloud business.  And that seems to be what has  investors a little bit worried about tonight.</p><p>Are you at all concerned?</p><p>IVES:  Yes, I view it as a knee-jerk reaction.  I mean, this continues in  my opinion to be a strong report and really one that puts gasoline in the  engine in terms of cloud.  You look at a 59 percent growth number.  I think  what`s happening here is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stealing share from AWS.   And for the stock, we continue to view this as something that`s still in  the early innings and moving higher.</p><p>HERERA:  Now, the stock as Josh mentioned in his report is up about 35  percent.  You`re still bullish on the stock.  What kind of target do you  have?  And does this percentage increase so far this year give you any  pause?</p><p>IVES:  Yes, we have $160 price target.  I think this is only halfway  through the move to cloud.  And Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to be our  bet.  But if I look at this quarter ultimately gives us more bullishness to  owning this.  Stocks up and I still view this as a start of what`s going to  be a massive secular change when the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) owning the cloud.</p><p>HERERA:  What about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the competition with their  cloud business?  They really still own the space even though Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) is gaining.</p><p>IVES:  It`s a great point.  I mean, I think the first part of this, Bezos  and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) won the first part of the cloud battle.  But I  think the next part is where Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Dell (NASDAQ:DELL)  win there.  And I think when you look at these earnings, forest for the  trees, I think this really shows that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is starting  to steal share and in our opinion makes us more positive on shares, and  just on the cloud story going forward, in terms of the two-horse race  between Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>HERERA:  Now, if you are a long-term investor as many of our viewers are,  would you own both stocks on a kind of hedge your bet as to who`s really  going to win the cloud war?</p><p>IVES:  Yes, I mean, right here, I view Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as my 10- year play on cloud.  And that`s continuing to be our top pick.  I do view  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) when you look at the AWS piece, that`s another name to  own in the portfolio.  You`re going to have $700 billion to $800 billion  spent in the cloud over the next eight to nine years.  These are the two  ways to play it in my opinion.</p><p>HERERA:  On that note, Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities -- thanks, Dan.</p><p>IVES:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Boeing`s earnings were cut in half as the company struggles to  recover from the grounding of its top selling 737 MAX jetliner.  Revenue  slid 20 percent from a year ago.  But that wasn`t as bad as feared.</p><p>The company also said it`s sticking with its plan to get the 737 MAX back  in the air.  And that helped lift the stock in today`s session.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Fixing the 737 MAX  continues to cost Boeing (NYSE:BA) hundreds of millions of dollars.  But  CEO Dennis Muilenburg says the company is moving closer to fixing the  beleaguered plane.</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, BOEING CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  There are tangible milestones  being achieved but we still have more work to do.  Last week, we did  complete an initial dry run of the certification test flight.</p><p>LEBEAU:  That certification flight is expected to happen next month.  If it  goes as planned, the head of the FAA could decide by the end of the year,  the MAX is safe to fly, clearing the way for scores of 737s to get back in  the air.  But some on Wall Street have a different time line for the MAX.</p><p>RON EPSTEIN, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have it returning to service in March.   Are we changing that because of what the company said?  No.  I mean, this  is a company that has a history of overpromising and under-delivering, and  eventually, they get it right.</p><p>LEBEAU:  After cutting MAX production to 42 per month earlier this year,  Boeing (NYSE:BA) plans to ramp up to 57 per month by the end of next year.</p><p>While investors are encouraged Boeing (NYSE:BA) is close to turning the  corner with this crisis, some in Congress still have plenty of questions  about what went wrong.  And next week, they`ll grill CEO Dennis Muilenburg  during hearings on the Hill.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  I anticipate there will be tough questions, challenging  questions, a lot of scrutiny.  And frankly, we support the scrutiny on the  work that we`re doing.</p><p>LEBEAU:  That scrutiny is far from over.  Regulators from around the world  still must be convinced that the MAX is safe to fly.  And in some countries  like China, that may not happen for several months.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is considered a barometer for global  growth.  And today, it reported weaker than expected earnings, it lowered  its full year profit outlook.  It also said it would not be issuing sales  guidance because the outlook is so uncertain.  But the stock didn`t fall as  much as you`d think.  In fact, it rose.</p><p>Seema Mody explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The softening global  economy is pushing Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) customers to think twice about  buying heavy machinery.  The industrial bellwether said dealers were  holding off on purchases of equipment not due to financial distress but  because of the uncertainty about where the economy goes from here.</p><p>ANDREW R.J. BONFIELD, CATERPILLAR CFO:  Obviously, primary is dealer  expectations of inventory reductions.  It depends where we end -- you know,  obviously, the big unknown factor is what is our dealer expectations of  future growth going to be at the end of the year, because that will impact  their order pattern in Q4.</p><p>MODY:  Weaker demand resulted in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) posting its first  quarterly profit decline since 2016.  Energy was also weak.  The company  makes things like pumps and drilling equipment.  That softness some experts  say is the result of the trade war and slowing global growth.</p><p>JIM UMPLEBY, CATERPILLAR CEO:  Our mines customers are cautious and so,  they are hesitant to pull the trigger on new equipment, although, again,  we`re seeing increased sales.  So, we`re seeing improvement in that  business.  One thing to also keep in mind is that, you know, when miners  sometimes delay, that creates opportunities for us for rebuild in parts.</p><p>MODY:  Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) continues to deal with ongoing weakness in  Asia-Pacific where sales fell 13 percent.  But the company is confident  that overtime, it will be able to fend of competition in markets like  China.</p><p>UMPLEBY:  We are confident in our ability to compete in China long-term and  demonstrated the ability to do that.  But there will be fluctuations on a  short-term basis up or down.  That`s just part of the deal.</p><p>MODY:  Despite the disappointing earnings report, some investors are  hopeful the company can stage a turn around overtime.</p><p>ROB WERTHEIMER, MELIUS RESEARCH FOUNDING PARTNER:  They`ve done a very good  job, the short little up cycle we have.  And keep in mind, these industrial  up cycles has been great.  Mining is not all that great.  Oil and gas is  not at all that great.  And construction is OK.</p><p>It hasn`t been a powerful up cycle.  The margins have been really  exceptional.  They`ve done a great job.  We`ll see how they can manage the  other side, the turn if we have one.</p><p>MODY:  The biggest challenge for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) will be navigating  the uncertain global economy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Seema Mody.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Those earnings were not enough to firmly drive stocks in one  direction or the other.  The major average is kind of wobbled, trading at a  narrow range throughout the session.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose  45 points to 26,833.  The Nasdaq was up 15, and the S&amp;P added 8.</p><p>And now comes the hard part, making sense of corporate America`s hits and  misses this earnings season.</p><p>Bob Pisani is here to help lead the way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We are about a quarter  of the way through earnings season and analysts are wondering whether  several high profile misses are spelling broader trouble ahead for the  overall stock market.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX), McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD), now Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and  Boeing (NYSE:BA) have all missed earnings expectations by a significant  amount.  We`re talking a miss of 30 percent by Boeing (NYSE:BA).  That`s a  real outlier.  While the misses aren`t trivial, they may be outliers.</p><p>Only 14 percent of companies are missing earnings estimates this quarter.   That`s roughly in line with the historical trends.  And most of these large  misses are either company or sector specific.  So, Boeing`s 737 MAX jet  issues are well-known.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) had many company specific issues.  Look at rival UPS, they  boasting strong numbers in the next day air delivery service.  They didn`t  have the same problems FedEx (NYSE:FDX) had.</p><p>McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) likely saw significant traffic diversion around that  whole chicken sandwich wars earlier in the last few months, competitors  like Popeyes.  But if the miss is reflecting trends in the broader economy,  you`d be seeing far more companies missing and overall guidance would be  much worse than it is.</p><p>So, this leaves Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), this is poster child for the trade  wars and for Canada.  Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) reduced dealer inventory due  uncertainty in the global economy resulting from trade tensions.  That`s  their words.  And they said end user demand was flat.  But Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) earnings trends have been very poor more than a year, not just  this quarter.</p><p>And the fact that the stock is up today seems to indicate that the street  believes that Caterpillar`s earnings could be bottoming.  The question now  is, is the global slowdown getting priced in?  Alec Young from FTSE Russell  calls this the muddle-through market, where investors are expecting one to  two percent GDP growth and maybe 5 percent earnings growth or less in 2020.</p><p>That`s a lot better than recession fears that we had six months ago.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Coke was upgraded to buy from neutral at UBS.  The analyst cites price  increase, its acquisition of a global coffee brand and innovation.  The  price target is $63.  The stock rose more than 1.5 percent to $56.64.</p><p>Travelers was upgraded to hold from sell at Deutsche Bank.  The analyst  says underwriting margin may be bottoming.  The price target is $140.   Shares of the Dow component gained 1.5 percent to $132.16.</p><p>Walgreen`s Boots Alliance was downgraded to neutral from overweight at  JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).  The analyst there cites growth challenges in the near  term.  The price target is $63.  The stock fell 1 percent to $54.56.</p><p>And ServiceNow was downgraded to neutral from buy at Mizuho Securities.   The analyst cites the departure of the company`s CEO and the broader  concern over employee attrition.  Last night you may remember we told that  you ServiceNow CEO is going to go over and head Nike (NYSE:NKE).  The price  target is $230.  The stock is down more than 3.5 percent to 220.01.</p><p>Still ahead, Facebook`s CEO did not find many friends among lawmakers on  Capitol Hill.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  In the news tonight, President Trump today lifted all sanctions on  Turkey, saying there will be a permanent cease fire in the conflict between  Turkey and the Kurds in northern Syria.  The ceasefire required Kurdish  forces to move out of a roughly 20-mile zone on the Turkish border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  By the moves that we have  made, we are achieving a much more peaceful and stable area between Turkey  and Syria, including a 20-mile-wide safe zone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The administration says it reserves the right to re-impose the  sanctions if Ankara falls short of its obligations, adding that it`s not  the job of the U.S. military to police the world.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg went to Capitol Hill today to  answer questions about his company`s cryptocurrency project called Libra.   And he found himself defending just about every part of his social media  network.</p><p>Ylan Mui has more on the heated hearing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mark Zuckerberg`s hearing  on Capitol Hill lasted all day.  Facebook`s founder and CEO fielded  questions on everything from election security and political speech, to  privacy and competition.  Democrats were angry and at times exasperated.</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA (NASDAQ:CA)), FINANCIAL SERVICES CHAIR:  Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) changes the rules when it can benefit itself.</p><p>REP. NYDIA VELAZQUEZ (D), NEW YORK:  Have you learned that you should not  lie?</p><p>REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY):  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been systemically  found at the scene of the crime.</p><p>REP. BRAD SHERMAN (D-CA (NASDAQ:CA)):  For the richest man in the world to  come here and hide behind the poorest people in the world and say that`s  who you`re really trying to help.  You`re trying to help those for whom the  dollar is not a good currency -- drug dealers, terrorists, tax evaders.</p><p>MUI:  Republicans were also tough on Zuckerberg but some cautioned against  the broader big tech backlash.</p><p>REP. PATRICK MCHENRY (R-NC):  That`s why I believe American innovation is  on trial this day in this hearing.</p><p>MUI:  The focus of the hearing was supposed to be Facebook`s ambitious plan  to launch a cryptocurrency called Libra.  Zuckerberg says he understands  why Washington is kept skeptical.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO:  I get that I`m not the ideal messenger for  this right now.  We faced a lot of issues over the past few years and I`m  sure there are a lot of people who wish it were anyone but Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) who are helping to propose this.</p><p>MUI:  He promised lawmakers that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) would not move  forward with Libra unless they get approval from U.S. regulators.  And if  it doesn`t, Zuckerberg said he would be willing to leave the association  backing the cryptocurrency.  However, there will be costs to stepping away.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  While we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn`t  waiting.  China is moving quickly to launch the similar idea in the coming  months.  Libra is going to be backed mostly by dollars and I believe that  it will extend America`s financial leadership around the world, as well as  our Democrat values and oversight.</p><p>But if America doesn`t innovate, our financial leadership is not  guaranteed.</p><p>MUI:  This is Zuckerberg`s first public testimony on Capitol Hill in 18  months.  He leaned forward in seat while listening to questions and  answering them.</p><p>This hearing may be over, but the spotlight isn`t going away.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Sales of one of the Eli Lilly`s top selling drugs misses the mark.   And that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Rebates and discounts on a Lily`s diabetes drug Trulicity curved revenue  and came in shy of targets but the drug maker did top expectations and it  raised its full year earnings forecast.  Shares fell more than 2 percent to  $107.40.</p><p>Profit and health insurer Anthem rose more than 20 percent, thanks to  enrollment gains from people enrolled in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid.   Anthem`s 2020 guidance was also better than feared, easing concerns that  rising medical costs would cut into profits.  That helped sent shares up  more than 1 percent to $263.51.</p><p>Norfolk Southern (NYSE:SO) profit fell as the railroad carried less freight  in the quarter.  The company also sees industry headwinds, with tariff  uncertainty and global weakness that could impact the coal and steel  transport markets.  Norfolk Southern (NYSE:SO) shares slipped more than 2  percent to $184.87.</p><p>And shares of Resideo Technologies fell following the company lowering its  revenue guidance.  The smart home and security products company also said  its CFO will be leaving and it has begun a comprehensive operational and  financial review.  Shares lost nearly 40 percent of their value today to  finish at $9.50.</p><p>And after the bell, Ford posted a lower than expected profit as higher  warranty and incentive costs and slower demand in China hit its bottom  line.  The automaker also cut its full-year guidance.  Shares initially  fell following the news, but they closed the regular session up about 1.5  percent to $9.21.</p><p>Also after the bell, Tesla shares initially spiked after the electric  carmaker posted a surprise profit for the quarter.  But revenue did fall  slightly from a year ago.  And you can see the after-hours move after  closing the regular session down a fraction to $254.68.</p><p>While price target hikes are pretty common on Wall Street, but today, there  were a couple that caught our attention.  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Morgan  Stanley (NYSE:MS) increased their target on the paint company Sherwin- Williams (NYSE:SHW) to $650 a share.  Now, there were only a handful of  companies trading at that high of a dollar amount, which got us thinking,  why did companies choose to keep their stock prices so high?</p><p>We decided to examine the phenomenon in a segment we call surprising  stocks.</p><p>And joining to us talk about all this is Art Hogan.  He is the chief market  strategist at National Securities.</p><p>Good to see you, Art.</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES:  Nice to see you,  Sue.  Thanks so much for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) was a surprise for me with the price  that it`s trades at.  But if you broaden it out, why would a company choose  to keep its price that high instead of splitting it?</p><p>HOGAN:  Yes, it`s such a great question.</p><p>So, on the company side, there`s three kind of fundamental reasons why they  like to keep that.  There`s a prestige thing and, all of a sudden, sort of  post to the 1999, 2000 time frame when everything fell apart, the higher  the price, is it just seemed like you are a fancier and better company.   That`s persistent.  So, we have seen that.</p><p>And the second thing, large institutional investors pay by share.  So they  put pressure on companies not to actually split their share price, so they  don`t have to pay as much in transacting, investing in companies.</p><p>And then the third thing is, remember both in 1999, 2000 and 2008 when  prices came down precipitously, if you start at lower level and you slipped  between $10, it became a very slippery slope for your stock to get down to  a level where you might be delisted or you might get -- the stock price  might be too low that you couldn`t trade on exchanging or couldn`t be in  funds.</p><p>So, I think that`s probably the three main drivers for corporations.</p><p>HERERA:  So, for that last one that you mentioned, it could be a defensive  strategy.  In case.</p><p>HOGAN:  Yes, very much so.</p><p>HERERA:  If the CFO or the CEO thinks that perhaps the economy is slowing  or we`re headed for a recession or something along those lines.</p><p>HOGAN:  Yes, that`s generally the thought process.  There`s the sort of  prestige thing I`ve got a $1,000 stock or the $500 stock.  There`s the  pressure you get from large institutional investors who say, hey, listen,  we are paying by the share, so we don`t care how expensive your stock is.   And the third thing is, hey, remember in 2008 when we got down to 5 bucks  and half the funds of the world could invest in us because our stock price  was too low.</p><p>So, those are types of things, and really, those are the fundamentals.  But  I don`t think there`s great reasons.</p><p>HERERA:  But on the other side, one of the reasons that you might want to  split your stock I would think that you broaden out shareholder base.</p><p>HOGAN:  Oh, absolutely.  So human psychology for with whatever reason, it`s  just easier for me to contemplate that a $20 stock is going to $40, and I  think I`m buying more if I buy it at $20, even though spending $10,000,  than if I paid $20 a share and it goes to $400.</p><p>The contemplation of going from 20 to 40 easier for me to grasp as an  investor than it is to think a stock can go from 20 to 400.  And even  though I invested $10,000 in that stock at either stock price and that  percentage gain is exactly the same, I just believe it`s easier for it to  happen from $20 to $40.</p><p>HERERA:  Right.</p><p>HOGAN:  I believe I can buy more.  It`s a human nature thing.  And you get  more investors that say, I can afford to buy this stock at $20.  Can`t  afraid it as $400.</p><p>HERERA:  Right, what about liquidity overall in the stock.</p><p>HOGAN:  Yes, the more shares you have outstanding, the more likely your  shares are going to trade an awful lot.  And I think that that helps in  that liquidity.  So, if you are a holder, you`re probably going to be able  to get in and out without moving a stock around that much when there`s more  liquidity, when there`s volume in your stock.</p><p>So, I think there are a whole lot of benefits, the largest of those --</p><p>HERERA:  OK.</p><p>HOGAN:  -- are psychological for the lower priced stocks.</p><p>HERERA:  On that note, Art, thanks so much.</p><p>HOGAN:  My pleasure.</p><p>HERERA:  Art Hogan with National Securities.</p><p>And coming up, why a new harvest may be coming to Wall Street.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANK HOLLAND, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The most valuable  hemp crop in U.S. history being harvested right now.</p><p>I`m Frank Holland.

As much as $32 billion worth of  cannabidiol or CBD could be sourced from the hemp of this farm in Murray,  Kentucky, and others around the country.</p><p>SMOKE WALLIN, VERTICAL WELLNESS CEO:  We are growing hemp.  We`re  harvesting it.  We`re extracting the CBD, and then we`re putting into our  brands.</p><p>HOLLAND:  Smoke Wallin is the CEO of Vertical Wellness, a company focused  on CBD products manufactured from industrial hemp.  Vertical Wellness is a  subsidiary of Vertical Companies, a U.S.-based cannabis producer expects to  launch an IPO, the Hemp CBD business, on the Nasdaq next year.  Other  companies in the CBD space already trade in Canada.</p><p>However, analysts say the first company to trade in the U.S. will benefit  from increased visibility, greater investment and more access to capital.   Wallin says that`s the motivation but unlike higher profile IPOs, he says  the company is already profitable.</p><p>Vertical Wellness expects to generate $28 million in revenue this year and  see the number more than triple in 2020.  By selling 75 percent of the hemp  and using 25 percent in its own brands of CBD products.</p><p>WALLIN:  Right away, we`re going to see a profitable company, scaling very  quickly.</p><p>So, we -- I don`t really focus on revenue so much.  I know the market is  really geared to that kind of stuff.  I focus on driving EBITDA and cash  flow so we can scale up business profitably.</p><p>HOLLAND:  It`s the same goal for Nathan Musser, a tobacco and soybean  farmer who started growing hemp in the spring of 2018 as part of the state  pilot program.  After hemp became legal, he decided to plant eight times  more.</p><p>NATHAN MUSSER, FARMER:  The profits on the hill is in line with the tobacco  probably 15 to 20 percent higher than the tobacco.  And with the corn and  soybeans, it`s substantially higher</p><p>HOLLAND:  Hemp is also a substantially cheaper source of CBD than cannabis.   Farmers and Vertical Wellness both hoping to capitalize on this emerging  cash crop.</p><p>WALLIN:  It`s about how do you build something that`s really truly,  scalable and sustainable.</p><p>HOLLAND:  Regulation, though, remains the biggest headwind for the domestic  hemp and CBD industry.  Both the Department of Agriculture and Food and  Drug Administration are drafting guidelines for how hemp can be grown , as  well as how CBD can be used in food and drinks.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Frank Holland in Murray, Kentucky.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And before we go, another look at the day`s final numbers on Wall  Street.  The Dow rose 45 points.  The Nasdaq up 15 and S&amp;P 500 added 8.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks  for joining us.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) trounced earnings expectations but growth has slowed in one of its key businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Billions and counting. Profits fall and costs rise at Boeing (NYSE:BA) as the CEO stands firm, sticking to his timeline of getting the 737 MAX back in the air.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) crunch. Sales slump and its outlook is ugly. But investors may be starting to believe that the worst is over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Wednesday, October 23rd.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome. Bill has the evening off.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is reeling in the profits. The most valuable public company in the U.S. easily beat Wall Street estimates, reporting earnings of more than $10 billion in sales of more than $30 billion both double digit increases from a year ago. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may have made its name in its Windows operating system but its future is in the cloud. Its cloud business called Azure has been growing quickly, but its growth in the most recent quarter was below 60 percent, a big number but one that gave investors pause. The stock was volatile in initial after- hours trading.</p><p>Josh Lipton has more now on Microsoft`s quarter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Expectations ran high into Microsoft`s latest earnings with the stock up nearly 35 percent so far this year as investors bet that it`s a smart way to capitalize on the shift to cloud computing. One big number that investors watch: commercial cloud revenue. Now, that includes Azure, Microsoft`s answer to rival AWS, as well as other cloud properties.</p><p>Commercial cloud revenue clocked in at $11.6 billion with gross margin spanning to 66 percent.</p><p>Evercore`s Kirk Materne says the growth in the cloud is now translating into real earnings power. And that he argues should drive the stock higher over the long-term.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Let`s turn now to Dan Ives to talk more about Microsoft`s better than expected earnings. He is the managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities.</p><p>Welcome, Dan. Nice to have you here.</p><p>DAN IVES, WEDBUSH SECURITIES MANAGING DIRECTOR OF EQUITY RESEARCH: Great to be here. Thanks.</p><p>HERERA: What do you think of the report? Specifically, I know you were going to be focused on the cloud business. And that seems to be what has investors a little bit worried about tonight.</p><p>Are you at all concerned?</p><p>IVES: Yes, I view it as a knee-jerk reaction. I mean, this continues in my opinion to be a strong report and really one that puts gasoline in the engine in terms of cloud. You look at a 59 percent growth number. I think what`s happening here is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stealing share from AWS. And for the stock, we continue to view this as something that`s still in the early innings and moving higher.</p><p>HERERA: Now, the stock as Josh mentioned in his report is up about 35 percent. You`re still bullish on the stock. What kind of target do you have? And does this percentage increase so far this year give you any pause?</p><p>IVES: Yes, we have $160 price target. I think this is only halfway through the move to cloud. And Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to be our bet. But if I look at this quarter ultimately gives us more bullishness to owning this. Stocks up and I still view this as a start of what`s going to be a massive secular change when the Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) owning the cloud.</p><p>HERERA: What about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the competition with their cloud business? They really still own the space even though Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is gaining.</p><p>IVES: It`s a great point. I mean, I think the first part of this, Bezos and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) won the first part of the cloud battle. But I think the next part is where Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) win there. And I think when you look at these earnings, forest for the trees, I think this really shows that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is starting to steal share and in our opinion makes us more positive on shares, and just on the cloud story going forward, in terms of the two-horse race between Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>HERERA: Now, if you are a long-term investor as many of our viewers are, would you own both stocks on a kind of hedge your bet as to who`s really going to win the cloud war?</p><p>IVES: Yes, I mean, right here, I view Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as my 10- year play on cloud. And that`s continuing to be our top pick. I do view Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) when you look at the AWS piece, that`s another name to own in the portfolio. You`re going to have $700 billion to $800 billion spent in the cloud over the next eight to nine years. These are the two ways to play it in my opinion.</p><p>HERERA: On that note, Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities -- thanks, Dan.</p><p>IVES: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Boeing`s earnings were cut in half as the company struggles to recover from the grounding of its top selling 737 MAX jetliner. Revenue slid 20 percent from a year ago. But that wasn`t as bad as feared.</p><p>The company also said it`s sticking with its plan to get the 737 MAX back in the air. And that helped lift the stock in today`s session.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Fixing the 737 MAX continues to cost Boeing (NYSE:BA) hundreds of millions of dollars. But CEO Dennis Muilenburg says the company is moving closer to fixing the beleaguered plane.</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, BOEING CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: There are tangible milestones being achieved but we still have more work to do. Last week, we did complete an initial dry run of the certification test flight.</p><p>LEBEAU: That certification flight is expected to happen next month. If it goes as planned, the head of the FAA could decide by the end of the year, the MAX is safe to fly, clearing the way for scores of 737s to get back in the air. But some on Wall Street have a different time line for the MAX.</p><p>RON EPSTEIN, BANK OF AMERICA: We have it returning to service in March. Are we changing that because of what the company said? No. I mean, this is a company that has a history of overpromising and under-delivering, and eventually, they get it right.</p><p>LEBEAU: After cutting MAX production to 42 per month earlier this year, Boeing (NYSE:BA) plans to ramp up to 57 per month by the end of next year.</p><p>While investors are encouraged Boeing (NYSE:BA) is close to turning the corner with this crisis, some in Congress still have plenty of questions about what went wrong. And next week, they`ll grill CEO Dennis Muilenburg during hearings on the Hill.</p><p>MUILENBURG: I anticipate there will be tough questions, challenging questions, a lot of scrutiny. And frankly, we support the scrutiny on the work that we`re doing.</p><p>LEBEAU: That scrutiny is far from over. Regulators from around the world still must be convinced that the MAX is safe to fly. And in some countries like China, that may not happen for several months.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is considered a barometer for global growth. And today, it reported weaker than expected earnings, it lowered its full year profit outlook. It also said it would not be issuing sales guidance because the outlook is so uncertain. But the stock didn`t fall as much as you`d think. In fact, it rose.</p><p>Seema Mody explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The softening global economy is pushing Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) customers to think twice about buying heavy machinery. The industrial bellwether said dealers were holding off on purchases of equipment not due to financial distress but because of the uncertainty about where the economy goes from here.</p><p>ANDREW R.J. BONFIELD, CATERPILLAR CFO: Obviously, primary is dealer expectations of inventory reductions. It depends where we end -- you know, obviously, the big unknown factor is what is our dealer expectations of future growth going to be at the end of the year, because that will impact their order pattern in Q4.</p><p>MODY: Weaker demand resulted in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) posting its first quarterly profit decline since 2016. Energy was also weak. The company makes things like pumps and drilling equipment. That softness some experts say is the result of the trade war and slowing global growth.</p><p>JIM UMPLEBY, CATERPILLAR CEO: Our mines customers are cautious and so, they are hesitant to pull the trigger on new equipment, although, again, we`re seeing increased sales. So, we`re seeing improvement in that business. One thing to also keep in mind is that, you know, when miners sometimes delay, that creates opportunities for us for rebuild in parts.</p><p>MODY: Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) continues to deal with ongoing weakness in Asia-Pacific where sales fell 13 percent. But the company is confident that overtime, it will be able to fend of competition in markets like China.</p><p>UMPLEBY: We are confident in our ability to compete in China long-term and demonstrated the ability to do that. But there will be fluctuations on a short-term basis up or down. That`s just part of the deal.</p><p>MODY: Despite the disappointing earnings report, some investors are hopeful the company can stage a turn around overtime.</p><p>ROB WERTHEIMER, MELIUS RESEARCH FOUNDING PARTNER: They`ve done a very good job, the short little up cycle we have. And keep in mind, these industrial up cycles has been great. Mining is not all that great. Oil and gas is not at all that great. And construction is OK.</p><p>It hasn`t been a powerful up cycle. The margins have been really exceptional. They`ve done a great job. We`ll see how they can manage the other side, the turn if we have one.</p><p>MODY: The biggest challenge for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) will be navigating the uncertain global economy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Seema Mody.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Those earnings were not enough to firmly drive stocks in one direction or the other. The major average is kind of wobbled, trading at a narrow range throughout the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 45 points to 26,833. The Nasdaq was up 15, and the S&amp;P added 8.</p><p>And now comes the hard part, making sense of corporate America`s hits and misses this earnings season.</p><p>Bob Pisani is here to help lead the way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: We are about a quarter of the way through earnings season and analysts are wondering whether several high profile misses are spelling broader trouble ahead for the overall stock market.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX), McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD), now Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) have all missed earnings expectations by a significant amount. We`re talking a miss of 30 percent by Boeing (NYSE:BA). That`s a real outlier. While the misses aren`t trivial, they may be outliers.</p><p>Only 14 percent of companies are missing earnings estimates this quarter. That`s roughly in line with the historical trends. And most of these large misses are either company or sector specific. So, Boeing`s 737 MAX jet issues are well-known.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) had many company specific issues. Look at rival UPS, they boasting strong numbers in the next day air delivery service. They didn`t have the same problems FedEx (NYSE:FDX) had.</p><p>McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) likely saw significant traffic diversion around that whole chicken sandwich wars earlier in the last few months, competitors like Popeyes. But if the miss is reflecting trends in the broader economy, you`d be seeing far more companies missing and overall guidance would be much worse than it is.</p><p>So, this leaves Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), this is poster child for the trade wars and for Canada. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) reduced dealer inventory due uncertainty in the global economy resulting from trade tensions. That`s their words. And they said end user demand was flat. But Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) earnings trends have been very poor more than a year, not just this quarter.</p><p>And the fact that the stock is up today seems to indicate that the street believes that Caterpillar`s earnings could be bottoming. The question now is, is the global slowdown getting priced in? Alec Young from FTSE Russell calls this the muddle-through market, where investors are expecting one to two percent GDP growth and maybe 5 percent earnings growth or less in 2020.</p><p>That`s a lot better than recession fears that we had six months ago.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: It is time to look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Coke was upgraded to buy from neutral at UBS. The analyst cites price increase, its acquisition of a global coffee brand and innovation. The price target is $63. The stock rose more than 1.5 percent to $56.64.</p><p>Travelers was upgraded to hold from sell at Deutsche Bank. The analyst says underwriting margin may be bottoming. The price target is $140. Shares of the Dow component gained 1.5 percent to $132.16.</p><p>Walgreen`s Boots Alliance was downgraded to neutral from overweight at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). The analyst there cites growth challenges in the near term. The price target is $63. The stock fell 1 percent to $54.56.</p><p>And ServiceNow was downgraded to neutral from buy at Mizuho Securities. The analyst cites the departure of the company`s CEO and the broader concern over employee attrition. Last night you may remember we told that you ServiceNow CEO is going to go over and head Nike (NYSE:NKE). The price target is $230. The stock is down more than 3.5 percent to 220.01.</p><p>Still ahead, Facebook`s CEO did not find many friends among lawmakers on Capitol Hill.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: In the news tonight, President Trump today lifted all sanctions on Turkey, saying there will be a permanent cease fire in the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds in northern Syria. The ceasefire required Kurdish forces to move out of a roughly 20-mile zone on the Turkish border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: By the moves that we have made, we are achieving a much more peaceful and stable area between Turkey and Syria, including a 20-mile-wide safe zone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: The administration says it reserves the right to re-impose the sanctions if Ankara falls short of its obligations, adding that it`s not the job of the U.S. military to police the world.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg went to Capitol Hill today to answer questions about his company`s cryptocurrency project called Libra. And he found himself defending just about every part of his social media network.</p><p>Ylan Mui has more on the heated hearing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Mark Zuckerberg`s hearing on Capitol Hill lasted all day. Facebook`s founder and CEO fielded questions on everything from election security and political speech, to privacy and competition. Democrats were angry and at times exasperated.</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA (NASDAQ:CA)), FINANCIAL SERVICES CHAIR: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) changes the rules when it can benefit itself.</p><p>REP. NYDIA VELAZQUEZ (D), NEW YORK: Have you learned that you should not lie?</p><p>REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY): Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been systemically found at the scene of the crime.</p><p>REP. BRAD SHERMAN (D-CA (NASDAQ:CA)): For the richest man in the world to come here and hide behind the poorest people in the world and say that`s who you`re really trying to help. You`re trying to help those for whom the dollar is not a good currency -- drug dealers, terrorists, tax evaders.</p><p>MUI: Republicans were also tough on Zuckerberg but some cautioned against the broader big tech backlash.</p><p>REP. PATRICK MCHENRY (R-NC): That`s why I believe American innovation is on trial this day in this hearing.</p><p>MUI: The focus of the hearing was supposed to be Facebook`s ambitious plan to launch a cryptocurrency called Libra. Zuckerberg says he understands why Washington is kept skeptical.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: I get that I`m not the ideal messenger for this right now. We faced a lot of issues over the past few years and I`m sure there are a lot of people who wish it were anyone but Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) who are helping to propose this.</p><p>MUI: He promised lawmakers that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) would not move forward with Libra unless they get approval from U.S. regulators. And if it doesn`t, Zuckerberg said he would be willing to leave the association backing the cryptocurrency. However, there will be costs to stepping away.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: While we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn`t waiting. China is moving quickly to launch the similar idea in the coming months. Libra is going to be backed mostly by dollars and I believe that it will extend America`s financial leadership around the world, as well as our Democrat values and oversight.</p><p>But if America doesn`t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.</p><p>MUI: This is Zuckerberg`s first public testimony on Capitol Hill in 18 months. He leaned forward in seat while listening to questions and answering them.</p><p>This hearing may be over, but the spotlight isn`t going away.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Sales of one of the Eli Lilly`s top selling drugs misses the mark. And that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Rebates and discounts on a Lily`s diabetes drug Trulicity curved revenue and came in shy of targets but the drug maker did top expectations and it raised its full year earnings forecast. Shares fell more than 2 percent to $107.40.</p><p>Profit and health insurer Anthem rose more than 20 percent, thanks to enrollment gains from people enrolled in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. Anthem`s 2020 guidance was also better than feared, easing concerns that rising medical costs would cut into profits. That helped sent shares up more than 1 percent to $263.51.</p><p>Norfolk Southern (NYSE:SO) profit fell as the railroad carried less freight in the quarter. The company also sees industry headwinds, with tariff uncertainty and global weakness that could impact the coal and steel transport markets. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:SO) shares slipped more than 2 percent to $184.87.</p><p>And shares of Resideo Technologies fell following the company lowering its revenue guidance. The smart home and security products company also said its CFO will be leaving and it has begun a comprehensive operational and financial review. Shares lost nearly 40 percent of their value today to finish at $9.50.</p><p>And after the bell, Ford posted a lower than expected profit as higher warranty and incentive costs and slower demand in China hit its bottom line. The automaker also cut its full-year guidance. Shares initially fell following the news, but they closed the regular session up about 1.5 percent to $9.21.</p><p>Also after the bell, Tesla shares initially spiked after the electric carmaker posted a surprise profit for the quarter. But revenue did fall slightly from a year ago. And you can see the after-hours move after closing the regular session down a fraction to $254.68.</p><p>While price target hikes are pretty common on Wall Street, but today, there were a couple that caught our attention. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) increased their target on the paint company Sherwin- Williams (NYSE:SHW) to $650 a share. Now, there were only a handful of companies trading at that high of a dollar amount, which got us thinking, why did companies choose to keep their stock prices so high?</p><p>We decided to examine the phenomenon in a segment we call surprising stocks.</p><p>And joining to us talk about all this is Art Hogan. He is the chief market strategist at National Securities.</p><p>Good to see you, Art.</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES: Nice to see you, Sue. Thanks so much for having me.</p><p>HERERA: Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) was a surprise for me with the price that it`s trades at. But if you broaden it out, why would a company choose to keep its price that high instead of splitting it?</p><p>HOGAN: Yes, it`s such a great question.</p><p>So, on the company side, there`s three kind of fundamental reasons why they like to keep that. There`s a prestige thing and, all of a sudden, sort of post to the 1999, 2000 time frame when everything fell apart, the higher the price, is it just seemed like you are a fancier and better company. That`s persistent. So, we have seen that.</p><p>And the second thing, large institutional investors pay by share. So they put pressure on companies not to actually split their share price, so they don`t have to pay as much in transacting, investing in companies.</p><p>And then the third thing is, remember both in 1999, 2000 and 2008 when prices came down precipitously, if you start at lower level and you slipped between $10, it became a very slippery slope for your stock to get down to a level where you might be delisted or you might get -- the stock price might be too low that you couldn`t trade on exchanging or couldn`t be in funds.</p><p>So, I think that`s probably the three main drivers for corporations.</p><p>HERERA: So, for that last one that you mentioned, it could be a defensive strategy. In case.</p><p>HOGAN: Yes, very much so.</p><p>HERERA: If the CFO or the CEO thinks that perhaps the economy is slowing or we`re headed for a recession or something along those lines.</p><p>HOGAN: Yes, that`s generally the thought process. There`s the sort of prestige thing I`ve got a $1,000 stock or the $500 stock. There`s the pressure you get from large institutional investors who say, hey, listen, we are paying by the share, so we don`t care how expensive your stock is. And the third thing is, hey, remember in 2008 when we got down to 5 bucks and half the funds of the world could invest in us because our stock price was too low.</p><p>So, those are types of things, and really, those are the fundamentals. But I don`t think there`s great reasons.</p><p>HERERA: But on the other side, one of the reasons that you might want to split your stock I would think that you broaden out shareholder base.</p><p>HOGAN: Oh, absolutely. So human psychology for with whatever reason, it`s just easier for me to contemplate that a $20 stock is going to $40, and I think I`m buying more if I buy it at $20, even though spending $10,000, than if I paid $20 a share and it goes to $400.</p><p>The contemplation of going from 20 to 40 easier for me to grasp as an investor than it is to think a stock can go from 20 to 400. And even though I invested $10,000 in that stock at either stock price and that percentage gain is exactly the same, I just believe it`s easier for it to happen from $20 to $40.</p><p>HERERA: Right.</p><p>HOGAN: I believe I can buy more. It`s a human nature thing. And you get more investors that say, I can afford to buy this stock at $20. Can`t afraid it as $400.</p><p>HERERA: Right, what about liquidity overall in the stock.</p><p>HOGAN: Yes, the more shares you have outstanding, the more likely your shares are going to trade an awful lot. And I think that that helps in that liquidity. So, if you are a holder, you`re probably going to be able to get in and out without moving a stock around that much when there`s more liquidity, when there`s volume in your stock.</p><p>So, I think there are a whole lot of benefits, the largest of those --</p><p>HERERA: OK.</p><p>HOGAN: -- are psychological for the lower priced stocks.</p><p>HERERA: On that note, Art, thanks so much.</p><p>HOGAN: My pleasure.</p><p>HERERA: Art Hogan with National Securities.</p><p>And coming up, why a new harvest may be coming to Wall Street.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANK HOLLAND, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The most valuable hemp crop in U.S. history being harvested right now.</p><p>I`m Frank Holland. Coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I take you inside the growing CBD industry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Target (NYSE:TGT) plans to add $50 million to its holiday payroll. The retailer wants to ensure it has enough workers on hand during peak shopping times. It`s also focusing on things like free shipping and rewards program that will give members early access to doorbusters.</p><p>Separately, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) will start advertising holiday discounts online this week, in an effort to attract holiday shoppers early.</p><p>Well, as you probably know, the trade war has put a lot of pressure on our nation`s farmers. But there is a relatively new cash crop that has some seeing green and Wall Street eyeing a potential new wave of profits.</p><p>Frank Holland is in Murray, Kentucky, for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOLLAND: U.S. hemp production has more than doubled since Congress legalized the crop last December. As much as $32 billion worth of cannabidiol or CBD could be sourced from the hemp of this farm in Murray, Kentucky, and others around the country.</p><p>SMOKE WALLIN, VERTICAL WELLNESS CEO: We are growing hemp. We`re harvesting it. We`re extracting the CBD, and then we`re putting into our brands.</p><p>HOLLAND: Smoke Wallin is the CEO of Vertical Wellness, a company focused on CBD products manufactured from industrial hemp. Vertical Wellness is a subsidiary of Vertical Companies, a U.S.-based cannabis producer expects to launch an IPO, the Hemp CBD business, on the Nasdaq next year. Other companies in the CBD space already trade in Canada.</p><p>However, analysts say the first company to trade in the U.S. will benefit from increased visibility, greater investment and more access to capital. Wallin says that`s the motivation but unlike higher profile IPOs, he says the company is already profitable.</p><p>Vertical Wellness expects to generate $28 million in revenue this year and see the number more than triple in 2020. By selling 75 percent of the hemp and using 25 percent in its own brands of CBD products.</p><p>WALLIN: Right away, we`re going to see a profitable company, scaling very quickly.</p><p>So, we -- I don`t really focus on revenue so much. I know the market is really geared to that kind of stuff. I focus on driving EBITDA and cash flow so we can scale up business profitably.</p><p>HOLLAND: It`s the same goal for Nathan Musser, a tobacco and soybean farmer who started growing hemp in the spring of 2018 as part of the state pilot program. After hemp became legal, he decided to plant eight times more.</p><p>NATHAN MUSSER, FARMER: The profits on the hill is in line with the tobacco probably 15 to 20 percent higher than the tobacco. And with the corn and soybeans, it`s substantially higher</p><p>HOLLAND: Hemp is also a substantially cheaper source of CBD than cannabis. Farmers and Vertical Wellness both hoping to capitalize on this emerging cash crop.</p><p>WALLIN: It`s about how do you build something that`s really truly, scalable and sustainable.</p><p>HOLLAND: Regulation, though, remains the biggest headwind for the domestic hemp and CBD industry. Both the Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration are drafting guidelines for how hemp can be grown , as well as how CBD can be used in food and drinks.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Frank Holland in Murray, Kentucky.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And before we go, another look at the day`s final numbers on Wall Street. The Dow rose 45 points. The Nasdaq up 15 and S&amp;P 500 added 8.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.

AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) proposes to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) for $86 billion. But will the proposal end in wedded bliss? Why Washington may stand in the way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Deal frenzy. From media to aerospace to discount brokerages, why a flurry of mega deals is happening now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: In the fast lane. The automaker, American automaker, that did something no other domestic carmaker has done in more than three decades.</p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, October 24th.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone.</p><p>Neither one of these two are strangers to big deals. AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) themselves, the products of audacious deal-making now plan to hook up in an $86 billion merger. It`s one of the biggest of all-time. The deal would put together the nation`s second-largest wireless carrier, a corporate descendent of the great Ma Bell with one of the most prominent media companies of them all, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), which traces its roots to Henry Luce and Jack Warner, literally invented the news magazine and introduced the first talking picture.</p><p>We told you Friday the deal was close and this weekend, it became official. The combination creates a massive media and distribution company. The CEOs predictably think it`s the next big thing -- an irresistible force, combining content, innovation, speed and mobility.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RANDALL STEPHENSON, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: The world of distribution and content is converging, and we need to move fast, and if we want to do something truly unique, begin to curate content differently, begin to format content differently for these mobile environments, this is all about mobility.</p><p>JEFF BEWKES, TIME WARNER CEO: We realize that if we had ourselves together that we could create more innovations for consumers so they could have more choices of package. They`re going to end up with more competition, therefore lower prices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: But both stocks fell in trading today as investors realize that closing the deal won`t be easy, and, in fact, faces an uphill climb, especially in Washington.</p><p>HERERA: Speaking of which, politicians from both sides of the aisle are raising questions about the proposed deal. This weekend, Donald Trump vowed to block it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: As an example of the power structure I`m fighting, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is buying Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), and thus, CNN, a deal we will not approve, in my administration, because it`s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: He wasn`t the only one. When asked on \"Meet the Press,\" Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine said he has some questions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM KAINE (D), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Generally, pro-competition and less concentration, I think, is generally helpful, especially in the media. But this is just announced, and I haven`t had a chance to dig into the details. But those are the kinds of questions we need to be asking.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: And Senator Bernie Sanders said simply, \"Washington needs to kill it.\"</p><p>Eamon Javers is in Washington with more on the challenges this deal faces.</p><p>Eamon, we heard about from Mr. Trump, from Mr. Kaine. What about from Hillary Clinton herself? Has she said anything?</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Sue. That`s the linchpin to this whole thing. Hillary Clinton, perhaps true to form, has been a little bit more cautious about where she stands on this deal. Her campaign did release a sort of generic statement, saying that the deal has to be examined. But she hasn`t come out and said one way or the other whether she favors this deal. And given the polls and the presidential race right now, a lot of people are thinking this might land on the desk of an incoming Clinton administration early next year.</p><p>So, it will be up to the Clinton folks what they want to do with it, if she wins this election. So, a lot of eyes now focused on her, if that Bernie Sanders comment and that Donald Trump comment sort of box her in politically and force her to come out one way or the other on this deal. So far, she hasn`t planted her flag yet.</p><p>MATHISEN: It`s interesting, Eamon. Usually when antitrust cases come into play, it`s two airlines merging to become one really big airline. This isn`t that. What`s the next step then in the Washington process?</p><p>JAVERS: Well, in terms of process, we`re going to see a filing in the SEC this week, and we`ll expect to learn a little bit more about the deal and where it goes from here. But we`re also going to see filings with Department of Justice eventually, and then, ultimately in November, we`re going to see hearings up on Capitol Hill as the Senate antitrust subcommittee holds hearings designed to provide a public platform here for the -- both the companies that are trying to do this deal and their critics to air their grievances about the deal and whether they think it will take out too much competition.</p><p>The companies have been saying, look, this is a vertical merger. It`s not a merger of competitors like we have seen in other deals. So, therefore, it should escape much regulatory scrutiny as a result of that.</p><p>I`m not so sure that`s the case. The populist mood out there in the country that`s been driving this entire election cycle that we`ve been covering doesn`t make it a natural fit for a massive $86 billion merger here in Washington.</p><p>HERERA: Indeed. Eamon, thank you very much. Eamon Javers in Washington.</p><p>MATHISEN: And another big deal. This one in the global aerospace sector.</p><p>We`ll bring together two of the biggest suppliers to plane-makers. Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) will acquire B/E Aerospace for about $6.5 billion, making this the biggest deal in Rockwell`s history. Rockwell Collins` CEO said the combination gives it a new path for growth and will let it develop supplies for a so-called smart airplane.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLY ORTBERG, ROCKWELL COLLINS CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: We are currently providing broadband systems onto the airplane to communicate with the ground, onboard secure firewalls for cyber security, networks on the aircraft, and in the future, all of the cabin systems are going to be nodes on that network. And that`s the thesis here is that we`ll be able to bring that networking technology to the products that B/E brings to our portfolio.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: Shares went in different directions. B/E Aerospace took off of 16 percent. Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) fell more than 2.5 percent.</p><p>HERERA: And yet another deal. TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) will buy rival Scottrade Financial Services for about $4 billion. That acquisition combines the two largest online brokerages and comes at a time when the industry is facing pressure from lower trading volumes and sluggish revenue growth. And TD Ameritrade`s CEO says his company has a strategy to gain the trust of younger investors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM HOCKEY, TD AMERITRADE CEO: We`re also investing in even more cutting- edge technologies, whether it be using Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo, for example, to be able to talk to TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD). So, we think we`ll be well-positioned to service the millennial client of the future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: Shares of TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) fell about 4 percent in today`s session.</p><p>MATHISEN: Today`s deals don`t stop there. Genworth Financial (NYSE:GNW), which provides mortgage and long-term care insurance, has agreed to sell itself to a Chinese investment firm called China Oceanwide Holdings. The deal valued at $2.5 billion, and comes as Genworth copes with continued low interest rates and rising costs. Shares of Genworth fell on the news. Analysts say the low premium to Friday`s closing prices reflects Genworth`s gloomy business outlook.</p><p>HERERA: Yet another Chinese conglomerate is going to buy a 25 percent stake in hotel operator Hilton Worldwide. HNA Group will pay $6.5 billion for its portion of the company, which is fine from private equity firm Blackstone. That deal comes as Hilton plans to split into three entities later this year, and it`s the latest move into American real estate assets by a Chinese firm. Shares of Hilton rose just a fraction.</p><p>MATHISEN: And so, from media and telecom, to aerospace, to discount brokerages and more, companies across many different industries are buying, selling and merging. In recent weeks alone, nearly $240 billion in deals.</p><p>And here to discuss why is one of America`s most respected deal-makers, Robert __. He`s chairman of the global M&amp;A practice at the law firm, Jones Day.</p><p>Excuse me, Mr. Profusek. Welcome.</p><p>Why are these deals happening now?</p><p>ROBERT PROFUSEK, JONES DAY, HEAD OF M&amp;A PRACTICE: Well, why not? One of the things -- one of the things when you went through the list, you`re going to look for a sort of common thread. Well, certainly, it`s not an industry common thread. There has been a little bit of a backup in M&amp;A in August and September, a little bit. But there`s still plenty of big deals being done.</p><p>And one of the things is the market got a little bit lumpy. Everybody has their own theory as to why that is. The election, discussion of what the Feds are going to do, uncertainty. But, you know, what today proves or this weekend proves is still a very strong market. Particularly driven by low-cost to capital, and frankly a, tepid growth rate that makes you think you need to buy in order to grow.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, I hear you`re saying perhaps the market has a little more clarity on the political side of things. But the higher interest rate scenario. I mean, the Fed is probably only going to raise interest rates once this year and not by very much. How big a factor is that in the move to merge now?</p><p>PROFUSEK: It`s -- there`s never one single factor. It`s probably a factor. But if you`re looking at something very large, and there`s maybe a 30 basis points swing in rates, you know, now rather than later is probably a good idea.</p><p>Nothing is driven by a single factor. It`s wrong when, you know, you`ve got to search out the headlines. But it`s a combination of things. I do think the election and the uncertainty about exactly what all of us are going to -- result from that, that had a negative effect, just like it did on the stock market. And now that it looks more certain, less of an effect.</p><p>MATHISEN: Yes, I was going to say, implicit in that is what I sense is your view that it isn`t as uncertain as it once was. Let`s talk a little bit quickly about that idea of not being able to create sort of organic growth, but having to go and acquire it.</p><p>Is that what`s happening here?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well, when you -- when you`re organic growth rate, your GDP growth rate is in the 150 to 200-basis-point rate, that doesn`t support a very high stock price.</p><p>So, one of the things that is common among all of these deals from this weekend is they`re strategic. Sure, people criticize big deals that it`s just empire building. I don`t think so. When you think about each of these deals, it had a very strategic purpose behind it.</p><p>So, it isn`t about getting better. It`s about getting bigger. It`s about getting better. And synergizing and getting a greater earnings growth than you can in revenue.</p><p>HERERA: What kind of a year do you think it`s going to end up to be? Obviously, the Time Warner (NYSE:TWX)/AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) deal is huge, certainly, but is it going to be a -- an up year compared to last year, do you think?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well, it`s hard for -- last year was over $4 trillion. That`s probably not going to be seen again for some time. But it`s going to be just as good as 2014 that we all thought was a very good year. So, you know, year over year comparisons are a little bit negative but that`s because they`re being compared to an astonishing year.</p><p>I still think, as long as money is cheap, there`s going to be plenty of deals.</p><p>MATHISEN: Very quickly, if you might, sir. Do you see on the face of it any antitrust issues with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T)/Time Warner (NYSE:TWX)?</p><p>PROFUSEK: Well, it is a different deal. Not horizontal as was said earlier. It`s vertical. But obviously, we`re in a political environment. So, it will be looked at. The analogous deal, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) took a year to get done.</p><p>MATHISEN: Robert, thank you very much.</p><p>HERERA: Good point.</p><p>MATHISEN: Robert Profusek with Jones Day.</p><p>HERERA: And as a pace of merger and acquisition activity picks up, who might be next, especially in the fast consolidating media and communications industry?</p><p>Julia Boorstin takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The end of traditional TV is getting closer, and media companies are scrambling to position themselves for the world where customers get exactly what they want on their mobile devices. We could see other distributors, such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Charter, follow AT&amp;T`s lead.</p><p>RANDALL STEPHENSON, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: To the extent that our strategy succeeds, I think other companies will try to look like us. And if our strategy doesn`t succeed, other companies won`t bother, right? So, I think it`s a function of how well we do together and pulling the strategy off.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Tech companies, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), could be buyers as they all put together more video offerings. And for content creators, this deal creates more pressure to consolidate for negotiating power with distributors.</p><p>JAMES DIX, WEDBUSH ANALYST: If you go across the large cap media sways, CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Viacom (NYSE:VIA), with common, you know, voting control already in discussions about a merger, I think this probably slightly increases the odds of that happening.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Fox, which made a failed bid to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) a few years ago, could be looking at other deals. And smaller media assets, such as AMC Networks, Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA), Scripps Networks Interactive (NYSE:SNI) and MSG Networks, whose channels at risk of being excluded from skinny bundles, could be snapped up.</p><p>But analysts warn that prices would need to come down first.</p><p>TODD JUENGER, BERNSTEIN ANALYST: I`m not sure that there`s many Silicon Valley companies who want to pay a multiple on the affiliate model that basically they think they`re destroying. They might want some content, but that`s different than buying television networks. So, if the buyers emerge, I`m sure we`ll have some willing sellers.</p><p>BOORSTIN: And when it comes to streaming giant, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), its $55 billion valuation means not many could buy it. But as the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were to step up, it would be another game-changer for the fast-moving media space.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, all the deal news spurred some optimism on Wall Street today and helped prop up the broader market. But the gains were capped by a rising dollar and falling oil prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 77 to 18,223. Had been up 130 points at one point. NASDAQ gained 52. S&amp;P 500 up 10.</p><p>HERERA: A Federal Reserve official said today very low interest rates will likely be the norm for the next two or three years. St. Louis President James Bullard, a voting member of the Central Banks policy setting committee reiterated his view that only one more interest rate hike is necessary before holding steady. Bullard said he thinks the path of rate rises should be so slow as to be imperceptible.</p><p>MATHISEN: The Dow component Visa (NYSE:V) reported a sharp rise in profits as customers spent more using its network. The world`s largest payments operator was also helped by its acquisition of Visa (NYSE:V) Europe. U.S. accounted for 41 percent of total payments, Europe about 25 percent. Visa (NYSE:V) earned 78 cents a share, that`s 5 cents above estimates. Revenues climbed 19 percent from a year ago to $4.2 billion. That was also above expectations.</p><p>The stock, volatile in after-hours trading and as Aditi Roy explains, that may have something to do with the company`s outlook.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: While Visa (NYSE:V) beat expectations on the top and bottom lines, its forward-looking guidance for the coming fiscal year came in weak. The company projecting net revenue growth for fiscal year 2017 at 16 to 18 percent. That`s lower than street expectations of 20 percent. Its projected EPS growth for the coming fiscal year is in the mid-teens. That number also missing expectations with the street looking for 19 percent growth.</p><p>The report coming on the heels of the company`s announcement last week that CEO Charles Scharf will be stepping down and board member and former AmEx president, Al Kelly, will be taking over.</p><p>The latest earnings also reflecting the company`s acquisition of Visa (NYSE:V) Europe earlier this summer.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, blurring the lines. Big tech is circling telecom. The telecom is fighting back. And these powerful industries may never be the same.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: With its proposed bid for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), it is clear that the boundaries between technology, telecom and media are not as defined as they once were.</p><p>Deirdre Bosa explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: With AT&amp;T`s bid for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), a new wave of media change may have just begun. And the line between media, telecom and tech is becoming blurred.</p><p>RICHARD GREENFIELD, BTIG MEDIA AND TECH ANALYST: I think the reality is, as we shift to an on-demand world, without commercials, as we move to a mobile-first environment, the media industry -- the legacy media industry, meaning the cable network product that kind of has been the basis for all of the media stocks, is very challenging.</p><p>BOSA: And the big shift is a big advantage for tech companies. Just last week, YouTube CEO telling the audience at the \"Vanity Fair\" summit that YouTube sees itself as a platform for next generation TV.</p><p>SUSAN WOJCICKI, YOUTUBE CEO: I think the question is whether you define TV as the content or the platform, right? Back to your original question. And I think the content is going over time is going to morph more to an online type of platform, similar to YouTube, where content is available, you know, on demand, global, and interactive.</p><p>And so, when we think about YouTube, we think about being a platform for the next generation of media companies, and traditional media companies, too.</p><p>BOSA: And that makes traditional media companies nervous. It`s not just YouTube and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) but also Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with its own original content and distribution channels, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV and Facebook`s push into video. Big tech is starting to look a lot like media.</p><p>It`s also encroaching on telecom`s bread and butter distribution business, from financing their own undersea cable to satisfy bandwidth needs to offering ultra high speed Internet as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) fiber already does in nine cities.</p><p>With tech, telecom and media now playing in the same sand box, they may start competing for the same assets. The AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) deal reportedly came together quickly as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and others were circling. In a consolidating media landscape, the tech giants will continue to play a major role.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Deirdre Bosa, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) cuts its outlook after a disappointing quarter and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The consumer products company missed analysts` estimates for profits and revenue, citing currency headwinds and competitive environment. The maker of Kleenex Tissues and Huggies Diapers lowered its earnings forecast for the year. Shares finished the day down nearly 5 percent to $113.91.</p><p>T-Mobile posted higher than expected profit, thanks in part to an increase in customers. The wireless carrier is optimistic that momentum will continue, saying it expects to add more customers this year than it previously forecast. The shares popped almost 10 percent to $51.19.</p><p>Restaurant Brands topped profit expectations as the owner of Burger King benefited from higher sales in some foreign markets. But the company`s same-store sales grew at a slower cliff than last year due to sluggish demand in the U.S. and Canada. Shares off nearly 5 percent to $44.67.</p><p>MATHISEN: VF Corp posted worse than expected revenue as weak demand in the apparel retailer`s denim division hurt results. The owner of the North Face and Wrangler brands did report a higher profit but still, the company cut its guidance for the year. But VF did raise its quarterly dividend on this day, nearly 14 percent to 42 currents a share. Nonetheless, shares down more than 2 percent at $53.07.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said the steep drop in the pound sterling following Britain`s vote to leave the European Union has prompted the company to raise prices for its software and cloud services in that country. Starting January 1st, business customers can expect to see a price hike of 13 percent for Enterprise software and an increase of 22 percent for Enterprise cloud services. Shares were up 2 percent on the day at $61 even.</p><p>Shares of the restaurant chain, Sonic (NASDAQ:SONC), took a hit after hours following a down beat earnings outlook for the year. The company also said profit and revenue were hurt in its latest quarter, because of, quote, \"slowing consumer trends\". Shares initially fell 10 percent, following the after the bell news, but finished the regular session up more than 1 percent to $26.49.</p><p>HERERA: A lot of money has been pouring into passive investments like mutual funds and ETFs. It`s a trend that we have been reporting on. But ETFs or exchange traded funds are multiplying like crazy.</p><p>And as Mike Santoli reports, not all of them are created equal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Exchange-traded funds are a bit like the smartphone apps of the investing world. They`re remarkably cheap and useful, new ones pop up each day to fit every narrow interest and there are far too many.</p><p>Because they offer efficient exposure to stock and bond markets at low costs, ETFs are one of the hottest growth areas in financial services. There are some 1,700 ETFs controlling about $2.4 trillion in assets. Still, the market is dominated by a handful of very broad funds. The ten largest ETFs, including State Street`s S&amp;P 500 Trust, and the Vanguard Total Market ETF command a more than a quarter of all ETF assets.</p><p>This is driven fund companies to push a variety of gimmicky or highly complex ETFs to appeal to niche interests. Among such offerings, an ETF to play the whiskey industry, one for the drone economy and others for most every agricultural commodity.</p><p>The success rate of new ETFs is pretty low. More than half of all listed funds have less than $100 million in assets, a common threshold for determining a fund`s viability. And one website that tracks what it calls an ETF death watch now lists more than 400 funds vulnerable to closure based on size and trading activity.</p><p>One promising area within ETFs is known as smart beta or funds pursuing automated stock selection strategy or feature some investing factor meant to outperform the broad market. This could be cheap stocks or momentum stocks or those with some other trades. These are crowding out traditional higher cost mutual funds run by human portfolio managers.</p><p>All this innovation in downward pressure on costs ultimately can work to the benefit of small investors who can use ETFs to construct a low fee, tax efficient portfolio. But as with the surplus of phone apps, it`s important to avoid the frivolous or costly ones.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, auto reliability. The American automaker that just broke a 35-year losing streak for domestic brands. See if you can guess which one.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Here`s a look at what to watch tomorrow. Seven Dow components report earnings, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), 3M (NYSE:MMM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Merck (NYSE:MRK), among others. The future of digital payments and financial services will be the focus of the Money 20/20 event. And we`ll get a read on home prices with the release of the S&amp;P Case- Shiller Home Price Index and that`s what to watch Tuesday.</p><p>HERERA: The White House today confirmed that health care premiums will go up sharply next year for insurance sold through healthcare.gov. Before subsidies, premiums for a mid-level plan will increase on average 25 percent. The administration says that the subsidies will help offset that price increase, but it comes as a number of insurers have pulled back from offering plans in the federal market. Open enrollment starts November 1st.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, today brought a surprise in the rankings of car brand reliability. The latest report on that shows a Japanese brand stumbling while a domestic brand has jumped to near the top of the list. In fact, for the first time ever, \"Consumer Reports\" puts a domestic brand among the three most reliable auto brands in the U.S.</p><p>Phil LeBeau reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: They`re not the flashiest models for sale, but Buicks are turning heads, especially after the latest report on auto reliability by \"Consumer Reports\" which ranks Buick as the third most reliable brand behind Lexus and Toyota (NYSE:TM).</p><p>JAKE FISHER, CONSUMER REPORTS: If you look at the top three, it`s Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Lexus, no surprise there, conservative companies that have a real good reputation of putting out reliable vehicles. But above any of the other Japanese automakers, above Honda, above Subaru, we see Buick. That is a big deal. .</p><p>LEBEAU: While Buicks are getting better, according to \"Consumer Reports\", Hondas are not as reliable. In fact, the latest version of the Civic, one of the most popular cars in America, dropped in the survey due to problems with the power train and infotainment system. Honda says it respects the survey results and is working to enhance the usability and functionality of its vehicles.</p><p>Meanwhile, issues with the falcon wing doors in the new Tesla Model X are one reason \"Consumer Reports\" ranks it as the least reliable luxury midsize SUV. But the brands with the poorest rankings are Ram, Fiat and Chrysler.</p><p>FISHER: Fiat Chrysler really continues to stumble. The platforms that they have for Fiat have not proven reliable.</p><p>LEBEAU: Fiat Chrysler says despite the survey results, the company`s own internal measurements continue to show positive growth toward vehicle quality.</p><p>This survey is based on \"Consumer Reports\" subscribers critiquing the cars, trucks and SUVs they own. Their most common complaint, the infotainment systems in these cars are not always working as they should be.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for watching.</p><p>MATHISEN: And thanks from me, as well. I`m Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening, everybody.

AT&amp;T  (NYSE:T) proposes to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) for $86 billion.  But will  the proposal end in wedded bliss?  Why Washington may stand in the way.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Deal frenzy.  From media  to aerospace to discount brokerages, why a flurry of mega deals is  happening now.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  In the fast lane.  The automaker, American automaker, that did  something no other domestic carmaker has done in more than three decades.  </p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday,  October 24th.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone.  </p><p>Neither one of these two are strangers to big deals.  AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and  Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) themselves, the products of audacious deal-making  now plan to hook up in an $86 billion merger.  It's one of the biggest of  all-time.  The deal would put together the nation's second-largest wireless  carrier, a corporate descendent of the great Ma Bell with one of the most  prominent media companies of them all, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), which traces  its roots to Henry Luce and Jack Warner, literally invented the news  magazine and introduced the first talking picture. </p><p>We told you Friday the deal was close and this weekend, it became official.   The combination creates a massive media and distribution company.  The CEOs  predictably think it's the next big thing -- an irresistible force,  combining content, innovation, speed and mobility.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RANDALL STEPHENSON, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  The world of  distribution and content is converging, and we need to move fast, and if we  want to do something truly unique, begin to curate content differently,  begin to format content differently for these mobile environments, this is  all about mobility.  </p><p>JEFF BEWKES, TIME WARNER CEO:  We realize that if we had ourselves together  that we could create more innovations for consumers so they could have more  choices of package.  They're going to end up with more competition,  therefore lower prices.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  But both stocks fell in trading today as investors realize that  closing the deal won't be easy, and, in fact, faces an uphill climb,  especially in Washington.  </p><p>HERERA:  Speaking of which, politicians from both sides of the aisle are  raising questions about the proposed deal.  This weekend, Donald Trump  vowed to block it.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  As an example of the power  structure I'm fighting, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is buying Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), and  thus, CNN, a deal we will not approve, in my administration, because it's  too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  He wasn't the only one.  When asked on \"Meet the Press,\"  Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine said he has some  questions.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM KAINE (D), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Generally, pro-competition and  less concentration, I think, is generally helpful, especially in the media.   But this is just announced, and I haven't had a chance to dig into the  details.  But those are the kinds of questions we need to be asking.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  And Senator Bernie Sanders said simply, \"Washington needs to kill  it.\" </p><p>Eamon Javers is in Washington with more on the challenges this deal faces.  </p><p>Eamon, we heard about from Mr. Trump, from Mr. Kaine.  What about from  Hillary Clinton herself?  Has she said anything?  </p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Sue.  That's the  linchpin to this whole thing.  Hillary Clinton, perhaps true to form, has  been a little bit more cautious about where she stands on this deal.  Her  campaign did release a sort of generic statement, saying that the deal has  to be examined.  But she hasn't come out and said one way or the other  whether she favors this deal.  And given the polls and the presidential  race right now, a lot of people are thinking this might land on the desk of  an incoming Clinton administration early next year.  </p><p>So, it will be up to the Clinton folks what they want to do with it, if she  wins this election.  So, a lot of eyes now focused on her, if that Bernie  Sanders comment and that Donald Trump comment sort of box her in  politically and force her to come out one way or the other on this deal.   So far, she hasn't planted her flag yet.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  It's interesting, Eamon.  Usually when antitrust cases come into  play, it's two airlines merging to become one really big airline.  This  isn't that.  What's the next step then in the Washington process?  </p><p>JAVERS:  Well, in terms of process, we're going to see a filing in the SEC  this week, and we'll expect to learn a little bit more about the deal and  where it goes from here.  But we're also going to see filings with  Department of Justice eventually, and then, ultimately in November, we're  going to see hearings up on Capitol Hill as the Senate antitrust  subcommittee holds hearings designed to provide a public platform here for  the -- both the companies that are trying to do this deal and their critics  to air their grievances about the deal and whether they think it will take  out too much competition.  </p><p>The companies have been saying, look, this is a vertical merger.  It's not  a merger of competitors like we have seen in other deals.  So, therefore,  it should escape much regulatory scrutiny as a result of that.  </p><p>I'm not so sure that's the case.  The populist mood out there in the  country that's been driving this entire election cycle that we've been  covering doesn't make it a natural fit for a massive $86 billion merger  here in Washington.  </p><p>HERERA:  Indeed.  Eamon, thank you very much.  Eamon Javers in Washington.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And another big deal.  This one in the global aerospace sector.  </p><p>We'll bring together two of the biggest suppliers to plane-makers.   Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) will acquire B/E Aerospace for about $6.5  billion, making this the biggest deal in Rockwell's history.  Rockwell  Collins' CEO said the combination gives it a new path for growth and will  let it develop supplies for a so-called smart airplane.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLY ORTBERG, ROCKWELL COLLINS CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  We are currently providing  broadband systems onto the airplane to communicate with the ground, onboard  secure firewalls for cyber security, networks on the aircraft, and in the  future, all of the cabin systems are going to be nodes on that network.   And that's the thesis here is that we'll be able to bring that networking  technology to the products that B/E brings to our portfolio.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Shares went in different directions.  B/E Aerospace took off of  16 percent.  Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) fell more than 2.5 percent.  </p><p>HERERA:  And yet another deal.  TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) will buy rival  Scottrade Financial Services for about $4 billion.  That acquisition  combines the two largest online brokerages and comes at a time when the  industry is facing pressure from lower trading volumes and sluggish revenue  growth.  And TD Ameritrade's CEO says his company has a strategy to gain  the trust of younger investors.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM HOCKEY, TD AMERITRADE CEO:  We're also investing in even more cutting- edge technologies, whether it be using Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo, for  example, to be able to talk to TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD).  So, we think  we'll be well-positioned to service the millennial client of the future.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  Shares of TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) fell about 4 percent in  today's session.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Today's deals don't stop there.  Genworth Financial (NYSE:GNW),  which provides mortgage and long-term care insurance, has agreed to sell  itself to a Chinese investment firm called China Oceanwide Holdings.  The  deal valued at $2.5 billion, and comes as Genworth copes with continued low  interest rates and rising costs.  Shares of Genworth fell on the news.   Analysts say the low premium to Friday's closing prices reflects Genworth's  gloomy business outlook.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yet another Chinese conglomerate is going to buy a 25 percent  stake in hotel operator Hilton Worldwide.  HNA Group will pay $6.5 billion  for its portion of the company, which is fine from private equity firm  Blackstone.  That deal comes as Hilton plans to split into three entities  later this year, and it's the latest move into American real estate assets  by a Chinese firm.  Shares of Hilton rose just a fraction.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And so, from media and telecom, to aerospace, to discount  brokerages and more, companies across many different industries are buying,  selling and merging.  In recent weeks alone, nearly $240 billion in deals.  </p><p>And here to discuss why is one of America's most respected deal-makers,  Robert __.  He's chairman of the global M&amp;A practice at the law firm, Jones  Day.  </p><p>Excuse me, Mr. Profusek.  Welcome.  </p><p>Why are these deals happening now?  </p><p>ROBERT PROFUSEK, JONES DAY, HEAD OF M&amp;A PRACTICE:  Well, why not?  One of  the things -- one of the things when you went through the list, you're  going to look for a sort of common thread.  Well, certainly, it's not an  industry common thread.  There has been a little bit of a backup in M&amp;A in  August and September, a little bit.  But there's still plenty of big deals  being done.  </p><p>And one of the things is the market got a little bit lumpy.  Everybody has  their own theory as to why that is.  The election, discussion of what the  Feds are going to do, uncertainty.  But, you know, what today proves or  this weekend proves is still a very strong market.  Particularly driven by  low-cost to capital, and frankly a, tepid growth rate that makes you think  you need to buy in order to grow.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes, I hear you're saying perhaps the market has a little more  clarity on the political side of things.  But the higher interest rate  scenario.  I mean, the Fed is probably only going to raise interest rates  once this year and not by very much.  How big a factor is that in the move  to merge now?  </p><p>PROFUSEK:  It's -- there's never one single factor.  It's probably a  factor.  But if you're looking at something very large, and there's maybe a  30 basis points swing in rates, you know, now rather than later is probably  a good idea.  </p><p>Nothing is driven by a single factor.  It's wrong when, you know, you've  got to search out the headlines.  But it's a combination of things.  I do  think the election and the uncertainty about exactly what all of us are  going to -- result from that, that had a negative effect, just like it did  on the stock market.  And now that it looks more certain, less of an  effect.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Yes, I was going to say, implicit in that is what I sense is  your view that it isn't as uncertain as it once was.  Let's talk a little  bit quickly about that idea of not being able to create sort of organic  growth, but having to go and acquire it.  </p><p>Is that what's happening here? </p><p>PROFUSEK:  Well, when you -- when you're organic growth rate, your GDP  growth rate is in the 150 to 200-basis-point rate, that doesn't support a  very high stock price.  </p><p>So, one of the things that is common among all of these deals from this  weekend is they're strategic.  Sure, people criticize big deals that it's  just empire building.  I don't think so.  When you think about each of  these deals, it had a very strategic purpose behind it.  </p><p>So, it isn't about getting better.  It's about getting bigger.  It's about  getting better.  And synergizing and getting a greater earnings growth than  you can in revenue.  </p><p>HERERA:  What kind of a year do you think it's going to end up to be?   Obviously, the Time Warner (NYSE:TWX)/AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) deal is huge,  certainly, but is it going to be a -- an up year compared to last year, do  you think?  </p><p>PROFUSEK:  Well, it's hard for -- last year was over $4 trillion.  That's  probably not going to be seen again for some time.  But it's going to be  just as good as 2014 that we all thought was a very good year.  So, you  know, year over year comparisons are a little bit negative but that's  because they're being compared to an astonishing year.  </p><p>I still think, as long as money is cheap, there's going to be plenty of  deals.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Very quickly, if you might, sir.  Do you see on the face of it  any antitrust issues with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T)/Time Warner (NYSE:TWX)?  </p><p>PROFUSEK:  Well, it is a different deal.  Not horizontal as was said  earlier.  It's vertical.  But obviously, we're in a political environment.   So, it will be looked at.  The analogous deal, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)  (NYSE:CCS) took a year to get done.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Robert, thank you very much.</p><p>HERERA:  Good point.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Robert Profusek with Jones Day.</p><p>HERERA:  And as a pace of merger and acquisition activity picks up, who  might be next, especially in the fast consolidating media and  communications industry?  </p><p>Julia Boorstin takes a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The end of  traditional TV is getting closer, and media companies are scrambling to  position themselves for the world where customers get exactly what they  want on their mobile devices.  We could see other distributors, such as  Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Charter, follow AT&amp;T's lead.  </p><p>RANDALL STEPHENSON, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  To the extent that our  strategy succeeds, I think other companies will try to look like us.  And  if our strategy doesn't succeed, other companies won't bother, right?  So,  I think it's a function of how well we do together and pulling the strategy  off.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Tech companies, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), could be buyers as they all put together more video  offerings.  And for content creators, this deal creates more pressure to  consolidate for negotiating power with distributors.  </p><p>JAMES DIX, WEDBUSH ANALYST:  If you go across the large cap media sways,  CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Viacom (NYSE:VIA), with common, you know, voting control  already in discussions about a merger, I think this probably slightly  increases the odds of that happening.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Fox, which made a failed bid to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) a few  years ago, could be looking at other deals.  And smaller media assets, such  as AMC Networks, Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA), Scripps Networks  Interactive (NYSE:SNI) and MSG Networks, whose channels at risk of being  excluded from skinny bundles, could be snapped up.  </p><p>But analysts warn that prices would need to come down first.  </p><p>TODD JUENGER, BERNSTEIN ANALYST:  I'm not sure that there's many Silicon  Valley companies who want to pay a multiple on the affiliate model that  basically they think they're destroying.  They might want some content, but  that's different than buying television networks.  So, if the buyers  emerge, I'm sure we'll have some willing sellers.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  And when it comes to streaming giant, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), its  $55 billion valuation means not many could buy it.  But as the likes of  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were to step up, it would be another game-changer for  the fast-moving media space.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, all the deal news spurred some optimism on Wall Street  today and helped prop up the broader market.  But the gains were capped by  a rising dollar and falling oil prices.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 77 to 18,223.  Had been up 130 points at one point.  NASDAQ gained 52.   S&amp;P 500 up 10.  </p><p>HERERA:  A Federal Reserve official said today very low interest rates will  likely be the norm for the next two or three years.  St.  Louis President  James Bullard, a voting member of the Central Banks policy setting  committee reiterated his view that only one more interest rate hike is  necessary before holding steady.  Bullard said he thinks the path of rate  rises should be so slow as to be imperceptible.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  The Dow component Visa (NYSE:V) reported a sharp rise in profits  as customers spent more using its network.  The world's largest payments  operator was also helped by its acquisition of Visa (NYSE:V) Europe.  U.S.  accounted for 41 percent of total payments, Europe about 25 percent.  Visa  (NYSE:V) earned 78 cents a share, that's 5 cents above estimates.  Revenues  climbed 19 percent from a year ago to $4.2 billion.  That was also above  expectations.  </p><p>The stock, volatile in after-hours trading and as Aditi Roy explains, that  may have something to do with the company's outlook.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  While Visa (NYSE:V) beat  expectations on the top and bottom lines, its forward-looking guidance for  the coming fiscal year came in weak.  The company projecting net revenue  growth for fiscal year 2017 at 16 to 18 percent.  That's lower than street  expectations of 20 percent.  Its projected EPS growth for the coming fiscal  year is in the mid-teens.  That number also missing expectations with the  street looking for 19 percent growth.  </p><p>The report coming on the heels of the company's announcement last week that  CEO Charles Scharf will be stepping down and board member and former AmEx  president, Al Kelly, will be taking over.  </p><p>The latest earnings also reflecting the company's acquisition of Visa  (NYSE:V) Europe earlier this summer.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, blurring the lines.  Big tech is circling telecom.   The telecom is fighting back.  And these powerful industries may never be  the same.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  With its proposed bid for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), it is clear  that the boundaries between technology, telecom and media are not as  defined as they once were.  </p><p>Deirdre Bosa explains.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With AT&amp;T's bid for  Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), a new wave of media change may have just begun.   And the line between media, telecom and tech is becoming blurred.  </p><p>RICHARD GREENFIELD, BTIG MEDIA AND TECH ANALYST:  I think the reality is,  as we shift to an on-demand world, without commercials, as we move to a  mobile-first environment, the media industry -- the legacy media industry,  meaning the cable network product that kind of has been the basis for all  of the media stocks, is very challenging.  </p><p>BOSA:  And the big shift is a big advantage for tech companies.  Just last  week, YouTube CEO telling the audience at the \"Vanity Fair\" summit that  YouTube sees itself as a platform for next generation TV.  </p><p>SUSAN WOJCICKI, YOUTUBE CEO:  I think the question is whether you define TV  as the content or the platform, right?  Back to your original question.   And I think the content is going over time is going to morph more to an  online type of platform, similar to YouTube, where content is available,  you know, on demand, global, and interactive.  </p><p>And so, when we think about YouTube, we think about being a platform for  the next generation of media companies, and traditional media companies,  too.  </p><p>BOSA:  And that makes traditional media companies nervous.  It's not just  YouTube and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) but also Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with its own  original content and distribution channels, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV and  Facebook's push into video.  Big tech is starting to look a lot like media.  </p><p>It's also encroaching on telecom's bread and butter distribution business,  from financing their own undersea cable to satisfy bandwidth needs to  offering ultra high speed Internet as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) fiber already  does in nine cities.  </p><p>With tech, telecom and media now playing in the same sand box, they may  start competing for the same assets.  The AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) Time Warner  (NYSE:TWX) deal reportedly came together quickly as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  others were circling.  In a consolidating media landscape, the tech giants  will continue to play a major role.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Deirdre Bosa, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) cuts its outlook after a disappointing  quarter and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The consumer products company missed analysts' estimates for profits and  revenue, citing currency headwinds and competitive environment.  The maker  of Kleenex Tissues and Huggies Diapers lowered its earnings forecast for  the year.  Shares finished the day down nearly 5 percent to $113.91.  </p><p>T-Mobile posted higher than expected profit, thanks in part to an increase  in customers.  The wireless carrier is optimistic that momentum will  continue, saying it expects to add more customers this year than it  previously forecast.  The shares popped almost 10 percent to $51.19.  </p><p>Restaurant Brands topped profit expectations as the owner of Burger King  benefited from higher sales in some foreign markets.  But the company's  same-store sales grew at a slower cliff than last year due to sluggish  demand in the U.S. and Canada.  Shares off nearly 5 percent to $44.67.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  VF Corp posted worse than expected revenue as weak demand in the  apparel retailer's denim division hurt results.  The owner of the North  Face and Wrangler brands did report a higher profit but still, the company  cut its guidance for the year.  But VF did raise its quarterly dividend on  this day, nearly 14 percent to 42 currents a share.  Nonetheless, shares  down more than 2 percent at $53.07.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said the steep drop in the pound sterling following  Britain's vote to leave the European Union has prompted the company to  raise prices for its software and cloud services in that country.  Starting  January 1st, business customers can expect to see a price hike of 13  percent for Enterprise software and an increase of 22 percent for  Enterprise cloud services.  Shares were up 2 percent on the day at $61  even.  </p><p>Shares of the restaurant chain, Sonic (NASDAQ:SONC), took a hit after hours  following a down beat earnings outlook for the year.  The company also said  profit and revenue were hurt in its latest quarter, because of, quote,  \"slowing consumer trends\".  Shares initially fell 10 percent, following the  after the bell news, but finished the regular session up more than 1  percent to $26.49.  </p><p>HERERA:  A lot of money has been pouring into passive investments like  mutual funds and ETFs.  It's a trend that we have been reporting on.  But  ETFs or exchange traded funds are multiplying like crazy.  </p><p>And as Mike Santoli reports, not all of them are created equal.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Exchange-traded funds  are a bit like the smartphone apps of the investing world.  They're  remarkably cheap and useful, new ones pop up each day to fit every narrow  interest and there are far too many.  </p><p>Because they offer efficient exposure to stock and bond markets at low  costs, ETFs are one of the hottest growth areas in financial services.   There are some 1,700 ETFs controlling about $2.4 trillion in assets.   Still, the market is dominated by a handful of very broad funds.  The ten  largest ETFs, including State Street's S&amp;P 500 Trust, and the Vanguard  Total Market ETF command a more than a quarter of all ETF assets.  </p><p>This is driven fund companies to push a variety of gimmicky or highly  complex ETFs to appeal to niche interests.  Among such offerings, an ETF to  play the whiskey industry, one for the drone economy and others for most  every agricultural commodity.  </p><p>The success rate of new ETFs is pretty low.  More than half of all listed  funds have less than $100 million in assets, a common threshold for  determining a fund's viability.  And one website that tracks what it calls  an ETF death watch now lists more than 400 funds vulnerable to closure  based on size and trading activity.  </p><p>One promising area within ETFs is known as smart beta or funds pursuing  automated stock selection strategy or feature some investing factor meant  to outperform the broad market.  This could be cheap stocks or momentum  stocks or those with some other trades.  These are crowding out traditional  higher cost mutual funds run by human portfolio managers.  </p><p>All this innovation in downward pressure on costs ultimately can work to  the benefit of small investors who can use ETFs to construct a low fee, tax  efficient portfolio.  But as with the surplus of phone apps, it's important  to avoid the frivolous or costly ones.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli at the New York Stock  Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up, auto reliability.  The American automaker that just  broke a 35-year losing streak for domestic brands.  See if you can guess  which one.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Here's a look at what to watch tomorrow.  Seven Dow components  report earnings, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), 3M (NYSE:MMM), Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and Merck (NYSE:MRK), among others.  The future of digital  payments and financial services will be the focus of the Money 20/20 event.   And we'll get a read on home prices with the release of the S&amp;P Case- Shiller Home Price Index and that's what to watch Tuesday.  </p><p>HERERA:  The White House today confirmed that health care premiums will go  up sharply next year for insurance sold through healthcare.gov.  Before  subsidies, premiums for a mid-level plan will increase on average 25  percent.  The administration says that the subsidies will help offset that  price increase, but it comes as a number of insurers have pulled back from  offering plans in the federal market.  Open enrollment starts November 1st.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, today brought a surprise in the rankings of car brand  reliability.  The latest report on that shows a Japanese brand stumbling  while a domestic brand has jumped to near the top of the list.  In fact,  for the first time ever, \"Consumer Reports\" puts a domestic brand among the  three most reliable auto brands in the U.S. </p><p>Phil LeBeau reports.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  They're not the  flashiest models for sale, but Buicks are turning heads, especially after  the latest report on auto reliability by \"Consumer Reports\" which ranks  Buick as the third most reliable brand behind Lexus and Toyota (NYSE:TM).  </p><p>JAKE FISHER, CONSUMER REPORTS:  If you look at the top three, it's Toyota  (NYSE:TM) and Lexus, no surprise there, conservative companies that have a  real good reputation of putting out reliable vehicles.  But above any of  the other Japanese automakers, above Honda, above Subaru, we see Buick.   That is a big deal.  .  </p><p>LEBEAU:  While Buicks are getting better, according to \"Consumer Reports\",  Hondas are not as reliable.  In fact, the latest version of the Civic, one  of the most popular cars in America, dropped in the survey due to problems  with the power train and infotainment system.  Honda says it respects the  survey results and is working to enhance the usability and functionality of  its vehicles.</p><p>Meanwhile, issues with the falcon wing doors in the new Tesla Model X are  one reason \"Consumer Reports\" ranks it as the least reliable luxury midsize  SUV.  But the brands with the poorest rankings are Ram, Fiat and Chrysler.  </p><p>FISHER:  FiatChrysler really continues to stumble.  The platforms that  they have for Fiat have not proven reliable.  </p><p>LEBEAU:  FiatChrysler says despite the survey results, the company's own  internal measurements continue to show positive growth toward vehicle  quality.  </p><p>This survey is based on \"Consumer Reports\" subscribers critiquing the cars,  trucks and SUVs they own.  Their most common complaint, the infotainment  systems in these cars are not always working as they should be. </p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm  Sue Herera.  Thanks for watching.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And thanks from me, as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great  evening, everybody.  And we'll see you here tomorrow night.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

AT&amp;T  (NYSE:T) proposes to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) for $86 billion.  But will  the proposal end in wedded bliss?  Why Washington may stand in the way.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Deal frenzy.  From media  to aerospace to discount brokerages, why a flurry of mega deals is  happening now.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  In the fast lane.  The automaker, American automaker, that did  something no other domestic carmaker has done in more than three decades.  </p><p> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday,  October 24th.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone.  </p><p> Neither one of these two are strangers to big deals.  AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and  Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) themselves, the products of audacious deal-making  now plan to hook up in an $86 billion merger.  It's one of the biggest of  all-time.  The deal would put together the nation's second-largest wireless  carrier, a corporate descendent of the great Ma Bell with one of the most  prominent media companies of them all, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), which traces  its roots to Henry Luce and Jack Warner, literally invented the news  magazine and introduced the first talking picture. </p><p> We told you Friday the deal was close and this weekend, it became official.   The combination creates a massive media and distribution company.  The CEOs  predictably think it's the next big thing -- an irresistible force,  combining content, innovation, speed and mobility.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RANDALL STEPHENSON, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  The world of  distribution and content is converging, and we need to move fast, and if we  want to do something truly unique, begin to curate content differently,  begin to format content differently for these mobile environments, this is  all about mobility.  </p><p> JEFF BEWKES, TIME WARNER CEO:  We realize that if we had ourselves together  that we could create more innovations for consumers so they could have more  choices of package.  They're going to end up with more competition,  therefore lower prices.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MATHISEN:  But both stocks fell in trading today as investors realize that  closing the deal won't be easy, and, in fact, faces an uphill climb,  especially in Washington.  </p><p> HERERA:  Speaking of which, politicians from both sides of the aisle are  raising questions about the proposed deal.  This weekend, Donald Trump  vowed to block it.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  As an example of the power  structure I'm fighting, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is buying Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), and  thus, CNN, a deal we will not approve, in my administration, because it's  too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  He wasn't the only one.  When asked on \"Meet the Press,\"  Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine said he has some  questions.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TIM KAINE (D), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Generally, pro-competition and  less concentration, I think, is generally helpful, especially in the media.   But this is just announced, and I haven't had a chance to dig into the  details.  But those are the kinds of questions we need to be asking.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  And Senator Bernie Sanders said simply, \"Washington needs to kill  it.\" </p><p> Eamon Javers is in Washington with more on the challenges this deal faces.  </p><p> Eamon, we heard about from Mr. Trump, from Mr. Kaine.  What about from  Hillary Clinton herself?  Has she said anything?  </p><p> EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Sue.  That's the  linchpin to this whole thing.  Hillary Clinton, perhaps true to form, has  been a little bit more cautious about where she stands on this deal.  Her  campaign did release a sort of generic statement, saying that the deal has  to be examined.  But she hasn't come out and said one way or the other  whether she favors this deal.  And given the polls and the presidential  race right now, a lot of people are thinking this might land on the desk of  an incoming Clinton administration early next year.  </p><p> So, it will be up to the Clinton folks what they want to do with it, if she  wins this election.  So, a lot of eyes now focused on her, if that Bernie  Sanders comment and that Donald Trump comment sort of box her in  politically and force her to come out one way or the other on this deal.   So far, she hasn't planted her flag yet.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  It's interesting, Eamon.  Usually when antitrust cases come into  play, it's two airlines merging to become one really big airline.  This  isn't that.  What's the next step then in the Washington process?  </p><p> JAVERS:  Well, in terms of process, we're going to see a filing in the SEC  this week, and we'll expect to learn a little bit more about the deal and  where it goes from here.  But we're also going to see filings with  Department of Justice eventually, and then, ultimately in November, we're  going to see hearings up on Capitol Hill as the Senate antitrust  subcommittee holds hearings designed to provide a public platform here for  the -- both the companies that are trying to do this deal and their critics  to air their grievances about the deal and whether they think it will take  out too much competition.  </p><p> The companies have been saying, look, this is a vertical merger.  It's not  a merger of competitors like we have seen in other deals.  So, therefore,  it should escape much regulatory scrutiny as a result of that.  </p><p> I'm not so sure that's the case.  The populist mood out there in the  country that's been driving this entire election cycle that we've been  covering doesn't make it a natural fit for a massive $86 billion merger  here in Washington.  </p><p> HERERA:  Indeed.  Eamon, thank you very much.  Eamon Javers in Washington.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And another big deal.  This one in the global aerospace sector.  </p><p> We'll bring together two of the biggest suppliers to plane-makers.   Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) will acquire B/E Aerospace for about $6.5  billion, making this the biggest deal in Rockwell's history.  Rockwell  Collins' CEO said the combination gives it a new path for growth and will  let it develop supplies for a so-called smart airplane.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KELLY ORTBERG, ROCKWELL COLLINS CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  We are currently providing  broadband systems onto the airplane to communicate with the ground, onboard  secure firewalls for cyber security, networks on the aircraft, and in the  future, all of the cabin systems are going to be nodes on that network.   And that's the thesis here is that we'll be able to bring that networking  technology to the products that B/E brings to our portfolio.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Shares went in different directions.  B/E Aerospace took off of  16 percent.  Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) fell more than 2.5 percent.  </p><p> HERERA:  And yet another deal.  TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) will buy rival  Scottrade Financial Services for about $4 billion.  That acquisition  combines the two largest online brokerages and comes at a time when the  industry is facing pressure from lower trading volumes and sluggish revenue  growth.  And TD Ameritrade's CEO says his company has a strategy to gain  the trust of younger investors.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TIM HOCKEY, TD AMERITRADE CEO:  We're also investing in even more cutting- edge technologies, whether it be using Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo, for  example, to be able to talk to TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD).  So, we think  we'll be well-positioned to service the millennial client of the future.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  Shares of TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) fell about 4 percent in  today's session.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Today's deals don't stop there.  Genworth Financial (NYSE:GNW),  which provides mortgage and long-term care insurance, has agreed to sell  itself to a Chinese investment firm called China Oceanwide Holdings.  The  deal valued at $2.5 billion, and comes as Genworth copes with continued low  interest rates and rising costs.  Shares of Genworth fell on the news.   Analysts say the low premium to Friday's closing prices reflects Genworth's  gloomy business outlook.  </p><p> HERERA:  Yet another Chinese conglomerate is going to buy a 25 percent  stake in hotel operator Hilton Worldwide.  HNA Group will pay $6.5 billion  for its portion of the company, which is fine from private equity firm  Blackstone.  That deal comes as Hilton plans to split into three entities  later this year, and it's the latest move into American real estate assets  by a Chinese firm.  Shares of Hilton rose just a fraction.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And so, from media and telecom, to aerospace, to discount  brokerages and more, companies across many different industries are buying,  selling and merging.  In recent weeks alone, nearly $240 billion in deals.  </p><p> And here to discuss why is one of America's most respected deal-makers,  Robert __.  He's chairman of the global M&amp;A practice at the law firm, Jones  Day.  </p><p> Excuse me, Mr. Profusek.  Welcome.  </p><p> Why are these deals happening now?  </p><p> ROBERT PROFUSEK, JONES DAY, HEAD OF M&amp;A PRACTICE:  Well, why not?  One of  the things -- one of the things when you went through the list, you're  going to look for a sort of common thread.  Well, certainly, it's not an  industry common thread.  There has been a little bit of a backup in M&amp;A in  August and September, a little bit.  But there's still plenty of big deals  being done.  </p><p> And one of the things is the market got a little bit lumpy.  Everybody has  their own theory as to why that is.  The election, discussion of what the  Feds are going to do, uncertainty.  But, you know, what today proves or  this weekend proves is still a very strong market.  Particularly driven by  low-cost to capital, and frankly a, tepid growth rate that makes you think  you need to buy in order to grow.  </p><p> HERERA:  Yes, I hear you're saying perhaps the market has a little more  clarity on the political side of things.  But the higher interest rate  scenario.  I mean, the Fed is probably only going to raise interest rates  once this year and not by very much.  How big a factor is that in the move  to merge now?  </p><p> PROFUSEK:  It's -- there's never one single factor.  It's probably a  factor.  But if you're looking at something very large, and there's maybe a  30 basis points swing in rates, you know, now rather than later is probably  a good idea.  </p><p> Nothing is driven by a single factor.  It's wrong when, you know, you've  got to search out the headlines.  But it's a combination of things.  I do  think the election and the uncertainty about exactly what all of us are  going to -- result from that, that had a negative effect, just like it did  on the stock market.  And now that it looks more certain, less of an  effect.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Yes, I was going to say, implicit in that is what I sense is  your view that it isn't as uncertain as it once was.  Let's talk a little  bit quickly about that idea of not being able to create sort of organic  growth, but having to go and acquire it.  </p><p> Is that what's happening here? </p><p> PROFUSEK:  Well, when you -- when you're organic growth rate, your GDP  growth rate is in the 150 to 200-basis-point rate, that doesn't support a  very high stock price.  </p><p> So, one of the things that is common among all of these deals from this  weekend is they're strategic.  Sure, people criticize big deals that it's  just empire building.  I don't think so.  When you think about each of  these deals, it had a very strategic purpose behind it.  </p><p> So, it isn't about getting better.  It's about getting bigger.  It's about  getting better.  And synergizing and getting a greater earnings growth than  you can in revenue.  </p><p> HERERA:  What kind of a year do you think it's going to end up to be?   Obviously, the Time Warner (NYSE:TWX)/AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) deal is huge,  certainly, but is it going to be a -- an up year compared to last year, do  you think?  </p><p> PROFUSEK:  Well, it's hard for -- last year was over $4 trillion.  That's  probably not going to be seen again for some time.  But it's going to be  just as good as 2014 that we all thought was a very good year.  So, you  know, year over year comparisons are a little bit negative but that's  because they're being compared to an astonishing year.  </p><p> I still think, as long as money is cheap, there's going to be plenty of  deals.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Very quickly, if you might, sir.  Do you see on the face of it  any antitrust issues with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T)/Time Warner (NYSE:TWX)?  </p><p> PROFUSEK:  Well, it is a different deal.  Not horizontal as was said  earlier.  It's vertical.  But obviously, we're in a political environment.   So, it will be looked at.  The analogous deal, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)  (NYSE:CCS) took a year to get done.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Robert, thank you very much.</p><p> HERERA:  Good point.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Robert Profusek with Jones Day.</p><p> HERERA:  And as a pace of merger and acquisition activity picks up, who  might be next, especially in the fast consolidating media and  communications industry?  </p><p> Julia Boorstin takes a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The end of  traditional TV is getting closer, and media companies are scrambling to  position themselves for the world where customers get exactly what they  want on their mobile devices.  We could see other distributors, such as  Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Charter, follow AT&amp;T's lead.  </p><p> RANDALL STEPHENSON, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  To the extent that our  strategy succeeds, I think other companies will try to look like us.  And  if our strategy doesn't succeed, other companies won't bother, right?  So,  I think it's a function of how well we do together and pulling the strategy  off.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  Tech companies, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), could be buyers as they all put together more video  offerings.  And for content creators, this deal creates more pressure to  consolidate for negotiating power with distributors.  </p><p> JAMES DIX, WEDBUSH ANALYST:  If you go across the large cap media sways,  CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Viacom (NYSE:VIA), with common, you know, voting control  already in discussions about a merger, I think this probably slightly  increases the odds of that happening.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  Fox, which made a failed bid to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) a few  years ago, could be looking at other deals.  And smaller media assets, such  as AMC Networks, Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA), Scripps Networks  Interactive (NYSE:SNI) and MSG Networks, whose channels at risk of being  excluded from skinny bundles, could be snapped up.  </p><p> But analysts warn that prices would need to come down first.  </p><p> TODD JUENGER, BERNSTEIN ANALYST:  I'm not sure that there's many Silicon  Valley companies who want to pay a multiple on the affiliate model that  basically they think they're destroying.  They might want some content, but  that's different than buying television networks.  So, if the buyers  emerge, I'm sure we'll have some willing sellers.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  And when it comes to streaming giant, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), its  $55 billion valuation means not many could buy it.  But as the likes of  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were to step up, it would be another game-changer for  the fast-moving media space.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, all the deal news spurred some optimism on Wall Street  today and helped prop up the broader market.  But the gains were capped by  a rising dollar and falling oil prices.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 77 to 18,223.  Had been up 130 points at one point.  NASDAQ gained 52.   S&amp;P 500 up 10.  </p><p> HERERA:  A Federal Reserve official said today very low interest rates will  likely be the norm for the next two or three years.  St.  Louis President  James Bullard, a voting member of the Central Banks policy setting  committee reiterated his view that only one more interest rate hike is  necessary before holding steady.  Bullard said he thinks the path of rate  rises should be so slow as to be imperceptible.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  The Dow component Visa (NYSE:V) reported a sharp rise in profits  as customers spent more using its network.  The world's largest payments  operator was also helped by its acquisition of Visa (NYSE:V) Europe.  U.S.  accounted for 41 percent of total payments, Europe about 25 percent.  Visa  (NYSE:V) earned 78 cents a share, that's 5 cents above estimates.  Revenues  climbed 19 percent from a year ago to $4.2 billion.  That was also above  expectations.  </p><p> The stock, volatile in after-hours trading and as Aditi Roy explains, that  may have something to do with the company's outlook.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  While Visa (NYSE:V) beat  expectations on the top and bottom lines, its forward-looking guidance for  the coming fiscal year came in weak.  The company projecting net revenue  growth for fiscal year 2017 at 16 to 18 percent.  That's lower than street  expectations of 20 percent.  Its projected EPS growth for the coming fiscal  year is in the mid-teens.  That number also missing expectations with the  street looking for 19 percent growth.  </p><p> The report coming on the heels of the company's announcement last week that  CEO Charles Scharf will be stepping down and board member and former AmEx  president, Al Kelly, will be taking over.  </p><p> The latest earnings also reflecting the company's acquisition of Visa  (NYSE:V) Europe earlier this summer.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, blurring the lines.  Big tech is circling telecom.   The telecom is fighting back.  And these powerful industries may never be  the same.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  With its proposed bid for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), it is clear  that the boundaries between technology, telecom and media are not as  defined as they once were.  </p><p> Deirdre Bosa explains.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With AT&amp;T's bid for  Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), a new wave of media change may have just begun.   And the line between media, telecom and tech is becoming blurred.  </p><p> RICHARD GREENFIELD, BTIG MEDIA AND TECH ANALYST:  I think the reality is,  as we shift to an on-demand world, without commercials, as we move to a  mobile-first environment, the media industry -- the legacy media industry,  meaning the cable network product that kind of has been the basis for all  of the media stocks, is very challenging.  </p><p> BOSA:  And the big shift is a big advantage for tech companies.  Just last  week, YouTube CEO telling the audience at the \"Vanity Fair\" summit that  YouTube sees itself as a platform for next generation TV.  </p><p> SUSAN WOJCICKI, YOUTUBE CEO:  I think the question is whether you define TV  as the content or the platform, right?  Back to your original question.   And I think the content is going over time is going to morph more to an  online type of platform, similar to YouTube, where content is available,  you know, on demand, global, and interactive.  </p><p> And so, when we think about YouTube, we think about being a platform for  the next generation of media companies, and traditional media companies,  too.  </p><p> BOSA:  And that makes traditional media companies nervous.  It's not just  YouTube and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) but also Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with its own  original content and distribution channels, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV and  Facebook's push into video.  Big tech is starting to look a lot like media.  </p><p> It's also encroaching on telecom's bread and butter distribution business,  from financing their own undersea cable to satisfy bandwidth needs to  offering ultra high speed Internet as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) fiber already  does in nine cities.  </p><p> With tech, telecom and media now playing in the same sand box, they may  start competing for the same assets.  The AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) Time Warner  (NYSE:TWX) deal reportedly came together quickly as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  others were circling.  In a consolidating media landscape, the tech giants  will continue to play a major role.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Deirdre Bosa, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) cuts its outlook after a disappointing  quarter and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The consumer products company missed analysts' estimates for profits and  revenue, citing currency headwinds and competitive environment.  The maker  of Kleenex Tissues and Huggies Diapers lowered its earnings forecast for  the year.  Shares finished the day down nearly 5 percent to $113.91.  </p><p> T-Mobile posted higher than expected profit, thanks in part to an increase  in customers.  The wireless carrier is optimistic that momentum will  continue, saying it expects to add more customers this year than it  previously forecast.  The shares popped almost 10 percent to $51.19.  </p><p> Restaurant Brands topped profit expectations as the owner of Burger King  benefited from higher sales in some foreign markets.  But the company's  same-store sales grew at a slower cliff than last year due to sluggish  demand in the U.S. and Canada.  Shares off nearly 5 percent to $44.67.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  VF Corp posted worse than expected revenue as weak demand in the  apparel retailer's denim division hurt results.  The owner of the North  Face and Wrangler brands did report a higher profit but still, the company  cut its guidance for the year.  But VF did raise its quarterly dividend on  this day, nearly 14 percent to 42 currents a share.  Nonetheless, shares  down more than 2 percent at $53.07.</p><p> Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said the steep drop in the pound sterling following  Britain's vote to leave the European Union has prompted the company to  raise prices for its software and cloud services in that country.  Starting  January 1st, business customers can expect to see a price hike of 13  percent for Enterprise software and an increase of 22 percent for  Enterprise cloud services.  Shares were up 2 percent on the day at $61  even.  </p><p> Shares of the restaurant chain, Sonic (NASDAQ:SONC), took a hit after hours  following a down beat earnings outlook for the year.  The company also said  profit and revenue were hurt in its latest quarter, because of, quote,  \"slowing consumer trends\".  Shares initially fell 10 percent, following the  after the bell news, but finished the regular session up more than 1  percent to $26.49.  </p><p> HERERA:  A lot of money has been pouring into passive investments like  mutual funds and ETFs.  It's a trend that we have been reporting on.  But  ETFs or exchange traded funds are multiplying like crazy.  </p><p> And as Mike Santoli reports, not all of them are created equal.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Exchange-traded funds  are a bit like the smartphone apps of the investing world.  They're  remarkably cheap and useful, new ones pop up each day to fit every narrow  interest and there are far too many.  </p><p> Because they offer efficient exposure to stock and bond markets at low  costs, ETFs are one of the hottest growth areas in financial services.   There are some 1,700 ETFs controlling about $2.4 trillion in assets.   Still, the market is dominated by a handful of very broad funds.  The ten  largest ETFs, including State Street's S&amp;P 500 Trust, and the Vanguard  Total Market ETF command a more than a quarter of all ETF assets.  </p><p> This is driven fund companies to push a variety of gimmicky or highly  complex ETFs to appeal to niche interests.  Among such offerings, an ETF to  play the whiskey industry, one for the drone economy and others for most  every agricultural commodity.  </p><p> The success rate of new ETFs is pretty low.  More than half of all listed  funds have less than $100 million in assets, a common threshold for  determining a fund's viability.  And one website that tracks what it calls  an ETF death watch now lists more than 400 funds vulnerable to closure  based on size and trading activity.  </p><p> One promising area within ETFs is known as smart beta or funds pursuing  automated stock selection strategy or feature some investing factor meant  to outperform the broad market.  This could be cheap stocks or momentum  stocks or those with some other trades.  These are crowding out traditional  higher cost mutual funds run by human portfolio managers.  </p><p> All this innovation in downward pressure on costs ultimately can work to  the benefit of small investors who can use ETFs to construct a low fee, tax  efficient portfolio.  But as with the surplus of phone apps, it's important  to avoid the frivolous or costly ones.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli at the New York Stock  Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Coming up, auto reliability.  The American automaker that just  broke a 35-year losing streak for domestic brands.  See if you can guess  which one.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Here's a look at what to watch tomorrow.  Seven Dow components  report earnings, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), 3M (NYSE:MMM), Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and Merck (NYSE:MRK), among others.  The future of digital  payments and financial services will be the focus of the Money 20/20 event.   And we'll get a read on home prices with the release of the S&amp;P Case- Shiller Home Price Index and that's what to watch Tuesday.  </p><p> HERERA:  The White House today confirmed that health care premiums will go  up sharply next year for insurance sold through healthcare.gov.  Before  subsidies, premiums for a mid-level plan will increase on average 25  percent.  The administration says that the subsidies will help offset that  price increase, but it comes as a number of insurers have pulled back from  offering plans in the federal market.  Open enrollment starts November 1st.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, today brought a surprise in the rankings of car brand  reliability.  The latest report on that shows a Japanese brand stumbling  while a domestic brand has jumped to near the top of the list.  In fact,  for the first time ever, \"Consumer Reports\" puts a domestic brand among the  three most reliable auto brands in the U.S.</p><p> Phil LeBeau reports.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  They're not the  flashiest models for sale, but Buicks are turning heads, especially after  the latest report on auto reliability by \"Consumer Reports\" which ranks  Buick as the third most reliable brand behind Lexus and Toyota (NYSE:TM).  </p><p> JAKE FISHER, CONSUMER REPORTS:  If you look at the top three, it's Toyota  (NYSE:TM) and Lexus, no surprise there, conservative companies that have a  real good reputation of putting out reliable vehicles.  But above any of  the other Japanese automakers, above Honda, above Subaru, we see Buick.   That is a big deal.  .  </p><p> LEBEAU:  While Buicks are getting better, according to \"Consumer Reports\",  Hondas are not as reliable.  In fact, the latest version of the Civic, one  of the most popular cars in America, dropped in the survey due to problems  with the power train and infotainment system.  Honda says it respects the  survey results and is working to enhance the usability and functionality of  its vehicles.</p><p> Meanwhile, issues with the falcon wing doors in the new Tesla Model X are  one reason \"Consumer Reports\" ranks it as the least reliable luxury midsize  SUV.  But the brands with the poorest rankings are Ram, Fiat and Chrysler.  </p><p> FISHER:  Fiat Chrysler really continues to stumble.  The platforms that  they have for Fiat have not proven reliable.  </p><p> LEBEAU:  Fiat Chrysler says despite the survey results, the company's own  internal measurements continue to show positive growth toward vehicle  quality.  </p><p> This survey is based on \"Consumer Reports\" subscribers critiquing the cars,  trucks and SUVs they own.  Their most common complaint, the infotainment  systems in these cars are not always working as they should be. </p><p> Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

The Dow and S&amp;P wipe out the gains for the year as the stock market route  deepens.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Tech tumbles.  The hottest  sector this year is now in a deep freeze with the Nasdaq entering  correction territory.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  Investor whiplash.  What's it going to take to calm the markets?   It's a key question we try to find the answer to.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Wednesday, October the 24th.  </p><p>HERERA:  And good evening, everyone.  Welcome.  </p><p>Stocks were punished today.  A late day selloff intensified sending the Dow  down 600 points.  As we mentioned both the blue chip average and S&amp;P 500  are now negative for the year.  </p><p>Tech stocks were hit the hardest.  The Nasdaq is now 12 percent below its  most recent high, putting its squarely in correction territory.  The index  is having the worst month since November of 2008.  </p><p>So, here is a look at today's damage.  The Dow tanked 608 points to 24,583.   The Nasdaq fell 4 percent, a loss of 329 points.  And the S&amp;P 500 was down  84.  </p><p>Mike Santoli is with us tonight from the New York Stock Exchange to try and  explain the selloff.  </p><p>Good evening, Mike.  And what a day.  </p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It sure was, Sue.  </p><p>You know it's amazing.  Over the course of the month it's been an  accumulation of factors that became very acute in the last couple of days  specifically around big company earnings.  I think investors have been  sensitive to the possibility that earnings growth is going to slow into  next year and getting some evidence from global industrial companies that  maybe that's happening and at the same time I think there is a little bit  of wariness that the Federal Reserve will continue raising rates at a pace  that might feel uncomfortable given the potential for slowing.  </p><p>To me, that all came together with a little bit of an acceleration of  downside momentum today.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And that downside momentum, Mike, has been occurring as we re- test recent lows.  We blew through yesterday's low today and that's when  the selling really took off late in the afternoon, right.  </p><p>SANTOLI:  Yes, absolutely, Bill.  I mean, it was basically very technically  driven in that sense.  I think a lot of investors, a lot of traders were  saying, OK, if we manage to hold around yesterday's lows, which by the way  were very much in the region of the October 11th lows, which was the low  from earlier this month, then perhaps this is just a more routine pullback  and we can bet on a fourth quarter recovery from here.  </p><p>So, it's obvious we deepened stretched to the downside.  And now, really  not too far above the lows for the indexes from early this year, after that  January and February correction.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Mike Santoli, thank you so much.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, as we mentioned, technology stocks were once the driving  force behind this market rally.  They have been hit hardest this month.   The tech heavy Nasdaq is now down more than 11 percent just since October  1st.  And now, wouldn't you know, the tech giants are starting to report  earnings.  </p><p>First out of the gate, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which investors are hoping  will provide some relief when trading begins tomorrow, because tonight the  company reported better than expected earnings of $1.14 a share when the  market was expected 96 cents.  Revenue in the quarter rose to $29 billion.  </p><p>And the market liked the results.  They sent the stock higher in initial  after-hours trading tonight.  </p><p>HERERA:  And tomorrow, the focus on tech will intensify when Alphabet,  Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all report their results.  </p><p>Josh Lipton gives us a preview on what's on deck.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The information  technology sector including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is down hard from its recent high.  Strategists say  investors tend to sell what has performed best during sharp selloffs and  that's certainly true of tech, which was among the best performing sectors  before this recent pullback.  </p><p>Now, attention turns to the flood of big tech companies about to report  their latest earnings results.  Tomorrow, Microsoft's cloud rivals Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet report, their cloud units bringing ever bigger  chunks of revenue and the competition is fierce.  The cloud market is  expected to surge an estimated 20 percent this year to $175 billion.  </p><p>Also tomorrow, investors will hear from chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).   It's down hard so far this month though not as badly as the broader chip  sector which is on track for its worst month since November 2008.  Some  analysts say there could be pressure ahead for some of tech's big names  like FANG, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  </p><p>BRENT HILL, JEFFERIES:  We don't know what the next year holds.  We do know  things will slow.  You can see that Amazon's growth going from mid-30  percent growth down to low 20s.  I think there is a lot of concern around  large cap cap tech pushing the investment decisions to look at some of  these other names outside of FANG.  </p><p>LIPTON:  On the other hand, what if big tech knocks it out of the park this  week and beats the forecast for this quarter and next?  Perhaps that could  win back tech investors at least in the near term.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, what to make of this tech selloff?  Well, where does the  important sector go from here? </p><p>Joining us tonight, Andy Hargreaves is a senior research analyst at  KeyBanc.</p><p>Andy, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>ANDY HARGREAVES, KEYBANC SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  What's your version of why we see the selloff in the market  leader right now?  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Well, I think you have a combination of factors, right you  have a lot of companies in this space that have significant consumer  exposure and there is a view sew sort of global consumer may be rolling  over.  You have a lot of companies highly valued and you have a lot of  China exposure variation varying degrees and you put all those together and  you get what we're seeing, which is a lot of downside.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, you know, I was also hearing a number of analysts today cite  the worry about tariffs and the trade war and all of that factoring in.   Just as key fundamental reasons for them to take some money out of tech at  this point.  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Yes, I mean, absolutely right.  To the extent that you have  any kind of hardware or consumer exposure that's either a big in market or  big input.  And on both sides, what you're going to see is higher prices.   And that usually drives lower volume.  So, you are going to have issues  throughout any company that's trying to sell something physical.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Are there particular areas of technology that you think are most  vulnerable, whether it's hardware, or software, social media, you know,  whatever happens to be?  What do you think?  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Yes.  I mean you have to look at everything in the context of  valuation, right?  And I think what we see a little bit is a risk off  mentality in which case you want to start looking a little bit more at  companies with a little bit of downside protection as opposed to what's my  upside opportunity.  For me right now, the names we like the most are  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in part because the valuation  really does provide some support.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Are you worried about regulation?  I mean, there is a lot of  talk about that on Capitol Hill as it goes to the social media companies  and the Googles of the world.  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Yes.  Yes.  I'm laughing just because yes, anytime politicians  --  </p><p>HERERA:  I wondered why you were laughing.  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Any time politicians get involved, I start to get worried.  I  think at least with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in  particular, it's been such a prominent issue already.  I think we have  priced in a lot of that risk.  And for them to solve the issues that they  are trying to solve I think is going to take many, many years.  So, it's  not something I view as a near-term issue.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we will be looking at that possibility of regulation of  those companies coming up in a little bit here on the program.  </p><p>Andy Hargreaves from KeyBanc, thanks for joining us tonight.  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Yes, thanks again.</p><p>HERERA:  So, given the rock stretch for the market, what will it take for a  sense of calm to return to Wall Street?  </p><p>Bob Pisani tries to answer that one.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Strong earning may not  be enough to calm the market until the higher yields is resolved.  So far,  80 percent of the companies are beating earnings.  Earnings growth is 22  percent, terrific.  It's expected to continue into the fourth quarter.</p><p>But it's not helping because the markets shifted to rates and slowing  growth in China -- macro issues.  The main risk is rising rates on the back  of strong U.S. economic data.  Therefore, the market will calm down.</p><p>If the market believes first ten-year yields are not rising too much more,  say 3.5 percent, and second that the Federal Reserve is not looking to  raise rates as aggressively as some traders believe.  In other words,  taking out the words accommodative from their policy statements, it doesn't  mean the Fed is going to keep hiking for years.  They'll certainly not  accelerate their gradual path to rate hikes.  The market needs to believe  that.  It doesn't right now.  </p><p>The market bulls are pushing back on this whole interpretation.  They're  arguing that beyond the housing market, these modestly high rates we see  are not a huge drag on the U.S. economy.  We have already seen attempts to  buy beaten up housing stocks, for example, in the last few days.  </p><p>Now, rates are rising but financial conditions are not tight, meaning  mortgage rights might be going up but they are still far from being  abnormally high.  And the economy remains strong, but it's not yet  overheating.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  As with every selloff, there is usually a bright spot.  And  today, that bright spot was Boeing (NYSE:BA).  The Dow component blew past  profit and revenue estimates and the company said that things are looking  pretty good right now.  That sent the stock up more than 1 percent on this  otherwise ugly down day.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau has the details for us tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I there are any  concerns about the global economy slowing down, they were not exhibited in  Boeing's third quarter results.  The company beat the street on both the  top and the bottom line, with free cash flow coming in at $4.1 billion.  In  terms Boeing's outlook, there is plenty of optimism.  </p><p>The company has raised its full year earnings and revenue guidance.  Its  commercial airplane division is improving deliveries and expects to improve  through the end of the year.  And it's not seeing a slowdown in China.  The  trade tensions from people wondering if we start to see fewer orders from  China.  But Boeing (NYSE:BA) executives say they are not seeing that so  far.  </p><p>The bottom line is this -- Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported a much better than  expected result for the third quarter.  And that optimism is also reflected  in its fourth quarter and full-year guidance.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And another bright spot late today was Visa (NYSE:V).  The Dow  component topped earnings estimates thanks to increase in total purchases  made by people using their visa cards.  The world's largest payments  network said it benefitted from higher credit card and debit card spending,  as well as job growth and lower taxes.  </p><p>And that sent the stock higher in initial after hours trading.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>And we begin with Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) upgraded to outperform from  market perform at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).  The analyst expects the bank to  increase its financial targets in January, price target $60, shares though  fell along with the broader market today to $43.49.  </p><p>Lululemon was upgraded to buy from hold at Canaccord.  The analyst cited  the company's product development and international expansion.  Price  target now $160.  Nonetheless the stock fell 2 percent to $134.29.  </p><p>And Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) was downgraded to hold from buy at Stifel  Nicholas.  The analyst cited the stock's recent strength.  Price target:  $49.  The stock dropped about 2 percent to $87.06.  </p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, mixed messages is the market saying one thing to  investors and the economy saying another?  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  New home sales for September fell for a fourth straight month to a  two-year low.  That decline of 5.5 percent adds to the recent spate of weak  reads on real estate.  As we have been reporting rising prices and mortgage  rates have decreased affordability for some buyers and economists say that  is reducing housing demand.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  President Trump has stepped up his criticism of the Fed's  monetary policy.  During an interview with the \"Wall Street Journal\", Mr.  Trump said the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's stance on rate increases  threatens economic growth.  The president added that while it's too early  to say, he may have regretted nominating Powell to the Central Bank.  The  Central Bank has hiked the benchmark rate three times this year and another  increase is expected in December.  </p><p>HERERA:  In the meantime, the Fed's Beige Book released today describes the  U.S. economy as growing modestly to moderately.  The Central Bank's  anecdotal snap shot of economic activity showed that businesses are  experiencing labor shortage.  They're also starting to notice the impact of  the trade war with China and simmering tensions with other trading  partners.  And factories say they are raising prices because of tariffs.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, the president of the Cleveland Fed said today that she is  not adjusting her policy stance because of the drop in the stock market.   Loretta Masters said that the economy is strong, the labor market is solid  and there's no sign of a recession any time soon.  </p><p>But as Steve Liesman reports now, it's exactly this split between the  declining stock market and the rising economy that investors are struggling  with.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The recent selloff  has feature add role reversal.  Normally, optimistic investors grown  worried about the outlook than the usually pessimistic economists.  The  list of what worries the market bear includes President Trump's tariffs,  higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve and the effect of those on  sectors like housing and autos.  </p><p>Also on the list, slower global growth, higher oil prices and lower  guidance from some companies.  It's all amounted to a three-week selloff  which shaved about 500 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  </p><p>But those same earnings are seen as positive by economists.  Estimates are  for 25 percent tax cut fueled earnings in this quarter compared to last  year.  That's the third quarter in a row above 20 percent.  Overall, U.S.  growth is also running a percentage point above trend and the unemployment  rate is 3.7 percent, the lowest since 1969 and most believe headed lower.   Inflation at just over 2 percent is mostly tame.  </p><p>Both sides agree the economy and earnings will slow from here.  But they  debate how much.  </p><p>DAVID BIANCO, DWS GROUP:  We expect S&amp;P earnings growth will slow from 25  percent growth to 2018 to 5 percent growth in 2009, and the reason for the  slowdown is one going back toward a more normal earnings growth rate for  S&amp;P, 5 to 7 percent.  But also we think earnings growth is going to be  challenged by tariffs, stronger dollar and the curbed oil prices.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  The bull case though sees above trend growth continuing, in part  because of higher spending on capital goods by companies motivated by the  tax cuts.  </p><p>HOWARD WARD, GABELLI FUNDS:  The capital spending thing is big.  Cap  spending now is growing at 8 percent.  So this is what's going to drive  increased productivity, and as you know you have to have the greater  productivity to get the growth rate of GDP up.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  No one is locked into their current position.  If the economy  keeps running strong, well, bears could be bulls, and if it weakens, bulls  could once again be bears.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Chinese and American businesses are trying to figure out how to  minimize the effects of the trade war.  </p><p>Eunice Yoon has more on the trading relationship between the world's two  largest economies.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I met China's most  prominent export fair.  The Canton Fair in the manufacturing hub of  Guangzhou is where buyers from the U.S. and other parts of the world  connect with Chinese manufacturers of consumer products.  The fair has been  going on for decades, but this year, because of the trade war, people are  nervous.  </p><p>The discussion is mainly how to minimize the impact of President Trump  tariffs.  One buyer told me he worked on a deal to sell frying pans without  a gift box because the box is subject to a 10 percent tariff.  </p><p>Second point, a lot of companies are still dependent on China and cannot  uproot their supply chain as easily as one might think.  </p><p>This is one American buyer here told me.  </p><p>RANDALL DAVIDSON, U.S. BUYER:  These are robust supply chains.  Not just  the factories but the printers supporting the factories, the other  suppliers and subcontractors that support the factories, trucking,  shipping, all of that has been developing for three decades.  </p><p>So, I don't see a wholesale move out of China.  But certainly, everyone is  looking at other options.  </p><p>YOON:  But what I found most surprising is how Chinese manufacturers are  giving non-American buyers better deals.  The Chinese suppliers are worried  because of the trade war.  One Indian buyer said he's been surprised at the  lower prices the Chinese are offering.  </p><p>So, while the non-American buyers are being cut better deals, American  buyers are still working out how to deal with the extra costs.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon, in Guangzhou.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And in fact, trade war concerns overshadowed profit gains at  UPS.  And that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The delivery company reported disappointing international results which UPS  says was caused by slowing economic activity resulting from changing trade  policies.  The CEO did say, though, he expects overseas operating profits  to rebound in the fourth quarter during the holidays.  UPS shares fell 5.5  percent to $107.93 today.  </p><p>Boy, it was a tough quarter for AT&amp;T (NYSE:T).  The company lost more  satellite TV customers than expected during the summer.  And it's over the  top streaming video services added fewer subscribers compared to the same  period a year ago.  And that caused its profits to miss analyst estimates  and the stock punished, down 8 percent to $30.36.  </p><p>Meanwhile revenue at General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) fell short of expectations.   And investors appeared concerned about lower business jet deliveries.  When  asked about business with Saudi Arabia, the CEO on the earnings conference  call said there has been no indication yet that it's $10 billion sale of  armored vehicle has been affected by the controversy surrounding the death  of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  Shares of General Dynamics (NYSE:GD),  though, fell by 7 percent to $173.24.  </p><p>HERERA:  Rival Northup Grumman topped expectations saying a recent  acquisition and strength in the aerospace systems and mission systems units  helped results.  The company also hiked its earnings guidance for the year  but left sales forecast unchanged.  Shares fell 6 percent to $285.86.  </p><p>After the bell, Ford reported earnings that beat analyst estimates by a  penny.  Revenue was also stronger than expected but the company reported a  lot of weakness in many of its foreign markets.  As a result, Ford says it  does not expect to hit its target of reaching 8 percent profit margins by  2020.  Nonetheless, shares initially rose in after-hours but finished the  regular day down more than 4 percent to $8.18.  </p><p>Also out after the bell, Tesla reported a surprise profit and better than  expected revenue.  Investors have been concerned the electric car maker  would need to raise additional capital.  But the company said it expects  the cash position to remain consistent even as it repays its debt and so,  shares took off in the extended session.  They finished the regular day  down nearly 2 percent to $288.50.  </p><p>And, Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) reported weak revenue and issued  sales guidance below estimates.  The chip maker is facing soft demand from  cryptocurrency miners for its graphic processors.  The stock fell more than  20 percent in initial after hours trading, extending its 9 percent decline  in the regular session.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Coming up, one of Silicon Valley's tech CEOs calls for stricter  data privacy protections.  But could that be a bad thing for shareholders?  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Late today, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) said it is cutting the price of  an anti-cholesterol drug by 60 percent.  That will bring the annual cost of  Repatha down to about $5,800, and it will lower patient co-pays and  barriers erected by insurers that have resulted in disappointing sales to  this point.  Drug companies that make rival anti-cholesterol drugs have  already announced rebates and discounts earlier this year.  </p><p>HERERA:  ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) was sued by the New York attorney general by  misleading investor on climates change.  The suit alleges that the company  did not tell investors about the true risks to the business posed by  climate change regulations.  The lawsuit does not charge the company with  contributing to climate change or was suppressing climate science.  It does  however claim that the former CEO Rex Tillerson was aware of the alleged  fraudulent behavior.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, on a day when extra attention is being paid to the tech  sector, the CEO of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had harsh words for how other  Silicon Valley company manage data they collect.  During a privacy  conference in Brussels today, Tim Cook said personal information has been  weaponized, in his words.  But he stopped short of naming Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) specifically, two of the largest  companies making money by selling ads.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  We shouldn't sugarcoat the consequences.  This is  surveillance.  And these stock piles of personal data serve only to enrich  the companies that collect them.  This should make us very uncomfortable.   It should unsettle us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mr. Cook has long spoken in support of personal privacy and he  often points out that because Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes money selling  devices and not advertisements, it has less of an incentive to exploit  customer data.  </p><p>HERERA:  And Connie Guglielmo joins us more to talk about regulating  consumer data and what it could mean for both the industry and also those  who share -- the share prices of those companies.  She is editor in chief  over at CNET.  </p><p>Connie, good to see you welcome.  </p><p>CONNIE GUGLIELMO, CNET EDITOR-IN-CHIEF:  Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, Mr. Cook has always been outspoken and plain spoken.   And Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has actually been pretty aggressive at guarding its  users' data, correct?  </p><p>GUGLIELMO, CNET EDITOR-IN-CHIEF:  That is correct.  And the point that you  made is well-noted.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes most of its money for sales  of the iPhone.  It's hardware.  It does make money from software and  services but doesn't monetize the use are data it collects as far as we  know.  </p><p>So, it can afford to also take a stand on privacy.  I'm not saying that  it's not serious about it.  Tim Cook is very genuine in how he talks about  the topic.  But its fortunes are tied to the hardware and software  services.  </p><p>GRIFFTH: And it's not just Tim Cook that's talking about this.  Members of  Congress are as well.  They've been holding hearings.  More hearings are  coming as well.  </p><p>The possibility of regulation of how these companies manage their data and  keeping it private, good for consumers, perhaps, but it is bad for  shareholders?  What do you think?</p><p>GUGLIELMO:  Well, it's been a bad year for the tech sector when it comes to  data privacy.  We have the Cambridge Analytica breach at Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), 87 million users were affected by that.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  recently was forced to disclose that users of its Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Plus  social network about 500,000 people were affected by a data breach there.  </p><p>These are very large companies who make most of their money from  advertising and pushing targeted ads.  They need personal data in order to  push their very lucrative targeted ads.  So, from a user perspective, sure,  you want your data to be protected.  You don't want to be the victim of any  kind of identity theft or privacy hack.  Very problematic to try to restore  your good name after it's been stolen.  </p><p>For shareholders, this is how these companies make money.  Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) made about $42 billion in 2017, 98 percent of that was from  ads.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), $110 or so billion dollars, 83, 84 percent from  ads.  So, yes, it's a concern to shareholders, but at the same time, think  about it, if users don't trust your platform, they're not use going.  And  if they're not using, there is nobody to target those ads to.  </p><p>So, there has to be some give here on the side of the tech industry.  </p><p>HERERA:  Before we let you go, do you think there is one company -- let's  put Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) aside because they do different things as you said  they do the hardware -- that is better prepared for regulation that might  be coming their way?  </p><p>GUGLIELMO:  I don't think there is any one company.  I do think you hear  companies talking about this topic.  The CEO of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Satya Nadella, has also echoed what Tim Cook has said and he says privacy  is a fundamental human right.  So, that idea that there should be  protections in place is something that tech executives are starting to talk  about whether they are forced to or not is the question.  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.  Connie thank you very much.  </p><p>GUGLIELMO:  My pleasure.</p><p>HERERA:  Connie Guglielmo with CNET.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And before we go, here's another look at the day's selloff.  It  was a big one.  The Dow tanked by 608 points.  The Nasdaq fell 4 percent, a  loss of 329.  The S&amp;P was down 84.  </p><p>HERERA:  And it's only Wednesday.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes.  </p><p>HERERA:  We'll see you tomorrow.  That does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue  Herera.  </p><p>GIRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Thanks for joining us.  Have a great  evening.  We will see you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The Dow and S&amp;P wipe out the gains for the year as the stock market route deepens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Tech tumbles. The hottest sector this year is now in a deep freeze with the Nasdaq entering correction territory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: Investor whiplash. What`s it going to take to calm the markets? It`s a key question we try to find the answer to.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Wednesday, October the 24th.</p><p>HERERA: And good evening, everyone. Welcome.</p><p>Stocks were punished today. A late day selloff intensified sending the Dow down 600 points. As we mentioned both the blue chip average and S&amp;P 500 are now negative for the year.</p><p>Tech stocks were hit the hardest. The Nasdaq is now 12 percent below its most recent high, putting its squarely in correction territory. The index is having the worst month since November of 2008.</p><p>So, here is a look at today`s damage. The Dow tanked 608 points to 24,583. The Nasdaq fell 4 percent, a loss of 329 points. And the S&amp;P 500 was down 84.</p><p>Mike Santoli is with us tonight from the New York Stock Exchange to try and explain the selloff.</p><p>Good evening, Mike. And what a day.</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It sure was, Sue.</p><p>You know it`s amazing. Over the course of the month it`s been an accumulation of factors that became very acute in the last couple of days specifically around big company earnings. I think investors have been sensitive to the possibility that earnings growth is going to slow into next year and getting some evidence from global industrial companies that maybe that`s happening and at the same time I think there is a little bit of wariness that the Federal Reserve will continue raising rates at a pace that might feel uncomfortable given the potential for slowing.</p><p>To me, that all came together with a little bit of an acceleration of downside momentum today.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And that downside momentum, Mike, has been occurring as we re- test recent lows. We blew through yesterday`s low today and that`s when the selling really took off late in the afternoon, right.</p><p>SANTOLI: Yes, absolutely, Bill. I mean, it was basically very technically driven in that sense. I think a lot of investors, a lot of traders were saying, OK, if we manage to hold around yesterday`s lows, which by the way were very much in the region of the October 11th lows, which was the low from earlier this month, then perhaps this is just a more routine pullback and we can bet on a fourth quarter recovery from here.</p><p>So, it`s obvious we deepened stretched to the downside. And now, really not too far above the lows for the indexes from early this year, after that January and February correction.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Mike Santoli, thank you so much.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, as we mentioned, technology stocks were once the driving force behind this market rally. They have been hit hardest this month. The tech heavy Nasdaq is now down more than 11 percent just since October 1st. And now, wouldn`t you know, the tech giants are starting to report earnings.</p><p>First out of the gate, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which investors are hoping will provide some relief when trading begins tomorrow, because tonight the company reported better than expected earnings of $1.14 a share when the market was expected 96 cents. Revenue in the quarter rose to $29 billion.</p><p>And the market liked the results. They sent the stock higher in initial after-hours trading tonight.</p><p>HERERA: And tomorrow, the focus on tech will intensify when Alphabet, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all report their results.</p><p>Josh Lipton gives us a preview on what`s on deck.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The information technology sector including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is down hard from its recent high. Strategists say investors tend to sell what has performed best during sharp selloffs and that`s certainly true of tech, which was among the best performing sectors before this recent pullback.</p><p>Now, attention turns to the flood of big tech companies about to report their latest earnings results. Tomorrow, Microsoft`s cloud rivals Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet report, their cloud units bringing ever bigger chunks of revenue and the competition is fierce. The cloud market is expected to surge an estimated 20 percent this year to $175 billion.</p><p>Also tomorrow, investors will hear from chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). It`s down hard so far this month though not as badly as the broader chip sector which is on track for its worst month since November 2008. Some analysts say there could be pressure ahead for some of tech`s big names like FANG, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>BRENT HILL, JEFFERIES: We don`t know what the next year holds. We do know things will slow. You can see that Amazon`s growth going from mid-30 percent growth down to low 20s. I think there is a lot of concern around large cap cap tech pushing the investment decisions to look at some of these other names outside of FANG.</p><p>LIPTON: On the other hand, what if big tech knocks it out of the park this week and beats the forecast for this quarter and next? Perhaps that could win back tech investors at least in the near term.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, what to make of this tech selloff? Well, where does the important sector go from here?</p><p>Joining us tonight, Andy Hargreaves is a senior research analyst at KeyBanc.</p><p>Andy, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>ANDY HARGREAVES, KEYBANC SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST: Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: What`s your version of why we see the selloff in the market leader right now?</p><p>HARGREAVES: Well, I think you have a combination of factors, right you have a lot of companies in this space that have significant consumer exposure and there is a view sew sort of global consumer may be rolling over. You have a lot of companies highly valued and you have a lot of China exposure variation varying degrees and you put all those together and you get what we`re seeing, which is a lot of downside.</p><p>HERERA: Well, you know, I was also hearing a number of analysts today cite the worry about tariffs and the trade war and all of that factoring in. Just as key fundamental reasons for them to take some money out of tech at this point.</p><p>HARGREAVES: Yes, I mean, absolutely right. To the extent that you have any kind of hardware or consumer exposure that`s either a big in market or big input. And on both sides, what you`re going to see is higher prices. And that usually drives lower volume. So, you are going to have issues throughout any company that`s trying to sell something physical.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Are there particular areas of technology that you think are most vulnerable, whether it`s hardware, or software, social media, you know, whatever happens to be? What do you think?</p><p>HARGREAVES: Yes. I mean you have to look at everything in the context of valuation, right? And I think what we see a little bit is a risk off mentality in which case you want to start looking a little bit more at companies with a little bit of downside protection as opposed to what`s my upside opportunity. For me right now, the names we like the most are Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in part because the valuation really does provide some support.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Are you worried about regulation? I mean, there is a lot of talk about that on Capitol Hill as it goes to the social media companies and the Googles of the world.</p><p>HARGREAVES: Yes. Yes. I`m laughing just because yes, anytime politicians --</p><p>HERERA: I wondered why you were laughing.</p><p>HARGREAVES: Any time politicians get involved, I start to get worried. I think at least with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in particular, it`s been such a prominent issue already. I think we have priced in a lot of that risk. And for them to solve the issues that they are trying to solve I think is going to take many, many years. So, it`s not something I view as a near-term issue.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we will be looking at that possibility of regulation of those companies coming up in a little bit here on the program.</p><p>Andy Hargreaves from KeyBanc, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>HARGREAVES: Yes, thanks again.</p><p>HERERA: So, given the rock stretch for the market, what will it take for a sense of calm to return to Wall Street?</p><p>Bob Pisani tries to answer that one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Strong earning may not be enough to calm the market until the higher yields is resolved. So far, 80 percent of the companies are beating earnings. Earnings growth is 22 percent, terrific. It`s expected to continue into the fourth quarter.</p><p>But it`s not helping because the markets shifted to rates and slowing growth in China -- macro issues. The main risk is rising rates on the back of strong U.S. economic data. Therefore, the market will calm down.</p><p>If the market believes first ten-year yields are not rising too much more, say 3.5 percent, and second that the Federal Reserve is not looking to raise rates as aggressively as some traders believe. In other words, taking out the words accommodative from their policy statements, it doesn`t mean the Fed is going to keep hiking for years. They`ll certainly not accelerate their gradual path to rate hikes. The market needs to believe that. It doesn`t right now.</p><p>The market bulls are pushing back on this whole interpretation. They`re arguing that beyond the housing market, these modestly high rates we see are not a huge drag on the U.S. economy. We have already seen attempts to buy beaten up housing stocks, for example, in the last few days.</p><p>Now, rates are rising but financial conditions are not tight, meaning mortgage rights might be going up but they are still far from being abnormally high. And the economy remains strong, but it`s not yet overheating.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: As with every selloff, there is usually a bright spot. And today, that bright spot was Boeing (NYSE:BA). The Dow component blew past profit and revenue estimates and the company said that things are looking pretty good right now. That sent the stock up more than 1 percent on this otherwise ugly down day.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has the details for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I there are any concerns about the global economy slowing down, they were not exhibited in Boeing`s third quarter results. The company beat the street on both the top and the bottom line, with free cash flow coming in at $4.1 billion. In terms Boeing`s outlook, there is plenty of optimism.</p><p>The company has raised its full year earnings and revenue guidance. Its commercial airplane division is improving deliveries and expects to improve through the end of the year. And it`s not seeing a slowdown in China. The trade tensions from people wondering if we start to see fewer orders from China. But Boeing (NYSE:BA) executives say they are not seeing that so far.</p><p>The bottom line is this -- Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported a much better than expected result for the third quarter. And that optimism is also reflected in its fourth quarter and full-year guidance.</p><p>Phil LeBeau NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And another bright spot late today was Visa (NYSE:V). The Dow component topped earnings estimates thanks to increase in total purchases made by people using their visa cards. The world`s largest payments network said it benefitted from higher credit card and debit card spending, as well as job growth and lower taxes.</p><p>And that sent the stock higher in initial after hours trading.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to take a look now at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>And we begin with Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) upgraded to outperform from market perform at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). The analyst expects the bank to increase its financial targets in January, price target $60, shares though fell along with the broader market today to $43.49.</p><p>Lululemon was upgraded to buy from hold at Canaccord. The analyst cited the company`s product development and international expansion. Price target now $160. Nonetheless the stock fell 2 percent to $134.29.</p><p>And Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) was downgraded to hold from buy at Stifel Nicholas. The analyst cited the stock`s recent strength. Price target: $49. The stock dropped about 2 percent to $87.06.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, mixed messages is the market saying one thing to investors and the economy saying another?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: New home sales for September fell for a fourth straight month to a two-year low. That decline of 5.5 percent adds to the recent spate of weak reads on real estate. As we have been reporting rising prices and mortgage rates have decreased affordability for some buyers and economists say that is reducing housing demand.</p><p>GRIFFETH: President Trump has stepped up his criticism of the Fed`s monetary policy. During an interview with the \"Wall Street Journal\", Mr. Trump said the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell`s stance on rate increases threatens economic growth. The president added that while it`s too early to say, he may have regretted nominating Powell to the Central Bank. The Central Bank has hiked the benchmark rate three times this year and another increase is expected in December.</p><p>HERERA: In the meantime, the Fed`s Beige Book released today describes the U.S. economy as growing modestly to moderately. The Central Bank`s anecdotal snap shot of economic activity showed that businesses are experiencing labor shortage. They`re also starting to notice the impact of the trade war with China and simmering tensions with other trading partners. And factories say they are raising prices because of tariffs.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, the president of the Cleveland Fed said today that she is not adjusting her policy stance because of the drop in the stock market. Loretta Masters said that the economy is strong, the labor market is solid and there`s no sign of a recession any time soon.</p><p>But as Steve Liesman reports now, it`s exactly this split between the declining stock market and the rising economy that investors are struggling with.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The recent selloff has feature add role reversal. Normally, optimistic investors grown worried about the outlook than the usually pessimistic economists. The list of what worries the market bear includes President Trump`s tariffs, higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve and the effect of those on sectors like housing and autos.</p><p>Also on the list, slower global growth, higher oil prices and lower guidance from some companies. It`s all amounted to a three-week selloff which shaved about 500 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>But those same earnings are seen as positive by economists. Estimates are for 25 percent tax cut fueled earnings in this quarter compared to last year. That`s the third quarter in a row above 20 percent. Overall, U.S. growth is also running a percentage point above trend and the unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, the lowest since 1969 and most believe headed lower. Inflation at just over 2 percent is mostly tame.</p><p>Both sides agree the economy and earnings will slow from here. But they debate how much.</p><p>DAVID BIANCO, DWS GROUP: We expect S&amp;P earnings growth will slow from 25 percent growth to 2018 to 5 percent growth in 2009, and the reason for the slowdown is one going back toward a more normal earnings growth rate for S&amp;P, 5 to 7 percent. But also we think earnings growth is going to be challenged by tariffs, stronger dollar and the curbed oil prices.</p><p>LIESMAN: The bull case though sees above trend growth continuing, in part because of higher spending on capital goods by companies motivated by the tax cuts.</p><p>HOWARD WARD, GABELLI FUNDS: The capital spending thing is big. Cap spending now is growing at 8 percent. So this is what`s going to drive increased productivity, and as you know you have to have the greater productivity to get the growth rate of GDP up.</p><p>LIESMAN: No one is locked into their current position. If the economy keeps running strong, well, bears could be bulls, and if it weakens, bulls could once again be bears.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Chinese and American businesses are trying to figure out how to minimize the effects of the trade war.</p><p>Eunice Yoon has more on the trading relationship between the world`s two largest economies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I met China`s most prominent export fair. The Canton Fair in the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou is where buyers from the U.S. and other parts of the world connect with Chinese manufacturers of consumer products. The fair has been going on for decades, but this year, because of the trade war, people are nervous.</p><p>The discussion is mainly how to minimize the impact of President Trump tariffs. One buyer told me he worked on a deal to sell frying pans without a gift box because the box is subject to a 10 percent tariff.</p><p>Second point, a lot of companies are still dependent on China and cannot uproot their supply chain as easily as one might think.</p><p>This is one American buyer here told me.</p><p>RANDALL DAVIDSON, U.S. BUYER: These are robust supply chains. Not just the factories but the printers supporting the factories, the other suppliers and subcontractors that support the factories, trucking, shipping, all of that has been developing for three decades.</p><p>So, I don`t see a wholesale move out of China. But certainly, everyone is looking at other options.</p><p>YOON: But what I found most surprising is how Chinese manufacturers are giving non-American buyers better deals. The Chinese suppliers are worried because of the trade war. One Indian buyer said he`s been surprised at the lower prices the Chinese are offering.</p><p>So, while the non-American buyers are being cut better deals, American buyers are still working out how to deal with the extra costs.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon, in Guangzhou.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And in fact, trade war concerns overshadowed profit gains at UPS. And that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The delivery company reported disappointing international results which UPS says was caused by slowing economic activity resulting from changing trade policies. The CEO did say, though, he expects overseas operating profits to rebound in the fourth quarter during the holidays. UPS shares fell 5.5 percent to $107.93 today.</p><p>Boy, it was a tough quarter for AT&amp;T (NYSE:T). The company lost more satellite TV customers than expected during the summer. And it`s over the top streaming video services added fewer subscribers compared to the same period a year ago. And that caused its profits to miss analyst estimates and the stock punished, down 8 percent to $30.36.</p><p>Meanwhile revenue at General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) fell short of expectations. And investors appeared concerned about lower business jet deliveries. When asked about business with Saudi Arabia, the CEO on the earnings conference call said there has been no indication yet that it`s $10 billion sale of armored vehicle has been affected by the controversy surrounding the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Shares of General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), though, fell by 7 percent to $173.24.</p><p>HERERA: Rival Northup Grumman topped expectations saying a recent acquisition and strength in the aerospace systems and mission systems units helped results. The company also hiked its earnings guidance for the year but left sales forecast unchanged. Shares fell 6 percent to $285.86.</p><p>After the bell, Ford reported earnings that beat analyst estimates by a penny. Revenue was also stronger than expected but the company reported a lot of weakness in many of its foreign markets. As a result, Ford says it does not expect to hit its target of reaching 8 percent profit margins by 2020. Nonetheless, shares initially rose in after-hours but finished the regular day down more than 4 percent to $8.18.</p><p>Also out after the bell, Tesla reported a surprise profit and better than expected revenue. Investors have been concerned the electric car maker would need to raise additional capital. But the company said it expects the cash position to remain consistent even as it repays its debt and so, shares took off in the extended session. They finished the regular day down nearly 2 percent to $288.50.</p><p>And, Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) reported weak revenue and issued sales guidance below estimates. The chip maker is facing soft demand from cryptocurrency miners for its graphic processors. The stock fell more than 20 percent in initial after hours trading, extending its 9 percent decline in the regular session.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Coming up, one of Silicon Valley`s tech CEOs calls for stricter data privacy protections. But could that be a bad thing for shareholders?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Late today, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) said it is cutting the price of an anti-cholesterol drug by 60 percent. That will bring the annual cost of Repatha down to about $5,800, and it will lower patient co-pays and barriers erected by insurers that have resulted in disappointing sales to this point. Drug companies that make rival anti-cholesterol drugs have already announced rebates and discounts earlier this year.</p><p>HERERA: ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) was sued by the New York attorney general by misleading investor on climates change. The suit alleges that the company did not tell investors about the true risks to the business posed by climate change regulations. The lawsuit does not charge the company with contributing to climate change or was suppressing climate science. It does however claim that the former CEO Rex Tillerson was aware of the alleged fraudulent behavior.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, on a day when extra attention is being paid to the tech sector, the CEO of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had harsh words for how other Silicon Valley company manage data they collect. During a privacy conference in Brussels today, Tim Cook said personal information has been weaponized, in his words. But he stopped short of naming Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) specifically, two of the largest companies making money by selling ads.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO: We shouldn`t sugarcoat the consequences. This is surveillance. And these stock piles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them. This should make us very uncomfortable. It should unsettle us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Mr. Cook has long spoken in support of personal privacy and he often points out that because Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes money selling devices and not advertisements, it has less of an incentive to exploit customer data.</p><p>HERERA: And Connie Guglielmo joins us more to talk about regulating consumer data and what it could mean for both the industry and also those who share -- the share prices of those companies. She is editor in chief over at CNET.</p><p>Connie, good to see you welcome.</p><p>CONNIE GUGLIELMO, CNET EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: You know, Mr. Cook has always been outspoken and plain spoken. And Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has actually been pretty aggressive at guarding its users` data, correct?</p><p>GUGLIELMO, CNET EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: That is correct. And the point that you made is well-noted. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes most of its money for sales of the iPhone. It`s hardware. It does make money from software and services but doesn`t monetize the use are data it collects as far as we know.</p><p>So, it can afford to also take a stand on privacy. I`m not saying that it`s not serious about it. Tim Cook is very genuine in how he talks about the topic. But its fortunes are tied to the hardware and software services.</p><p>GRIFFTH: And it`s not just Tim Cook that`s talking about this. Members of Congress are as well. They`ve been holding hearings. More hearings are coming as well.</p><p>The possibility of regulation of how these companies manage their data and keeping it private, good for consumers, perhaps, but it is bad for shareholders? What do you think?</p><p>GUGLIELMO: Well, it`s been a bad year for the tech sector when it comes to data privacy. We have the Cambridge Analytica breach at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), 87 million users were affected by that. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) recently was forced to disclose that users of its Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Plus social network about 500,000 people were affected by a data breach there.</p><p>These are very large companies who make most of their money from advertising and pushing targeted ads. They need personal data in order to push their very lucrative targeted ads. So, from a user perspective, sure, you want your data to be protected. You don`t want to be the victim of any kind of identity theft or privacy hack. Very problematic to try to restore your good name after it`s been stolen.</p><p>For shareholders, this is how these companies make money. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) made about $42 billion in 2017, 98 percent of that was from ads. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), $110 or so billion dollars, 83, 84 percent from ads. So, yes, it`s a concern to shareholders, but at the same time, think about it, if users don`t trust your platform, they`re not use going. And if they`re not using, there is nobody to target those ads to.</p><p>So, there has to be some give here on the side of the tech industry.</p><p>HERERA: Before we let you go, do you think there is one company -- let`s put Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) aside because they do different things as you said they do the hardware -- that is better prepared for regulation that might be coming their way?</p><p>GUGLIELMO: I don`t think there is any one company. I do think you hear companies talking about this topic. The CEO of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Satya Nadella, has also echoed what Tim Cook has said and he says privacy is a fundamental human right. So, that idea that there should be protections in place is something that tech executives are starting to talk about whether they are forced to or not is the question.</p><p>HERERA: OK. Connie thank you very much.</p><p>GUGLIELMO: My pleasure.</p><p>HERERA: Connie Guglielmo with CNET.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And before we go, here`s another look at the day`s selloff. It was a big one. The Dow tanked by 608 points. The Nasdaq fell 4 percent, a loss of 329. The S&amp;P was down 84.</p><p>HERERA: And it`s only Wednesday.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes.</p><p>HERERA: We`ll see you tomorrow. That does it for us tonight. I`m Sue Herera.</p><p>GIRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Thanks for joining us. Have a great evening. We will see you tomorrow.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The Dow and S&amp;P wipe out the gains for the year as the stock market route  deepens.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Tech tumbles.  The hottest  sector this year is now in a deep freeze with the Nasdaq entering  correction territory.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  Investor whiplash.  What's it going to take to calm the markets?   It's a key question we try to find the answer to.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Wednesday, October the 24th.  </p><p>HERERA:  And good evening, everyone.  Welcome.  </p><p>Stocks were punished today.  A late day selloff intensified sending the Dow  down 600 points.  As we mentioned both the blue chip average and S&amp;P 500  are now negative for the year.  </p><p>Tech stocks were hit the hardest.  The Nasdaq is now 12 percent below its  most recent high, putting its squarely in correction territory.  The index  is having the worst month since November of 2008.  </p><p>So, here is a look at today's damage.  The Dow tanked 608 points to 24,583.   The Nasdaq fell 4 percent, a loss of 329 points.  And the S&amp;P 500 was down  84.  </p><p>Mike Santoli is with us tonight from the New York Stock Exchange to try and  explain the selloff.  </p><p>Good evening, Mike.  And what a day.  </p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It sure was, Sue.  </p><p>You know it's amazing.  Over the course of the month it's been an  accumulation of factors that became very acute in the last couple of days  specifically around big company earnings.  I think investors have been  sensitive to the possibility that earnings growth is going to slow into  next year and getting some evidence from global industrial companies that  maybe that's happening and at the same time I think there is a little bit  of wariness that the Federal Reserve will continue raising rates at a pace  that might feel uncomfortable given the potential for slowing.  </p><p>To me, that all came together with a little bit of an acceleration of  downside momentum today.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And that downside momentum, Mike, has been occurring as we re- test recent lows.  We blew through yesterday's low today and that's when  the selling really took off late in the afternoon, right.  </p><p>SANTOLI:  Yes, absolutely, Bill.  I mean, it was basically very technically  driven in that sense.  I think a lot of investors, a lot of traders were  saying, OK, if we manage to hold around yesterday's lows, which by the way  were very much in the region of the October 11th lows, which was the low  from earlier this month, then perhaps this is just a more routine pullback  and we can bet on a fourth quarter recovery from here.  </p><p>So, it's obvious we deepened stretched to the downside.  And now, really  not too far above the lows for the indexes from early this year, after that  January and February correction.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Mike Santoli, thank you so much.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, as we mentioned, technology stocks were once the driving  force behind this market rally.  They have been hit hardest this month.   The tech heavy Nasdaq is now down more than 11 percent just since October  1st.  And now, wouldn't you know, the tech giants are starting to report  earnings.  </p><p>First out of the gate, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which investors are hoping  will provide some relief when trading begins tomorrow, because tonight the  company reported better than expected earnings of $1.14 a share when the  market was expected 96 cents.  Revenue in the quarter rose to $29 billion.  </p><p>And the market liked the results.  They sent the stock higher in initial  after-hours trading tonight.  </p><p>HERERA:  And tomorrow, the focus on tech will intensify when Alphabet,  Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all report their results.  </p><p>Josh Lipton gives us a preview on what's on deck.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The information  technology sector including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is down hard from its recent high.  Strategists say  investors tend to sell what has performed best during sharp selloffs and  that's certainly true of tech, which was among the best performing sectors  before this recent pullback.  </p><p>Now, attention turns to the flood of big tech companies about to report  their latest earnings results.  Tomorrow, Microsoft's cloud rivals Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet report, their cloud units bringing ever bigger  chunks of revenue and the competition is fierce.  The cloud market is  expected to surge an estimated 20 percent this year to $175 billion.  </p><p>Also tomorrow, investors will hear from chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).   It's down hard so far this month though not as badly as the broader chip  sector which is on track for its worst month since November 2008.  Some  analysts say there could be pressure ahead for some of tech's big names  like FANG, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  </p><p>BRENT HILL, JEFFERIES:  We don't know what the next year holds.  We do know  things will slow.  You can see that Amazon's growth going from mid-30  percent growth down to low 20s.  I think there is a lot of concern around  large cap cap tech pushing the investment decisions to look at some of  these other names outside of FANG.  </p><p>LIPTON:  On the other hand, what if big tech knocks it out of the park this  week and beats the forecast for this quarter and next?  Perhaps that could  win back tech investors at least in the near term.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, what to make of this tech selloff?  Well, where does the  important sector go from here? </p><p>Joining us tonight, Andy Hargreaves is a senior research analyst at  KeyBanc.</p><p>Andy, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>ANDY HARGREAVES, KEYBANC SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  What's your version of why we see the selloff in the market  leader right now?  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Well, I think you have a combination of factors, right you  have a lot of companies in this space that have significant consumer  exposure and there is a view sew sort of global consumer may be rolling  over.  You have a lot of companies highly valued and you have a lot of  China exposure variation varying degrees and you put all those together and  you get what we're seeing, which is a lot of downside.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, you know, I was also hearing a number of analysts today cite  the worry about tariffs and the trade war and all of that factoring in.   Just as key fundamental reasons for them to take some money out of tech at  this point.  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Yes, I mean, absolutely right.  To the extent that you have  any kind of hardware or consumer exposure that's either a big in market or  big input.  And on both sides, what you're going to see is higher prices.   And that usually drives lower volume.  So, you are going to have issues  throughout any company that's trying to sell something physical.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Are there particular areas of technology that you think are most  vulnerable, whether it's hardware, or software, social media, you know,  whatever happens to be?  What do you think?  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Yes.  I mean you have to look at everything in the context of  valuation, right?  And I think what we see a little bit is a risk off  mentality in which case you want to start looking a little bit more at  companies with a little bit of downside protection as opposed to what's my  upside opportunity.  For me right now, the names we like the most are  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in part because the valuation  really does provide some support.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Are you worried about regulation?  I mean, there is a lot of  talk about that on Capitol Hill as it goes to the social media companies  and the Googles of the world.  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Yes.  Yes.  I'm laughing just because yes, anytime politicians  --  </p><p>HERERA:  I wondered why you were laughing.  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Any time politicians get involved, I start to get worried.  I  think at least with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in  particular, it's been such a prominent issue already.  I think we have  priced in a lot of that risk.  And for them to solve the issues that they  are trying to solve I think is going to take many, many years.  So, it's  not something I view as a near-term issue.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we will be looking at that possibility of regulation of  those companies coming up in a little bit here on the program.  </p><p>Andy Hargreaves from KeyBanc, thanks for joining us tonight.  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Yes, thanks again.</p><p>HERERA:  So, given the rock stretch for the market, what will it take for a  sense of calm to return to Wall Street?  </p><p>Bob Pisani tries to answer that one.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Strong earning may not  be enough to calm the market until the higher yields is resolved.  So far,  80 percent of the companies are beating earnings.  Earnings growth is 22  percent, terrific.  It's expected to continue into the fourth quarter.</p><p>But it's not helping because the markets shifted to rates and slowing  growth in China -- macro issues.  The main risk is rising rates on the back  of strong U.S. economic data.  Therefore, the market will calm down.</p><p>If the market believes first ten-year yields are not rising too much more,  say 3.5 percent, and second that the Federal Reserve is not looking to  raise rates as aggressively as some traders believe.  In other words,  taking out the words accommodative from their policy statements, it doesn't  mean the Fed is going to keep hiking for years.  They'll certainly not  accelerate their gradual path to rate hikes.  The market needs to believe  that.  It doesn't right now.  </p><p>The market bulls are pushing back on this whole interpretation.  They're  arguing that beyond the housing market, these modestly high rates we see  are not a huge drag on the U.S. economy.  We have already seen attempts to  buy beaten up housing stocks, for example, in the last few days.  </p><p>Now, rates are rising but financial conditions are not tight, meaning  mortgage rights might be going up but they are still far from being  abnormally high.  And the economy remains strong, but it's not yet  overheating.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  As with every selloff, there is usually a bright spot.  And  today, that bright spot was Boeing (NYSE:BA).  The Dow component blew past  profit and revenue estimates and the company said that things are looking  pretty good right now.  That sent the stock up more than 1 percent on this  otherwise ugly down day.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau has the details for us tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I there are any  concerns about the global economy slowing down, they were not exhibited in  Boeing's third quarter results.  The company beat the street on both the  top and the bottom line, with free cash flow coming in at $4.1 billion.  In  terms Boeing's outlook, there is plenty of optimism.  </p><p>The company has raised its full year earnings and revenue guidance.  Its  commercial airplane division is improving deliveries and expects to improve  through the end of the year.  And it's not seeing a slowdown in China.  The  trade tensions from people wondering if we start to see fewer orders from  China.  But Boeing (NYSE:BA) executives say they are not seeing that so  far.  </p><p>The bottom line is this -- Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported a much better than  expected result for the third quarter.  And that optimism is also reflected  in its fourth quarter and full-year guidance.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And another bright spot late today was Visa (NYSE:V).  The Dow  component topped earnings estimates thanks to increase in total purchases  made by people using their visa cards.  The world's largest payments  network said it benefitted from higher credit card and debit card spending,  as well as job growth and lower taxes.  </p><p>And that sent the stock higher in initial after hours trading.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>And we begin with Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) upgraded to outperform from  market perform at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).  The analyst expects the bank to  increase its financial targets in January, price target $60, shares though  fell along with the broader market today to $43.49.  </p><p>Lululemon was upgraded to buy from hold at Canaccord.  The analyst cited  the company's product development and international expansion.  Price  target now $160.  Nonetheless the stock fell 2 percent to $134.29.  </p><p>And Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) was downgraded to hold from buy at Stifel  Nicholas.  The analyst cited the stock's recent strength.  Price target:  $49.  The stock dropped about 2 percent to $87.06.  </p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, mixed messages is the market saying one thing to  investors and the economy saying another?  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  New home sales for September fell for a fourth straight month to a  two-year low.  That decline of 5.5 percent adds to the recent spate of weak  reads on real estate.  As we have been reporting rising prices and mortgage  rates have decreased affordability for some buyers and economists say that  is reducing housing demand.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  President Trump has stepped up his criticism of the Fed's  monetary policy.  During an interview with the \"Wall Street Journal\", Mr.  Trump said the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's stance on rate increases  threatens economic growth.  The president added that while it's too early  to say, he may have regretted nominating Powell to the Central Bank.  The  Central Bank has hiked the benchmark rate three times this year and another  increase is expected in December.  </p><p>HERERA:  In the meantime, the Fed's Beige Book released today describes the  U.S. economy as growing modestly to moderately.  The Central Bank's  anecdotal snap shot of economic activity showed that businesses are  experiencing labor shortage.  They're also starting to notice the impact of  the trade war with China and simmering tensions with other trading  partners.  And factories say they are raising prices because of tariffs.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, the president of the Cleveland Fed said today that she is  not adjusting her policy stance because of the drop in the stock market.   Loretta Masters said that the economy is strong, the labor market is solid  and there's no sign of a recession any time soon.  </p><p>But as Steve Liesman reports now, it's exactly this split between the  declining stock market and the rising economy that investors are struggling  with.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The recent selloff  has feature add role reversal.  Normally, optimistic investors grown  worried about the outlook than the usually pessimistic economists.  The  list of what worries the market bear includes President Trump's tariffs,  higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve and the effect of those on  sectors like housing and autos.  </p><p>Also on the list, slower global growth, higher oil prices and lower  guidance from some companies.  It's all amounted to a three-week selloff  which shaved about 500 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  </p><p>But those same earnings are seen as positive by economists.  Estimates are  for 25 percent tax cut fueled earnings in this quarter compared to last  year.  That's the third quarter in a row above 20 percent.  Overall, U.S.  growth is also running a percentage point above trend and the unemployment  rate is 3.7 percent, the lowest since 1969 and most believe headed lower.   Inflation at just over 2 percent is mostly tame.  </p><p>Both sides agree the economy and earnings will slow from here.  But they  debate how much.  </p><p>DAVID BIANCO, DWS GROUP:  We expect S&amp;P earnings growth will slow from 25  percent growth to 2018 to 5 percent growth in 2009, and the reason for the  slowdown is one going back toward a more normal earnings growth rate for  S&amp;P, 5 to 7 percent.  But also we think earnings growth is going to be  challenged by tariffs, stronger dollar and the curbed oil prices.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  The bull case though sees above trend growth continuing, in part  because of higher spending on capital goods by companies motivated by the  tax cuts.  </p><p>HOWARD WARD, GABELLI FUNDS:  The capital spending thing is big.  Cap  spending now is growing at 8 percent.  So this is what's going to drive  increased productivity, and as you know you have to have the greater  productivity to get the growth rate of GDP up.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  No one is locked into their current position.  If the economy  keeps running strong, well, bears could be bulls, and if it weakens, bulls  could once again be bears.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Chinese and American businesses are trying to figure out how to  minimize the effects of the trade war.  </p><p>Eunice Yoon has more on the trading relationship between the world's two  largest economies.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I met China's most  prominent export fair.  The Canton Fair in the manufacturing hub of  Guangzhou is where buyers from the U.S. and other parts of the world  connect with Chinese manufacturers of consumer products.  The fair has been  going on for decades, but this year, because of the trade war, people are  nervous.  </p><p>The discussion is mainly how to minimize the impact of President Trump  tariffs.  One buyer told me he worked on a deal to sell frying pans without  a gift box because the box is subject to a 10 percent tariff.  </p><p>Second point, a lot of companies are still dependent on China and cannot  uproot their supply chain as easily as one might think.  </p><p>This is one American buyer here told me.  </p><p>RANDALL DAVIDSON, U.S. BUYER:  These are robust supply chains.  Not just  the factories but the printers supporting the factories, the other  suppliers and subcontractors that support the factories, trucking,  shipping, all of that has been developing for three decades.  </p><p>So, I don't see a wholesale move out of China.  But certainly, everyone is  looking at other options.  </p><p>YOON:  But what I found most surprising is how Chinese manufacturers are  giving non-American buyers better deals.  The Chinese suppliers are worried  because of the trade war.  One Indian buyer said he's been surprised at the  lower prices the Chinese are offering.  </p><p>So, while the non-American buyers are being cut better deals, American  buyers are still working out how to deal with the extra costs.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon, in Guangzhou.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And in fact, trade war concerns overshadowed profit gains at  UPS.  And that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The delivery company reported disappointing international results which UPS  says was caused by slowing economic activity resulting from changing trade  policies.  The CEO did say, though, he expects overseas operating profits  to rebound in the fourth quarter during the holidays.  UPS shares fell 5.5  percent to $107.93 today.  </p><p>Boy, it was a tough quarter for AT&amp;T (NYSE:T).  The company lost more  satellite TV customers than expected during the summer.  And it's over the  top streaming video services added fewer subscribers compared to the same  period a year ago.  And that caused its profits to miss analyst estimates  and the stock punished, down 8 percent to $30.36.  </p><p>Meanwhile revenue at General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) fell short of expectations.   And investors appeared concerned about lower business jet deliveries.  When  asked about business with Saudi Arabia, the CEO on the earnings conference  call said there has been no indication yet that it's $10 billion sale of  armored vehicle has been affected by the controversy surrounding the death  of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  Shares of General Dynamics (NYSE:GD),  though, fell by 7 percent to $173.24.  </p><p>HERERA:  Rival Northup Grumman topped expectations saying a recent  acquisition and strength in the aerospace systems and mission systems units  helped results.  The company also hiked its earnings guidance for the year  but left sales forecast unchanged.  Shares fell 6 percent to $285.86.  </p><p>After the bell, Ford reported earnings that beat analyst estimates by a  penny.  Revenue was also stronger than expected but the company reported a  lot of weakness in many of its foreign markets.  As a result, Ford says it  does not expect to hit its target of reaching 8 percent profit margins by  2020.  Nonetheless, shares initially rose in after-hours but finished the  regular day down more than 4 percent to $8.18.  </p><p>Also out after the bell, Tesla reported a surprise profit and better than  expected revenue.  Investors have been concerned the electric car maker  would need to raise additional capital.  But the company said it expects  the cash position to remain consistent even as it repays its debt and so,  shares took off in the extended session.  They finished the regular day  down nearly 2 percent to $288.50.  </p><p>And, Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) reported weak revenue and issued  sales guidance below estimates.  The chip maker is facing soft demand from  cryptocurrency miners for its graphic processors.  The stock fell more than  20 percent in initial after hours trading, extending its 9 percent decline  in the regular session.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Coming up, one of Silicon Valley's tech CEOs calls for stricter  data privacy protections.  But could that be a bad thing for shareholders?  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Late today, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) said it is cutting the price of  an anti-cholesterol drug by 60 percent.  That will bring the annual cost of  Repatha down to about $5,800, and it will lower patient co-pays and  barriers erected by insurers that have resulted in disappointing sales to  this point.  Drug companies that make rival anti-cholesterol drugs have  already announced rebates and discounts earlier this year.  </p><p>HERERA:  ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) was sued by the New York attorney general by  misleading investor on climates change.  The suit alleges that the company  did not tell investors about the true risks to the business posed by  climate change regulations.  The lawsuit does not charge the company with  contributing to climate change or was suppressing climate science.  It does  however claim that the former CEO Rex Tillerson was aware of the alleged  fraudulent behavior.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, on a day when extra attention is being paid to the tech  sector, the CEO of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had harsh words for how other  Silicon Valley company manage data they collect.  During a privacy  conference in Brussels today, Tim Cook said personal information has been  weaponized, in his words.  But he stopped short of naming Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) specifically, two of the largest  companies making money by selling ads.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  We shouldn't sugarcoat the consequences.  This is  surveillance.  And these stock piles of personal data serve only to enrich  the companies that collect them.  This should make us very uncomfortable.   It should unsettle us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mr. Cook has long spoken in support of personal privacy and he  often points out that because Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes money selling  devices and not advertisements, it has less of an incentive to exploit  customer data.  </p><p>HERERA:  And Connie Guglielmo joins us more to talk about regulating  consumer data and what it could mean for both the industry and also those  who share -- the share prices of those companies.  She is editor in chief  over at CNET.  </p><p>Connie, good to see you welcome.  </p><p>CONNIE GUGLIELMO, CNET EDITOR-IN-CHIEF:  Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, Mr. Cook has always been outspoken and plain spoken.   And Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has actually been pretty aggressive at guarding its  users' data, correct?  </p><p>GUGLIELMO, CNET EDITOR-IN-CHIEF:  That is correct.  And the point that you  made is well-noted.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes most of its money for sales  of the iPhone.  It's hardware.  It does make money from software and  services but doesn't monetize the use are data it collects as far as we  know.  </p><p>So, it can afford to also take a stand on privacy.  I'm not saying that  it's not serious about it.  Tim Cook is very genuine in how he talks about  the topic.  But its fortunes are tied to the hardware and software  services.  </p><p>GRIFFTH: And it's not just Tim Cook that's talking about this.  Members of  Congress are as well.  They've been holding hearings.  More hearings are  coming as well.  </p><p>The possibility of regulation of how these companies manage their data and  keeping it private, good for consumers, perhaps, but it is bad for  shareholders?  What do you think?</p><p>GUGLIELMO:  Well, it's been a bad year for the tech sector when it comes to  data privacy.  We have the Cambridge Analytica breach at Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), 87 million users were affected by that.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  recently was forced to disclose that users of its Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Plus  social network about 500,000 people were affected by a data breach there.  </p><p>These are very large companies who make most of their money from  advertising and pushing targeted ads.  They need personal data in order to  push their very lucrative targeted ads.  So, from a user perspective, sure,  you want your data to be protected.  You don't want to be the victim of any  kind of identity theft or privacy hack.  Very problematic to try to restore  your good name after it's been stolen.  </p><p>For shareholders, this is how these companies make money.  Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) made about $42 billion in 2017, 98 percent of that was from  ads.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), $110 or so billion dollars, 83, 84 percent from  ads.  So, yes, it's a concern to shareholders, but at the same time, think  about it, if users don't trust your platform, they're not use going.  And  if they're not using, there is nobody to target those ads to.  </p><p>So, there has to be some give here on the side of the tech industry.  </p><p>HERERA:  Before we let you go, do you think there is one company -- let's  put Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) aside because they do different things as you said  they do the hardware -- that is better prepared for regulation that might  be coming their way?  </p><p>GUGLIELMO:  I don't think there is any one company.  I do think you hear  companies talking about this topic.  The CEO of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Satya Nadella, has also echoed what Tim Cook has said and he says privacy  is a fundamental human right.  So, that idea that there should be  protections in place is something that tech executives are starting to talk  about whether they are forced to or not is the question.  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.  Connie thank you very much.  </p><p>GUGLIELMO:  My pleasure.</p><p>HERERA:  Connie Guglielmo with CNET.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And before we go, here's another look at the day's selloff.  It  was a big one.  The Dow tanked by 608 points.  The Nasdaq fell 4 percent, a  loss of 329.  The S&amp;P was down 84.  </p><p>HERERA:  And it's only Wednesday.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes.  </p><p>HERERA:  We'll see you tomorrow.  That does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue  Herera.  </p><p>GIRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Thanks for joining us.  Have a great  evening.  We will see you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The Dow and S&amp;P wipe out the gains for the year as the stock market route  deepens.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Tech tumbles.  The hottest  sector this year is now in a deep freeze with the Nasdaq entering  correction territory.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  Investor whiplash.  What's it going to take to calm the markets?   It's a key question we try to find the answer to.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Wednesday, October the 24th.  </p><p>HERERA:  And good evening, everyone.  Welcome.  </p><p>Stocks were punished today.  A late day selloff intensified sending the Dow  down 600 points.  As we mentioned both the blue chip average and S&amp;P 500  are now negative for the year.  </p><p>Tech stocks were hit the hardest.  The Nasdaq is now 12 percent below its  most recent high, putting its squarely in correction territory.  The index  is having the worst month since November of 2008.  </p><p>So, here is a look at today's damage.  The Dow tanked 608 points to 24,583.   The Nasdaq fell 4 percent, a loss of 329 points.  And the S&amp;P 500 was down  84.  </p><p>Mike Santoli is with us tonight from the New York Stock Exchange to try and  explain the selloff.  </p><p>Good evening, Mike.  And what a day.  </p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It sure was, Sue.  </p><p>You know it's amazing.  Over the course of the month it's been an  accumulation of factors that became very acute in the last couple of days  specifically around big company earnings.  I think investors have been  sensitive to the possibility that earnings growth is going to slow into  next year and getting some evidence from global industrial companies that  maybe that's happening and at the same time I think there is a little bit  of wariness that the Federal Reserve will continue raising rates at a pace  that might feel uncomfortable given the potential for slowing.  </p><p>To me, that all came together with a little bit of an acceleration of  downside momentum today.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And that downside momentum, Mike, has been occurring as we re- test recent lows.  We blew through yesterday's low today and that's when  the selling really took off late in the afternoon, right.  </p><p>SANTOLI:  Yes, absolutely, Bill.  I mean, it was basically very technically  driven in that sense.  I think a lot of investors, a lot of traders were  saying, OK, if we manage to hold around yesterday's lows, which by the way  were very much in the region of the October 11th lows, which was the low  from earlier this month, then perhaps this is just a more routine pullback  and we can bet on a fourth quarter recovery from here.  </p><p>So, it's obvious we deepened stretched to the downside.  And now, really  not too far above the lows for the indexes from early this year, after that  January and February correction.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Mike Santoli, thank you so much.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, as we mentioned, technology stocks were once the driving  force behind this market rally.  They have been hit hardest this month.   The tech heavy Nasdaq is now down more than 11 percent just since October  1st.  And now, wouldn't you know, the tech giants are starting to report  earnings.  </p><p>First out of the gate, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which investors are hoping  will provide some relief when trading begins tomorrow, because tonight the  company reported better than expected earnings of $1.14 a share when the  market was expected 96 cents.  Revenue in the quarter rose to $29 billion.  </p><p>And the market liked the results.  They sent the stock higher in initial  after-hours trading tonight.  </p><p>HERERA:  And tomorrow, the focus on tech will intensify when Alphabet,  Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all report their results.  </p><p>Josh Lipton gives us a preview on what's on deck.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The information  technology sector including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is down hard from its recent high.  Strategists say  investors tend to sell what has performed best during sharp selloffs and  that's certainly true of tech, which was among the best performing sectors  before this recent pullback.  </p><p>Now, attention turns to the flood of big tech companies about to report  their latest earnings results.  Tomorrow, Microsoft's cloud rivals Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet report, their cloud units bringing ever bigger  chunks of revenue and the competition is fierce.  The cloud market is  expected to surge an estimated 20 percent this year to $175 billion.  </p><p>Also tomorrow, investors will hear from chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).   It's down hard so far this month though not as badly as the broader chip  sector which is on track for its worst month since November 2008.  Some  analysts say there could be pressure ahead for some of tech's big names  like FANG, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  </p><p>BRENT HILL, JEFFERIES:  We don't know what the next year holds.  We do know  things will slow.  You can see that Amazon's growth going from mid-30  percent growth down to low 20s.  I think there is a lot of concern around  large cap cap tech pushing the investment decisions to look at some of  these other names outside of FANG.  </p><p>LIPTON:  On the other hand, what if big tech knocks it out of the park this  week and beats the forecast for this quarter and next?  Perhaps that could  win back tech investors at least in the near term.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, what to make of this tech selloff?  Well, where does the  important sector go from here? </p><p>Joining us tonight, Andy Hargreaves is a senior research analyst at  KeyBanc.</p><p>Andy, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>ANDY HARGREAVES, KEYBANC SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  What's your version of why we see the selloff in the market  leader right now?  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Well, I think you have a combination of factors, right you  have a lot of companies in this space that have significant consumer  exposure and there is a view sew sort of global consumer may be rolling  over.  You have a lot of companies highly valued and you have a lot of  China exposure variation varying degrees and you put all those together and  you get what we're seeing, which is a lot of downside.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, you know, I was also hearing a number of analysts today cite  the worry about tariffs and the trade war and all of that factoring in.   Just as key fundamental reasons for them to take some money out of tech at  this point.  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Yes, I mean, absolutely right.  To the extent that you have  any kind of hardware or consumer exposure that's either a big in market or  big input.  And on both sides, what you're going to see is higher prices.   And that usually drives lower volume.  So, you are going to have issues  throughout any company that's trying to sell something physical.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Are there particular areas of technology that you think are most  vulnerable, whether it's hardware, or software, social media, you know,  whatever happens to be?  What do you think?  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Yes.  I mean you have to look at everything in the context of  valuation, right?  And I think what we see a little bit is a risk off  mentality in which case you want to start looking a little bit more at  companies with a little bit of downside protection as opposed to what's my  upside opportunity.  For me right now, the names we like the most are  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in part because the valuation  really does provide some support.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Are you worried about regulation?  I mean, there is a lot of  talk about that on Capitol Hill as it goes to the social media companies  and the Googles of the world.  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Yes.  Yes.  I'm laughing just because yes, anytime politicians  --  </p><p>HERERA:  I wondered why you were laughing.  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Any time politicians get involved, I start to get worried.  I  think at least with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in  particular, it's been such a prominent issue already.  I think we have  priced in a lot of that risk.  And for them to solve the issues that they  are trying to solve I think is going to take many, many years.  So, it's  not something I view as a near-term issue.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we will be looking at that possibility of regulation of  those companies coming up in a little bit here on the program.  </p><p>Andy Hargreaves from KeyBanc, thanks for joining us tonight.  </p><p>HARGREAVES:  Yes, thanks again.</p><p>HERERA:  So, given the rock stretch for the market, what will it take for a  sense of calm to return to Wall Street?  </p><p>Bob Pisani tries to answer that one.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Strong earning may not  be enough to calm the market until the higher yields is resolved.  So far,  80 percent of the companies are beating earnings.  Earnings growth is 22  percent, terrific.  It's expected to continue into the fourth quarter.</p><p>But it's not helping because the markets shifted to rates and slowing  growth in China -- macro issues.  The main risk is rising rates on the back  of strong U.S. economic data.  Therefore, the market will calm down.</p><p>If the market believes first ten-year yields are not rising too much more,  say 3.5 percent, and second that the Federal Reserve is not looking to  raise rates as aggressively as some traders believe.  In other words,  taking out the words accommodative from their policy statements, it doesn't  mean the Fed is going to keep hiking for years.  They'll certainly not  accelerate their gradual path to rate hikes.  The market needs to believe  that.  It doesn't right now.  </p><p>The market bulls are pushing back on this whole interpretation.  They're  arguing that beyond the housing market, these modestly high rates we see  are not a huge drag on the U.S. economy.  We have already seen attempts to  buy beaten up housing stocks, for example, in the last few days.  </p><p>Now, rates are rising but financial conditions are not tight, meaning  mortgage rights might be going up but they are still far from being  abnormally high.  And the economy remains strong, but it's not yet  overheating.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  As with every selloff, there is usually a bright spot.  And  today, that bright spot was Boeing (NYSE:BA).  The Dow component blew past  profit and revenue estimates and the company said that things are looking  pretty good right now.  That sent the stock up more than 1 percent on this  otherwise ugly down day.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau has the details for us tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I there are any  concerns about the global economy slowing down, they were not exhibited in  Boeing's third quarter results.  The company beat the street on both the  top and the bottom line, with free cash flow coming in at $4.1 billion.  In  terms Boeing's outlook, there is plenty of optimism.  </p><p>The company has raised its full year earnings and revenue guidance.  Its  commercial airplane division is improving deliveries and expects to improve  through the end of the year.  And it's not seeing a slowdown in China.  The  trade tensions from people wondering if we start to see fewer orders from  China.  But Boeing (NYSE:BA) executives say they are not seeing that so  far.  </p><p>The bottom line is this -- Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported a much better than  expected result for the third quarter.  And that optimism is also reflected  in its fourth quarter and full-year guidance.  </p><p>Phil LeBeau NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And another bright spot late today was Visa (NYSE:V).  The Dow  component topped earnings estimates thanks to increase in total purchases  made by people using their visa cards.  The world's largest payments  network said it benefitted from higher credit card and debit card spending,  as well as job growth and lower taxes.  </p><p>And that sent the stock higher in initial after hours trading.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>And we begin with Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) upgraded to outperform from  market perform at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).  The analyst expects the bank to  increase its financial targets in January, price target $60, shares though  fell along with the broader market today to $43.49.  </p><p>Lululemon was upgraded to buy from hold at Canaccord.  The analyst cited  the company's product development and international expansion.  Price  target now $160.  Nonetheless the stock fell 2 percent to $134.29.  </p><p>And Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) was downgraded to hold from buy at Stifel  Nicholas.  The analyst cited the stock's recent strength.  Price target:  $49.  The stock dropped about 2 percent to $87.06.  </p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, mixed messages is the market saying one thing to  investors and the economy saying another?  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  New home sales for September fell for a fourth straight month to a  two-year low.  That decline of 5.5 percent adds to the recent spate of weak  reads on real estate.  As we have been reporting rising prices and mortgage  rates have decreased affordability for some buyers and economists say that  is reducing housing demand.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  President Trump has stepped up his criticism of the Fed's  monetary policy.  During an interview with the \"Wall Street Journal\", Mr.  Trump said the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's stance on rate increases  threatens economic growth.  The president added that while it's too early  to say, he may have regretted nominating Powell to the Central Bank.  The  Central Bank has hiked the benchmark rate three times this year and another  increase is expected in December.  </p><p>HERERA:  In the meantime, the Fed's Beige Book released today describes the  U.S. economy as growing modestly to moderately.  The Central Bank's  anecdotal snap shot of economic activity showed that businesses are  experiencing labor shortage.  They're also starting to notice the impact of  the trade war with China and simmering tensions with other trading  partners.  And factories say they are raising prices because of tariffs.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, the president of the Cleveland Fed said today that she is  not adjusting her policy stance because of the drop in the stock market.   Loretta Masters said that the economy is strong, the labor market is solid  and there's no sign of a recession any time soon.  </p><p>But as Steve Liesman reports now, it's exactly this split between the  declining stock market and the rising economy that investors are struggling  with.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The recent selloff  has feature add role reversal.  Normally, optimistic investors grown  worried about the outlook than the usually pessimistic economists.  The  list of what worries the market bear includes President Trump's tariffs,  higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve and the effect of those on  sectors like housing and autos.  </p><p>Also on the list, slower global growth, higher oil prices and lower  guidance from some companies.  It's all amounted to a three-week selloff  which shaved about 500 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  </p><p>But those same earnings are seen as positive by economists.  Estimates are  for 25 percent tax cut fueled earnings in this quarter compared to last  year.  That's the third quarter in a row above 20 percent.  Overall, U.S.  growth is also running a percentage point above trend and the unemployment  rate is 3.7 percent, the lowest since 1969 and most believe headed lower.   Inflation at just over 2 percent is mostly tame.  </p><p>Both sides agree the economy and earnings will slow from here.  But they  debate how much.  </p><p>DAVID BIANCO, DWS GROUP:  We expect S&amp;P earnings growth will slow from 25  percent growth to 2018 to 5 percent growth in 2009, and the reason for the  slowdown is one going back toward a more normal earnings growth rate for  S&amp;P, 5 to 7 percent.  But also we think earnings growth is going to be  challenged by tariffs, stronger dollar and the curbed oil prices.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  The bull case though sees above trend growth continuing, in part  because of higher spending on capital goods by companies motivated by the  tax cuts.  </p><p>HOWARD WARD, GABELLI FUNDS:  The capital spending thing is big.  Cap  spending now is growing at 8 percent.  So this is what's going to drive  increased productivity, and as you know you have to have the greater  productivity to get the growth rate of GDP up.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  No one is locked into their current position.  If the economy  keeps running strong, well, bears could be bulls, and if it weakens, bulls  could once again be bears.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Chinese and American businesses are trying to figure out how to  minimize the effects of the trade war.  </p><p>Eunice Yoon has more on the trading relationship between the world's two  largest economies.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I met China's most  prominent export fair.  The Canton Fair in the manufacturing hub of  Guangzhou is where buyers from the U.S. and other parts of the world  connect with Chinese manufacturers of consumer products.  The fair has been  going on for decades, but this year, because of the trade war, people are  nervous.  </p><p>The discussion is mainly how to minimize the impact of President Trump  tariffs.  One buyer told me he worked on a deal to sell frying pans without  a gift box because the box is subject to a 10 percent tariff.  </p><p>Second point, a lot of companies are still dependent on China and cannot  uproot their supply chain as easily as one might think.  </p><p>This is one American buyer here told me.  </p><p>RANDALL DAVIDSON, U.S. BUYER:  These are robust supply chains.  Not just  the factories but the printers supporting the factories, the other  suppliers and subcontractors that support the factories, trucking,  shipping, all of that has been developing for three decades.  </p><p>So, I don't see a wholesale move out of China.  But certainly, everyone is  looking at other options.  </p><p>YOON:  But what I found most surprising is how Chinese manufacturers are  giving non-American buyers better deals.  The Chinese suppliers are worried  because of the trade war.  One Indian buyer said he's been surprised at the  lower prices the Chinese are offering.  </p><p>So, while the non-American buyers are being cut better deals, American  buyers are still working out how to deal with the extra costs.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon, in Guangzhou.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And in fact, trade war concerns overshadowed profit gains at  UPS.  And that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The delivery company reported disappointing international results which UPS  says was caused by slowing economic activity resulting from changing trade  policies.  The CEO did say, though, he expects overseas operating profits  to rebound in the fourth quarter during the holidays.  UPS shares fell 5.5  percent to $107.93 today.  </p><p>Boy, it was a tough quarter for AT&amp;T (NYSE:T).  The company lost more  satellite TV customers than expected during the summer.  And it's over the  top streaming video services added fewer subscribers compared to the same  period a year ago.  And that caused its profits to miss analyst estimates  and the stock punished, down 8 percent to $30.36.  </p><p>Meanwhile revenue at General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) fell short of expectations.   And investors appeared concerned about lower business jet deliveries.  When  asked about business with Saudi Arabia, the CEO on the earnings conference  call said there has been no indication yet that it's $10 billion sale of  armored vehicle has been affected by the controversy surrounding the death  of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  Shares of General Dynamics (NYSE:GD),  though, fell by 7 percent to $173.24.  </p><p>HERERA:  Rival Northup Grumman topped expectations saying a recent  acquisition and strength in the aerospace systems and mission systems units  helped results.  The company also hiked its earnings guidance for the year  but left sales forecast unchanged.  Shares fell 6 percent to $285.86.  </p><p>After the bell, Ford reported earnings that beat analyst estimates by a  penny.  Revenue was also stronger than expected but the company reported a  lot of weakness in many of its foreign markets.  As a result, Ford says it  does not expect to hit its target of reaching 8 percent profit margins by  2020.  Nonetheless, shares initially rose in after-hours but finished the  regular day down more than 4 percent to $8.18.  </p><p>Also out after the bell, Tesla reported a surprise profit and better than  expected revenue.  Investors have been concerned the electric car maker  would need to raise additional capital.  But the company said it expects  the cash position to remain consistent even as it repays its debt and so,  shares took off in the extended session.  They finished the regular day  down nearly 2 percent to $288.50.  </p><p>And, Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) reported weak revenue and issued  sales guidance below estimates.  The chip maker is facing soft demand from  cryptocurrency miners for its graphic processors.  The stock fell more than  20 percent in initial after hours trading, extending its 9 percent decline  in the regular session.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Coming up, one of Silicon Valley's tech CEOs calls for stricter  data privacy protections.  But could that be a bad thing for shareholders?  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Late today, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) said it is cutting the price of  an anti-cholesterol drug by 60 percent.  That will bring the annual cost of  Repatha down to about $5,800, and it will lower patient co-pays and  barriers erected by insurers that have resulted in disappointing sales to  this point.  Drug companies that make rival anti-cholesterol drugs have  already announced rebates and discounts earlier this year.  </p><p>HERERA:  ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) was sued by the New York attorney general by  misleading investor on climates change.  The suit alleges that the company  did not tell investors about the true risks to the business posed by  climate change regulations.  The lawsuit does not charge the company with  contributing to climate change or was suppressing climate science.  It does  however claim that the former CEO Rex Tillerson was aware of the alleged  fraudulent behavior.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, on a day when extra attention is being paid to the tech  sector, the CEO of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had harsh words for how other  Silicon Valley company manage data they collect.  During a privacy  conference in Brussels today, Tim Cook said personal information has been  weaponized, in his words.  But he stopped short of naming Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) specifically, two of the largest  companies making money by selling ads.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  We shouldn't sugarcoat the consequences.  This is  surveillance.  And these stock piles of personal data serve only to enrich  the companies that collect them.  This should make us very uncomfortable.   It should unsettle us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mr. Cook has long spoken in support of personal privacy and he  often points out that because Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes money selling  devices and not advertisements, it has less of an incentive to exploit  customer data.  </p><p>HERERA:  And Connie Guglielmo joins us more to talk about regulating  consumer data and what it could mean for both the industry and also those  who share -- the share prices of those companies.  She is editor in chief  over at CNET.  </p><p>Connie, good to see you welcome.  </p><p>CONNIE GUGLIELMO, CNET EDITOR-IN-CHIEF:  Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, Mr. Cook has always been outspoken and plain spoken.   And Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has actually been pretty aggressive at guarding its  users' data, correct?  </p><p>GUGLIELMO, CNET EDITOR-IN-CHIEF:  That is correct.  And the point that you  made is well-noted.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes most of its money for sales  of the iPhone.  It's hardware.  It does make money from software and  services but doesn't monetize the use are data it collects as far as we  know.  </p><p>So, it can afford to also take a stand on privacy.  I'm not saying that  it's not serious about it.  Tim Cook is very genuine in how he talks about  the topic.  But its fortunes are tied to the hardware and software  services.  </p><p>GRIFFTH: And it's not just Tim Cook that's talking about this.  Members of  Congress are as well.  They've been holding hearings.  More hearings are  coming as well.  </p><p>The possibility of regulation of how these companies manage their data and  keeping it private, good for consumers, perhaps, but it is bad for  shareholders?  What do you think?</p><p>GUGLIELMO:  Well, it's been a bad year for the tech sector when it comes to  data privacy.  We have the Cambridge Analytica breach at Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), 87 million users were affected by that.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  recently was forced to disclose that users of its Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Plus  social network about 500,000 people were affected by a data breach there.  </p><p>These are very large companies who make most of their money from  advertising and pushing targeted ads.  They need personal data in order to  push their very lucrative targeted ads.  So, from a user perspective, sure,  you want your data to be protected.  You don't want to be the victim of any  kind of identity theft or privacy hack.  Very problematic to try to restore  your good name after it's been stolen.  </p><p>For shareholders, this is how these companies make money.  Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) made about $42 billion in 2017, 98 percent of that was from  ads.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), $110 or so billion dollars, 83, 84 percent from  ads.  So, yes, it's a concern to shareholders, but at the same time, think  about it, if users don't trust your platform, they're not use going.  And  if they're not using, there is nobody to target those ads to.  </p><p>So, there has to be some give here on the side of the tech industry.  </p><p>HERERA:  Before we let you go, do you think there is one company -- let's  put Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) aside because they do different things as you said  they do the hardware -- that is better prepared for regulation that might  be coming their way?  </p><p>GUGLIELMO:  I don't think there is any one company.  I do think you hear  companies talking about this topic.  The CEO of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Satya Nadella, has also echoed what Tim Cook has said and he says privacy  is a fundamental human right.  So, that idea that there should be  protections in place is something that tech executives are starting to talk  about whether they are forced to or not is the question.  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.  Connie thank you very much.  </p><p>GUGLIELMO:  My pleasure.</p><p>HERERA:  Connie Guglielmo with CNET.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And before we go, here's another look at the day's selloff.  It  was a big one.  The Dow tanked by 608 points.  The Nasdaq fell 4 percent, a  loss of 329.  The S&amp;P was down 84.  </p><p>HERERA:  And it's only Wednesday.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes.  </p><p>HERERA:  We'll see you tomorrow.  That does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue  Herera.  </p><p>GIRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Thanks for joining us.  Have a great  evening.  We will see you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

A possible major deal in health care, a presidential push against opioid addiction, and a report that questions how you probably pick mutual funds.</p><p>We begin with major news about profits in tech land. And they were good. Expectations were high, and big tech did not disappoint. Four major companies reported quarterlies that were much stronger than anyone expected.</p><p>Let`s start with Amazon. The story here, simple: revenue, up. Profit, up. The stock, up.</p><p>The company earned 52 cents a share. Expectations were for three pennies. Sales jumped more than 30 percent to about $43 billion year over year. Investors, well, they`re giddy, sending Amazon shares initially higher and through the thousand dollar mark.</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis zeroes in on the biggest surprise in Amazon`s report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: One of the key points of interest for Amazon`s third quarter earnings with how its web services division did. The company delivered. That segment bringing in revenue $4.58 billion, handily topping analysts` expectations.</p><p>Amazon`s Web Services or AWS is Amazon`s version of the cloud. It`s an emerging space where many companies are competing for share, and Amazon appears to be one of the winners. As business in the divisions grows, the high bar will be more difficult to top. But for this quarter, it was certainly a standout.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Up next, Google`s parent Alphabet. It has a similar story and one that any company would envy. Alphabet`s profit grew more than 30 percent. Revenue jumped more than 20 percent. Its stock got an initial lift from upbeat shareholders after the bell.</p><p>And Josh Lipton explains why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It wasn`t just a beat on earnings and revenue. It was also because Google is showing better profitability. Aaron Kessler of Raymond James says operating income came in at $7.8 billion and that was better than what he expected. Kessler pointing out that a concern for investors has been declining margins for Google. They want to see better operating leverage for some time. Now with this report they got it.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Now to Microsoft. It did report a better than expected profit. Its demand for its fast-growing cloud computing services rose. It also saw its personal computer software business stabilize. Revenue rose double digits, and that sent shares of the Dow component up initially in after- hours trading, you say see there.</p><p>HERERA: One more to tell you about: Intel. It too was helped by growth in its cloud computing business. The world`s largest computer chip maker topped earnings and revenue expectations and raised its full year revenue and profit forecast. Revenue from its higher margin data center business was up as well. And that helped the stock in initial late day trading.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, even before all of those results, the busiest day of earnings season helped drive things today on Wall Street. Better than expected results from the likes of Twitter and Ford early set the tone. More on those in a little bit.</p><p>As for the major indexes, the Dow rose 71 points to 23400, but the Nasdaq lost seven, and the S&amp;P 500 added three.</p><p>HERERA: Health care was all abuzz late today on a report that took most by surprise. CVS Health is reportedly in talks to buy Aetna. As first reported by \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the takeout price is said to be about $200 a share, much higher than Aetna`s current share price. That would put the deal`s price tag at $66 billion, in what could be the largest health insurance deal on record. That sent shares of Aetna higher, much higher in fact. CVS shares finished the day lower.</p><p>But this stock and other drugstores and pharmacy benefit managers` stocks were pressured by reports that Amazon obtained its pharmacy license in a number of sets.</p><p>Meg Tirrell joins us here on set to talk about it.</p><p>And there is an awful lot to talk about tonight, Meg.</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>HERERA: Where do we really start with this story?</p><p>TIRRELL: Well, let`s start with this report from \"The Wall Street Journal\" that CVS is looking at buying Aetna. This would be just a gigantic deal, $200 a share. And we`ll note that Aetna`s stock didn`t trade up that high. So, it implies the market might not believe this yet. That would be a 25 percent premium to where the stock was trading before this report came out.</p><p>And thinking about what this means for CVS, they already are both a pharmacy benefits manager, so managing drug benefits for employers and insurers, and they`re a retail pharmacy, of course. So, this would make them yet another thing, giving them more power to potentially offer to employers when trying to do services with them.</p><p>We`ve seen this kind of bulking up in other companies. UnitedHealth, for example, which is the biggest health insurer in the United States, also has a PBM in-house in Optum. So, these companies are getting bigger and bigger, you know, trying to get more sort of ability to offer things to their customers.</p><p>MATHISEN: You know, there has been sort of a lot of sort of subcontracting of various services in health care. The insurer does your major medical, but then somebody else handles your drugs and somebody else may handle your mental health.</p><p>Are we about to see a consolidation, or maybe even a situation where not only do insurers merge with the pharmacy benefit managers, but they may merge with medical systems, health care companies, hospital companies, health care delivery companies, a Kaiser model?</p><p>TIRRELL: All of that is probably in the air right now, especially because, going to our second story of the night, there is the threat of Amazon coming in and disrupting everything. If a big player like that comes in, the existing players, a lot of analysts are saying, are going to do whatever they can to get more power in the market. And that might mean conglomeration.</p><p>HERERA: Amazon has gotten licenses in a number of states. Do you view that as more of a test as to how successful they could be, and then maybe try and get licenses all across the country? Or is there something else to it?</p><p>TIRRELL: It`s not totally clear what these licenses mean. This is reported today by \"The St. Louis Post Dispatch.\" You know, it could just mean it sort of supports existing things that Amazon already does.</p><p>But a lot of people are very excited about seeing Amazon get into this space, so interpret it as an initial move to get bigger into perhaps drug distribution. We don`t know yet, the company hasn`t said. But CNBC.com`s Christine Farr has been reporting a lot on Amazon`s moves here, implying that they are probably are looking very closely at this.</p><p>HERERA: Thank you, Meg, as always. Great to have you with us.</p><p>TIRRELL: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Meg Tirrell.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. The health care industry paying close attention today to the president, who declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. By doing so, the government will waive some regulations and give states more flexibility in how they use federal funds. President Trump stopped short of declaring a national state of emergency, but he said he was going to go after bad actors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I will be looking at the potential of the federal government bringing major lawsuits against bad actors, what they have and what they`re doing to our people is unheard of. We will be bringing some very major lawsuits against people and against companies that are hurting our people. And that will start taking place pretty soon.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: Meantime, the Fed chief, Janet Yellen, recently said the opioid epidemic may be tied to declining labor force participation.</p><p>HERERA: The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics was arrested today in an opioid-related case. John Kapoor was charged with racketeering, conspiracy and fraud. The scheme alleges that he bribed doctors to prescribe a powerful opioid to patients who didn`t need it. As we`ve reported, Insys has been in settlement talks with the Justice Department in connection with the probe. Last December, six other executives were indicted on federal charges. Shares of Insys fell today by 22 2/3 percent.</p><p>MATHISEN: Still ahead, written in the stars, or is it? A new report says Morningstar`s familiar mutual fund star ratings aren`t as predictive as you may think.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: The economy now in the housing market pending home sales which account for homes under contract but not yet sold sank to the lowest level in three years, but it`s not for a lack of buyers.</p><p>Diana Olick explains what`s behind the slump in the fall market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A heavy hurricane season in the South may have kept homebuyers there out of the market last month. But in the rest of the nation, home sales are being hit by other headwinds -- high prices and little for sale.</p><p>NELA RICHARDSON, REDFIN CHIEF ECONOMIST: The tight inventory conditions that we`ve been talking about pretty much ad nauseam all year finally came to a head in September. We saw the third consecutive month of year over year declines. Look, the tightness in inventory, the lack of affordable housing and huge increases in prices are really tamping down sales.</p><p>OLICK: An index of pending home sales which measures signed contracts during the month sat at the lowest level in nearly three years in September. While part of that may have been due to the heavy hurricane season, sales have been lower annually for five of the past six months and prices just continue to rise.</p><p>RICHARDSON: The only way out is to build more. And right now, we are not nearly keeping up with the demand for home ownership or for the rental part of the market.</p><p>OLICK: Maryland real estate agent Eric Murtagh specializes in selling newly built homes and says there is definitely high demand.</p><p>ERIC MURTAGH, EVERS &amp; COMPANY REAL ESTATE: You have people who want the space. They want the more input on the finishes. We sell properties when they`re under construction like this, and so if a buyer comes along and wants to pick their kitchen, their bathrooms, or do other options like an elevator, we`re set up to really help them with that.</p><p>OLICK: The trouble is a lack of labor. Subcontractors are heading south to rebuild after the hurricanes. That makes building everywhere else more expensive.</p><p>MURTAGH: That really comes into play when we`re bidding out jobs, and you only have one contractor available to do the work, it`s not a competitive environment. And so, they`re dictating what the cost of the project will be.</p><p>OLICK (on camera): With so little new construction nationwide and the labor shortage only getting worse, this housing market needs more sellers. But we`re heading into the slow season for that. Winter usually puts a chill on home sales. But this year, they could be downright frozen.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The House of Representatives narrowly cleared a budget blueprint that will allow a tax bill to pass Congress without any Democratic votes. The final tally for the budget vote was a tight 216-212, in part because a number of Republicans from states with high state taxes voted against the measure. The current tax outline calls for the elimination of a popular deduction for state and local taxes to help pay for other tax cuts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: The Ways and Means Committee will be putting out the specific plan very shortly. And they`re going to work with all of our members to look at and consider and address their concerns. I believe that the Ways and Means Committee will be working with these members in particular to find a solution.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee says he will introduce a bill on November 1st and begin deliberations on the 6th.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, how would a reduction in corporate taxes affect the stock market?</p><p>Steve Liesman did some digging.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It would make sense that with all the talk and all the apparent momentum towards cutting corporate taxes, that the market would be pricing in at least some possibility of it actually happening. Corporate tax cuts will flow right to the bottom line of companies, especially the high tax companies. But CNBC looked at three different baskets of high tax stocks. The result: all three are substantially underperforming the broader market.</p><p>S&amp;P Global divided up into three different categories. The top 100 taxpayers, they`ve returned 4.8 percent year to date. The bottom 100 taxpayers returned 11 percent. And then, you take out those companies that are paying no tax. They could be potentially troubled companies. They`re up 24 percent year to date.</p><p>Here`s a basket of high tax stocks from Strategas and its performance relative to the S&amp;P 500. If it were 100, it would equal the broader market performance. Instead, it`s been underperforming most of the year. Now, it topped last month when the tax outline was announced from the big six. But it seems to have come off again with the spat between Senator Corker and President Trump. That potentially diminishes the chance of passing the tax cut package.</p><p>Three reasons have been offered for this divergence. First, the market may not be appropriately pricing in the chance of a tax cut. Second, it doesn`t believe these tax cuts are good for the economy or earnings since they could accelerate rate hikes. Third, the market just doesn`t think tax cuts will happen. Dan Clifton of Strategas thinks the market is underestimating the chance of passage and thinks there`s money on the table for investors.</p><p>Michael Thompson, president of S&amp;P Global, points out the market is focused on growth stocks, many of which don`t pay high taxes, so it hasn`t really put a value on high tax companies.</p><p>The right answer, the market can sometimes be inefficient, especially when it comes to discounting political outcomes.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Four million users flocked to Twitter, and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The social media company added 4 million new users, reported its lowest net loss in several quarters, and also topped Wall Street`s revenue expectations. Twitter did say it overstated its monthly active user numbers since the end of 2014, but investors turned their focus to the company`s upbeat guidance, which was that it may turn its first ever profit next quarter. Shares rose 18 percent to $20.31.</p><p>Cost cuts and strong demand in North America helped lift sales above expectations at Ford. The automaker also over-delivered on profits. Ford says while it still has work to do, it`s improving its financial health as the industry moves into autonomous technology.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB SHANKS, FORD CFO: What we are working to do is improve the fitness of the business better, as a really strong foundation as we enter a really important transitional period for the whole sector, not only the company, as we take advantage of new emerging technologies such as AVs and EVs and so forth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: Shares were up just about 2 percent to $12.27.</p><p>MATHISEN: Celgene slashes its long term outlook. The biotech said difficult market conditions and some disappointments in its drug pipeline would cause earnings and sales in 2020 to be lower than initially expected. Celgene did beat estimates in its latest quarter but shares touched their lowest level in 17 years, finishing down 16 percent at $99.99.</p><p>Tenet Health Care may no longer be for sale. \"Reuters\" says the hospital operator has scrapped plans to sell itself following the earlier than expected departure of its CEO this month. But according to CNBC, a strategic review is ongoing at the company and no options have been taken off the table. Still, shares down 9 percent to $12.87.</p><p>And after the bell, Mattel, ouch, disappointing results, hurt by weak demand and the bankruptcy of Toys \"R\" Us. The toy maker said it would suspend its quarterly dividend so it could strengthen its balance sheet and increase financial flexibility. Shares, as you see there, got crushed in after-hours trading. They finished the regular session down just a fraction at $15.37.</p><p>HERERA: Profits came under pressure at UPS amid expanded Saturday delivery and recent natural disasters. But revenue climbed and the company issued an upbeat outlook for the key holiday shipping season.</p><p>Morgan Brennan has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: UPS expects to deliver a staggering number of packages this holiday season -- 750 million. It would be another record, a nearly 6 percent increase compared to last year. The delivery giant expects to handle at least 30 million packages or double average daily volume on 17 out of the 21 shipping days that would make up peak season.</p><p>UPS`s CFO Richard Peretz says it`s crucial the company get the right return on all of the investments it`s making to keep up.</p><p>RICHARD PERETZ, UPS CFO: We keep getting asked to do different solutions for our customers during peak. And as we do that, we`re putting new resources in, creating temporary capacity. There are very few businesses in the world that can flex 100 percent of their average daily business for a four to six-week period.</p><p>BRENNAN: According to a recent Deloitte Survey, for the first time ever, more people will buy things online this holiday season than in stores. Companies like UPS and FedEx have been pouring billions into their next to expand capacity. A year-round process that will be put to the ultimate test in the month of December.</p><p>To prepare, UPS is hiring 95,000 workers, opening more facilities, putting three new Boeing-made jumbo jets into the air, and ramping up Saturday delivery. It`s also slapping new quality surcharge on some packages destined for door steps, a move analysts are watching closely, since rising costs have been an issue during previous holiday season.</p><p>DAVID VERNON, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; CO.: From an investment standpoint, I think the market is looking to see if UPS can handle the scaling of its network to the degree that they have to scale it every fourth quarter. Every year, e-commerce becomes bigger, every year, UPS has to do more to make sure that Christmas gifts are delivered on time. And I think the market is still trying to make sure that UPS can do that and do that profitably.</p><p>BRENNAN: And UPS isn`t alone. FedEx is hiring 50,000 additional workers to handle its own record volumes. The U.S. Postal Service has said it too plans for a record, 850 million packages between Thanksgiving and New Year`s Eve.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, a five-star rating from the investment research firm Morningstar has always meant a seal of approval for mutual funds. Implicit in its, the idea that the fund would remain a top performer. Well, an article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today questions that premise and the Morningstar methodology, saying that a five-star rating isn`t what you may think it is.</p><p>One of the articles` authors is with us tonight to discuss her findings. She`s Sarah Krouse, a reporter with \"The Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>Sarah, welcome. Good to have you with us.</p><p>SARAH KROUSE, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER: Thank you for having me.</p><p>MATHISEN: Why don`t you sort of tell us what you found? But as I boil it down, it is that once a fund becomes a five-star fund at Morningstar, not always a five-star fund in the ensuing one, three, five, 10 years. Boil it down to me.</p><p>KROUSE: Sure. So, we spent a year going through Morningstar`s data. And one of the things that we found, the most striking, was five-star funds did attract the vast majority of investor flows. But very few of them failed to outperform longer term. So, for example, a five-star fund, take any five-star fund, only 12 percent five years later had performed well enough to earn that same top mark.</p><p>HERERA: So --</p><p>KROUSE: And a lot of investors rely heavily on those stars, some entirely, to make their decisions.</p><p>HERERA: Morningstar I think would argue that they`re constantly looking at their data and their star system, and they`ve said they view it as somewhat predictive. Is that correct? What response did you get from them?</p><p>KROUSE: Well, I would say that they`ve said a lot of things but the predictive powers of the stars. They`ve said that they`re not predictive. They`ve said that higher rated funds are more likely to outperform longer term, that they have moderate predictive powers. So, they`ve said a number of things on that present.</p><p>MATHISEN: I want to play a sound bite from an interview I did early today with Jeffrey Ptak. He`s the head of global manager research at Morningstar. It challenges some of the premises of your article. So, listen, and I`ll get your reaction.</p><p>KROUSE: Sure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF PTAK, MORNINGSTAR HEAD OF RESEARCH: We strongly disagree with her conclusions. If you take a look at some of the findings that they themselves reported in exhibit to the study, what you find is that highly rated funds, five-star funds are about seven times more likely to succeed than low-rated funds, one-star funds, over a future 10-year horizon. To me, that doesn`t look like failure. That looks like a measure that`s tilting the odds of success in the investor`s favor.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: So, Jeffrey says he disputes the conclusion, and he cites his data that the five-star funds are seven times more likely to be better performers down the road than the one-star funds. Is it possible that you both are right?</p><p>KROUSE: Yes. And we noted in the article that that was the case. But better is nearly average. That the five-star funds we tracked over the 14 years in our study went on to become three-star performers. So, that`s -- it`s -- one of the things that I think is important to keep in mind as we talk about this is the way the star ratings are used.</p><p>Morningstar licenses the ratings to fund firms who then include them in their advertisements. The implicit suggestion is that this five-star fund will go on to outperform, and that`s what our analysis showed was not the case.</p><p>HERERA: So, how is an investor, given what you found out and researched, how is an individual investor to use this data to the best of their advantage?</p><p>KROUSE: Yes, it`s a really important question. And the premise on all of this and why it`s worth having this conversation is that investing in the markets is difficult. It`s fraught with risk. I would say that yes, a rating and some of the metrics that Morningstar provides can be used as a starting point.</p><p>But what we found throughout our research and talking to investors is they rely very heavily on it. And Morningstar knows they rely heavily on it. And in fact, in our piece, an executive that focuses on behavioral finance at Morningstar stated that they know that investors misuse it and even he questioned, you know, whether they need to do something about that.</p><p>MATHISEN: It was really an amazing piece of work, Sarah. Whether you agree with it or not, it was hard, hard work. I recommend your article to everybody.</p><p>KROUSE: Thank you.</p><p>MATHISEN: Thanks very much. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>KROUSE: Thanks for having me.</p><p>MATHISEN: Sarah Krouse of \"The Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, the first glimpse of what a towering border wall might look like.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: President Trump`s border wall may be taking another step forward. Today was the deadline for six companies to finish building prototypes.</p><p>Aditi Roy reports from the border in Otay Mesa, California.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For the last 30 days, construction trucks have been humming. The cranes have soared. And workers have been buzzing around this otherwise desolate, dusty part of Otay Mesa, California. It`s two miles from the border crossing with Mexico. And the project they`ve been working on, building eight versions of the border wall of the future.</p><p>TRUMP: We will build a great wall along the southern border.</p><p>ROY: One that fulfills President Trump`s vision. He spoke so frequently about it on the campaign trail.</p><p>The six construction companies behind these eight prototypes are W.G. Yates and Sons, Elta North America, Caddell, Texas Sterling, KWR Construction and Fisher Sands &amp; Gravel Company. They were awarded contracts between $300,000 and $500,000 and were chosen among hundreds of applicants.</p><p>U.S. Customs and Border Patrol spokesman Carlos Diaz says the rules were pretty simple.</p><p>CARLOS DIAZ, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL SPOKESPERSON: They had to have anti-dig, anti-climb capabilities, they had anti-breach capabilities and other number of capabilities that included being able to see through.</p><p>ROY: The reason? As of two months ago, there were nearly 290,000 Border Patrol apprehensions nationwide so far this year. Last year, there were more than 415,000. We got an up close look at the current border wall with holes in places it had been breached. Those visible marks now guiding enforcement agents as they get ready to test the prototypes.</p><p>DIAZ: We`re going to be looking at the type of breaches that we see throughout the southwest border. We`re going to be looking at techniques.</p><p>ROY (on camera): The prototypes are between 18 and 30 feet high, compare to the existing wall back there. That`s between eight to 10 feet high.</p><p>(voice-over): Ultimately, it`s about making the most secure wall possible.</p><p>DIAZ: We`re always trying to find ways to defeat and to deter those folks from crossing to this side.</p><p>ROY (on camera): Border Patrol officials say they have no deadline for making a decision. They could choose one of these prototypes or aspects of all eight. The big question that remains is whether or not Congress will foot the heavy price tag with some estimates put at more than $20 billion.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, Otay Mesa, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I`m Tyler Mathisen. Thanks from me as well.

The  industry was put to the test and passed with flying colors, as Alphabet,  Amazon, Microsoft, and Intel blew past earnings estimates.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Blockbuster deal.  CVS  Health is reportedly in talks to buy Aetna in what could be a  transformative deal for the health care industry.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  The fault in our stars.  Why your highly-rated mutual fund may not  be all it's cracked up to be?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday,  October 26th.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>Lots to tell you about tonight.  A possible major deal in health care, a  presidential push against opioid addiction, and a report that questions how  you probably pick mutual funds.  </p><p>We begin with major news about profits in tech land.  And they were good.   Expectations were high, and big tech did not disappoint.  Four major  companies reported quarterlies that were much stronger than anyone  expected.  </p><p>Let's start with Amazon.  The story here, simple: revenue, up.  Profit, up.   The stock, up.  </p><p>The company earned 52 cents a share.  Expectations were for three pennies.   Sales jumped more than 30 percent to about $43 billion year over year.   Investors, well, they're giddy, sending Amazon shares initially higher and  through the thousand dollar mark.  </p><p>Jackie DeAngelis zeroes in on the biggest surprise in Amazon's report.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  One of the key  points of interest for Amazon's third quarter earnings with how its web  services division did.  The company delivered.  That segment bringing in  revenue $4.58 billion, handily topping analysts' expectations.  </p><p>Amazon's Web Services or AWS is Amazon's version of the cloud.  It's an  emerging space where many companies are competing for share, and Amazon  appears to be one of the winners.  As business in the divisions grows, the  high bar will be more difficult to top.  But for this quarter, it was  certainly a standout.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Up next, Google's parent Alphabet.  It has a similar story and one  that any company would envy.  Alphabet's profit grew more than 30 percent.   Revenue jumped more than 20 percent.  Its stock got an initial lift from  upbeat shareholders after the bell.  </p><p>And Josh Lipton explains why.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It wasn't just a beat  on earnings and revenue.  It was also because Google is showing better  profitability.  Aaron Kessler of Raymond James says operating income came  in at $7.8 billion and that was better than what he expected.  Kessler  pointing out that a concern for investors has been declining margins for  Google.  They want to see better operating leverage for some time.  Now  with this report they got it.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Now to Microsoft.  It did report a better than expected profit.   Its demand for its fast-growing cloud computing services rose.  It also saw  its personal computer software business stabilize.  Revenue rose double  digits, and that sent shares of the Dow component up initially in after- hours trading, you say see there.  </p><p>HERERA:  One more to tell you about: Intel.  It too was helped by growth in  its cloud computing business.  The world's largest computer chip maker  topped earnings and revenue expectations and raised its full year revenue  and profit forecast.  Revenue from its higher margin data center business  was up as well.  And that helped the stock in initial late day trading.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, even before all of those results, the busiest day of  earnings season helped drive things today on Wall Street.  Better than  expected results from the likes of Twitter and Ford early set the tone.   More on those in a little bit.  </p><p>As for the major indexes, the Dow rose 71 points to 23400, but the Nasdaq  lost seven, and the S&amp;P 500 added three.  </p><p>HERERA:  Health care was all abuzz late today on a report that took most by  surprise.  CVS Health is reportedly in talks to buy Aetna.  As first  reported by \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the takeout price is said to be  about $200 a share, much higher than Aetna's current share price.  That  would put the deal's price tag at $66 billion, in what could be the largest  health insurance deal on record.  That sent shares of Aetna higher, much  higher in fact.  CVS shares finished the day lower.  </p><p>But this stock and other drugstores and pharmacy benefit managers' stocks  were pressured by reports that Amazon obtained its pharmacy license in a  number of sets.  </p><p>Meg Tirrell joins us here on set to talk about it.  </p><p>And there is an awful lot to talk about tonight, Meg.</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>HERERA:  Where do we really start with this story?  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Well, let's start with this report from \"The Wall Street Journal\"  that CVS is looking at buying Aetna.  This would be just a gigantic deal,  $200 a share.  And we'll note that Aetna's stock didn't trade up that high.   So, it implies the market might not believe this yet.  That would be a 25  percent premium to where the stock was trading before this report came out.  </p><p>And thinking about what this means for CVS, they already are both a  pharmacy benefits manager, so managing drug benefits for employers and  insurers, and they're a retail pharmacy, of course.  So, this would make  them yet another thing, giving them more power to potentially offer to  employers when trying to do services with them.  </p><p>We've seen this kind of bulking up in other companies.  UnitedHealth, for  example, which is the biggest health insurer in the United States, also has  a PBM in-house in Optum.  So, these companies are getting bigger and  bigger, you know, trying to get more sort of ability to offer things to  their customers.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You know, there has been sort of a lot of sort of subcontracting  of various services in health care.  The insurer does your major medical,  but then somebody else handles your drugs and somebody else may handle your  mental health.</p><p>Are we about to see a consolidation, or maybe even a situation where not  only do insurers merge with the pharmacy benefit managers, but they may  merge with medical systems, health care companies, hospital companies,  health care delivery companies, a Kaiser model?  </p><p>TIRRELL:  All of that is probably in the air right now, especially because,  going to our second story of the night, there is the threat of Amazon  coming in and disrupting everything.  If a big player like that comes in,  the existing players, a lot of analysts are saying, are going to do  whatever they can to get more power in the market.  And that might mean  conglomeration.  </p><p>HERERA:  Amazon has gotten licenses in a number of states.  Do you view  that as more of a test as to how successful they could be, and then maybe  try and get licenses all across the country?  Or is there something else to  it?  </p><p>TIRRELL:  It's not totally clear what these licenses mean.  This is  reported today by \"The St. Louis Post Dispatch.\"  You know, it could just  mean it sort of supports existing things that Amazon already does.  </p><p>But a lot of people are very excited about seeing Amazon get into this  space, so interpret it as an initial move to get bigger into perhaps drug  distribution.  We don't know yet, the company hasn't said.  But CNBC.com's  Christine Farr has been reporting a lot on Amazon's moves here, implying  that they are probably are looking very closely at this.  </p><p>HERERA:  Thank you, Meg, as always.  Great to have you with us.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Meg Tirrell.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  The health care industry paying close attention  today to the president, who declared the opioid crisis a public health  emergency.  By doing so, the government will waive some regulations and  give states more flexibility in how they use federal funds.  President  Trump stopped short of declaring a national state of emergency, but he said  he was going to go after bad actors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I will be looking at the  potential of the federal government bringing major lawsuits against bad  actors, what they have and what they're doing to our people is unheard of.   We will be bringing some very major lawsuits against people and against  companies that are hurting our people.  And that will start taking place  pretty soon.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MATHISEN:  Meantime, the Fed chief, Janet Yellen, recently said the opioid  epidemic may be tied to declining labor force participation.  </p><p>HERERA:  The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics was arrested today  in an opioid-related case.  John Kapoor was charged with racketeering,  conspiracy and fraud.  The scheme alleges that he bribed doctors to  prescribe a powerful opioid to patients who didn't need it.  As we've  reported, Insys has been in settlement talks with the Justice Department in  connection with the probe.  Last December, six other executives were  indicted on federal charges.  Shares of Insys fell today by 22 2/3 percent.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Still ahead, written in the stars, or is it?  A new report says  Morningstar's familiar mutual fund star ratings aren't as predictive as you  may think.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The economy now in the housing market pending home sales which  account for homes under contract but not yet sold sank to the lowest level  in three years, but it's not for a lack of buyers.  </p><p>Diana Olick explains what's behind the slump in the fall market.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A heavy  hurricane season in the South may have kept homebuyers there out of the  market last month.  But in the rest of the nation, home sales are being hit  by other headwinds -- high prices and little for sale.  </p><p>NELA RICHARDSON, REDFIN CHIEF ECONOMIST:  The tight inventory conditions  that we've been talking about pretty much ad nauseam all year finally came  to a head in September.  We saw the third consecutive month of year over  year declines.  Look, the tightness in inventory, the lack of affordable  housing and huge increases in prices are really tamping down sales.  </p><p>OLICK:  An index of pending home sales which measures signed contracts  during the month sat at the lowest level in nearly three years in  September.  While part of that may have been due to the heavy hurricane  season, sales have been lower annually for five of the past six months and  prices just continue to rise.  </p><p>RICHARDSON:  The only way out is to build more.  And right now, we are not  nearly keeping up with the demand for home ownership or for the rental part  of the market.  </p><p>OLICK:  Maryland real estate agent Eric Murtagh specializes in selling  newly built homes and says there is definitely high demand.  </p><p>ERIC MURTAGH, EVERS &amp; COMPANY REAL ESTATE:  You have people who want the  space.  They want the more input on the finishes.  We sell properties when  they're under construction like this, and so if a buyer comes along and  wants to pick their kitchen, their bathrooms, or do other options like an  elevator, we're set up to really help them with that.  </p><p>OLICK:  The trouble is a lack of labor.  Subcontractors are heading south  to rebuild after the hurricanes.  That makes building everywhere else more  expensive.  </p><p>MURTAGH:  That really comes into play when we're bidding out jobs, and you  only have one contractor available to do the work, it's not a competitive  environment.  And so, they're dictating what the cost of the project will  be.  </p><p>OLICK (on camera):  With so little new construction nationwide and the  labor shortage only getting worse, this housing market needs more sellers.   But we're heading into the slow season for that.  Winter usually puts a  chill on home sales.  But this year, they could be downright frozen.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The House of Representatives narrowly cleared a budget blueprint  that will allow a tax bill to pass Congress without any Democratic votes.   The final tally for the budget vote was a tight 216-212, in part because a  number of Republicans from states with high state taxes voted against the  measure.  The current tax outline calls for the elimination of a popular  deduction for state and local taxes to help pay for other tax cuts.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  The Ways and Means Committee  will be putting out the specific plan very shortly.  And they're going to  work with all of our members to look at and consider and address their  concerns.  I believe that the Ways and Means Committee will be working with  these members in particular to find a solution.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee says he will  introduce a bill on November 1st and begin deliberations on the 6th.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  So, how would a reduction in corporate taxes affect the stock  market?  </p><p>Steve Liesman did some digging.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It would make sense  that with all the talk and all the apparent momentum towards cutting  corporate taxes, that the market would be pricing in at least some  possibility of it actually happening.  Corporate tax cuts will flow right  to the bottom line of companies, especially the high tax companies.  But  CNBC looked at three different baskets of high tax stocks.  The result: all  three are substantially underperforming the broader market.  </p><p>S&amp;P Global divided up into three different categories.  The top 100  taxpayers, they've returned 4.8 percent year to date.  The bottom 100  taxpayers returned 11 percent.  And then, you take out those companies that  are paying no tax.  They could be potentially troubled companies.  They're  up 24 percent year to date.  </p><p>Here's a basket of high tax stocks from Strategas and its performance  relative to the S&amp;P 500.  If it were 100, it would equal the broader market  performance.  Instead, it's been underperforming most of the year.  Now, it  topped last month when the tax outline was announced from the big six.  But  it seems to have come off again with the spat between Senator Corker and  President Trump.  That potentially diminishes the chance of passing the tax  cut package.  </p><p>Three reasons have been offered for this divergence.  First, the market may  not be appropriately pricing in the chance of a tax cut.  Second, it  doesn't believe these tax cuts are good for the economy or earnings since  they could accelerate rate hikes.  Third, the market just doesn't think tax  cuts will happen.  Dan Clifton of Strategas thinks the market is  underestimating the chance of passage and thinks there's money on the table  for investors.  </p><p>Michael Thompson, president of S&amp;P Global, points out the market is focused  on growth stocks, many of which don't pay high taxes, so it hasn't really  put a value on high tax companies.  </p><p>The right answer, the market can sometimes be inefficient, especially when  it comes to discounting political outcomes.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Four million users flocked to Twitter, and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The social media company added 4 million new users, reported its lowest net  loss in several quarters, and also topped Wall Street's revenue  expectations.  Twitter did say it overstated its monthly active user  numbers since the end of 2014, but investors turned their focus to the  company's upbeat guidance, which was that it may turn its first ever profit  next quarter.  Shares rose 18 percent to $20.31.  </p><p>Cost cuts and strong demand in North America helped lift sales above  expectations at Ford.  The automaker also over-delivered on profits.  Ford  says while it still has work to do, it's improving its financial health as  the industry moves into autonomous technology.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB SHANKS, FORD CFO:  What we are working to do is improve the fitness of  the business better, as a really strong foundation as we enter a really  important transitional period for the whole sector, not only the company,  as we take advantage of new emerging technologies such as AVs and EVs and  so forth.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  Shares were up just about 2 percent to $12.27.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Celgene slashes its long term outlook.  The biotech said  difficult market conditions and some disappointments in its drug pipeline  would cause earnings and sales in 2020 to be lower than initially expected.   Celgene did beat estimates in its latest quarter but shares touched their  lowest level in 17 years, finishing down 16 percent at $99.99.  </p><p>Tenet Health Care may no longer be for sale.  \"Reuters\" says the hospital  operator has scrapped plans to sell itself following the earlier than  expected departure of its CEO this month.  But according to CNBC, a  strategic review is ongoing at the company and no options have been taken  off the table.  Still, shares down 9 percent to $12.87.  </p><p>And after the bell, Mattel, ouch, disappointing results, hurt by weak  demand and the bankruptcy of Toys \"R\" Us.  The toy maker said it would  suspend its quarterly dividend so it could strengthen its balance sheet and  increase financial flexibility.  Shares, as you see there, got crushed in  after-hours trading.  They finished the regular session down just a  fraction at $15.37.  </p><p>HERERA:  Profits came under pressure at UPS amid expanded Saturday delivery  and recent natural disasters.  But revenue climbed and the company issued  an upbeat outlook for the key holiday shipping season.  </p><p>Morgan Brennan has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  UPS expects to  deliver a staggering number of packages this holiday season -- 750 million.   It would be another record, a nearly 6 percent increase compared to last  year.  The delivery giant expects to handle at least 30 million packages or  double average daily volume on 17 out of the 21 shipping days that would  make up peak season.  </p><p>UPS's CFO Richard Peretz says it's crucial the company get the right return  on all of the investments it's making to keep up.  </p><p>RICHARD PERETZ, UPS CFO:  We keep getting asked to do different solutions  for our customers during peak.  And as we do that, we're putting new  resources in, creating temporary capacity.  There are very few businesses  in the world that can flex 100 percent of their average daily business for  a four to six-week period.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  According to a recent Deloitte Survey, for the first time ever,  more people will buy things online this holiday season than in stores.   Companies like UPS and FedEx have been pouring billions into their next to  expand capacity.  A year-round process that will be put to the ultimate  test in the month of December.  </p><p>To prepare, UPS is hiring 95,000 workers, opening more facilities, putting  three new Boeing-made jumbo jets into the air, and ramping up Saturday  delivery.  It's also slapping new quality surcharge on some packages  destined for door steps, a move analysts are watching closely, since rising  costs have been an issue during previous holiday season.  </p><p>DAVID VERNON, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; CO.:  From an investment standpoint, I  think the market is looking to see if UPS can handle the scaling of its  network to the degree that they have to scale it every fourth quarter.   Every year, e-commerce becomes bigger, every year, UPS has to do more to  make sure that Christmas gifts are delivered on time.  And I think the  market is still trying to make sure that UPS can do that and do that  profitably.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  And UPS isn't alone.  FedEx is hiring 50,000 additional workers  to handle its own record volumes.  The U.S. Postal Service has said it too  plans for a record, 850 million packages between Thanksgiving and New  Year's Eve.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, a five-star rating from the investment research firm  Morningstar has always meant a seal of approval for mutual funds.  Implicit  in its, the idea that the fund would remain a top performer.  Well, an  article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today questions that premise and the  Morningstar methodology, saying that a five-star rating isn't what you may  think it is.  </p><p>One of the articles' authors is with us tonight to discuss her findings.   She's Sarah Krouse, a reporter with \"The Wall Street Journal\". </p><p>Sarah, welcome.  Good to have you with us.</p><p>SARAH KROUSE, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Why don't you sort of tell us what you found?  But as I boil it  down, it is that once a fund becomes a five-star fund at Morningstar, not  always a five-star fund in the ensuing one, three, five, 10 years.  Boil it  down to me.  </p><p>KROUSE:  Sure.  So, we spent a year going through Morningstar's data.  And  one of the things that we found, the most striking, was five-star funds did  attract the vast majority of investor flows.  But very few of them failed  to outperform longer term.  So, for example, a five-star fund, take any  five-star fund, only 12 percent five years later had performed well enough  to earn that same top mark.  </p><p>HERERA:  So --  </p><p>KROUSE:  And a lot of investors rely heavily on those stars, some entirely,  to make their decisions.  </p><p>HERERA:  Morningstar I think would argue that they're constantly looking at  their data and their star system, and they've said they view it as somewhat  predictive.  Is that correct?  What response did you get from them?  </p><p>KROUSE:  Well, I would say that they've said a lot of things but the  predictive powers of the stars.  They've said that they're not predictive.   They've said that higher rated funds are more likely to outperform longer  term, that they have moderate predictive powers.  So, they've said a number  of things on that present.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  I want to play a sound bite from an interview I did early today  with Jeffrey Ptak.  He's the head of global manager research at  Morningstar.  It challenges some of the premises of your article.  So,  listen, and I'll get your reaction.  </p><p>KROUSE:  Sure.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF PTAK, MORNINGSTAR HEAD OF RESEARCH:  We strongly disagree with her  conclusions.  If you take a look at some of the findings that they  themselves reported in exhibit to the study, what you find is that highly  rated funds, five-star funds are about seven times more likely to succeed  than low-rated funds, one-star funds, over a future 10-year horizon.  To  me, that doesn't look like failure.  That looks like a measure that's  tilting the odds of success in the investor's favor.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So, Jeffrey says he disputes the conclusion, and he cites his  data that the five-star funds are seven times more likely to be better  performers down the road than the one-star funds.  Is it possible that you  both are right?  </p><p>KROUSE:  Yes.  And we noted in the article that that was the case.  But  better is nearly average.  That the five-star funds we tracked over the 14  years in our study went on to become three-star performers.  So, that's --  it's -- one of the things that I think is important to keep in mind as we  talk about this is the way the star ratings are used.  </p><p>Morningstar licenses the ratings to fund firms who then include them in  their advertisements.  The implicit suggestion is that this five-star fund  will go on to outperform, and that's what our analysis showed was not the  case.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, how is an investor, given what you found out and researched,  how is an individual investor to use this data to the best of their  advantage?  </p><p>KROUSE:  Yes, it's a really important question.  And the premise on all of  this and why it's worth having this conversation is that investing in the  markets is difficult.  It's fraught with risk.  I would say that yes, a  rating and some of the metrics that Morningstar provides can be used as a  starting point.  </p><p>But what we found throughout our research and talking to investors is they  rely very heavily on it.  And Morningstar knows they rely heavily on it.   And in fact, in our piece, an executive that focuses on behavioral finance  at Morningstar stated that they know that investors misuse it and even he  questioned, you know, whether they need to do something about that.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  It was really an amazing piece of work, Sarah.  Whether you  agree with it or not, it was hard, hard work.  I recommend your article to  everybody.  </p><p>KROUSE:  Thank you.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Thanks very much.  Thanks for being with us.  </p><p>KROUSE:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Sarah Krouse of \"The Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, the first glimpse of what a towering border wall might  look like. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  President Trump's border wall may be taking another step  forward.  Today was the deadline for six companies to finish building  prototypes.  </p><p>Aditi Roy reports from the border in Otay Mesa, California.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For the  last 30 days, construction trucks have been humming.  The cranes have  soared.  And workers have been buzzing around this otherwise desolate,  dusty part of Otay Mesa, California.  It's two miles from the border  crossing with Mexico.  And the project they've been working on, building  eight versions of the border wall of the future.  </p><p>TRUMP:  We will build a great wall along the southern border.  </p><p>ROY:  One that fulfills President Trump's vision.  He spoke so frequently  about it on the campaign trail.  </p><p>The six construction companies behind these eight prototypes are W.G. Yates  and Sons, Elta North America, Caddell, Texas Sterling, KWR Construction and  Fisher Sands &amp; Gravel Company.  They were awarded contracts between  $300,000 and $500,000 and were chosen among hundreds of applicants.  </p><p>U.S. Customs and Border Patrol spokesman Carlos Diaz says the rules were  pretty simple.  </p><p>CARLOS DIAZ, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL SPOKESPERSON:  They had to have  anti-dig, anti-climb capabilities, they had anti-breach capabilities and  other number of capabilities that included being able to see through.  </p><p>ROY:  The reason?  As of two months ago, there were nearly 290,000 Border  Patrol apprehensions nationwide so far this year.  Last year, there were  more than 415,000.  We got an up close look at the current border wall with  holes in places it had been breached.  Those visible marks now guiding  enforcement agents as they get ready to test the prototypes.  </p><p>DIAZ:  We're going to be looking at the type of breaches that we see  throughout the southwest border.  We're going to be looking at techniques.</p><p>ROY (on camera):  The prototypes are between 18 and 30 feet high, compare  to the existing wall back there.  That's between eight to 10 feet high.  </p><p>(voice-over):  Ultimately, it's about making the most secure wall possible.  </p><p>DIAZ:  We're always trying to find ways to defeat and to deter those folks  from crossing to this side.  </p><p>ROY (on camera):  Border Patrol officials say they have no deadline for  making a decision.  They could choose one of these prototypes or aspects of  all eight.  The big question that remains is whether or not Congress will  foot the heavy price tag with some estimates put at more than $20 billion.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, Otay Mesa, California.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me as well.  Have a great  evening, everybody and we will see you back here tomorrow night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The  industry was put to the test and passed with flying colors, as Alphabet,  Amazon, Microsoft, and Intel blew past earnings estimates.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Blockbuster deal.  CVS  Health is reportedly in talks to buy Aetna in what could be a  transformative deal for the health care industry.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  The fault in our stars.  Why your highly-rated mutual fund may not  be all it's cracked up to be?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday,  October 26th.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> Lots to tell you about tonight.  A possible major deal in health care, a  presidential push against opioid addiction, and a report that questions how  you probably pick mutual funds.  </p><p> We begin with major news about profits in tech land.  And they were good.   Expectations were high, and big tech did not disappoint.  Four major  companies reported quarterlies that were much stronger than anyone  expected.  </p><p> Let's start with Amazon.  The story here, simple: revenue, up.  Profit, up.   The stock, up.  </p><p> The company earned 52 cents a share.  Expectations were for three pennies.   Sales jumped more than 30 percent to about $43 billion year over year.   Investors, well, they're giddy, sending Amazon shares initially higher and  through the thousand dollar mark.  </p><p> Jackie DeAngelis zeroes in on the biggest surprise in Amazon's report.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  One of the key  points of interest for Amazon's third quarter earnings with how its web  services division did.  The company delivered.  That segment bringing in  revenue $4.58 billion, handily topping analysts' expectations.  </p><p>Amazon's Web Services or AWS is Amazon's version of the cloud.  It's an  emerging space where many companies are competing for share, and Amazon  appears to be one of the winners.  As business in the divisions grows, the  high bar will be more difficult to top.  But for this quarter, it was  certainly a standout.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Up next, Google's parent Alphabet.  It has a similar story and one  that any company would envy.  Alphabet's profit grew more than 30 percent.   Revenue jumped more than 20 percent.  Its stock got an initial lift from  upbeat shareholders after the bell.  </p><p> And Josh Lipton explains why.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It wasn't just a beat  on earnings and revenue.  It was also because Google is showing better  profitability.  Aaron Kessler of Raymond James says operating income came  in at $7.8 billion and that was better than what he expected.  Kessler  pointing out that a concern for investors has been declining margins for  Google.  They want to see better operating leverage for some time.  Now  with this report they got it.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Now to Microsoft.  It did report a better than expected profit.   Its demand for its fast-growing cloud computing services rose.  It also saw  its personal computer software business stabilize.  Revenue rose double  digits, and that sent shares of the Dow component up initially in after- hours trading, you say see there.  </p><p> HERERA:  One more to tell you about: Intel.  It too was helped by growth in  its cloud computing business.  The world's largest computer chip maker  topped earnings and revenue expectations and raised its full year revenue  and profit forecast.  Revenue from its higher margin data center business  was up as well.  And that helped the stock in initial late day trading.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, even before all of those results, the busiest day of  earnings season helped drive things today on Wall Street.  Better than  expected results from the likes of Twitter and Ford early set the tone.   More on those in a little bit.  </p><p> As for the major indexes, the Dow rose 71 points to 23400, but the Nasdaq  lost seven, and the S&amp;P 500 added three.  </p><p> HERERA:  Health care was all abuzz late today on a report that took most by  surprise.  CVS Health is reportedly in talks to buy Aetna.  As first  reported by \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the takeout price is said to be  about $200 a share, much higher than Aetna's current share price.  That  would put the deal's price tag at $66 billion, in what could be the largest  health insurance deal on record.  That sent shares of Aetna higher, much  higher in fact.  CVS shares finished the day lower.  </p><p> But this stock and other drugstores and pharmacy benefit managers' stocks  were pressured by reports that Amazon obtained its pharmacy license in a  number of sets.  </p><p> Meg Tirrell joins us here on set to talk about it.  </p><p> And there is an awful lot to talk about tonight, Meg.</p><p> MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p> HERERA:  Where do we really start with this story?  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Well, let's start with this report from \"The Wall Street Journal\"  that CVS is looking at buying Aetna.  This would be just a gigantic deal,  $200 a share.  And we'll note that Aetna's stock didn't trade up that high.   So, it implies the market might not believe this yet.  That would be a 25  percent premium to where the stock was trading before this report came out.  </p><p> And thinking about what this means for CVS, they already are both a  pharmacy benefits manager, so managing drug benefits for employers and  insurers, and they're a retail pharmacy, of course.  So, this would make  them yet another thing, giving them more power to potentially offer to  employers when trying to do services with them.  </p><p> We've seen this kind of bulking up in other companies.  UnitedHealth, for  example, which is the biggest health insurer in the United States, also has  a PBM in-house in Optum.  So, these companies are getting bigger and  bigger, you know, trying to get more sort of ability to offer things to  their customers.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  You know, there has been sort of a lot of sort of subcontracting  of various services in health care.  The insurer does your major medical,  but then somebody else handles your drugs and somebody else may handle your  mental health.</p><p> Are we about to see a consolidation, or maybe even a situation where not  only do insurers merge with the pharmacy benefit managers, but they may  merge with medical systems, health care companies, hospital companies,  health care delivery companies, a Kaiser model?  </p><p> TIRRELL:  All of that is probably in the air right now, especially because,  going to our second story of the night, there is the threat of Amazon  coming in and disrupting everything.  If a big player like that comes in,  the existing players, a lot of analysts are saying, are going to do  whatever they can to get more power in the market.  And that might mean  conglomeration.  </p><p> HERERA:  Amazon has gotten licenses in a number of states.  Do you view  that as more of a test as to how successful they could be, and then maybe  try and get licenses all across the country?  Or is there something else to  it?  </p><p> TIRRELL:  It's not totally clear what these licenses mean.  This is  reported today by \"The St. Louis Post Dispatch.\"  You know, it could just  mean it sort of supports existing things that Amazon already does.  </p><p> But a lot of people are very excited about seeing Amazon get into this  space, so interpret it as an initial move to get bigger into perhaps drug  distribution.  We don't know yet, the company hasn't said.  But CNBC.com's  Christine Farr has been reporting a lot on Amazon's moves here, implying  that they are probably are looking very closely at this.  </p><p> HERERA:  Thank you, Meg, as always.  Great to have you with us.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  Meg Tirrell.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  All right.  The health care industry paying close attention  today to the president, who declared the opioid crisis a public health  emergency.  By doing so, the government will waive some regulations and  give states more flexibility in how they use federal funds.  President  Trump stopped short of declaring a national state of emergency, but he said  he was going to go after bad actors.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I will be looking at the  potential of the federal government bringing major lawsuits against bad  actors, what they have and what they're doing to our people is unheard of.   We will be bringing some very major lawsuits against people and against  companies that are hurting our people.  And that will start taking place  pretty soon.</p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MATHISEN:  Meantime, the Fed chief, Janet Yellen, recently said the opioid  epidemic may be tied to declining labor force participation.  </p><p> HERERA:  The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics was arrested today  in an opioid-related case.  John Kapoor was charged with racketeering,  conspiracy and fraud.  The scheme alleges that he bribed doctors to  prescribe a powerful opioid to patients who didn't need it.  As we've  reported, Insys has been in settlement talks with the Justice Department in  connection with the probe.  Last December, six other executives were  indicted on federal charges.  Shares of Insys fell today by 22 2/3 percent.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Still ahead, written in the stars, or is it?  A new report says  Morningstar's familiar mutual fund star ratings aren't as predictive as you  may think.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  The economy now in the housing market pending home sales which  account for homes under contract but not yet sold sank to the lowest level  in three years, but it's not for a lack of buyers.  </p><p> Diana Olick explains what's behind the slump in the fall market.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A heavy  hurricane season in the South may have kept homebuyers there out of the  market last month.  But in the rest of the nation, home sales are being hit  by other headwinds -- high prices and little for sale.  </p><p> NELA RICHARDSON, REDFIN CHIEF ECONOMIST:  The tight inventory conditions  that we've been talking about pretty much ad nauseam all year finally came  to a head in September.  We saw the third consecutive month of year over  year declines.  Look, the tightness in inventory, the lack of affordable  housing and huge increases in prices are really tamping down sales.  </p><p> OLICK:  An index of pending home sales which measures signed contracts  during the month sat at the lowest level in nearly three years in  September.  While part of that may have been due to the heavy hurricane  season, sales have been lower annually for five of the past six months and  prices just continue to rise.  </p><p> RICHARDSON:  The only way out is to build more.  And right now, we are not  nearly keeping up with the demand for home ownership or for the rental part  of the market.  </p><p> OLICK:  Maryland real estate agent Eric Murtagh specializes in selling  newly built homes and says there is definitely high demand.  </p><p> ERIC MURTAGH, EVERS &amp; COMPANY REAL ESTATE:  You have people who want the  space.  They want the more input on the finishes.  We sell properties when  they're under construction like this, and so if a buyer comes along and  wants to pick their kitchen, their bathrooms, or do other options like an  elevator, we're set up to really help them with that.  </p><p> OLICK:  The trouble is a lack of labor.  Subcontractors are heading south  to rebuild after the hurricanes.  That makes building everywhere else more  expensive.  </p><p> MURTAGH:  That really comes into play when we're bidding out jobs, and you  only have one contractor available to do the work, it's not a competitive  environment.  And so, they're dictating what the cost of the project will  be.  </p><p> OLICK (on camera):  With so little new construction nationwide and the  labor shortage only getting worse, this housing market needs more sellers.   But we're heading into the slow season for that.  Winter usually puts a  chill on home sales.  But this year, they could be downright frozen.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  The House of Representatives narrowly cleared a budget blueprint  that will allow a tax bill to pass Congress without any Democratic votes.   The final tally for the budget vote was a tight 216-212, in part because a  number of Republicans from states with high state taxes voted against the  measure.  The current tax outline calls for the elimination of a popular  deduction for state and local taxes to help pay for other tax cuts.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  The Ways and Means Committee  will be putting out the specific plan very shortly.  And they're going to  work with all of our members to look at and consider and address their  concerns.  I believe that the Ways and Means Committee will be working with  these members in particular to find a solution.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee says he will  introduce a bill on November 1st and begin deliberations on the 6th.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  So, how would a reduction in corporate taxes affect the stock  market?  </p><p> Steve Liesman did some digging.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It would make sense  that with all the talk and all the apparent momentum towards cutting  corporate taxes, that the market would be pricing in at least some  possibility of it actually happening.  Corporate tax cuts will flow right  to the bottom line of companies, especially the high tax companies.  But  CNBC looked at three different baskets of high tax stocks.  The result: all  three are substantially underperforming the broader market.  </p><p> S&amp;P Global divided up into three different categories.  The top 100  taxpayers, they've returned 4.8 percent year to date.  The bottom 100  taxpayers returned 11 percent.  And then, you take out those companies that  are paying no tax.  They could be potentially troubled companies.  They're  up 24 percent year to date.  </p><p> Here's a basket of high tax stocks from Strategas and its performance  relative to the S&amp;P 500.  If it were 100, it would equal the broader market  performance.  Instead, it's been underperforming most of the year.  Now, it  topped last month when the tax outline was announced from the big six.  But  it seems to have come off again with the spat between Senator Corker and  President Trump.  That potentially diminishes the chance of passing the tax  cut package.  </p><p> Three reasons have been offered for this divergence.  First, the market may  not be appropriately pricing in the chance of a tax cut.  Second, it  doesn't believe these tax cuts are good for the economy or earnings since  they could accelerate rate hikes.  Third, the market just doesn't think tax  cuts will happen.  Dan Clifton of Strategas thinks the market is  underestimating the chance of passage and thinks there's money on the table  for investors.  </p><p> Michael Thompson, president of S&amp;P Global, points out the market is focused  on growth stocks, many of which don't pay high taxes, so it hasn't really  put a value on high tax companies.  </p><p> The right answer, the market can sometimes be inefficient, especially when  it comes to discounting political outcomes.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Four million users flocked to Twitter, and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The social media company added 4 million new users, reported its lowest net  loss in several quarters, and also topped Wall Street's revenue  expectations.  Twitter did say it overstated its monthly active user  numbers since the end of 2014, but investors turned their focus to the  company's upbeat guidance, which was that it may turn its first ever profit  next quarter.  Shares rose 18 percent to $20.31.  </p><p> Cost cuts and strong demand in North America helped lift sales above  expectations at Ford.  The automaker also over-delivered on profits.  Ford  says while it still has work to do, it's improving its financial health as  the industry moves into autonomous technology.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOB SHANKS, FORD CFO:  What we are working to do is improve the fitness of  the business better, as a really strong foundation as we enter a really  important transitional period for the whole sector, not only the company,  as we take advantage of new emerging technologies such as AVs and EVs and  so forth.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  Shares were up just about 2 percent to $12.27.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Celgene slashes its long term outlook.  The biotech said  difficult market conditions and some disappointments in its drug pipeline  would cause earnings and sales in 2020 to be lower than initially expected.   Celgene did beat estimates in its latest quarter but shares touched their  lowest level in 17 years, finishing down 16 percent at $99.99.  </p><p> Tenet Health Care may no longer be for sale.  \"Reuters\" says the hospital  operator has scrapped plans to sell itself following the earlier than  expected departure of its CEO this month.  But according to CNBC, a  strategic review is ongoing at the company and no options have been taken  off the table.  Still, shares down 9 percent to $12.87.  </p><p> And after the bell, Mattel, ouch, disappointing results, hurt by weak  demand and the bankruptcy of Toys \"R\" Us.  The toy maker said it would  suspend its quarterly dividend so it could strengthen its balance sheet and  increase financial flexibility.  Shares, as you see there, got crushed in  after-hours trading.  They finished the regular session down just a  fraction at $15.37.  </p><p> HERERA:  Profits came under pressure at UPS amid expanded Saturday delivery  and recent natural disasters.  But revenue climbed and the company issued  an upbeat outlook for the key holiday shipping season.  </p><p> Morgan Brennan has more.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  UPS expects to  deliver a staggering number of packages this holiday season -- 750 million.   It would be another record, a nearly 6 percent increase compared to last  year.  The delivery giant expects to handle at least 30 million packages or  double average daily volume on 17 out of the 21 shipping days that would  make up peak season.  </p><p> UPS's CFO Richard Peretz says it's crucial the company get the right return  on all of the investments it's making to keep up.  </p><p> RICHARD PERETZ, UPS CFO:  We keep getting asked to do different solutions  for our customers during peak.  And as we do that, we're putting new  resources in, creating temporary capacity.  There are very few businesses  in the world that can flex 100 percent of their average daily business for  a four to six-week period.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  According to a recent Deloitte Survey, for the first time ever,  more people will buy things online this holiday season than in stores.   Companies like UPS and FedEx have been pouring billions into their next to  expand capacity.  A year-round process that will be put to the ultimate  test in the month of December.  </p><p> To prepare, UPS is hiring 95,000 workers, opening more facilities, putting  three new Boeing-made jumbo jets into the air, and ramping up Saturday  delivery.  It's also slapping new quality surcharge on some packages  destined for door steps, a move analysts are watching closely, since rising  costs have been an issue during previous holiday season.  </p><p> DAVID VERNON, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; CO.:  From an investment standpoint, I  think the market is looking to see if UPS can handle the scaling of its  network to the degree that they have to scale it every fourth quarter.   Every year, e-commerce becomes bigger, every year, UPS has to do more to  make sure that Christmas gifts are delivered on time.  And I think the  market is still trying to make sure that UPS can do that and do that  profitably.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  And UPS isn't alone.  FedEx is hiring 50,000 additional workers  to handle its own record volumes.  The U.S. Postal Service has said it too  plans for a record, 850 million packages between Thanksgiving and New  Year's Eve.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, a five-star rating from the investment research firm  Morningstar has always meant a seal of approval for mutual funds.  Implicit  in its, the idea that the fund would remain a top performer.  Well, an  article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today questions that premise and the  Morningstar methodology, saying that a five-star rating isn't what you may  think it is.  </p><p> One of the articles' authors is with us tonight to discuss her findings.   She's Sarah Krouse, a reporter with \"The Wall Street Journal\". </p><p> Sarah, welcome.  Good to have you with us.</p><p> SARAH KROUSE, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Why don't you sort of tell us what you found?  But as I boil it  down, it is that once a fund becomes a five-star fund at Morningstar, not  always a five-star fund in the ensuing one, three, five, 10 years.  Boil it  down to me.  </p><p> KROUSE:  Sure.  So, we spent a year going through Morningstar's data.  And  one of the things that we found, the most striking, was five-star funds did  attract the vast majority of investor flows.  But very few of them failed  to outperform longer term.  So, for example, a five-star fund, take any  five-star fund, only 12 percent five years later had performed well enough  to earn that same top mark.  </p><p> HERERA:  So --  </p><p> KROUSE:  And a lot of investors rely heavily on those stars, some entirely,  to make their decisions.  </p><p> HERERA:  Morningstar I think would argue that they're constantly looking at  their data and their star system, and they've said they view it as somewhat  predictive.  Is that correct?  What response did you get from them?  </p><p> KROUSE:  Well, I would say that they've said a lot of things but the  predictive powers of the stars.  They've said that they're not predictive.   They've said that higher rated funds are more likely to outperform longer  term, that they have moderate predictive powers.  So, they've said a number  of things on that present.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  I want to play a sound bite from an interview I did early today  with Jeffrey Ptak.  He's the head of global manager research at  Morningstar.  It challenges some of the premises of your article.  So,  listen, and I'll get your reaction.  </p><p> KROUSE:  Sure.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JEFF PTAK, MORNINGSTAR HEAD OF RESEARCH:  We strongly disagree with her  conclusions.  If you take a look at some of the findings that they  themselves reported in exhibit to the study, what you find is that highly  rated funds, five-star funds are about seven times more likely to succeed  than low-rated funds, one-star funds, over a future 10-year horizon.  To  me, that doesn't look like failure.  That looks like a measure that's  tilting the odds of success in the investor's favor.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MATHISEN:  So, Jeffrey says he disputes the conclusion, and he cites his  data that the five-star funds are seven times more likely to be better  performers down the road than the one-star funds.  Is it possible that you  both are right?  </p><p> KROUSE:  Yes.  And we noted in the article that that was the case.  But  better is nearly average.  That the five-star funds we tracked over the 14  years in our study went on to become three-star performers.  So, that's --  it's -- one of the things that I think is important to keep in mind as we  talk about this is the way the star ratings are used.  </p><p> Morningstar licenses the ratings to fund firms who then include them in  their advertisements.  The implicit suggestion is that this five-star fund  will go on to outperform, and that's what our analysis showed was not the  case.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, how is an investor, given what you found out and researched,  how is an individual investor to use this data to the best of their  advantage?  </p><p> KROUSE:  Yes, it's a really important question.  And the premise on all of  this and why it's worth having this conversation is that investing in the  markets is difficult.  It's fraught with risk.  I would say that yes, a  rating and some of the metrics that Morningstar provides can be used as a  starting point.  </p><p> But what we found throughout our research and talking to investors is they  rely very heavily on it.  And Morningstar knows they rely heavily on it.   And in fact, in our piece, an executive that focuses on behavioral finance  at Morningstar stated that they know that investors misuse it and even he  questioned, you know, whether they need to do something about that.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  It was really an amazing piece of work, Sarah.  Whether you  agree with it or not, it was hard, hard work.  I recommend your article to  everybody.  </p><p> KROUSE:  Thank you.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Thanks very much.  Thanks for being with us.  </p><p> KROUSE:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Sarah Krouse of \"The Wall Street Journal\".</p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, the first glimpse of what a towering border wall might  look like. </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  President Trump's border wall may be taking another step  forward.  Today was the deadline for six companies to finish building  prototypes.  </p><p> Aditi Roy reports from the border in Otay Mesa, California.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For the  last 30 days, construction trucks have been humming.  The cranes have  soared.  And workers have been buzzing around this otherwise desolate,  dusty part of Otay Mesa, California.  It's two miles from the border  crossing with Mexico.  And the project they've been working on, building  eight versions of the border wall of the future.  </p><p> TRUMP:  We will build a great wall along the southern border.  </p><p> ROY:  One that fulfills President Trump's vision.  He spoke so frequently  about it on the campaign trail.  </p><p> The six construction companies behind these eight prototypes are W.G. Yates  and Sons, Elta North America, Caddell, Texas Sterling, KWR Construction and  Fisher Sands &amp; Gravel Company.  They were awarded contracts between  $300,000 and $500,000 and were chosen among hundreds of applicants.  </p><p> U.S. Customs and Border Patrol spokesman Carlos Diaz says the rules were  pretty simple.  </p><p> CARLOS DIAZ, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL SPOKESPERSON:  They had to have  anti-dig, anti-climb capabilities, they had anti-breach capabilities and  other number of capabilities that included being able to see through.  </p><p> ROY:  The reason?  As of two months ago, there were nearly 290,000 Border  Patrol apprehensions nationwide so far this year.  Last year, there were  more than 415,000.  We got an up close look at the current border wall with  holes in places it had been breached.  Those visible marks now guiding  enforcement agents as they get ready to test the prototypes.  </p><p> DIAZ:  We're going to be looking at the type of breaches that we see  throughout the southwest border.  We're going to be looking at techniques.</p><p> ROY (on camera):  The prototypes are between 18 and 30 feet high, compare  to the existing wall back there.  That's between eight to 10 feet high.  </p><p> (voice-over):  Ultimately, it's about making the most secure wall possible.  </p><p> DIAZ:  We're always trying to find ways to defeat and to deter those folks  from crossing to this side.  </p><p> ROY (on camera):  Border Patrol officials say they have no deadline for  making a decision.  They could choose one of these prototypes or aspects of  all eight.  The big question that remains is whether or not Congress will  foot the heavy price tag with some estimates put at more than $20 billion.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, Otay Mesa, California.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me as well.  Have a great  evening, everybody and we will see you back here tomorrow night.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

CVS  Health is reportedly in talks to buy Aetna in what could be a  transformative deal for the health care industry.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  The fault in our stars.  Why your highly-rated mutual fund may not  be all it's cracked up to be?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday,  October 26th.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>Lots to tell you about tonight.  A possible major deal in health care, a  presidential push against opioid addiction, and a report that questions how  you probably pick mutual funds.  </p><p>We begin with major news about profits in tech land.  And they were good.   Expectations were high, and big tech did not disappoint.  Four major  companies reported quarterlies that were much stronger than anyone  expected.  </p><p>Let's start with Amazon.  The story here, simple: revenue, up.  Profit, up.   The stock, up.  </p><p>The company earned 52 cents a share.  Expectations were for three pennies.   Sales jumped more than 30 percent to about $43 billion year over year.   Investors, well, they're giddy, sending Amazon shares initially higher and  through the thousand dollar mark.  </p><p>Jackie DeAngelis zeroes in on the biggest surprise in Amazon's report.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  One of the key  points of interest for Amazon's third quarter earnings with how its web  services division did.  The company delivered.  That segment bringing in  revenue $4.58 billion, handily topping analysts' expectations.  </p><p>Amazon's Web Services or AWS is Amazon's version of the cloud.  It's an  emerging space where many companies are competing for share, and Amazon  appears to be one of the winners.  As business in the divisions grows, the  high bar will be more difficult to top.  But for this quarter, it was  certainly a standout.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Up next, Google's parent Alphabet.  It has a similar story and one  that any company would envy.  Alphabet's profit grew more than 30 percent.   Revenue jumped more than 20 percent.  Its stock got an initial lift from  upbeat shareholders after the bell.  </p><p>And Josh Lipton explains why.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It wasn't just a beat  on earnings and revenue.  It was also because Google is showing better  profitability.  Aaron Kessler of Raymond James says operating income came  in at $7.8 billion and that was better than what he expected.  Kessler  pointing out that a concern for investors has been declining margins for  Google.  They want to see better operating leverage for some time.  Now  with this report they got it.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Now to Microsoft.  It did report a better than expected profit.   Its demand for its fast-growing cloud computing services rose.  It also saw  its personal computer software business stabilize.  Revenue rose double  digits, and that sent shares of the Dow component up initially in after- hours trading, you say see there.  </p><p>HERERA:  One more to tell you about: Intel.  It too was helped by growth in  its cloud computing business.  The world's largest computer chip maker  topped earnings and revenue expectations and raised its full year revenue  and profit forecast.  Revenue from its higher margin data center business  was up as well.  And that helped the stock in initial late day trading.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, even before all of those results, the busiest day of  earnings season helped drive things today on Wall Street.  Better than  expected results from the likes of Twitter and Ford early set the tone.   More on those in a little bit.  </p><p>As for the major indexes, the Dow rose 71 points to 23400, but the Nasdaq  lost seven, and the S&amp;P 500 added three.  </p><p>HERERA:  Health care was all abuzz late today on a report that took most by  surprise.  CVS Health is reportedly in talks to buy Aetna.  As first  reported by \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the takeout price is said to be  about $200 a share, much higher than Aetna's current share price.  That  would put the deal's price tag at $66 billion, in what could be the largest  health insurance deal on record.  That sent shares of Aetna higher, much  higher in fact.  CVS shares finished the day lower.  </p><p>But this stock and other drugstores and pharmacy benefit managers' stocks  were pressured by reports that Amazon obtained its pharmacy license in a  number of sets.  </p><p>Meg Tirrell joins us here on set to talk about it.  </p><p>And there is an awful lot to talk about tonight, Meg.</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>HERERA:  Where do we really start with this story?  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Well, let's start with this report from \"The Wall Street Journal\"  that CVS is looking at buying Aetna.  This would be just a gigantic deal,  $200 a share.  And we'll note that Aetna's stock didn't trade up that high.   So, it implies the market might not believe this yet.  That would be a 25  percent premium to where the stock was trading before this report came out.  </p><p>And thinking about what this means for CVS, they already are both a  pharmacy benefits manager, so managing drug benefits for employers and  insurers, and they're a retail pharmacy, of course.  So, this would make  them yet another thing, giving them more power to potentially offer to  employers when trying to do services with them.  </p><p>We've seen this kind of bulking up in other companies.  UnitedHealth, for  example, which is the biggest health insurer in the United States, also has  a PBM in-house in Optum.  So, these companies are getting bigger and  bigger, you know, trying to get more sort of ability to offer things to  their customers.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You know, there has been sort of a lot of sort of subcontracting  of various services in health care.  The insurer does your major medical,  but then somebody else handles your drugs and somebody else may handle your  mental health.</p><p>Are we about to see a consolidation, or maybe even a situation where not  only do insurers merge with the pharmacy benefit managers, but they may  merge with medical systems, health care companies, hospital companies,  health care delivery companies, a Kaiser model?  </p><p>TIRRELL:  All of that is probably in the air right now, especially because,  going to our second story of the night, there is the threat of Amazon  coming in and disrupting everything.  If a big player like that comes in,  the existing players, a lot of analysts are saying, are going to do  whatever they can to get more power in the market.  And that might mean  conglomeration.  </p><p>HERERA:  Amazon has gotten licenses in a number of states.  Do you view  that as more of a test as to how successful they could be, and then maybe  try and get licenses all across the country?  Or is there something else to  it?  </p><p>TIRRELL:  It's not totally clear what these licenses mean.  This is  reported today by \"The St. Louis Post Dispatch.\"  You know, it could just  mean it sort of supports existing things that Amazon already does.  </p><p>But a lot of people are very excited about seeing Amazon get into this  space, so interpret it as an initial move to get bigger into perhaps drug  distribution.  We don't know yet, the company hasn't said.  But CNBC.com's  Christine Farr has been reporting a lot on Amazon's moves here, implying  that they are probably are looking very closely at this.  </p><p>HERERA:  Thank you, Meg, as always.  Great to have you with us.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Meg Tirrell.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  The health care industry paying close attention  today to the president, who declared the opioid crisis a public health  emergency.  By doing so, the government will waive some regulations and  give states more flexibility in how they use federal funds.  President  Trump stopped short of declaring a national state of emergency, but he said  he was going to go after bad actors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I will be looking at the  potential of the federal government bringing major lawsuits against bad  actors, what they have and what they're doing to our people is unheard of.   We will be bringing some very major lawsuits against people and against  companies that are hurting our people.  And that will start taking place  pretty soon.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MATHISEN:  Meantime, the Fed chief, Janet Yellen, recently said the opioid  epidemic may be tied to declining labor force participation.  </p><p>HERERA:  The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics was arrested today  in an opioid-related case.  John Kapoor was charged with racketeering,  conspiracy and fraud.  The scheme alleges that he bribed doctors to  prescribe a powerful opioid to patients who didn't need it.  As we've  reported, Insys has been in settlement talks with the Justice Department in  connection with the probe.  Last December, six other executives were  indicted on federal charges.  Shares of Insys fell today by 22 2/3 percent.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Still ahead, written in the stars, or is it?  A new report says  Morningstar's familiar mutual fund star ratings aren't as predictive as you  may think.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The economy now in the housing market pending home sales which  account for homes under contract but not yet sold sank to the lowest level  in three years, but it's not for a lack of buyers.  </p><p>Diana Olick explains what's behind the slump in the fall market.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A heavy  hurricane season in the South may have kept homebuyers there out of the  market last month.  But in the rest of the nation, home sales are being hit  by other headwinds -- high prices and little for sale.  </p><p>NELA RICHARDSON, REDFIN CHIEF ECONOMIST:  The tight inventory conditions  that we've been talking about pretty much ad nauseam all year finally came  to a head in September.  We saw the third consecutive month of year over  year declines.  Look, the tightness in inventory, the lack of affordable  housing and huge increases in prices are really tamping down sales.  </p><p>OLICK:  An index of pending home sales which measures signed contracts  during the month sat at the lowest level in nearly three years in  September.  While part of that may have been due to the heavy hurricane  season, sales have been lower annually for five of the past six months and  prices just continue to rise.  </p><p>RICHARDSON:  The only way out is to build more.  And right now, we are not  nearly keeping up with the demand for home ownership or for the rental part  of the market.  </p><p>OLICK:  Maryland real estate agent Eric Murtagh specializes in selling  newly built homes and says there is definitely high demand.  </p><p>ERIC MURTAGH, EVERS &amp; COMPANY REAL ESTATE:  You have people who want the  space.  They want the more input on the finishes.  We sell properties when  they're under construction like this, and so if a buyer comes along and  wants to pick their kitchen, their bathrooms, or do other options like an  elevator, we're set up to really help them with that.  </p><p>OLICK:  The trouble is a lack of labor.  Subcontractors are heading south  to rebuild after the hurricanes.  That makes building everywhere else more  expensive.  </p><p>MURTAGH:  That really comes into play when we're bidding out jobs, and you  only have one contractor available to do the work, it's not a competitive  environment.  And so, they're dictating what the cost of the project will  be.  </p><p>OLICK (on camera):  With so little new construction nationwide and the  labor shortage only getting worse, this housing market needs more sellers.   But we're heading into the slow season for that.  Winter usually puts a  chill on home sales.  But this year, they could be downright frozen.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The House of Representatives narrowly cleared a budget blueprint  that will allow a tax bill to pass Congress without any Democratic votes.   The final tally for the budget vote was a tight 216-212, in part because a  number of Republicans from states with high state taxes voted against the  measure.  The current tax outline calls for the elimination of a popular  deduction for state and local taxes to help pay for other tax cuts.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  The Ways and Means Committee  will be putting out the specific plan very shortly.  And they're going to  work with all of our members to look at and consider and address their  concerns.  I believe that the Ways and Means Committee will be working with  these members in particular to find a solution.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee says he will  introduce a bill on November 1st and begin deliberations on the 6th.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  So, how would a reduction in corporate taxes affect the stock  market?  </p><p>Steve Liesman did some digging.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It would make sense  that with all the talk and all the apparent momentum towards cutting  corporate taxes, that the market would be pricing in at least some  possibility of it actually happening.  Corporate tax cuts will flow right  to the bottom line of companies, especially the high tax companies.  But  CNBC looked at three different baskets of high tax stocks.  The result: all  three are substantially underperforming the broader market.  </p><p>S&amp;P Global divided up into three different categories.  The top 100  taxpayers, they've returned 4.8 percent year to date.  The bottom 100  taxpayers returned 11 percent.  And then, you take out those companies that  are paying no tax.  They could be potentially troubled companies.  They're  up 24 percent year to date.  </p><p>Here's a basket of high tax stocks from Strategas and its performance  relative to the S&amp;P 500.  If it were 100, it would equal the broader market  performance.  Instead, it's been underperforming most of the year.  Now, it  topped last month when the tax outline was announced from the big six.  But  it seems to have come off again with the spat between Senator Corker and  President Trump.  That potentially diminishes the chance of passing the tax  cut package.  </p><p>Three reasons have been offered for this divergence.  First, the market may  not be appropriately pricing in the chance of a tax cut.  Second, it  doesn't believe these tax cuts are good for the economy or earnings since  they could accelerate rate hikes.  Third, the market just doesn't think tax  cuts will happen.  Dan Clifton of Strategas thinks the market is  underestimating the chance of passage and thinks there's money on the table  for investors.  </p><p>Michael Thompson, president of S&amp;P Global, points out the market is focused  on growth stocks, many of which don't pay high taxes, so it hasn't really  put a value on high tax companies.  </p><p>The right answer, the market can sometimes be inefficient, especially when  it comes to discounting political outcomes.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Four million users flocked to Twitter, and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The social media company added 4 million new users, reported its lowest net  loss in several quarters, and also topped Wall Street's revenue  expectations.  Twitter did say it overstated its monthly active user  numbers since the end of 2014, but investors turned their focus to the  company's upbeat guidance, which was that it may turn its first ever profit  next quarter.  Shares rose 18 percent to $20.31.  </p><p>Cost cuts and strong demand in North America helped lift sales above  expectations at Ford.  The automaker also over-delivered on profits.  Ford  says while it still has work to do, it's improving its financial health as  the industry moves into autonomous technology.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB SHANKS, FORD CFO:  What we are working to do is improve the fitness of  the business better, as a really strong foundation as we enter a really  important transitional period for the whole sector, not only the company,  as we take advantage of new emerging technologies such as AVs and EVs and  so forth.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  Shares were up just about 2 percent to $12.27.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Celgene slashes its long term outlook.  The biotech said  difficult market conditions and some disappointments in its drug pipeline  would cause earnings and sales in 2020 to be lower than initially expected.   Celgene did beat estimates in its latest quarter but shares touched their  lowest level in 17 years, finishing down 16 percent at $99.99.  </p><p>Tenet Health Care may no longer be for sale.  \"Reuters\" says the hospital  operator has scrapped plans to sell itself following the earlier than  expected departure of its CEO this month.  But according to CNBC, a  strategic review is ongoing at the company and no options have been taken  off the table.  Still, shares down 9 percent to $12.87.  </p><p>And after the bell, Mattel, ouch, disappointing results, hurt by weak  demand and the bankruptcy of Toys \"R\" Us.  The toy maker said it would  suspend its quarterly dividend so it could strengthen its balance sheet and  increase financial flexibility.  Shares, as you see there, got crushed in  after-hours trading.  They finished the regular session down just a  fraction at $15.37.  </p><p>HERERA:  Profits came under pressure at UPS amid expanded Saturday delivery  and recent natural disasters.  But revenue climbed and the company issued  an upbeat outlook for the key holiday shipping season.  </p><p>Morgan Brennan has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  UPS expects to  deliver a staggering number of packages this holiday season -- 750 million.   It would be another record, a nearly 6 percent increase compared to last  year.  The delivery giant expects to handle at least 30 million packages or  double average daily volume on 17 out of the 21 shipping days that would  make up peak season.  </p><p>UPS's CFO Richard Peretz says it's crucial the company get the right return  on all of the investments it's making to keep up.  </p><p>RICHARD PERETZ, UPS CFO:  We keep getting asked to do different solutions  for our customers during peak.  And as we do that, we're putting new  resources in, creating temporary capacity.  There are very few businesses  in the world that can flex 100 percent of their average daily business for  a four to six-week period.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  According to a recent Deloitte Survey, for the first time ever,  more people will buy things online this holiday season than in stores.   Companies like UPS and FedEx have been pouring billions into their next to  expand capacity.  A year-round process that will be put to the ultimate  test in the month of December.  </p><p>To prepare, UPS is hiring 95,000 workers, opening more facilities, putting  three new Boeing-made jumbo jets into the air, and ramping up Saturday  delivery.  It's also slapping new quality surcharge on some packages  destined for door steps, a move analysts are watching closely, since rising  costs have been an issue during previous holiday season.  </p><p>DAVID VERNON, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; CO.:  From an investment standpoint, I  think the market is looking to see if UPS can handle the scaling of its  network to the degree that they have to scale it every fourth quarter.   Every year, e-commerce becomes bigger, every year, UPS has to do more to  make sure that Christmas gifts are delivered on time.  And I think the  market is still trying to make sure that UPS can do that and do that  profitably.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  And UPS isn't alone.  FedEx is hiring 50,000 additional workers  to handle its own record volumes.  The U.S. Postal Service has said it too  plans for a record, 850 million packages between Thanksgiving and New  Year's Eve.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, a five-star rating from the investment research firm  Morningstar has always meant a seal of approval for mutual funds.  Implicit  in its, the idea that the fund would remain a top performer.  Well, an  article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today questions that premise and the  Morningstar methodology, saying that a five-star rating isn't what you may  think it is.  </p><p>One of the articles' authors is with us tonight to discuss her findings.   She's Sarah Krouse, a reporter with \"The Wall Street Journal\". </p><p>Sarah, welcome.  Good to have you with us.</p><p>SARAH KROUSE, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Why don't you sort of tell us what you found?  But as I boil it  down, it is that once a fund becomes a five-star fund at Morningstar, not  always a five-star fund in the ensuing one, three, five, 10 years.  Boil it  down to me.  </p><p>KROUSE:  Sure.  So, we spent a year going through Morningstar's data.  And  one of the things that we found, the most striking, was five-star funds did  attract the vast majority of investor flows.  But very few of them failed  to outperform longer term.  So, for example, a five-star fund, take any  five-star fund, only 12 percent five years later had performed well enough  to earn that same top mark.  </p><p>HERERA:  So --  </p><p>KROUSE:  And a lot of investors rely heavily on those stars, some entirely,  to make their decisions.  </p><p>HERERA:  Morningstar I think would argue that they're constantly looking at  their data and their star system, and they've said they view it as somewhat  predictive.  Is that correct?  What response did you get from them?  </p><p>KROUSE:  Well, I would say that they've said a lot of things but the  predictive powers of the stars.  They've said that they're not predictive.   They've said that higher rated funds are more likely to outperform longer  term, that they have moderate predictive powers.  So, they've said a number  of things on that present.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  I want to play a sound bite from an interview I did early today  with Jeffrey Ptak.  He's the head of global manager research at  Morningstar.  It challenges some of the premises of your article.  So,  listen, and I'll get your reaction.  </p><p>KROUSE:  Sure.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF PTAK, MORNINGSTAR HEAD OF RESEARCH:  We strongly disagree with her  conclusions.  If you take a look at some of the findings that they  themselves reported in exhibit to the study, what you find is that highly  rated funds, five-star funds are about seven times more likely to succeed  than low-rated funds, one-star funds, over a future 10-year horizon.  To  me, that doesn't look like failure.  That looks like a measure that's  tilting the odds of success in the investor's favor.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So, Jeffrey says he disputes the conclusion, and he cites his  data that the five-star funds are seven times more likely to be better  performers down the road than the one-star funds.  Is it possible that you  both are right?  </p><p>KROUSE:  Yes.  And we noted in the article that that was the case.  But  better is nearly average.  That the five-star funds we tracked over the 14  years in our study went on to become three-star performers.  So, that's --  it's -- one of the things that I think is important to keep in mind as we  talk about this is the way the star ratings are used.  </p><p>Morningstar licenses the ratings to fund firms who then include them in  their advertisements.  The implicit suggestion is that this five-star fund  will go on to outperform, and that's what our analysis showed was not the  case.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, how is an investor, given what you found out and researched,  how is an individual investor to use this data to the best of their  advantage?  </p><p>KROUSE:  Yes, it's a really important question.  And the premise on all of  this and why it's worth having this conversation is that investing in the  markets is difficult.  It's fraught with risk.  I would say that yes, a  rating and some of the metrics that Morningstar provides can be used as a  starting point.  </p><p>But what we found throughout our research and talking to investors is they  rely very heavily on it.  And Morningstar knows they rely heavily on it.   And in fact, in our piece, an executive that focuses on behavioral finance  at Morningstar stated that they know that investors misuse it and even he  questioned, you know, whether they need to do something about that.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  It was really an amazing piece of work, Sarah.  Whether you  agree with it or not, it was hard, hard work.  I recommend your article to  everybody.  </p><p>KROUSE:  Thank you.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Thanks very much.  Thanks for being with us.  </p><p>KROUSE:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Sarah Krouse of \"The Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, the first glimpse of what a towering border wall might  look like. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  President Trump's border wall may be taking another step  forward.  Today was the deadline for six companies to finish building  prototypes.  </p><p>Aditi Roy reports from the border in Otay Mesa, California.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For the  last 30 days, construction trucks have been humming.  The cranes have  soared.  And workers have been buzzing around this otherwise desolate,  dusty part of Otay Mesa, California.  It's two miles from the border  crossing with Mexico.  And the project they've been working on, building  eight versions of the border wall of the future.  </p><p>TRUMP:  We will build a great wall along the southern border.  </p><p>ROY:  One that fulfills President Trump's vision.  He spoke so frequently  about it on the campaign trail.  </p><p>The six construction companies behind these eight prototypes are W.G. Yates  and Sons, Elta North America, Caddell, Texas Sterling, KWR Construction and  Fisher Sands &amp; Gravel Company.  They were awarded contracts between  $300,000 and $500,000 and were chosen among hundreds of applicants.  </p><p>U.S. Customs and Border Patrol spokesman Carlos Diaz says the rules were  pretty simple.  </p><p>CARLOS DIAZ, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL SPOKESPERSON:  They had to have  anti-dig, anti-climb capabilities, they had anti-breach capabilities and  other number of capabilities that included being able to see through.  </p><p>ROY:  The reason?  As of two months ago, there were nearly 290,000 Border  Patrol apprehensions nationwide so far this year.  Last year, there were  more than 415,000.  We got an up close look at the current border wall with  holes in places it had been breached.  Those visible marks now guiding  enforcement agents as they get ready to test the prototypes.  </p><p>DIAZ:  We're going to be looking at the type of breaches that we see  throughout the southwest border.  We're going to be looking at techniques.</p><p>ROY (on camera):  The prototypes are between 18 and 30 feet high, compare  to the existing wall back there.  That's between eight to 10 feet high.  </p><p>(voice-over):  Ultimately, it's about making the most secure wall possible.  </p><p>DIAZ:  We're always trying to find ways to defeat and to deter those folks  from crossing to this side.  </p><p>ROY (on camera):  Border Patrol officials say they have no deadline for  making a decision.  They could choose one of these prototypes or aspects of  all eight.

Stocks suffer  their worst monthly performance since January.  And the week ahead holds  several more catalysts investors need to keep an eye on.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Merger mania.  General  Electric (NYSE:GE) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) cap off a record month of  merger activity.  Will the deal-making continue and which sectors might see  some action?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  And a fortune of fright.  How one woman turned her love of  Halloween into millions.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, October 31st.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone.  And welcome.  And happy Halloween.  </p><p>OK.  So there haven't been dramatic drops or crashes as in Octobers' past,  but the trading month that just ended a couple hours ago on this Halloween  evening has had its share of spooky moments.  Plenty enough to send a chill  down a random spine or a hair to stand up straight on a sensitive  investor's neck.  No, the losses weren't ghoulish, but the major average  did suffer their worst monthly performances since January, and it could  have been worse if banks and some big tech names hadn't held their own and  bolstered the performance.  </p><p>And today, oil did fall to a one month low over uncertainty about an OPEC  production cut.  </p><p>As for stocks today, not too scary.  The Dow dropping a modest 18 points to  18,142, NASDAQ down nearly a point, and the S&amp;P was off just the slightest  fraction.  </p><p>HERERA:  And now to a deal we told you on Friday might happen.  General  electric has agreed to combine its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BHI) and will create a new publicly traded company which will be  majority-owned by GE.  GE shares were essentially flat, but Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BHI) was down 6 percent.  </p><p>Morgan Brennan has more on the tie-up.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's all about  energy.  The new Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) will combine the world's largest  oil field equipment manufacturer, GE, with the number three oiled field  services firm, creating a company with $32 billion in revenue, second only  to rival, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).  GE will merge with the entirety of  Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), a move that will have the industrial giant owning  the majority of the new company without spending tens of billions of  dollars to actually make an acquisition.  </p><p>Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) shareholders will own the rest, with GE raising  more than $7 billion to pay them a one-time special dividend.  GE's oil and  gas chief Lorenzo Simonelli will run the entity, expected by the middle of  next year.  CEO Jeff Immelt saying the structure of the deal will have tax  advantages, and will allow for flexibility around capital allocation.  </p><p>JEFF IMMELT, GE CHAIRMAN AND CEO:  Let's say the industry remains tough.   This is still value accretive to both investors and a tough oil price  environment.  If their pricing gets better, it allows us to benefit that  from that, as well.  It's a very diversified portfolio in terms of short  cycle and longer cycle operations.  So I think it just gives us a chance to  weather the cycle better.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  The transaction assumes a, quote, \"slow recovery\" in oil with  prices estimated at $45 to $50 a barrel through 2019.  The new company will  be a one stop services shop for everything from fracking to power  generation, establishing a formidable competitor to other oiled field  services giants like Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), National Oilwell Varco and  Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), which had tried unsuccessfully to buy Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BHI) earlier this year.  </p><p>It also leverages GE's big data push through Internet of things technology.   And analysts say it comes at a time when the broader industry has been  engaged in a race to the bottom in terms of pricing.  </p><p>JOATHAN GARRETT, WOOD MACKENZIE PRINCIPAL ANALYST:  If not at the exact  bottom, we're pretty close.  And we spent a lot of time listening and  reading through some of the earnings calls as of late.  We have had seven  quarters of margins getting squeezed.  It looks like, you know, pricing is  starting to hold. </p><p>You know, we're not seeing meaningful upticks in terms of prices that OFS  can sort of market for their services.  But we have certainly not seen them  move meaningfully down from this quarter to the last.  So, it looks like  we're pretty close to that bottom.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  The deal could also spark a flurry of consolidation in oil field  services.  As major competitors look to beef up their own offerings with  smaller firms that have been squeezed as service prices plunge.  Analysts  say firms with exposure to the Permian Basin where energy activity  continues might be attractive, as well as energy companies with  manufacturing operations like oil states international and fracking-related  operations, such as superior energy and RPC (NYSE:RES). </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) will buy level three communications for  $25 billion, sizeable deal here.  It expands CenturyLink's fiber optic  network and high speed data service for corporate clients, also let's  CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) better compete with the likes of AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon (NYSE:VZ).  Shares of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) down sharply off 12.5  percent, but level 3 was up nearly 4 percent.  </p><p>HERERA:  And TeamHealth is going private.  Selling itself to private equity  firm, Blackstone, for a little over $6 billion.  The hospital staffing  company turned down a $5 billion offer last year from rival AmSurg.  Shares  of TeamHealth jumped on the trading session by better than 16 percent.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reportedly wants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  to get in on Time Warner (NYSE:TWX).  \"The New York Post\" says Goldman is  nudging -- that's banker talk -- nudging Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make a bid  on TW.  AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) has agreed to buy the media company for $85 billion.   The biggest deal Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has ever done so far was in 2014 when  it bought Beats, the speaker and headphone company, for $3 billion.  </p><p>HERERA:  And October has been a record-setting month for M&amp;A deals in the  U.S.  The value of announced deals are adding up to about $337 billion,  surpassing the previous high of $82 billion back in January of 2000.  </p><p>Richard Peterson, senior director at S&amp;P global market intelligence, joins  us now to talk about whether or not this frenzy in M&amp;A is going to  continue.  </p><p>Good to see you, Richard.  Welcome back.  </p><p>RICHARD PETERSON, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE:  Hello, Sue.  Hello,  Tyler.  </p><p>HERERA:  What do you make of this so far?  We have talked a little bit in  the past of why this flurry of activity now.  And will it continue?  </p><p>PETERSON:  Well, it's really a continuation of what has been transpiring  over the past several years.  The fact this year in 2016, there's been over  $1.4 trillion in announced U.S. M&amp;A and marks the fourth consecutive year  of over $1 trillion in deal activity.  Last year was a record year, over $2  trillion.  And even though there's been a flurry of deals this month as you  accurately said, October has over $300 billion, our record month.  We're  still down year over year from where we were at this time.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  So is it just coincidence that so many of these deals came  together in this month?  </p><p>PETERSON:  Well, I think it's -- various factors.  With Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BHI), they had the merger with Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), which was  called off by regulatory concerns.  We are upon GE, stepped in, looking for  ideas.  I think a former partnership, I think with Time Warner (NYSE:TWX)  and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T).  That's a factor of the media consolidation and desire  for AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) to own the content, rather than be just a distributor of  the product.  </p><p>I think if you look at these deals, just the two top deals this month, in  the AT&amp;T (NYSE:T)/Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) deal and British American  Tobacco's $58 billion purchase, just announced, remaining stakes of  Reynolds America, those two deals count for half the deal value this month.  </p><p>HERERA:  Absolutely.  Does it have anything to do with the fact that  interest rates are low, even though the Fed is expected to raise interest  rates once this year, you know, the time before the end of the year is  getting pretty short.  So, does that kind of incremental move in interest  rates influence these deals?  </p><p>PETERSON:  I think it's very marginal, the fact you have companies that are  awash in cash, that even though corporate profits may be flat for this  year, corporate profits still at elevated levels.  I think the companies  see their peers make acquisitions, whereupon they're forced to make  comparable moves.  It's more like a chess board, when rook takes pawn and  bishop wants to take knight and all these variations that go about.</p><p>MATHISEN:  OK.  So, you just teed up the next question.  Where next, who  next?  More in energy, finance?  Health care?  What, and who might be  bought or sold?  </p><p>PETERSON:  Well, it's the usual suspects.  That being top sections this  year are consumer discretionary by virtue of media, health care,  information technology and real estate, which is actually the reclassified  sector, which came out of financial earlier this year.  I think I look for  probably bigger deals in technology going forward.  I think in terms of the  media, we have talked that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) may make a  move in light of what AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) did with Time Warner (NYSE:TWX).  </p><p>And I think also, again in financials, considering what happens with the  election next year, some companies may desire to quickly merge by the  bounce of this year before the change happens in 2017.  </p><p>HERERA:  What does history tell us, if anything at all, about how the  market performs the year following, you know, a quarter of heavy deal- making?  </p><p>PETERSON:  Sure.  I mean, there's two ways to look at it.  We crunched some  numbers at S&amp;P global markets intelligence.  You look at the top months for  M&amp;A activity, the following month tend to be negative.  So, the top five  months looking at the following month, the average decline over 2 percent.  </p><p>Conversely, look at the top deals on average, one-year period following  those top deal announcements, the average gain was 9 percent.  So, some  good news for the bears and some for the bulls.  </p><p>HERERA:  Thank you, Richard.  Appreciate it.  Richard Peterson of S&amp;P  global market intelligence.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, October is finished, and as Bill Belichick might say, it's  on to November.  And the first ten days could be nothing short of a Super  Bowl of big data and even bigger decisions.  </p><p>Bob Pisani has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Wall Street is keeping  an eye on a handful of key catalysts this week, starting with the election.   The markets pricing in a Clinton victory with the House remaining  Republican, so any evidence to the contrary could shake things up.  Already  for the month, we have seen health care stocks like CardinalHealth and  McKesson (NYSE:MCK) down big-time, thanks to drug pricing concerns.  </p><p>It's going to be another busy earnings week ahead with names like Sony  (NYSE:SNE), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alibaba, all  reporting in the next few days.  </p><p>We have ended the earnings recession for now.  That's the good news.  But  we're still waiting on 200 more companies to report results.  The Federal  Reserve kicks off its two-day meeting on interest rates tomorrow and the  markets are widely expecting them to signal a rate hike in December.  But  no major surprises expected when both the Bank of Japan and Bank of England  meet later this week.  </p><p>Finally, any clues from the widely watched October jobs report on Friday  will help solidify expectations for the Fed even further. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Another thing the market is intently watching, anything coming  out of the FBI's investigation into new e-mails related to Hillary  Clinton's private server.  </p><p>Eamon Javers is on the case.  </p><p>What can you tell us, Eamon?  </p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Hi, Tyler.  </p><p>What we know of as of this evening, FBI officials carefully going through  the e-mails now that they have a warrant in place to search them.  They're  using a software program that sorts out any e-mails that were previously  turned over to the FBI as part of the investigation and looking for  anything that might not have been turned over.  If they find any of that,  they'll look through it and try to figure out whether or not there's any  classified information in there, as part of this Clinton probe.  </p><p>We're also learning a little bit of context here about FBI director, James  Comey's decision-making to release this information before the election.   I'm told by a former FBI official that this is an extraordinary decision  for Comey to take, in particular because earlier this year, when the FBI  and U.S. intelligence agencies were discussing whether or not to name  Russia as a state entity that was trying to mettle in U.S. elections, Comey  argued internally and privately, it should not be done publicly, because it  was getting too close to the election.  </p><p>So, my source saying that's extraordinary, given that he ultimately made  the decision to go forward with the Clinton e-mails on Friday, guys.  </p><p>HERERA:  How fast, though, can they look at these, as we get -- ever closer  to the election?  Have they made any comment on the speed with which they  can investigate?  </p><p>JAVERS:  The FBI is saying nothing public about this.  It's not even clear  that Director Comey will come out and say anything publicly between now and  the election.  But I talked to a former FBI official today who said that  technologically, they can do this in days and have what the source called a  preliminary read on these e-mails and have at least a preliminary  indication of what's in there.  </p><p>But whether they will release that preliminary indication to the public  between now and Election Day is really anybody's guess at this point.  One  official telling me that we are in uncharted territory here.  This has  simply never happened before at the FBI.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Do we have a quick count of how many e-mails they're looking at?  </p><p>JAVERS:  Well, we think the total universe is 650,000.  That might be a  meaningless number, though, because there are so many duplicates in their  attachments and spam and other things.  The subset that would apply here  would be much, much smaller than that, Tyler.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Eamon, thank you very much.  Eamon Javers in Washington.  </p><p>HERERA:  And straight ahead, why the newest trend in what women are buying  is great news for the housing industry.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Consumer spending rose more than expected last month, spending  did rise a half percent in September, a tenth of a percent more than  estimates.  The increase was due in part to the public buying more  automobiles.  Personal income also inched higher but by less than expected.   However, Americans did save less last month, amassing nearly $800 billion  down from $820 billion in August.  </p><p>HERERA:  Investors and companies are increasingly looking for business  models that revolve around services.  Being dubbed the subscription  economy, analysts are looking at the success of Amazon's prime service, and  calling for other companies to follow suit.  </p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look at what subscription bundling means for  investors, and where the benefits and pitfalls may lie.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  One of the hottest  business investing trends is a very old idea -- subscriptions.  Amazon's  huge success of its $99 a year prime service has CEOs and investors chasing  similar business models.  Software maker Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) has  turned to a cloud subscription format in recent years and shares doubled  since 2013, and most other tech giants are trying to follow the same path.   AT&amp;T's plan purchase of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) is also a bid for a better  subscription bundle of wireless service and entertainment, and a more  durable with costumers.  </p><p>All this has led analysts to propose Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) prime, a package  of an iPhone, iTunes and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV as a fix for flattening  smartphone sales.  </p><p>One media consultant has even floated Disney (NYSE:DIS) as a service or pay  one price access to Disney's entire TV and entertainment output, plus theme  park discounts.  </p><p>So, what's behind all of this?  Subscription fees means steady revenues and  a sticky relationship directly with customers, with customers attention so  fragmented in the social media age, the cost of locating and acquiring  customers has gone up far faster than the more predictable expense of  delivering a product or service, even many less virtual are being viewed  through the prism of subscriptions.  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Dunkin  Brands have pushed sophisticated rewards programs that almost make  subscribers out of their customers for instance.  As with any Wall Street  trend, there is a risk this idea will be misapplied to some companies and  taken too far by others.  </p><p>For now, though, expect to hear more CEOs touting the virtues of  subscriptions.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli at the New York Stock  Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Nike (NYSE:NKE) gets hit on a stock downgrade and that is where  we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Merrill Lynch cut the Dow component's rating to  underperform, which is essentially a sell down from neutral, citing an  increase in competition from companies like Adidas and Under Armour  (NYSE:UA).  The bank also slashed its price target on Nike (NYSE:NKE) to  $46, down from $55, saying it's not convinced Nike (NYSE:NKE) has  innovative products in its pipeline.  Shares were off 3 1/2 percent to  $50.18.  </p><p>Cost cuts helped turn energy firm Williams Company turned a profit in the  latest quarter with results exceeding estimates.  The company also said its  revenue grew.  Even so, Williams' shares finished the day down more than  1.5 percent at $29.20.  </p><p>The power supplier Southern (NYSE:SO) Company topped analysts' profit  expectations, thanks to higher retail revenue and strong performance in a  company subsidiary.  Southern (NYSE:SO) Company also saw its revenue rise.   Shares rose 87 cents to $51.57.  </p><p>HERERA:  Pharmaceutical distributor, CardinalHealth, said drug pricing  pressures caused profit to fall but still, the results managed to surpass  estimates.  The company also posted higher than expected sales.  However,  Cardinal cut its earnings outlook for the year, citing short term headwinds  in the pharmaceutical business.  Shares nonetheless rose 2 percent to  $68.69.  </p><p>Xerox (NYSE:XRX) says it has reached a settlement with its largest  individual shareholder who we told you sued the copier maker last month,  alleging the company's plan spinoff violated an existing contract  agreement.  Under the settlement, Darwin Deason will be given 300,000  shares in the company's two businesses.  Shares fell marginally to $9.77.  </p><p>And network equipment maker, Brocade, may be interested in selling itself.   As first reported by Bloomberg, the company is in advanced talks and close  to entering the final stages of a sale process.  The potential deal which  could be reached as early as this week has attracted interest from chip  maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM).  Shares soared almost 22 percent to $10.60.  </p><p>And Valeant Pharmaceuticals isn't out of the woods quite yet.  Bloomberg  said the drug maker's former CEO and CFOR are being investigated by  authorities regarding potential accounting fraud.  The report added the  investigation could lead to charges within weeks.  Valiant said it had  previously disclosed that investigation.  Valeant shares tanked more than  12 percent on the news to $17.84.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) will pay $50 million to settle a lawsuit  accusing the bank of overcharging hundreds of thousands of homeowners for  appraisals that were ordered after they defaulted on their mortgages.  The  settlement would resolve claims that Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) charged more  than it paid for third-party appraisals.  Mortgage agreements do let banks  charge owners who default on their loans for those appraisals.  But the  lawsuit says Wells charged up to $125 when their actual cost was $50 or  even less.  </p><p>HERERA:  Traditionally, males and married couples have been the main buyers  of homes.  But now, single women are becoming home owners more than men.   In fact, this year females have bought twice as much as their male  counterparts.  </p><p>Diana Olick has more on this new trend in housing.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Adrienne Nassau just  closed on this three-bedroom home in Maryland.  It's a fixer upper, but she  is looking forward to the project.  </p><p>ADRIENNE NASSAU, HOME BUYER:  I actually think I'm simplifying my life.  </p><p>OLICK:  Nassau, widowed, now 15 years, sold her large family home on the  eastern shore and intends to sell the con low she is living in now in  nearby Bethesda.  Even in her retirement, she still thinks ownership is  worth it.  </p><p>NASSAU:  I think when you own, you can do with a house whatever you want.   You can make it your own.  You can make whatever improvements you feel  comfortable with.  </p><p>OLICK:  Nassau is one of a growing share of single women in the housing  market.  They now make up 17 percent of home buyers, more than twice the  share of single men.  This, despite the fact that women still earn less  than men for the same jobs.  </p><p>NASSAU:  There are women in the workplace who earn good money, who are  professionals, and who are independent in their thinking and feel they're  able to cope with taking on a house.  </p><p>OLICK:  In the past, women had a harder time getting mortgages on their  own, and often had to have someone else cosign the loan.  That  discrimination is gone today, but men do tend to have higher credit scores  than women, likely because men make more money.  </p><p>After living with her daughters for a while and then renting for a year,  68-year-old Barbara Jennai just bought a condo in an age-restricted  community using part of her retirement savings and a reverse mortgage.  </p><p>BARBARA JENNAI, HOME BUYER:  Instead of $1,400, I'm paying $400 a month and  that's all I'll have to pay for as long as I live in this condo.  </p><p>OLICK:  Jennai still works full time as a teacher, but her salary was  barely covering the rent.  By buying in the same building where she was  renting, Jennai not only saves money, but has something to show for it.  </p><p>JENNAI:  For me, this is the first time that I have ever owned in America  in my life.  So I walk in every day, I say, \"Hello beautiful home,\" it's  mine.  </p><p>OLICK:  A greeting more and more women are now embracing all on their own.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Chevy Chase, Maryland.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up, how giving people a good scare has turned into good  business.  That's next.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Here's what's to watch tomorrow, folks.  </p><p>As we mentioned earlier, the Federal Reserve begins its two-day policy  meeting where it will decide whether or not to raise interest rates.  We  get a look at the manufacturing sector when the Institute for Supply  Management releases its October index and the Dow component Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) will post its latest quarterly results.  And that is what to  watch Tuesday.  </p><p>HERERA:  And finally tonight, who wouldn't want a job they love?  Well, one  media pro took her fascination with Halloween to a whole new level,  quitting her day job to make millions in the horror space.  </p><p>Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) bravely takes us to Randall's Island, New York. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  For some people, being  terrified is actually fun.  </p><p>And Melissa Carbone is cashing in.  </p><p>MELISSA CARBONE, TEN THIRTY ONE PRODUCTIONS:  Fear is America's favorite  drug, like, 100 percent.  Fear is actually a real physical reaction.  </p><p>ROGERS:  Oh, I know.  </p><p>Oh, my gosh.  This is a dead end!  </p><p>The founder of 1031 productions always loved Halloween, but it wasn't until  she began decorating her own home in Los Angeles years ago that it hit her.   There might be a real business behind scaring people.  </p><p>CARBONE:  I didn't realize that it was such a thing for me.  Trick or  treating and handing out candy wasn't enough.  It kept building for me and  then I realized how much I love the genre.  </p><p>ROGERS:  At the time, she was working in marketing at Clear Channel  worldwide.  She and her co-founder, Allison Richards, began saving and  plotting for a large-scale haunted hayride.  They drained their life- savings and raised half a million dollars from friends and family, as well  as their sponsor, Mini Cooper, to launch in L.A. in 2009.  </p><p>CARBONE:  I feel like we have pioneered a whole new industry.  </p><p>ROGERS:  They're not going to get too close to me, right?  See, that's not  bad.  They're cute.  </p><p>Ten Thirty One broke even their first year and continued to grow.  This is  their second year hosting the New York haunted hayride on Randall's Island.   The company now has eight attractions from February through November in New  York and California, raking in $3 million last year and securing a $2  million investment from Mark Cuban on \"Shark Tank\" and another undisclosed  investment from Live Nation along the way.  </p><p>CARBONE:  I get to make a living by building and creating these  environments that people typically would not get to experience.  That  people can remember physically and not necessarily mentally.  </p><p>ROGERS:  Hayride attendees will experience a storyline that's a full year  in the making with more than 100 live actors.  Between New York and Los  Angeles, about 130,000 people will attend the event this year.  The  scariest part, the blackout maze, even in the daytime.  </p><p>(SCREAMING)</p><p>ROGERS:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG), trying to  escape from Randall's Island, New York.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She just took the emergency -- </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  She's never going to be the same.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Kate doesn't scare easily.  </p><p>HERERA:  She doesn't, but that was the emergency exit she went out.  </p><p>That does it tonight for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me as well.  Have a great  evening, everybody.  Happy Halloween.  We'll see you tomorrow. </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Stocks suffer their worst monthly performance since January. And the week ahead holds several more catalysts investors need to keep an eye on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Merger mania. General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) cap off a record month of merger activity. Will the deal-making continue and which sectors might see some action?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: And a fortune of fright. How one woman turned her love of Halloween into millions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, October 31st.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone. And welcome. And happy Halloween.</p><p>OK. So there haven`t been dramatic drops or crashes as in Octobers` past, but the trading month that just ended a couple hours ago on this Halloween evening has had its share of spooky moments. Plenty enough to send a chill down a random spine or a hair to stand up straight on a sensitive investor`s neck. No, the losses weren`t ghoulish, but the major average did suffer their worst monthly performances since January, and it could have been worse if banks and some big tech names hadn`t held their own and bolstered the performance.</p><p>And today, oil did fall to a one month low over uncertainty about an OPEC production cut.</p><p>As for stocks today, not too scary. The Dow dropping a modest 18 points to 18,142, NASDAQ down nearly a point, and the S&amp;P was off just the slightest fraction.</p><p>HERERA: And now to a deal we told you on Friday might happen. General electric has agreed to combine its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) and will create a new publicly traded company which will be majority-owned by GE. GE shares were essentially flat, but Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) was down 6 percent.</p><p>Morgan Brennan has more on the tie-up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s all about energy. The new Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) will combine the world`s largest oil field equipment manufacturer, GE, with the number three oiled field services firm, creating a company with $32 billion in revenue, second only to rival, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). GE will merge with the entirety of Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), a move that will have the industrial giant owning the majority of the new company without spending tens of billions of dollars to actually make an acquisition.</p><p>Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) shareholders will own the rest, with GE raising more than $7 billion to pay them a one-time special dividend. GE`s oil and gas chief Lorenzo Simonelli will run the entity, expected by the middle of next year. CEO Jeff Immelt saying the structure of the deal will have tax advantages, and will allow for flexibility around capital allocation.</p><p>JEFF IMMELT, GE CHAIRMAN AND CEO: Let`s say the industry remains tough. This is still value accretive to both investors and a tough oil price environment. If their pricing gets better, it allows us to benefit that from that, as well. It`s a very diversified portfolio in terms of short cycle and longer cycle operations. So I think it just gives us a chance to weather the cycle better.</p><p>BRENNAN: The transaction assumes a, quote, \"slow recovery\" in oil with prices estimated at $45 to $50 a barrel through 2019. The new company will be a one stop services shop for everything from fracking to power generation, establishing a formidable competitor to other oiled field services giants like Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), National Oilwell Varco and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), which had tried unsuccessfully to buy Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) earlier this year.</p><p>It also leverages GE`s big data push through Internet of things technology. And analysts say it comes at a time when the broader industry has been engaged in a race to the bottom in terms of pricing.</p><p>JOATHAN GARRETT, WOOD MACKENZIE PRINCIPAL ANALYST: If not at the exact bottom, we`re pretty close. And we spent a lot of time listening and reading through some of the earnings calls as of late. We have had seven quarters of margins getting squeezed. It looks like, you know, pricing is starting to hold.</p><p>You know, we`re not seeing meaningful upticks in terms of prices that OFS can sort of market for their services. But we have certainly not seen them move meaningfully down from this quarter to the last. So, it looks like we`re pretty close to that bottom.</p><p>BRENNAN: The deal could also spark a flurry of consolidation in oil field services. As major competitors look to beef up their own offerings with smaller firms that have been squeezed as service prices plunge. Analysts say firms with exposure to the Permian Basin where energy activity continues might be attractive, as well as energy companies with manufacturing operations like oil states international and fracking-related operations, such as superior energy and RPC (NYSE:RES).</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) will buy level three communications for $25 billion, sizeable deal here. It expands CenturyLink`s fiber optic network and high speed data service for corporate clients, also let`s CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) better compete with the likes of AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Shares of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) down sharply off 12.5 percent, but level 3 was up nearly 4 percent.</p><p>HERERA: And TeamHealth is going private. Selling itself to private equity firm, Blackstone, for a little over $6 billion. The hospital staffing company turned down a $5 billion offer last year from rival AmSurg. Shares of TeamHealth jumped on the trading session by better than 16 percent.</p><p>MATHISEN: And Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reportedly wants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to get in on Time Warner (NYSE:TWX). \"The New York Post\" says Goldman is nudging -- that`s banker talk -- nudging Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make a bid on TW. AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) has agreed to buy the media company for $85 billion. The biggest deal Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has ever done so far was in 2014 when it bought Beats, the speaker and headphone company, for $3 billion.</p><p>HERERA: And October has been a record-setting month for M&amp;A deals in the U.S. The value of announced deals are adding up to about $337 billion, surpassing the previous high of $82 billion back in January of 2000.</p><p>Richard Peterson, senior director at S&amp;P global market intelligence, joins us now to talk about whether or not this frenzy in M&amp;A is going to continue.</p><p>Good to see you, Richard. Welcome back.</p><p>RICHARD PETERSON, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE: Hello, Sue. Hello, Tyler.</p><p>HERERA: What do you make of this so far? We have talked a little bit in the past of why this flurry of activity now. And will it continue?</p><p>PETERSON: Well, it`s really a continuation of what has been transpiring over the past several years. The fact this year in 2016, there`s been over $1.4 trillion in announced U.S. M&amp;A and marks the fourth consecutive year of over $1 trillion in deal activity. Last year was a record year, over $2 trillion. And even though there`s been a flurry of deals this month as you accurately said, October has over $300 billion, our record month. We`re still down year over year from where we were at this time.</p><p>MATHISEN: So is it just coincidence that so many of these deals came together in this month?</p><p>PETERSON: Well, I think it`s -- various factors. With Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), they had the merger with Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), which was called off by regulatory concerns. We are upon GE, stepped in, looking for ideas. I think a former partnership, I think with Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T). That`s a factor of the media consolidation and desire for AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) to own the content, rather than be just a distributor of the product.</p><p>I think if you look at these deals, just the two top deals this month, in the AT&amp;T (NYSE:T)/Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) deal and British American Tobacco`s $58 billion purchase, just announced, remaining stakes of Reynolds America, those two deals count for half the deal value this month.</p><p>HERERA: Absolutely. Does it have anything to do with the fact that interest rates are low, even though the Fed is expected to raise interest rates once this year, you know, the time before the end of the year is getting pretty short. So, does that kind of incremental move in interest rates influence these deals?</p><p>PETERSON: I think it`s very marginal, the fact you have companies that are awash in cash, that even though corporate profits may be flat for this year, corporate profits still at elevated levels. I think the companies see their peers make acquisitions, whereupon they`re forced to make comparable moves. It`s more like a chess board, when rook takes pawn and bishop wants to take knight and all these variations that go about.</p><p>MATHISEN: OK. So, you just teed up the next question. Where next, who next? More in energy, finance? Health care? What, and who might be bought or sold?</p><p>PETERSON: Well, it`s the usual suspects. That being top sections this year are consumer discretionary by virtue of media, health care, information technology and real estate, which is actually the reclassified sector, which came out of financial earlier this year. I think I look for probably bigger deals in technology going forward. I think in terms of the media, we have talked that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) may make a move in light of what AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) did with Time Warner (NYSE:TWX).</p><p>And I think also, again in financials, considering what happens with the election next year, some companies may desire to quickly merge by the bounce of this year before the change happens in 2017.</p><p>HERERA: What does history tell us, if anything at all, about how the market performs the year following, you know, a quarter of heavy deal- making?</p><p>PETERSON: Sure. I mean, there`s two ways to look at it. We crunched some numbers at S&amp;P global markets intelligence. You look at the top months for M&amp;A activity, the following month tend to be negative. So, the top five months looking at the following month, the average decline over 2 percent.</p><p>Conversely, look at the top deals on average, one-year period following those top deal announcements, the average gain was 9 percent. So, some good news for the bears and some for the bulls.</p><p>HERERA: Thank you, Richard. Appreciate it. Richard Peterson of S&amp;P global market intelligence.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, October is finished, and as Bill Belichick might say, it`s on to November. And the first ten days could be nothing short of a Super Bowl of big data and even bigger decisions.</p><p>Bob Pisani has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Wall Street is keeping an eye on a handful of key catalysts this week, starting with the election. The markets pricing in a Clinton victory with the House remaining Republican, so any evidence to the contrary could shake things up. Already for the month, we have seen health care stocks like CardinalHealth and McKesson (NYSE:MCK) down big-time, thanks to drug pricing concerns.</p><p>It`s going to be another busy earnings week ahead with names like Sony (NYSE:SNE), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alibaba, all reporting in the next few days.</p><p>We have ended the earnings recession for now. That`s the good news. But we`re still waiting on 200 more companies to report results. The Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day meeting on interest rates tomorrow and the markets are widely expecting them to signal a rate hike in December. But no major surprises expected when both the Bank of Japan and Bank of England meet later this week.</p><p>Finally, any clues from the widely watched October jobs report on Friday will help solidify expectations for the Fed even further.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Another thing the market is intently watching, anything coming out of the FBI`s investigation into new e-mails related to Hillary Clinton`s private server.</p><p>Eamon Javers is on the case.</p><p>What can you tell us, Eamon?</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Hi, Tyler.</p><p>What we know of as of this evening, FBI officials carefully going through the e-mails now that they have a warrant in place to search them. They`re using a software program that sorts out any e-mails that were previously turned over to the FBI as part of the investigation and looking for anything that might not have been turned over. If they find any of that, they`ll look through it and try to figure out whether or not there`s any classified information in there, as part of this Clinton probe.</p><p>We`re also learning a little bit of context here about FBI director, James Comey`s decision-making to release this information before the election. I`m told by a former FBI official that this is an extraordinary decision for Comey to take, in particular because earlier this year, when the FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies were discussing whether or not to name Russia as a state entity that was trying to mettle in U.S. elections, Comey argued internally and privately, it should not be done publicly, because it was getting too close to the election.</p><p>So, my source saying that`s extraordinary, given that he ultimately made the decision to go forward with the Clinton e-mails on Friday, guys.</p><p>HERERA: How fast, though, can they look at these, as we get -- ever closer to the election? Have they made any comment on the speed with which they can investigate?</p><p>JAVERS: The FBI is saying nothing public about this. It`s not even clear that Director Comey will come out and say anything publicly between now and the election. But I talked to a former FBI official today who said that technologically, they can do this in days and have what the source called a preliminary read on these e-mails and have at least a preliminary indication of what`s in there.</p><p>But whether they will release that preliminary indication to the public between now and Election Day is really anybody`s guess at this point. One official telling me that we are in uncharted territory here. This has simply never happened before at the FBI.</p><p>MATHISEN: Do we have a quick count of how many e-mails they`re looking at?</p><p>JAVERS: Well, we think the total universe is 650,000. That might be a meaningless number, though, because there are so many duplicates in their attachments and spam and other things. The subset that would apply here would be much, much smaller than that, Tyler.</p><p>MATHISEN: Eamon, thank you very much. Eamon Javers in Washington.</p><p>HERERA: And straight ahead, why the newest trend in what women are buying is great news for the housing industry.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Consumer spending rose more than expected last month, spending did rise a half percent in September, a tenth of a percent more than estimates. The increase was due in part to the public buying more automobiles. Personal income also inched higher but by less than expected. However, Americans did save less last month, amassing nearly $800 billion down from $820 billion in August.</p><p>HERERA: Investors and companies are increasingly looking for business models that revolve around services. Being dubbed the subscription economy, analysts are looking at the success of Amazon`s prime service, and calling for other companies to follow suit.</p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look at what subscription bundling means for investors, and where the benefits and pitfalls may lie.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: One of the hottest business investing trends is a very old idea -- subscriptions. Amazon`s huge success of its $99 a year prime service has CEOs and investors chasing similar business models. Software maker Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) has turned to a cloud subscription format in recent years and shares doubled since 2013, and most other tech giants are trying to follow the same path. AT&amp;T`s plan purchase of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) is also a bid for a better subscription bundle of wireless service and entertainment, and a more durable with costumers.</p><p>All this has led analysts to propose Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) prime, a package of an iPhone, iTunes and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV as a fix for flattening smartphone sales.</p><p>One media consultant has even floated Disney (NYSE:DIS) as a service or pay one price access to Disney`s entire TV and entertainment output, plus theme park discounts.</p><p>So, what`s behind all of this? Subscription fees means steady revenues and a sticky relationship directly with customers, with customers attention so fragmented in the social media age, the cost of locating and acquiring customers has gone up far faster than the more predictable expense of delivering a product or service, even many less virtual are being viewed through the prism of subscriptions. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Dunkin Brands have pushed sophisticated rewards programs that almost make subscribers out of their customers for instance. As with any Wall Street trend, there is a risk this idea will be misapplied to some companies and taken too far by others.</p><p>For now, though, expect to hear more CEOs touting the virtues of subscriptions.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Nike (NYSE:NKE) gets hit on a stock downgrade and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Merrill Lynch cut the Dow component`s rating to underperform, which is essentially a sell down from neutral, citing an increase in competition from companies like Adidas and Under Armour (NYSE:UA). The bank also slashed its price target on Nike (NYSE:NKE) to $46, down from $55, saying it`s not convinced Nike (NYSE:NKE) has innovative products in its pipeline. Shares were off 3 1/2 percent to $50.18.</p><p>Cost cuts helped turn energy firm Williams Company turned a profit in the latest quarter with results exceeding estimates. The company also said its revenue grew. Even so, Williams` shares finished the day down more than 1.5 percent at $29.20.</p><p>The power supplier Southern (NYSE:SO) Company topped analysts` profit expectations, thanks to higher retail revenue and strong performance in a company subsidiary. Southern (NYSE:SO) Company also saw its revenue rise. Shares rose 87 cents to $51.57.</p><p>HERERA: Pharmaceutical distributor, CardinalHealth, said drug pricing pressures caused profit to fall but still, the results managed to surpass estimates. The company also posted higher than expected sales. However, Cardinal cut its earnings outlook for the year, citing short term headwinds in the pharmaceutical business. Shares nonetheless rose 2 percent to $68.69.</p><p>Xerox (NYSE:XRX) says it has reached a settlement with its largest individual shareholder who we told you sued the copier maker last month, alleging the company`s plan spinoff violated an existing contract agreement. Under the settlement, Darwin Deason will be given 300,000 shares in the company`s two businesses. Shares fell marginally to $9.77.</p><p>And network equipment maker, Brocade, may be interested in selling itself. As first reported by Bloomberg, the company is in advanced talks and close to entering the final stages of a sale process. The potential deal which could be reached as early as this week has attracted interest from chip maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM). Shares soared almost 22 percent to $10.60.</p><p>And Valeant Pharmaceuticals isn`t out of the woods quite yet. Bloomberg said the drug maker`s former CEO and CFOR are being investigated by authorities regarding potential accounting fraud. The report added the investigation could lead to charges within weeks. Valiant said it had previously disclosed that investigation. Valeant shares tanked more than 12 percent on the news to $17.84.</p><p>MATHISEN: Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) will pay $50 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the bank of overcharging hundreds of thousands of homeowners for appraisals that were ordered after they defaulted on their mortgages. The settlement would resolve claims that Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) charged more than it paid for third-party appraisals. Mortgage agreements do let banks charge owners who default on their loans for those appraisals. But the lawsuit says Wells charged up to $125 when their actual cost was $50 or even less.</p><p>HERERA: Traditionally, males and married couples have been the main buyers of homes. But now, single women are becoming home owners more than men. In fact, this year females have bought twice as much as their male counterparts.</p><p>Diana Olick has more on this new trend in housing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Adrienne Nassau just closed on this three-bedroom home in Maryland. It`s a fixer upper, but she is looking forward to the project.</p><p>ADRIENNE NASSAU, HOME BUYER: I actually think I`m simplifying my life.</p><p>OLICK: Nassau, widowed, now 15 years, sold her large family home on the eastern shore and intends to sell the con low she is living in now in nearby Bethesda. Even in her retirement, she still thinks ownership is worth it.</p><p>NASSAU: I think when you own, you can do with a house whatever you want. You can make it your own. You can make whatever improvements you feel comfortable with.</p><p>OLICK: Nassau is one of a growing share of single women in the housing market. They now make up 17 percent of home buyers, more than twice the share of single men. This, despite the fact that women still earn less than men for the same jobs.</p><p>NASSAU: There are women in the workplace who earn good money, who are professionals, and who are independent in their thinking and feel they`re able to cope with taking on a house.</p><p>OLICK: In the past, women had a harder time getting mortgages on their own, and often had to have someone else cosign the loan. That discrimination is gone today, but men do tend to have higher credit scores than women, likely because men make more money.</p><p>After living with her daughters for a while and then renting for a year, 68-year-old Barbara Jennai just bought a condo in an age-restricted community using part of her retirement savings and a reverse mortgage.</p><p>BARBARA JENNAI, HOME BUYER: Instead of $1,400, I`m paying $400 a month and that`s all I`ll have to pay for as long as I live in this condo.</p><p>OLICK: Jennai still works full time as a teacher, but her salary was barely covering the rent. By buying in the same building where she was renting, Jennai not only saves money, but has something to show for it.</p><p>JENNAI: For me, this is the first time that I have ever owned in America in my life. So I walk in every day, I say, \"Hello beautiful home,\" it`s mine.</p><p>OLICK: A greeting more and more women are now embracing all on their own.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Chevy Chase, Maryland.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, how giving people a good scare has turned into good business. That`s next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Here`s what`s to watch tomorrow, folks.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, the Federal Reserve begins its two-day policy meeting where it will decide whether or not to raise interest rates. We get a look at the manufacturing sector when the Institute for Supply Management releases its October index and the Dow component Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) will post its latest quarterly results. And that is what to watch Tuesday.</p><p>HERERA: And finally tonight, who wouldn`t want a job they love? Well, one media pro took her fascination with Halloween to a whole new level, quitting her day job to make millions in the horror space.</p><p>Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) bravely takes us to Randall`s Island, New York.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For some people, being terrified is actually fun.</p><p>And Melissa Carbone is cashing in.</p><p>MELISSA CARBONE, TEN THIRTY ONE PRODUCTIONS: Fear is America`s favorite drug, like, 100 percent. Fear is actually a real physical reaction.</p><p>ROGERS: Oh, I know.</p><p>Oh, my gosh. This is a dead end!</p><p>The founder of 1031 productions always loved Halloween, but it wasn`t until she began decorating her own home in Los Angeles years ago that it hit her. There might be a real business behind scaring people.</p><p>CARBONE: I didn`t realize that it was such a thing for me. Trick or treating and handing out candy wasn`t enough. It kept building for me and then I realized how much I love the genre.</p><p>ROGERS: At the time, she was working in marketing at Clear Channel worldwide. She and her co-founder, Allison Richards, began saving and plotting for a large-scale haunted hayride. They drained their life- savings and raised half a million dollars from friends and family, as well as their sponsor, Mini Cooper, to launch in L.A. in 2009.</p><p>CARBONE: I feel like we have pioneered a whole new industry.</p><p>ROGERS: They`re not going to get too close to me, right? See, that`s not bad. They`re cute.</p><p>Ten Thirty One broke even their first year and continued to grow. This is their second year hosting the New York haunted hayride on Randall`s Island. The company now has eight attractions from February through November in New York and California, raking in $3 million last year and securing a $2 million investment from Mark Cuban on \"Shark Tank\" and another undisclosed investment from Live Nation along the way.</p><p>CARBONE: I get to make a living by building and creating these environments that people typically would not get to experience. That people can remember physically and not necessarily mentally.</p><p>ROGERS: Hayride attendees will experience a storyline that`s a full year in the making with more than 100 live actors. Between New York and Los Angeles, about 130,000 people will attend the event this year. The scariest part, the blackout maze, even in the daytime.</p><p>(SCREAMING)</p><p>ROGERS: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG), trying to escape from Randall`s Island, New York.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She just took the emergency --</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: She`s never going to be the same.</p><p>MATHISEN: Kate doesn`t scare easily.</p><p>HERERA: She doesn`t, but that was the emergency exit she went out.</p><p>That does it tonight for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.

Stocks suffer  their worst monthly performance since January.  And the week ahead holds  several more catalysts investors need to keep an eye on.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Merger mania.  General  Electric (NYSE:GE) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) cap off a record month of  merger activity.  Will the deal-making continue and which sectors might see  some action?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  And a fortune of fright.  How one woman turned her love of  Halloween into millions.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> All that and more on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, October 31st.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone.  And welcome.  And happy Halloween.  </p><p> OK.  So there haven't been dramatic drops or crashes as in Octobers' past,  but the trading month that just ended a couple hours ago on this Halloween  evening has had its share of spooky moments.  Plenty enough to send a chill  down a random spine or a hair to stand up straight on a sensitive  investor's neck.  No, the losses weren't ghoulish, but the major average  did suffer their worst monthly performances since January, and it could  have been worse if banks and some big tech names hadn't held their own and  bolstered the performance.  </p><p> And today, oil did fall to a one month low over uncertainty about an OPEC  production cut.  </p><p> As for stocks today, not too scary.  The Dow dropping a modest 18 points to  18,142, NASDAQ down nearly a point, and the S&amp;P was off just the slightest  fraction.  </p><p> HERERA:  And now to a deal we told you on Friday might happen.  General  electric has agreed to combine its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BHI) and will create a new publicly traded company which will be  majority-owned by GE.  GE shares were essentially flat, but Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BHI) was down 6 percent.  </p><p> Morgan Brennan has more on the tie-up.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's all about  energy.  The new Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) will combine the world's largest  oil field equipment manufacturer, GE, with the number three oiled field  services firm, creating a company with $32 billion in revenue, second only  to rival, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).  GE will merge with the entirety of  Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), a move that will have the industrial giant owning  the majority of the new company without spending tens of billions of  dollars to actually make an acquisition.  </p><p> Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) shareholders will own the rest, with GE raising  more than $7 billion to pay them a one-time special dividend.  GE's oil and  gas chief Lorenzo Simonelli will run the entity, expected by the middle of  next year.  CEO Jeff Immelt saying the structure of the deal will have tax  advantages, and will allow for flexibility around capital allocation.  </p><p> JEFF IMMELT, GE CHAIRMAN AND CEO:  Let's say the industry remains tough.   This is still value accretive to both investors and a tough oil price  environment.  If their pricing gets better, it allows us to benefit that  from that, as well.  It's a very diversified portfolio in terms of short  cycle and longer cycle operations.  So I think it just gives us a chance to  weather the cycle better.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  The transaction assumes a, quote, \"slow recovery\" in oil with  prices estimated at $45 to $50 a barrel through 2019.  The new company will  be a one stop services shop for everything from fracking to power  generation, establishing a formidable competitor to other oiled field  services giants like Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), National Oilwell Varco and  Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), which had tried unsuccessfully to buy Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BHI) earlier this year.  </p><p> It also leverages GE's big data push through Internet of things technology.   And analysts say it comes at a time when the broader industry has been  engaged in a race to the bottom in terms of pricing.  </p><p> JOATHAN GARRETT, WOOD MACKENZIE PRINCIPAL ANALYST:  If not at the exact  bottom, we're pretty close.  And we spent a lot of time listening and  reading through some of the earnings calls as of late.  We have had seven  quarters of margins getting squeezed.  It looks like, you know, pricing is  starting to hold. </p><p> You know, we're not seeing meaningful upticks in terms of prices that OFS  can sort of market for their services.  But we have certainly not seen them  move meaningfully down from this quarter to the last.  So, it looks like  we're pretty close to that bottom.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  The deal could also spark a flurry of consolidation in oil field  services.  As major competitors look to beef up their own offerings with  smaller firms that have been squeezed as service prices plunge.  Analysts  say firms with exposure to the Permian Basin where energy activity  continues might be attractive, as well as energy companies with  manufacturing operations like oil states international and fracking-related  operations, such as superior energy and RPC (NYSE:RES). </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) will buy level three communications for  $25 billion, sizeable deal here.  It expands CenturyLink's fiber optic  network and high speed data service for corporate clients, also let's  CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) better compete with the likes of AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon (NYSE:VZ).  Shares of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) down sharply off 12.5  percent, but level 3 was up nearly 4 percent.  </p><p> HERERA:  And TeamHealth is going private.  Selling itself to private equity  firm, Blackstone, for a little over $6 billion.  The hospital staffing  company turned down a $5 billion offer last year from rival AmSurg.  Shares  of TeamHealth jumped on the trading session by better than 16 percent.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reportedly wants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  to get in on Time Warner (NYSE:TWX).  \"The New York Post\" says Goldman is  nudging -- that's banker talk -- nudging Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make a bid  on TW.  AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) has agreed to buy the media company for $85 billion.   The biggest deal Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has ever done so far was in 2014 when  it bought Beats, the speaker and headphone company, for $3 billion.  </p><p> HERERA:  And October has been a record-setting month for M&amp;A deals in the  U.S.  The value of announced deals are adding up to about $337 billion,  surpassing the previous high of $82 billion back in January of 2000.  </p><p> Richard Peterson, senior director at S&amp;P global market intelligence, joins  us now to talk about whether or not this frenzy in M&amp;A is going to  continue.  </p><p> Good to see you, Richard.  Welcome back.  </p><p> RICHARD PETERSON, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE:  Hello, Sue.  Hello,  Tyler.  </p><p> HERERA:  What do you make of this so far?  We have talked a little bit in  the past of why this flurry of activity now.  And will it continue?  </p><p> PETERSON:  Well, it's really a continuation of what has been transpiring  over the past several years.  The fact this year in 2016, there's been over  $1.4 trillion in announced U.S. M&amp;A and marks the fourth consecutive year  of over $1 trillion in deal activity.  Last year was a record year, over $2  trillion.  And even though there's been a flurry of deals this month as you  accurately said, October has over $300 billion, our record month.  We're  still down year over year from where we were at this time.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  So is it just coincidence that so many of these deals came  together in this month?  </p><p> PETERSON:  Well, I think it's -- various factors.  With Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BHI), they had the merger with Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), which was  called off by regulatory concerns.  We are upon GE, stepped in, looking for  ideas.  I think a former partnership, I think with Time Warner (NYSE:TWX)  and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T).  That's a factor of the media consolidation and desire  for AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) to own the content, rather than be just a distributor of  the product.  </p><p> I think if you look at these deals, just the two top deals this month, in  the AT&amp;T (NYSE:T)/Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) deal and British American  Tobacco's $58 billion purchase, just announced, remaining stakes of  Reynolds America, those two deals count for half the deal value this month.  </p><p> HERERA:  Absolutely.  Does it have anything to do with the fact that  interest rates are low, even though the Fed is expected to raise interest  rates once this year, you know, the time before the end of the year is  getting pretty short.  So, does that kind of incremental move in interest  rates influence these deals?  </p><p> PETERSON:  I think it's very marginal, the fact you have companies that are  awash in cash, that even though corporate profits may be flat for this  year, corporate profits still at elevated levels.  I think the companies  see their peers make acquisitions, whereupon they're forced to make  comparable moves.  It's more like a chess board, when rook takes pawn and  bishop wants to take knight and all these variations that go about.</p><p> MATHISEN:  OK.  So, you just teed up the next question.  Where next, who  next?  More in energy, finance?  Health care?  What, and who might be  bought or sold?  </p><p> PETERSON:  Well, it's the usual suspects.  That being top sections this  year are consumer discretionary by virtue of media, health care,  information technology and real estate, which is actually the reclassified  sector, which came out of financial earlier this year.  I think I look for  probably bigger deals in technology going forward.  I think in terms of the  media, we have talked that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) may make a  move in light of what AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) did with Time Warner (NYSE:TWX).  </p><p> And I think also, again in financials, considering what happens with the  election next year, some companies may desire to quickly merge by the  bounce of this year before the change happens in 2017.  </p><p> HERERA:  What does history tell us, if anything at all, about how the  market performs the year following, you know, a quarter of heavy deal- making?  </p><p> PETERSON:  Sure.  I mean, there's two ways to look at it.  We crunched some  numbers at S&amp;P global markets intelligence.  You look at the top months for  M&amp;A activity, the following month tend to be negative.  So, the top five  months looking at the following month, the average decline over 2 percent.  </p><p> Conversely, look at the top deals on average, one-year period following  those top deal announcements, the average gain was 9 percent.  So, some  good news for the bears and some for the bulls.  </p><p> HERERA:  Thank you, Richard.  Appreciate it.  Richard Peterson of S&amp;P  global market intelligence.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, October is finished, and as Bill Belichick might say, it's  on to November.  And the first ten days could be nothing short of a Super  Bowl of big data and even bigger decisions.  </p><p> Bob Pisani has more.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Wall Street is keeping  an eye on a handful of key catalysts this week, starting with the election.   The markets pricing in a Clinton victory with the House remaining  Republican, so any evidence to the contrary could shake things up.  Already  for the month, we have seen health care stocks like CardinalHealth and  McKesson (NYSE:MCK) down big-time, thanks to drug pricing concerns.  </p><p> It's going to be another busy earnings week ahead with names like Sony  (NYSE:SNE), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alibaba, all  reporting in the next few days.  </p><p> We have ended the earnings recession for now.  That's the good news.  But  we're still waiting on 200 more companies to report results.  The Federal  Reserve kicks off its two-day meeting on interest rates tomorrow and the  markets are widely expecting them to signal a rate hike in December.  But  no major surprises expected when both the Bank of Japan and Bank of England  meet later this week.  </p><p> Finally, any clues from the widely watched October jobs report on Friday  will help solidify expectations for the Fed even further. </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Another thing the market is intently watching, anything coming  out of the FBI's investigation into new e-mails related to Hillary  Clinton's private server.  </p><p> Eamon Javers is on the case.  </p><p> What can you tell us, Eamon?  </p><p> EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Hi, Tyler.  </p><p> What we know of as of this evening, FBI officials carefully going through  the e-mails now that they have a warrant in place to search them.  They're  using a software program that sorts out any e-mails that were previously  turned over to the FBI as part of the investigation and looking for  anything that might not have been turned over.  If they find any of that,  they'll look through it and try to figure out whether or not there's any  classified information in there, as part of this Clinton probe.  </p><p> We're also learning a little bit of context here about FBI director, James  Comey's decision-making to release this information before the election.   I'm told by a former FBI official that this is an extraordinary decision  for Comey to take, in particular because earlier this year, when the FBI  and U.S. intelligence agencies were discussing whether or not to name  Russia as a state entity that was trying to mettle in U.S. elections, Comey  argued internally and privately, it should not be done publicly, because it  was getting too close to the election.  </p><p> So, my source saying that's extraordinary, given that he ultimately made  the decision to go forward with the Clinton e-mails on Friday, guys.  </p><p> HERERA:  How fast, though, can they look at these, as we get -- ever closer  to the election?  Have they made any comment on the speed with which they  can investigate?  </p><p> JAVERS:  The FBI is saying nothing public about this.  It's not even clear  that Director Comey will come out and say anything publicly between now and  the election.  But I talked to a former FBI official today who said that  technologically, they can do this in days and have what the source called a  preliminary read on these e-mails and have at least a preliminary  indication of what's in there.  </p><p> But whether they will release that preliminary indication to the public  between now and Election Day is really anybody's guess at this point.  One  official telling me that we are in uncharted territory here.  This has  simply never happened before at the FBI.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Do we have a quick count of how many e-mails they're looking at?  </p><p> JAVERS:  Well, we think the total universe is 650,000.  That might be a  meaningless number, though, because there are so many duplicates in their  attachments and spam and other things.  The subset that would apply here  would be much, much smaller than that, Tyler.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Eamon, thank you very much.  Eamon Javers in Washington.  </p><p> HERERA:  And straight ahead, why the newest trend in what women are buying  is great news for the housing industry.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Consumer spending rose more than expected last month, spending  did rise a half percent in September, a tenth of a percent more than  estimates.  The increase was due in part to the public buying more  automobiles.  Personal income also inched higher but by less than expected.   However, Americans did save less last month, amassing nearly $800 billion  down from $820 billion in August.  </p><p> HERERA:  Investors and companies are increasingly looking for business  models that revolve around services.  Being dubbed the subscription  economy, analysts are looking at the success of Amazon's prime service, and  calling for other companies to follow suit.  </p><p> Mike Santoli takes a look at what subscription bundling means for  investors, and where the benefits and pitfalls may lie.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  One of the hottest  business investing trends is a very old idea -- subscriptions.  Amazon's  huge success of its $99 a year prime service has CEOs and investors chasing  similar business models.  Software maker Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) has  turned to a cloud subscription format in recent years and shares doubled  since 2013, and most other tech giants are trying to follow the same path.   AT&amp;T's plan purchase of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) is also a bid for a better  subscription bundle of wireless service and entertainment, and a more  durable with costumers.  </p><p> All this has led analysts to propose Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) prime, a package  of an iPhone, iTunes and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV as a fix for flattening  smartphone sales.  </p><p> One media consultant has even floated Disney (NYSE:DIS) as a service or pay  one price access to Disney's entire TV and entertainment output, plus theme  park discounts.  </p><p> So, what's behind all of this?  Subscription fees means steady revenues and  a sticky relationship directly with customers, with customers attention so  fragmented in the social media age, the cost of locating and acquiring  customers has gone up far faster than the more predictable expense of  delivering a product or service, even many less virtual are being viewed  through the prism of subscriptions.  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Dunkin  Brands have pushed sophisticated rewards programs that almost make  subscribers out of their customers for instance.  As with any Wall Street  trend, there is a risk this idea will be misapplied to some companies and  taken too far by others.  </p><p> For now, though, expect to hear more CEOs touting the virtues of  subscriptions.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli at the New York Stock  Exchange.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Nike (NYSE:NKE) gets hit on a stock downgrade and that is where  we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Merrill Lynch cut the Dow component's rating to  underperform, which is essentially a sell down from neutral, citing an  increase in competition from companies like Adidas and Under Armour  (NYSE:UA).  The bank also slashed its price target on Nike (NYSE:NKE) to  $46, down from $55, saying it's not convinced Nike (NYSE:NKE) has  innovative products in its pipeline.  Shares were off 3 1/2 percent to  $50.18.  </p><p> Cost cuts helped turn energy firm Williams Company turned a profit in the  latest quarter with results exceeding estimates.  The company also said its  revenue grew.  Even so, Williams' shares finished the day down more than  1.5 percent at $29.20.  </p><p>The power supplier Southern (NYSE:SO) Company topped analysts' profit  expectations, thanks to higher retail revenue and strong performance in a  company subsidiary.  Southern (NYSE:SO) Company also saw its revenue rise.   Shares rose 87 cents to $51.57.  </p><p> HERERA:  Pharmaceutical distributor, CardinalHealth, said drug pricing  pressures caused profit to fall but still, the results managed to surpass  estimates.  The company also posted higher than expected sales.  However,  Cardinal cut its earnings outlook for the year, citing short term headwinds  in the pharmaceutical business.  Shares nonetheless rose 2 percent to  $68.69.  </p><p> Xerox (NYSE:XRX) says it has reached a settlement with its largest  individual shareholder who we told you sued the copier maker last month,  alleging the company's plan spinoff violated an existing contract  agreement.  Under the settlement, Darwin Deason will be given 300,000  shares in the company's two businesses.  Shares fell marginally to $9.77.  </p><p> And network equipment maker, Brocade, may be interested in selling itself.   As first reported by Bloomberg, the company is in advanced talks and close  to entering the final stages of a sale process.  The potential deal which  could be reached as early as this week has attracted interest from chip  maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM).  Shares soared almost 22 percent to $10.60.  </p><p> And Valeant Pharmaceuticals isn't out of the woods quite yet.  Bloomberg  said the drug maker's former CEO and CFOR are being investigated by  authorities regarding potential accounting fraud.  The report added the  investigation could lead to charges within weeks.  Valiant said it had  previously disclosed that investigation.  Valeant shares tanked more than  12 percent on the news to $17.84.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) will pay $50 million to settle a lawsuit  accusing the bank of overcharging hundreds of thousands of homeowners for  appraisals that were ordered after they defaulted on their mortgages.  The  settlement would resolve claims that Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) charged more  than it paid for third-party appraisals.  Mortgage agreements do let banks  charge owners who default on their loans for those appraisals.  But the  lawsuit says Wells charged up to $125 when their actual cost was $50 or  even less.  </p><p> HERERA:  Traditionally, males and married couples have been the main buyers  of homes.  But now, single women are becoming home owners more than men.   In fact, this year females have bought twice as much as their male  counterparts.  </p><p> Diana Olick has more on this new trend in housing.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Adrienne Nassau just  closed on this three-bedroom home in Maryland.  It's a fixer upper, but she  is looking forward to the project.  </p><p> ADRIENNE NASSAU, HOME BUYER:  I actually think I'm simplifying my life.  </p><p> OLICK:  Nassau, widowed, now 15 years, sold her large family home on the  eastern shore and intends to sell the con low she is living in now in  nearby Bethesda.  Even in her retirement, she still thinks ownership is  worth it.  </p><p> NASSAU:  I think when you own, you can do with a house whatever you want.   You can make it your own.  You can make whatever improvements you feel  comfortable with.  </p><p> OLICK:  Nassau is one of a growing share of single women in the housing  market.  They now make up 17 percent of home buyers, more than twice the  share of single men.  This, despite the fact that women still earn less  than men for the same jobs.  </p><p>NASSAU:  There are women in the workplace who earn good money, who are  professionals, and who are independent in their thinking and feel they're  able to cope with taking on a house.  </p><p> OLICK:  In the past, women had a harder time getting mortgages on their  own, and often had to have someone else cosign the loan.  That  discrimination is gone today, but men do tend to have higher credit scores  than women, likely because men make more money.  </p><p> After living with her daughters for a while and then renting for a year,  68-year-old Barbara Jennai just bought a condo in an age-restricted  community using part of her retirement savings and a reverse mortgage.  </p><p> BARBARA JENNAI, HOME BUYER:  Instead of $1,400, I'm paying $400 a month and  that's all I'll have to pay for as long as I live in this condo.  </p><p> OLICK:  Jennai still works full time as a teacher, but her salary was  barely covering the rent.  By buying in the same building where she was  renting, Jennai not only saves money, but has something to show for it.  </p><p> JENNAI:  For me, this is the first time that I have ever owned in America  in my life.  So I walk in every day, I say, \"Hello beautiful home,\" it's  mine.  </p><p> OLICK:  A greeting more and more women are now embracing all on their own.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Chevy Chase, Maryland.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Coming up, how giving people a good scare has turned into good  business.  That's next.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Here's what's to watch tomorrow, folks.  </p><p> As we mentioned earlier, the Federal Reserve begins its two-day policy  meeting where it will decide whether or not to raise interest rates.  We  get a look at the manufacturing sector when the Institute for Supply  Management releases its October index and the Dow component Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) will post its latest quarterly results.  And that is what to  watch Tuesday.  </p><p> HERERA:  And finally tonight, who wouldn't want a job they love?  Well, one  media pro took her fascination with Halloween to a whole new level,  quitting her day job to make millions in the horror space.  </p><p> Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) bravely takes us to Randall's Island, New York. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  For some people, being  terrified is actually fun.  </p><p> And Melissa Carbone is cashing in.  </p><p> MELISSA CARBONE, TEN THIRTY ONE PRODUCTIONS:  Fear is America's favorite  drug, like, 100 percent.  Fear is actually a real physical reaction.  </p><p> ROGERS:  Oh, I know.  </p><p> Oh, my gosh.  This is a dead end!  </p><p> The founder of 1031 productions always loved Halloween, but it wasn't until  she began decorating her own home in Los Angeles years ago that it hit her.   There might be a real business behind scaring people.  </p><p> CARBONE:  I didn't realize that it was such a thing for me.  Trick or  treating and handing out candy wasn't enough.  It kept building for me and  then I realized how much I love the genre.  </p><p> ROGERS:  At the time, she was working in marketing at Clear Channel  worldwide.  She and her co-founder, Allison Richards, began saving and  plotting for a large-scale haunted hayride.  They drained their life- savings and raised half a million dollars from friends and family, as well  as their sponsor, Mini Cooper, to launch in L.A. in 2009.  </p><p> CARBONE:  I feel like we have pioneered a whole new industry.  </p><p> ROGERS:  They're not going to get too close to me, right?  See, that's not  bad.  They're cute.  </p><p> Ten Thirty One broke even their first year and continued to grow.  This is  their second year hosting the New York haunted hayride on Randall's Island.   The company now has eight attractions from February through November in New  York and California, raking in $3 million last year and securing a $2  million investment from Mark Cuban on \"Shark Tank\" and another undisclosed  investment from Live Nation along the way.  </p><p> CARBONE:  I get to make a living by building and creating these  environments that people typically would not get to experience.  That  people can remember physically and not necessarily mentally.  </p><p> ROGERS:  Hayride attendees will experience a storyline that's a full year  in the making with more than 100 live actors.  Between New York and Los  Angeles, about 130,000 people will attend the event this year.  The  scariest part, the blackout maze, even in the daytime.  </p><p> (SCREAMING)</p><p> ROGERS:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG), trying to  escape from Randall's Island, New York.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She just took the emergency -- </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  She's never going to be the same.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Kate doesn't scare easily.  </p><p> HERERA:  She doesn't, but that was the emergency exit she went out.  </p><p> That does it tonight for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me as well.  Have a great  evening, everybody.  Happy Halloween.  We'll see you tomorrow. </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

We`re only one day in and today was pretty bumpy.  The trading day started  with new tariffs on U.S. and Chinese goods, marking the latest escalation  in the long-running trade war between the world`s two largest economies.   That dampened investor sentiment.</p><p>Then came a weak report on manufacturing.  Its weakest read in three years,  raising fears of an economic slowdown and that dented sentiment further.   Investors loaded up on gold and U.S. treasuries sending yields lower and  pressuring bank stocks.</p><p>And by the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 285 points to  26,118.  The Nasdaq was down 88, and S&amp;P500 slid 20.</p><p>Seema Mody starts us off tonight from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Wall Street started the  month of September on a down note as President Trump come forth with a new  set of tariffs.  Investors are losing faith that a trade deal will be  reached before the end of the year.  This as officials from the US. and  China had yet to confirm a date for a September meeting that would launch  another round of trade talks.</p><p>Stocks continue to decline after the Institute for Supply Management`s  manufacturing index unexpectedly contracted for the first time in three  years, due in part to tariffs and the broader global slowdown.  At one  point, The Dow Jones dropped 428 points, but finished off the lows of the  day.  Industrials, many of which are exposed to China, led the major  indices lower as did energy and technology stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>September is historically a bad month Wall Street.  Strategists are worried  that this September could be especially tough for investors as U.S.  tensions remain high and worries over whether the Federal Reserve will cut  interest rates at its next policy meeting.  Tomorrow, investors will be  keeping a close eye on the manufacturing data released from a number of  European countries and a speech from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Seema Mody.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And as she just mentioned, trade was a major overhang on Wall  Street today as it has been for quite some time and those escalating  tensions are getting trickier for businesses to navigate.</p><p>Kayla Tausche has that story in Washington tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Many products  leaving ports in China and the U.S. over the weekend just got more  expensive.  With the U.S. charging 15 percent on footwear, clothes and  certain tech products totaling $112 billion.  China slapping tariffs on $75  billion in goods.  A late June truce between Presidents Trump and Xi short  lived as the two economic powers are back to battling over trade with the  holiday season around the corner.</p><p>GARY SHAPIRO, CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION:  He`s promised us now for a  year and a half this is just a short-term thing and we`ve gone along with  it, not happily, of course, but he keeps increasing.  He`s increased so  much now on almost every product that consumers are going to feel it.  In  fact, businesses are already feeling it.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  The hit could have been worse.  Three sources say President Trump  wanted to double existing tariffs after learning of China`s retaliation.   Treasury secretary and the U.S. trade representatives enlisted CEOs to talk  Trump out of it.</p><p>Days later, Secretary Mnuchin acknowledged Trump wanted more.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  His only second thoughts, as he said,  was maybe he should raise tariffs more.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  President Trump said on Twitter he`d be much tougher on China  after his potential re-election, warning of China`s economy deteriorating  in the meantime.</p><p>The Chamber of Commerce says for business, getting back to the negotiating  table would be more effective.</p><p>TOM DONOHUE, U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE:  And I think it would have been much  better doing that than continuing to ratchet up of who`s got the biggest  threat available at the time.  It`s all going to be paid by American  companies and American consumers between now and the end of the year.  We  should do better.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  A call between U.S. and Chinese officials last Thursday did not  produce any tariff relief.  The two sides had been discussing in-person  negotiations in Washington this month, but no date for those talks has been  set.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  By the way, later in the program, we`re going to take you to the  town in China that makes roughly half the world`s Christmas lights and  ornaments.  We`re going to see how things have been charged there by the  trade war.</p><p>HERERA:  When investors are not concerned about trade, they are worried  about the Federal Reserve and the path forward for interest rates.  And  that concern will likely build ahead of its policy meeting later this  month.</p><p>Steve Liesman takes a look at what might lie ahead for the Fed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The breeze investors  feel is not a local wind, it`s a global downdraft in interest rates that`s  expected to blow harder this month.  On September 12th, the European  Central Bank meets, and on September 18th, the Federal Reserve meets.  Both  are expected to reduce interest rates or otherwise provide monetary policy  easing.  That could boost the Japanese yen, pressuring the Bank of Japan to  cut, and Mark Carney, the governor of Bank of England, he`s only holding  his fire until he knows how the U.K. is going to exit the European Union in  the Brexit process.</p><p>In an exclusive interview in Jackson Hole, Mark Carney talked about the  impact of Brexit and trade.</p><p>MARK CARNEY, BANK OF ENGLAND GOVERNOR:  Business investment is actually  running almost 25 percentage points below its previous trend.  Business in  the U.K. and quite reasonably said, wait a minute, I`m going to wait until  if they have any exposure to Europe, either upstream or downstream, they  decided to wait and see what are the new rules of the game going to be.   That`s part of what`s happening worldwide as people saying, well, OK, I`ve  got exposure to Chinese supply chain or U.S., let me see where this settles  out.</p><p>LIESMAN:  There`s a widespread ride now in global interest rates.  China`s  central benchmark rate is at 4.35 percent.  The U.S. at 2.13.  The U.K. at  just three quarters of a percent while Europe is at zero, and Japan is  minus 0.1.</p><p>It`s not just Central Banks in the developed world that are cutting.  Of 37  emerging market central banks looked at by \"Reuters\", there`s been a net 14  cuts in August.  That`s the most in a decade.  And that`s up from eight net  cuts in July and it`s the seventh straight month of cuts from these banks.</p><p>The Fed is expected to cut rates in September and again in October.  That  could prompt another global downdraft in interest rates.  The question is,  is the tailwind provided to economies from lower rates enough to offset the  headwinds from slower growth and a trade war?</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  There was some positive news on the economy today.  Construction  spending ticked higher in July after falling more than 2 percent so far  this year.  According to the Commerce Department, government spending on  schools, sewers and the water supply picked up as did construction for  single family homes.</p><p>HERERA:  A key vote in the U.K. parliament tonight and a potential major  blow to the new prime minister.  Lawmakers moved to take control of  parliament.  A vote will now be held tomorrow which could prevent the  government from being able to withdraw from the European Union without a  deal at the end of October.</p><p>A so-called hard Brexit is something economists have viewed as a risk to  the global economy.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, trade, slowing economy, the Fed, they all continue to weigh  on stocks as we begin this month September.  What`s it going to bring for  investors?</p><p>We have two market pros with opposing views on that tonight with us.</p><p>Barry Bannister is head of equity strategy at Stifel.  He sees a tough  month ahead for stocks.</p><p>While Kristina Hooper thinks that the market is going to hold up fairly  well.  She`s chief global market strategist at Invesco.</p><p>Good to see you both.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>KRISTINA HOOPER, INVESCO CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST:  Thank you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Kristina, I`m gong to start with you.  We had an epic volatility  in the month of August with all kinds of issues going on with the trade war  and the Fed.  If I`m reading your notes right, you see things settling down  a bit?  What do you see happening in September?</p><p>HOOPER:  Well, I expect more volatility, but we could see a similar  scenario that we saw in August, where we get a lot of negative news flow, a  lot of fluctuations in the stock market, but ultimately, finish the month  in fairly good standing, with stocks holding their own and possibly eking  out gains.</p><p>HERERA:  Barry, you think it is going to be a rough September.  I mean, we  just detailed what`s going on in the U.K. with Brexit.  That`s another fly  in the ointment in terms of global tensions that are out there.  How do you  see September playing out and what role will the Fed play?</p><p>BARRY BANNISTER, STIFEL HEAD OF EQUITY STRATEGY:  Well, to me, it looks  like a game of two chickens, right?  So, on the one hand, you`ve got the  Fed and the trade policy in the White House going head on to each other and  neither one wants to turn their car.  So, it`s like a game of chicken.</p><p>And the other hand, when you look at the market, it`s a chicken and an egg  problem in that eggs are going to have to break before the Fed turns  chicken enough to start whacking those rates.  The Fed took rates up at the  end of last year to 2.4 percent in a world with zero rates.  It was just  too tight for the rest of the world.</p><p>And so, in effect, the rest of the world has slowed down.  U.S. exports are  going to weaken appreciably.  We`re probably going to see an inventory pile  up.  The industrial sector was weaker than we expected.</p><p>So, it looks pretty tough until we can convince the Fed to really cut those  rates aggressively, which they need to do.  They`re the biggest problem  right now.  Keeping those rates above 2 percent on the short end, which is  way above the 10-year yield right now.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Barry, how -- what are you expecting this month?  Are you among  those who would like to see 350 basis points cut in September?</p><p>BANNISTER:  Well, absolutely.  I think they need to at least move towards  what the futures expect.  Well, the market`s job is essentially to riot,  until the Fed adapts to what the market expects.</p><p>So, when you think about it, the Fed funds expected, expected by the  futures market to be 1 percent at the end of 2020.  They`re at 2.1 now and  not talking about anything like that kind of rate cut.  So, yes, they need  to move and they need to move fast.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Kristina, you think the Fed can probably be positive for the  stock market if indeed they do cut rates, but what about for the economy?</p><p>HOOPER:  Well, I don`t think the Fed has the cure for what`s ailing the  economy, which is tariffs.  The only thing that can stop that is a  resolution to the trade war.  But the Fed does have in its arsenal,  monetary policy tools that can be very supportive of risk assets.  All we  have to do is look back to the global financial crisis and how well stocks  and other risk assets did.</p><p>And we could see a replay of that again where accommodative, monetary  policy, Fed rate cuts enable stocks to not only hold their own, but make  some gains.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So I`ll ask you the same question.  How much do you think the  Fed will cut rates this month?</p><p>HOOPER:  I expect the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points.  And I --</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And what will the market`s response be to that do you think?</p><p>HOOPER:  I think markets will accept it and we could see stocks move  slightly higher, as long as the messaging remains dovish.  That`s really  what`s critical in September.</p><p>HERERA:  Would you agree with that, Barry?  It`s the messaging, not  necessarily the move?</p><p>BANNISTER:  The messaging obviously and Chairman Powell`s press conference  would be very important when they have the September meeting, but the  quarter point I think would not be enough.  I think the market would be  disappointed.</p><p>The other thing to consider is that all this talk of trade war, the U.S.  economy what`s called the domestic GDP is holding up very well.  The  unemployment is exceptionally low.</p><p>The real problem is the international.  The trade war is much harder on the  rest of the world than it is on the U.S.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>BANNISTER:  And a lot of the global companies in the large capitalization  index, they`re suffering for it.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.</p><p>BANNISTER:  So that`s why it`s important.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We must move along, but a good conversation from both of you.   Thank you.</p><p>Barry Bannister with Stifel, Kristina Hooper with Invesco, thanks for  joining us tonight.</p><p>HOOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and  Downgrades\".</p><p>Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, was upgraded to outperform from  inline at Evercore.  The analyst cites the company`s move into gaming.  The  price target is $20.  The stock rose a fraction to $15.93.</p><p>Square was upgraded to buy from hold, but SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, the  analyst there cites the company`s investments in his point of sale card  readers to attract some new customers.  The price target is $80.  Despite  the upgrade, the stock fell 1 percent to $61.13.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) was downgraded to underperform from hold  at Jefferies today.  The analyst cited increased competition in that hot  alcoholic seltzer drink market right now.  Price target, $332.  The stock  fell 6 percent today to $411.10.</p><p>Amazon`s Price Target (NYSE:TGT) was raised to $2,600 from $2,250 by RBC  Capital Markets.  The analyst cites the company`s new prime one day  shipping initiative.  The firm has an outperform rating on the stock and  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose a fraction today $1,789.84.</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, open house.  Some millennials are jumping into the real  estate market and it`s showing up in home prices.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) may be the next target of a new antitrust  prob.  According to \"the Washington Post (NYSE:WPO),\" more than half of the  nation`s state attorneys general could announce an investigation next week.   Many states have been critical of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for its handling of  user`s personal information and its searches.  Over the summer, the  Department of Justice announced its own broad review into big tech.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Walmart is scaling back its firearms sales.  The world`s largest  retailer said today it`s going to stop selling handguns and certain types  of ammunition and it will no longer allow customers to openly carry  firearms in its stores while they shop.</p><p>CEO Doug McMillon said that the policy shift was a response to those fatal  shootings in two of his stores last month and he admitted that Walmart will  likely lower its market share of ammunition sales from 20 percent to as  little as 6 percent.  Shares of Walmart rose slightly in today`s session.   The shares of gun makers and firearm retailers, they fell in today`s  trading.</p><p>HERERA:  There are reports that new delays could keep Boeing`s 737 MAX  grounded into the holiday travel season.  According to \"The Wall Street  Journal,\" a tense meeting last month between Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  international regulators has pushed out the jet`s return.</p><p>As we reported, United pushed back the MAX`s return into December and  American made a similar announcement over weekend.  Boeing (NYSE:BA) was  the biggest drag on the Dow index today falling more than 2.5 percent.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Home prices had been cooling off for much of this year, we knew  that.  But that may not be the case anymore.  Demand is rising again,  especially among one segment of millennial buyers.</p><p>Diana Olick explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  They may have waited  longer than other generations, but older millennials are finally buying  homes and at a faster clip, thanks to low mortgage rates and rising  incomes.  More than a quarter said they want to buy a home in the next  year, according to a new survey by Core Logic.</p><p>That may be reigniting the fire under home prices.  Home price gains had  been shrinking over the year, but gains turned higher again this summer.   Home prices were 3.6 percent higher in July compared with July 2018,  according to Core Logic.  That is wider than the 3.4 percent gain in June.</p><p>Core Logic is now predicting an even larger 5.4 percent annual price gain  by July of 2020.  There is though a massive imbalance between supply and  demand, especially on the lower end of the market where demand is  strongest.  That`s where supply is leanest.</p><p>Sales on the low end fell 10 percent in July because there was so little  for sale.  Sales surged higher in the move up market where there are more  listings.  More listings would likely come on the market in early fall  before the winter freeze, but given the strong demand, it is unlikely to be  enough.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick, in Washington</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) inks a new leasing deal with American Tower  (NYSE:AMT).  That`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The long-term tower leasing deal streamlines wireless distribution at  American Tower`s U.S. sites.  It will also help AT&amp;T`s deployment of 5G and  other next generation technology across the country.  American Tower  (NYSE:AMT) shares rose more than 3 percent to $237.84.  AT&amp;T (NYSE:T)  shares were up a fraction to $35.38.</p><p>Retailer Conn`s (NASDAQ:CONN) saw a boost in new store offerings, improved  online offerings, and favorable credit performance.  All of that helped the  company top expectations.  Conn`s also plans to expand its presence with  more locations in the next fiscal year.  The stock rose more than 18  percent to $23.85.</p><p>Bio pharma firm The Medicines Company (NASDAQ:MDCO) said late stage trial  of an experimental drug showed lowering level of bad cholesterol.  The  drug, which is used twice a year, was tested against the placebo in  patients with heart disease.  Shares of The Medicines Company (NASDAQ:MDCO)  rose more than 10 percent to $46.31.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Spark Therapeutics and Roche have again extended Roche`s $4  billion offer for the gene therapy firm as regulatory reviews continue.   That extension now runs until October 1st.  Spark Therapeutics rose more  than 1 percent today to $98.67.</p><p>After the bell, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) said that it is lowering its full  year guidance due to a number of factors, including market volatility, a  beef processing plant fire and slower than expected operational  improvements in its chicken brand.  Shares dropped in initial after hours  trading this evening, but they closed the regular session up a fraction at  $93.29.</p><p>And hedge fund Starboard Value says it`s going to be taking a more than 7  percent stake in cloud service provider Box.  Starboard calls Box`s shares  undervalued.  This new investment makes it now the second largest  shareholder in Box.  And those shares rose in initial after-hours trading  on that news.  They closed the regular session up 1-1/2 percent to $14.85.</p><p>HERERA:  And as the calendar turns to September, so does the focus on  politics because some say what happens to the economy between now and the  end of the year could determine the outcome of the next presidential  election.</p><p>We`re joined from Washington by Mark Avallone, president of Potomac Wealth  Economic Advisers, and John Harwood joins us as well this evening.</p><p>Welcome, gentlemen.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>MARK AVALLONE, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS PRESIDENT:  Good to be here.</p><p>HERERA:  So, Mark, I`ll start with you.  What does history tell us about  how important the economic performance is in this latter part of the year  as it pertains to the election?</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well, that`s certainly as we get closer to 2020, it`s going to  be the issue.  It`s the kitchen table topic that families talk about and  the unemployment rate and wage growth and the outlook on the economy is  going to be the biggest driver.  And that`s why there`s so much pressure  right now on the Trump administration to reach a deal with tariffs because  as we heard, that`s the issue driving the fear in the markets and that`s  what`s slowing global growth.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And, of course, John, there`s been talk of maybe a tax cut of  some kind.  A payroll tax cut.  The president has said the things that I  remember Ross Perot used the call the free candy that politicians on both  sides of the aisle like to hand out at certain times of the year.</p><p>Is there anything the administration can do to balance the slowdown in the  economy if that happens because of the trade war?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I think the biggest  thing the administration could do to help itself economically would be to  call a cessation to the trade war.  We`re in a very dangerous point for the  Trump White House because Americans perception of where the economy is may  be changing right now.</p><p>We`ve had the backdrop of the entire Trump presidency, the idea that  markets were rising, the economy was growing in a robust rate.  Wages were  rising, especially for people at the bottom.  But we saw a poll last week  that showed for the first time in a long time, a plurality of people saying  the economy is more likely to get worse in the next year than better.</p><p>And if, all of a sudden, the backdrop for the Trump re-election campaign is  a slowing economy or worse yet, one that`s in recession, all bets are off  because then the culture wars diminish in significance and the economy  becomes a driving factor to his detriment.</p><p>HERERA:  Mark, we did get some economic news this morning.  Manufacturing  contracting sharply and you also make the point, it`s not just the tariffs  and trade war with China, but whatever administration says right now, they  also have some issues with Europe in terms of trade.  So, it`s kind of a  two front.  Is it not?</p><p>AVALLONE:  Yes, and that`s what`s co me at least in terms of why not align  with our allies against the main trade predator, China.  And that would  make a clear landscape for an early resolution.</p><p>The China trade war is also trickling into e emerging economies, creating a  global slowdown and while we are not primarily a manufacturing economy, it  is a growing importance.  It was thriving early in the first year or two of  the Trump administration, so we`re seeing everything being suppressed now,  whether it`s emerging countries growth, developed Europe growth, some  pockets at home.</p><p>And I think John made a good point as the year turns closer to the  election, how people feel about the economy is going to be just as  important if not more important than how the economy actually is.</p><p>HERERA:  Gentlemen, thank you very much.  Mark Avallone with Potomac Wealth  Advisors and John Harwood, thank you both.</p><p>AVALLONE:  Good to be here.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, how China`s Christmas village is trying to stay  jolly during the trade war.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  In the news tonight, Hurricane Dorian.  Of course, it has been  devastating for those residents caught in its path, but it`s already  affecting a number of businesses.  Airlines have canceled 1,400 flights so  far.  Some airports have been shut down.</p><p>One analyst estimates that cruise lines could see a reduction of five cents  per share for the current quarter, because of cancellations and UBS says  that hurricanes could cost insurers about $25 billion.  But share of those  insurers with exposures to Florida did move higher due to the storm`s  changing path off the coast.</p><p>HERERA:  Members of the United Auto Workers Union granted union leaders  authorization to strike during contract negotiations with the big three  automakers.  The union said about 96 percent of members support the action.   GM will lead the negotiations which come amid a widening probe into union  corruption, which we told you about last week.  The industry is also  grappling with slowing demand and rising trade tension.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Finally tonight, if you own Christmas lights or ornament,  chances are they were made in a small town in China.  It`s known as  Christmas Village.  But this year with the ongoing trade war, there isn`t a  lot of holiday cheer.</p><p>Eunice Yoon is there for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I`m in the Chinese  town of Yiwu where it`s Christmas 365 days a year.  This eastern coastal  city makes roughly half of the world`s Christmas decorations.  Buyers come  from all over the world to meet with Chinese manufacturers here and hunt  for everything from artificial trees to dancing Santas.</p><p>Manufacturers tell us for the most part, orders have been priced and  shipped for this year, but with new tariffs hitting this past weekend and  in December, they`re scared about orders for Christmas next year.  Some  estimate orders could drop by at least 10 percent.</p><p>The Christmas industry is a low margin business and the factories believe  that the confrontation with the U.S. will last for another year or two at  least.  So, they`re looking for ways to survive and have more flexibility  than you might think.  Some are thinking of moving production to less  developed rural parts of China where they say land can be a tenth of a cost  here in the coast, and labor 40 percent cheaper.</p><p>They`re also looking for to expand businesses in markets outside the U.S.,  in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia.  For many  manufacturers here, the U.S. only makes up 10 to 25 percent of their sales.   In the short-term, they`re working out with their customers who is going to  eat the tariffs.  Some of the manufactures say they`re absorbing 3 percent  to 5 percent.</p><p>But this latest round of tariffs hitting so many consumer products, they  say that the cost will be shared with American retailers and consumers.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Yiwu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Here`s another look at final numbers from Wall Street.  The Dow  fell 285 points.  Nasdaq down 88.  S&amp;P 500 down 20.</p><p>That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for  joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.

Stocks tumble to start the month after the new report on the economy adds to worries about the impact of the escalating trade war.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: It`s the economy. Why now through the end of the year could determine who wins the White House in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: Home sweet home. A growing number of millennials are ready to buy homes and it could heat up an otherwise cool housing market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, September 3rd.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>Well, September is living up to its reputation as being a rough month. We`re only one day in and today was pretty bumpy. The trading day started with new tariffs on U.S. and Chinese goods, marking the latest escalation in the long-running trade war between the world`s two largest economies. That dampened investor sentiment.</p><p>Then came a weak report on manufacturing. Its weakest read in three years, raising fears of an economic slowdown and that dented sentiment further. Investors loaded up on gold and U.S. treasuries sending yields lower and pressuring bank stocks.</p><p>And by the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 285 points to 26,118. The Nasdaq was down 88, and S&amp;P500 slid 20.</p><p>Seema Mody starts us off tonight from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Wall Street started the month of September on a down note as President Trump come forth with a new set of tariffs. Investors are losing faith that a trade deal will be reached before the end of the year. This as officials from the US. and China had yet to confirm a date for a September meeting that would launch another round of trade talks.</p><p>Stocks continue to decline after the Institute for Supply Management`s manufacturing index unexpectedly contracted for the first time in three years, due in part to tariffs and the broader global slowdown. At one point, The Dow Jones dropped 428 points, but finished off the lows of the day. Industrials, many of which are exposed to China, led the major indices lower as did energy and technology stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>September is historically a bad month Wall Street. Strategists are worried that this September could be especially tough for investors as U.S. tensions remain high and worries over whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next policy meeting. Tomorrow, investors will be keeping a close eye on the manufacturing data released from a number of European countries and a speech from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Seema Mody.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And as she just mentioned, trade was a major overhang on Wall Street today as it has been for quite some time and those escalating tensions are getting trickier for businesses to navigate.</p><p>Kayla Tausche has that story in Washington tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Many products leaving ports in China and the U.S. over the weekend just got more expensive. With the U.S. charging 15 percent on footwear, clothes and certain tech products totaling $112 billion. China slapping tariffs on $75 billion in goods. A late June truce between Presidents Trump and Xi short lived as the two economic powers are back to battling over trade with the holiday season around the corner.</p><p>GARY SHAPIRO, CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION: He`s promised us now for a year and a half this is just a short-term thing and we`ve gone along with it, not happily, of course, but he keeps increasing. He`s increased so much now on almost every product that consumers are going to feel it. In fact, businesses are already feeling it.</p><p>TAUSCHE: The hit could have been worse. Three sources say President Trump wanted to double existing tariffs after learning of China`s retaliation. Treasury secretary and the U.S. trade representatives enlisted CEOs to talk Trump out of it.</p><p>Days later, Secretary Mnuchin acknowledged Trump wanted more.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: His only second thoughts, as he said, was maybe he should raise tariffs more.</p><p>TAUSCHE: President Trump said on Twitter he`d be much tougher on China after his potential re-election, warning of China`s economy deteriorating in the meantime.</p><p>The Chamber of Commerce says for business, getting back to the negotiating table would be more effective.</p><p>TOM DONOHUE, U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: And I think it would have been much better doing that than continuing to ratchet up of who`s got the biggest threat available at the time. It`s all going to be paid by American companies and American consumers between now and the end of the year. We should do better.</p><p>TAUSCHE: A call between U.S. and Chinese officials last Thursday did not produce any tariff relief. The two sides had been discussing in-person negotiations in Washington this month, but no date for those talks has been set.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: By the way, later in the program, we`re going to take you to the town in China that makes roughly half the world`s Christmas lights and ornaments. We`re going to see how things have been charged there by the trade war.</p><p>HERERA: When investors are not concerned about trade, they are worried about the Federal Reserve and the path forward for interest rates. And that concern will likely build ahead of its policy meeting later this month.</p><p>Steve Liesman takes a look at what might lie ahead for the Fed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The breeze investors feel is not a local wind, it`s a global downdraft in interest rates that`s expected to blow harder this month. On September 12th, the European Central Bank meets, and on September 18th, the Federal Reserve meets. Both are expected to reduce interest rates or otherwise provide monetary policy easing. That could boost the Japanese yen, pressuring the Bank of Japan to cut, and Mark Carney, the governor of Bank of England, he`s only holding his fire until he knows how the U.K. is going to exit the European Union in the Brexit process.</p><p>In an exclusive interview in Jackson Hole, Mark Carney talked about the impact of Brexit and trade.</p><p>MARK CARNEY, BANK OF ENGLAND GOVERNOR: Business investment is actually running almost 25 percentage points below its previous trend. Business in the U.K. and quite reasonably said, wait a minute, I`m going to wait until if they have any exposure to Europe, either upstream or downstream, they decided to wait and see what are the new rules of the game going to be. That`s part of what`s happening worldwide as people saying, well, OK, I`ve got exposure to Chinese supply chain or U.S., let me see where this settles out.</p><p>LIESMAN: There`s a widespread ride now in global interest rates. China`s central benchmark rate is at 4.35 percent. The U.S. at 2.13. The U.K. at just three quarters of a percent while Europe is at zero, and Japan is minus 0.1.</p><p>It`s not just Central Banks in the developed world that are cutting. Of 37 emerging market central banks looked at by \"Reuters\", there`s been a net 14 cuts in August. That`s the most in a decade. And that`s up from eight net cuts in July and it`s the seventh straight month of cuts from these banks.</p><p>The Fed is expected to cut rates in September and again in October. That could prompt another global downdraft in interest rates. The question is, is the tailwind provided to economies from lower rates enough to offset the headwinds from slower growth and a trade war?</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: There was some positive news on the economy today. Construction spending ticked higher in July after falling more than 2 percent so far this year. According to the Commerce Department, government spending on schools, sewers and the water supply picked up as did construction for single family homes.</p><p>HERERA: A key vote in the U.K. parliament tonight and a potential major blow to the new prime minister. Lawmakers moved to take control of parliament. A vote will now be held tomorrow which could prevent the government from being able to withdraw from the European Union without a deal at the end of October.</p><p>A so-called hard Brexit is something economists have viewed as a risk to the global economy.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, trade, slowing economy, the Fed, they all continue to weigh on stocks as we begin this month September. What`s it going to bring for investors?</p><p>We have two market pros with opposing views on that tonight with us.</p><p>Barry Bannister is head of equity strategy at Stifel. He sees a tough month ahead for stocks.</p><p>While Kristina Hooper thinks that the market is going to hold up fairly well. She`s chief global market strategist at Invesco.</p><p>Good to see you both. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>KRISTINA HOOPER, INVESCO CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST: Thank you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Kristina, I`m gong to start with you. We had an epic volatility in the month of August with all kinds of issues going on with the trade war and the Fed. If I`m reading your notes right, you see things settling down a bit? What do you see happening in September?</p><p>HOOPER: Well, I expect more volatility, but we could see a similar scenario that we saw in August, where we get a lot of negative news flow, a lot of fluctuations in the stock market, but ultimately, finish the month in fairly good standing, with stocks holding their own and possibly eking out gains.</p><p>HERERA: Barry, you think it is going to be a rough September. I mean, we just detailed what`s going on in the U.K. with Brexit. That`s another fly in the ointment in terms of global tensions that are out there. How do you see September playing out and what role will the Fed play?</p><p>BARRY BANNISTER, STIFEL HEAD OF EQUITY STRATEGY: Well, to me, it looks like a game of two chickens, right? So, on the one hand, you`ve got the Fed and the trade policy in the White House going head on to each other and neither one wants to turn their car. So, it`s like a game of chicken.</p><p>And the other hand, when you look at the market, it`s a chicken and an egg problem in that eggs are going to have to break before the Fed turns chicken enough to start whacking those rates. The Fed took rates up at the end of last year to 2.4 percent in a world with zero rates. It was just too tight for the rest of the world.</p><p>And so, in effect, the rest of the world has slowed down. U.S. exports are going to weaken appreciably. We`re probably going to see an inventory pile up. The industrial sector was weaker than we expected.</p><p>So, it looks pretty tough until we can convince the Fed to really cut those rates aggressively, which they need to do. They`re the biggest problem right now. Keeping those rates above 2 percent on the short end, which is way above the 10-year yield right now.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Barry, how -- what are you expecting this month? Are you among those who would like to see 350 basis points cut in September?</p><p>BANNISTER: Well, absolutely. I think they need to at least move towards what the futures expect. Well, the market`s job is essentially to riot, until the Fed adapts to what the market expects.</p><p>So, when you think about it, the Fed funds expected, expected by the futures market to be 1 percent at the end of 2020. They`re at 2.1 now and not talking about anything like that kind of rate cut. So, yes, they need to move and they need to move fast.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Kristina, you think the Fed can probably be positive for the stock market if indeed they do cut rates, but what about for the economy?</p><p>HOOPER: Well, I don`t think the Fed has the cure for what`s ailing the economy, which is tariffs. The only thing that can stop that is a resolution to the trade war. But the Fed does have in its arsenal, monetary policy tools that can be very supportive of risk assets. All we have to do is look back to the global financial crisis and how well stocks and other risk assets did.</p><p>And we could see a replay of that again where accommodative, monetary policy, Fed rate cuts enable stocks to not only hold their own, but make some gains.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So I`ll ask you the same question. How much do you think the Fed will cut rates this month?</p><p>HOOPER: I expect the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points. And I --</p><p>GRIFFETH: And what will the market`s response be to that do you think?</p><p>HOOPER: I think markets will accept it and we could see stocks move slightly higher, as long as the messaging remains dovish. That`s really what`s critical in September.</p><p>HERERA: Would you agree with that, Barry? It`s the messaging, not necessarily the move?</p><p>BANNISTER: The messaging obviously and Chairman Powell`s press conference would be very important when they have the September meeting, but the quarter point I think would not be enough. I think the market would be disappointed.</p><p>The other thing to consider is that all this talk of trade war, the U.S. economy what`s called the domestic GDP is holding up very well. The unemployment is exceptionally low.</p><p>The real problem is the international. The trade war is much harder on the rest of the world than it is on the U.S.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>BANNISTER: And a lot of the global companies in the large capitalization index, they`re suffering for it.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right.</p><p>BANNISTER: So that`s why it`s important.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We must move along, but a good conversation from both of you. Thank you.</p><p>Barry Bannister with Stifel, Kristina Hooper with Invesco, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>HOOPER: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, was upgraded to outperform from inline at Evercore. The analyst cites the company`s move into gaming. The price target is $20. The stock rose a fraction to $15.93.</p><p>Square was upgraded to buy from hold, but SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, the analyst there cites the company`s investments in his point of sale card readers to attract some new customers. The price target is $80. Despite the upgrade, the stock fell 1 percent to $61.13.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) was downgraded to underperform from hold at Jefferies today. The analyst cited increased competition in that hot alcoholic seltzer drink market right now. Price target, $332. The stock fell 6 percent today to $411.10.</p><p>Amazon`s Price Target (NYSE:TGT) was raised to $2,600 from $2,250 by RBC Capital Markets. The analyst cites the company`s new prime one day shipping initiative. The firm has an outperform rating on the stock and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose a fraction today $1,789.84.</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, open house. Some millennials are jumping into the real estate market and it`s showing up in home prices.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) may be the next target of a new antitrust prob. According to \"the Washington Post (NYSE:WPO),\" more than half of the nation`s state attorneys general could announce an investigation next week. Many states have been critical of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for its handling of user`s personal information and its searches. Over the summer, the Department of Justice announced its own broad review into big tech.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Walmart is scaling back its firearms sales. The world`s largest retailer said today it`s going to stop selling handguns and certain types of ammunition and it will no longer allow customers to openly carry firearms in its stores while they shop.</p><p>CEO Doug McMillon said that the policy shift was a response to those fatal shootings in two of his stores last month and he admitted that Walmart will likely lower its market share of ammunition sales from 20 percent to as little as 6 percent. Shares of Walmart rose slightly in today`s session. The shares of gun makers and firearm retailers, they fell in today`s trading.</p><p>HERERA: There are reports that new delays could keep Boeing`s 737 MAX grounded into the holiday travel season. According to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" a tense meeting last month between Boeing (NYSE:BA) and international regulators has pushed out the jet`s return.</p><p>As we reported, United pushed back the MAX`s return into December and American made a similar announcement over weekend. Boeing (NYSE:BA) was the biggest drag on the Dow index today falling more than 2.5 percent.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Home prices had been cooling off for much of this year, we knew that. But that may not be the case anymore. Demand is rising again, especially among one segment of millennial buyers.</p><p>Diana Olick explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: They may have waited longer than other generations, but older millennials are finally buying homes and at a faster clip, thanks to low mortgage rates and rising incomes. More than a quarter said they want to buy a home in the next year, according to a new survey by Core Logic.</p><p>That may be reigniting the fire under home prices. Home price gains had been shrinking over the year, but gains turned higher again this summer. Home prices were 3.6 percent higher in July compared with July 2018, according to Core Logic. That is wider than the 3.4 percent gain in June.</p><p>Core Logic is now predicting an even larger 5.4 percent annual price gain by July of 2020. There is though a massive imbalance between supply and demand, especially on the lower end of the market where demand is strongest. That`s where supply is leanest.</p><p>Sales on the low end fell 10 percent in July because there was so little for sale. Sales surged higher in the move up market where there are more listings. More listings would likely come on the market in early fall before the winter freeze, but given the strong demand, it is unlikely to be enough.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick, in Washington</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) inks a new leasing deal with American Tower (NYSE:AMT). That`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The long-term tower leasing deal streamlines wireless distribution at American Tower`s U.S. sites. It will also help AT&amp;T`s deployment of 5G and other next generation technology across the country. American Tower (NYSE:AMT) shares rose more than 3 percent to $237.84. AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) shares were up a fraction to $35.38.</p><p>Retailer Conn`s (NASDAQ:CONN) saw a boost in new store offerings, improved online offerings, and favorable credit performance. All of that helped the company top expectations. Conn`s also plans to expand its presence with more locations in the next fiscal year. The stock rose more than 18 percent to $23.85.</p><p>Bio pharma firm The Medicines Company (NASDAQ:MDCO) said late stage trial of an experimental drug showed lowering level of bad cholesterol. The drug, which is used twice a year, was tested against the placebo in patients with heart disease. Shares of The Medicines Company (NASDAQ:MDCO) rose more than 10 percent to $46.31.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Spark Therapeutics and Roche have again extended Roche`s $4 billion offer for the gene therapy firm as regulatory reviews continue. That extension now runs until October 1st. Spark Therapeutics rose more than 1 percent today to $98.67.</p><p>After the bell, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) said that it is lowering its full year guidance due to a number of factors, including market volatility, a beef processing plant fire and slower than expected operational improvements in its chicken brand. Shares dropped in initial after hours trading this evening, but they closed the regular session up a fraction at $93.29.</p><p>And hedge fund Starboard Value says it`s going to be taking a more than 7 percent stake in cloud service provider Box. Starboard calls Box`s shares undervalued. This new investment makes it now the second largest shareholder in Box. And those shares rose in initial after-hours trading on that news. They closed the regular session up 1-1/2 percent to $14.85.</p><p>HERERA: And as the calendar turns to September, so does the focus on politics because some say what happens to the economy between now and the end of the year could determine the outcome of the next presidential election.</p><p>We`re joined from Washington by Mark Avallone, president of Potomac Wealth Economic Advisers, and John Harwood joins us as well this evening.</p><p>Welcome, gentlemen. Nice to have you here.</p><p>MARK AVALLONE, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS PRESIDENT: Good to be here.</p><p>HERERA: So, Mark, I`ll start with you. What does history tell us about how important the economic performance is in this latter part of the year as it pertains to the election?</p><p>AVALLONE: Well, that`s certainly as we get closer to 2020, it`s going to be the issue. It`s the kitchen table topic that families talk about and the unemployment rate and wage growth and the outlook on the economy is going to be the biggest driver. And that`s why there`s so much pressure right now on the Trump administration to reach a deal with tariffs because as we heard, that`s the issue driving the fear in the markets and that`s what`s slowing global growth.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And, of course, John, there`s been talk of maybe a tax cut of some kind. A payroll tax cut. The president has said the things that I remember Ross Perot used the call the free candy that politicians on both sides of the aisle like to hand out at certain times of the year.</p><p>Is there anything the administration can do to balance the slowdown in the economy if that happens because of the trade war?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I think the biggest thing the administration could do to help itself economically would be to call a cessation to the trade war. We`re in a very dangerous point for the Trump White House because Americans perception of where the economy is may be changing right now.</p><p>We`ve had the backdrop of the entire Trump presidency, the idea that markets were rising, the economy was growing in a robust rate. Wages were rising, especially for people at the bottom. But we saw a poll last week that showed for the first time in a long time, a plurality of people saying the economy is more likely to get worse in the next year than better.</p><p>And if, all of a sudden, the backdrop for the Trump re-election campaign is a slowing economy or worse yet, one that`s in recession, all bets are off because then the culture wars diminish in significance and the economy becomes a driving factor to his detriment.</p><p>HERERA: Mark, we did get some economic news this morning. Manufacturing contracting sharply and you also make the point, it`s not just the tariffs and trade war with China, but whatever administration says right now, they also have some issues with Europe in terms of trade. So, it`s kind of a two front. Is it not?</p><p>AVALLONE: Yes, and that`s what`s co me at least in terms of why not align with our allies against the main trade predator, China. And that would make a clear landscape for an early resolution.</p><p>The China trade war is also trickling into e emerging economies, creating a global slowdown and while we are not primarily a manufacturing economy, it is a growing importance. It was thriving early in the first year or two of the Trump administration, so we`re seeing everything being suppressed now, whether it`s emerging countries growth, developed Europe growth, some pockets at home.</p><p>And I think John made a good point as the year turns closer to the election, how people feel about the economy is going to be just as important if not more important than how the economy actually is.</p><p>HERERA: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Mark Avallone with Potomac Wealth Advisors and John Harwood, thank you both.</p><p>AVALLONE: Good to be here.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, how China`s Christmas village is trying to stay jolly during the trade war.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: In the news tonight, Hurricane Dorian. Of course, it has been devastating for those residents caught in its path, but it`s already affecting a number of businesses. Airlines have canceled 1,400 flights so far. Some airports have been shut down.</p><p>One analyst estimates that cruise lines could see a reduction of five cents per share for the current quarter, because of cancellations and UBS says that hurricanes could cost insurers about $25 billion. But share of those insurers with exposures to Florida did move higher due to the storm`s changing path off the coast.</p><p>HERERA: Members of the United Auto Workers Union granted union leaders authorization to strike during contract negotiations with the big three automakers. The union said about 96 percent of members support the action. GM will lead the negotiations which come amid a widening probe into union corruption, which we told you about last week. The industry is also grappling with slowing demand and rising trade tension.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Finally tonight, if you own Christmas lights or ornament, chances are they were made in a small town in China. It`s known as Christmas Village. But this year with the ongoing trade war, there isn`t a lot of holiday cheer.</p><p>Eunice Yoon is there for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m in the Chinese town of Yiwu where it`s Christmas 365 days a year. This eastern coastal city makes roughly half of the world`s Christmas decorations. Buyers come from all over the world to meet with Chinese manufacturers here and hunt for everything from artificial trees to dancing Santas.</p><p>Manufacturers tell us for the most part, orders have been priced and shipped for this year, but with new tariffs hitting this past weekend and in December, they`re scared about orders for Christmas next year. Some estimate orders could drop by at least 10 percent.</p><p>The Christmas industry is a low margin business and the factories believe that the confrontation with the U.S. will last for another year or two at least. So, they`re looking for ways to survive and have more flexibility than you might think. Some are thinking of moving production to less developed rural parts of China where they say land can be a tenth of a cost here in the coast, and labor 40 percent cheaper.</p><p>They`re also looking for to expand businesses in markets outside the U.S., in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. For many manufacturers here, the U.S. only makes up 10 to 25 percent of their sales. In the short-term, they`re working out with their customers who is going to eat the tariffs. Some of the manufactures say they`re absorbing 3 percent to 5 percent.</p><p>But this latest round of tariffs hitting so many consumer products, they say that the cost will be shared with American retailers and consumers.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Yiwu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Here`s another look at final numbers from Wall Street. The Dow fell 285 points. Nasdaq down 88. S&amp;P 500 down 20.</p><p>That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth.

Auto sales sizzled. Demand for tracks and crossovers sore as buyers rush into showrooms. But prices are rising as well to record levels. Will that slam the brakes on the buying frenzy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Power house. America`s oil boom is so powerful that a new study out today says it will actually boost the income of American households and create millions of jobs. But how and by how much?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Get smart. The battle over your wrist has begun. Samsung and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) taking the first swing, beating Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to the punch. But with big firms investing big money in smart watches, what`s at stake if consumers just don`t buy in?</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, September 4th.</p><p>Good evening, everybody. I`m Sue Herrera, in for Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>GHARIB: And I`m Susie Gharib. Good evening, everyone.</p><p>On Wall Street today, a red hot rally for the blue chips. The Dow posted its biggest gain in more than a month, even though investors are on edge about a possible military strike against Syria. They were encouraged to buy stocks, thanks to robust sales of cars and trucks in August. The major stock averages rallied as auto makers posted their strongest month since the government`s cash-for-clunkers incentive program back at the height of the financial crisis.</p><p>Here are the closing digits. The Dow jumped about 97 points, the NASDAQ rose 36. That was on the strength of tech stocks. And S&amp;P added 13 points.</p><p>HERERA: And now to break down those August sales figures for Detroit`s big three.</p><p>General Motor sales rose nearly 15 percent. That easily beat expectations.</p><p>Ford sales rose more than 12 percent from the same month last year. It`s best August in seven years.</p><p>And Chrysler had the best August in six years with sales up by 11.5 percent led by strong demand for its Ram pickup trucks.</p><p>With a closer look behind those numbers, we turn to Phil LeBeau in Chicago with more.</p><p>Hi, Phil.</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Sue.</p><p>Three things were driving better than expected sales last month. Let`s start first off by -- in the official number for August, $16.09 million. That was the sales pace for the month of august. That is the strongest monthly auto sales since November of 2007. So we are in a territory that we haven`t seen in six years.</p><p>And one reason why is that auto sales last month were helped by a strong Labor Day weekend. Those were actually lumped in with all of August, so that`s why you had stronger than expected numbers in part. Another reason, the people going into dealerships, they were buying in part because of low interest loans, leases, those are attracting buyers. Right now, it`s not uncommon to get zero percent financing for loans and leases.</p><p>The average transaction price tops $31,000. That is close to an all- time record high. And when you look at that, you might be saying, well, who is buying right now? In part, when you look at the pickup truck market, it`s the contractors, small business owners. They continue to replenish their fleets by buying new trucks. Large pickup sales up 19.3 percent in August, better than the overall sales pace for the industry.</p><p>And here`s a stat I love -- Ford sold one F-series pickup every 42 seconds last month. Not surprisingly, as it is almost every month. The F- series was the top-selling vehicle followed by the Camry, the Silverado, and the Civic.</p><p>And, Susie and Sue, one last statistic for you. Last month, the big three sold 44.1 percent of the vehicles in the United States. Asian auto makers sold 47.8. So, the Asian automakers had passed the big three at least in the month of August.</p><p>HERERA: You know, Phil, you mentioned those interest rates that are so attractive right, but rates are starting to rise. Do you expect that that is going to slow the pace of sales?</p><p>LEBEAU: Not for a while. They`re going to have to go up dramatically, Sue, because the cap of finance organizations for all of the auto makers, they are intent on keeping those rates as low as possible. Now, inevitably, as rates move higher, that`s going to have some impact on auto loan rates, as well as lease rates. But for the foreseeable future, they are expected to stay low.</p><p>GHARIB: Phil, you mentioned in your report that the average car price is now $31,000. So, given all the demand going on, will the prices go up even higher?</p><p>LEBEAU: I think so. I think you`re going to see it go up for two reasons. One, people are putting more content in their vehicles. So, they`re willing to say, you know what, if I`m going to pay for this over the next six or seven years, I`m going to put more content in it, and that`s pushing the price higher.</p><p>And at the same time, the auto makers are in the sweet spot right now, Susie. They can increase production as they want to. They are not forced to increase production and as a result, you got a tight supply and that`s allowing dealers to push prices higher.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, at least it`s a good sign that we have such robust sales going on. Phil, thank you so much.</p><p>LEBEAU: You bet.</p><p>GHARIB: That`s Phil LeBeau, reporting from Chicago.</p><p>To Washington now, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted today to approve a resolution authorizing a limited military strike against Syria. The resolution which passed by a 10-7 vote sets a 60-day limit on any U.S. military engagement in Syria and bars the deployment of any troops on the ground for combat duty. This also sets the stage for a debate and another vote by the full Senate next week. That`s when lawmakers return from their five-week summer break.</p><p>HERERA: President Obama was in Sweden today meeting with Scandinavian leaders ahead of the G-20 economic summit that starts Thursday in St. Petersburg, Russia. As Secretary of State John Kerry continued to make the case to U.S. lawmakers to back U.S.-led strike against Syria, the president tried to shift the onus for military action away from the U.S. and on to world leaders everywhere.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: In the face of such barbarism, the international community cannot be silent and that failing to respond to this attack would only increase the risk for more attacks, and that possibility that other countries would use these weapons, as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB: As the president tries to drum up support from the international community and Congress debates authorizing military action, Americans in the nation`s heartland have their own opinions about U.S. involvement in Syria.</p><p>In Oklahoma, many people expressed strong views about the U.S. getting involved in Syria civil war.</p><p>John Harwood joins us now from Midwest City, Oklahoma where he asked residents there how they feel about the Syrian crisis.</p><p>I know you have a lot of good stories to tell us, John.</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Susie, lots of conflicting pressures on lawmakers as they return next week on Syria and on budget and financial issues, as well. We got a taste of them here in Oklahoma`s fourth district. Congressman Tom Cole, the Republican representative, went to Tinker Air Force Base, a massive facility here, and heard that the base had been hurt but budget sequester and furloughs. They simply can`t afford the shut down that some Republicans have threatened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEN. BRUCE LITCHFIELD, TINKER AIR FORCE BASE: I don`t know what you would do on the flying operations and how that would operate, especially if, you know, with a mission if they have to do the nuclear mission that the Navy is responsible for on a day-to-day basis, the counter-drug counter-operations that you have along with the North American defense. I`m not sure how you do that in a total shut down.</p><p>REP. TOM COLE (R), OKLAHOMA: Come to my town hall tonight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARWOOD: And indeed, at that town hall tonight, very feisty conservatives said a shut down is exactly what we need as a tool to get rid of Obamacare.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Republicans have got to wake up and get -- you say, well, I think this will fly, that won`t fly and we can`t shut the government down. Let the government shut down, if that`s what they want to do. Let Obama be guilty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEBEAU: And, of course, on Syria, you had speaker after speaker questioning the president`s constitutional authority to act on his own and demanding that Congress not give him that authority.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where did he get this? You know, out of a Cracker Jack box or what? It`s n out of the Constitution. Just because the president made a statement that he should not have made should not bind Congress to go ahead and approve it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARWOOD: Now on that issue, Syria, Congressman Cole sides with the right in his district and he is leaning against voting to give authority, but he does want to see a deal on budget and financial issues to spare Tinker Air Force Base and avoid a financial crisis this fall, guys.</p><p>GHARIB: So, John, what exactly did the congressman say about how he`s going to vote on Syria, and also, what did he say about President Obama? Is he going to win support for military action?</p><p>HARWOOD: He`s leaning strongly against. He said he`ll listen to arguments over the next week, but he`s going to be a very, very hard sale for administration. He says he does think the president has a good chance of winning this vote.</p><p>House Speaker Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, both influential among Republicans, have come out in support of the president. That is a sign that he may be building some momentum in the House, but it`s not a sure thing.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, John, how close is this going to vote be? Because we heard from both sides of the isle and a number of Democrats are saying they`re going to vote no. And a couple of Republicans say they`re going to vote yes. So, how tight is it going to be?</p><p>HARWOOD: I think it will be very tight in the House, less so in the Senate, Democratic-controlled Senate. It moved out of the Foreign Relations Committee today, but I do think in the House, it`s going to be a nail biter that will require a very large Democratic vote to go with a minority of Republican votes.</p><p>Congressman Cole predicted that most Republicans would not vote with the speaker and with the president.</p><p>HERERA: John Harwood -- John, thank you so much.</p><p>And while Syria remains the biggest worry for Washington and, of course, for Wall Street the debate rages on about whether it`s time for the nation central bank to begin easing back on its stimulus plans. One top Fed official thinks that time is very near. John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco says the U.S. economy has nearly enough momentum right now without the need for any additional monetary stimulus from the Fed.</p><p>In a speech today in Oregon, Williams said he has an open mind about tapering but did not offer specific timetable for a possible pull back by the central bank.</p><p>GHARIB: And more from the Central Bank. Meanwhile, the latest Federal Reserve Beige Book survey of economic conditions around the nation lived up to its name today. There wasn`t a whole lot that was new or unexpected in the Fed`s latest region by region break down on the economy.</p><p>The Fed reports, quote, \"modest and moderate growth across most regions of the U.S. over the past six weeks or so as consumer spending, manufacturing and real estate activity all increased. But some Wall Street observers think this may be just enough for the central bank to again consider when to begin tapering back its bond-buying stimulus measures.</p><p>HERERA: Mortgage applications rose last week for the first time in a month, rising more than 1 percent. That`s after a slight dip in lending rates falling from the highest level so far this year for the week before and a pickup in refinancing. The Mortgage Bankers Association said borrowing costs climbed by more than a full percentage point since late May.</p><p>GHARIB: The U.S. is getting more competitive. The World Economic Forum says that U.S. competitiveness among global economies is rising again after four years of decline. The U.S., still the world`s largest economy, is now ranked in fifth place for overall competitiveness. That`s up from seventh last year.</p><p>HERERA: Well, the NASDAQ may not have felt very competitive for a short time today. The all-electronic exchange suffered a six-minute outage today in processing quotes and orders, but just for a small number of stocks. But the NASDAQ says trading was not interrupted and in a note sent to traders, they blamed a computer failure. A backup system successfully kicked in and the problem was resolved.</p><p>Today`s issue was not related to that massive outage on August 22nd when trading on all stocks was halted for three hours due to a trading software glitch.</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead on the program, America is awash in energy, but does the oil and gas boom help your finances? A new study says yes. That`s coming up.</p><p>But, first, here`s how the international markets closed today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: Did the S&amp;P really commit fraud, or is a new $5 billion lawsuit that it`s facing retaliation?</p><p>Standard &amp; Poor`s, the ratings agency owned by McGraw-Hill, is facing a fraud filed by the Justice Department. The suit alleges that S&amp;P misled banks and credit unions about the credibility of its ratings on mortgage backed securities, just ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. S&amp;P says the suit is just, quote, \"retaliation\" for being the only major credit rating agency to take away the U.S.` AAA rating during the recession. That`s when the Treasury hit its debt ceiling and Congress failed to reach a federal budget.</p><p>HERERA: Another fine for America`s largest bank. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase has agreed to pay $18.3 million to settle a class-action lawsuit claiming it made inadequate disclosure about the resetting of interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages that it was currently selling.</p><p>GHARIB: A big blow for Boeing (NYSE:BA) today. Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) announced plans to buy 40 new passenger jets worth about $5.5 billion from Airbus. It`s European`s plane maker`s first order from Delta in two decades. The first batch of brand-new A330s will arrive in 2015. The rest of Delta`s order, the smaller A321 jets, which are being phased out, are due in 2016.</p><p>HERERA: Toyota (NYSE:TM) is recalling 369,000 vehicles worldwide. Its high-end hybrid SUVs may stop running if a hybrid engine system alarm goes off and its luxury Lexus sedans could stall out because of a loose engine bolt. A company spokesman says no accidents related to either problem have been reported.</p><p>GHARIB: We begin our \"Market Focus\" tonight with a retailer that`s having a rough day. Shares of Francesca`s, which sells women`s apparel and accessories, fell sharply after the company reported weaker than expected earnings and said sales would continue to decline. It`s the latest retailer to take a hit from cautious spending as more consumers forgo impulse items like shoes and dresses and focus instead on buying houses and cars. The stock fell almost 26 percent to $17.79.</p><p>A different story, though, for Ciena. This network equipment-maker reporting a narrower-than-expected loss and forecasting strong revenue growth for the current quarter. The company is benefitting from a recovery and spending by telecom carriers which are upgrading their wireless and wire line network, that`s creating big demand for network here. The stock soaring almost 14 percent to $23.54, and that`s also a good trend news for Ciena`s rivals Juniper and JDS Uniphase (NASDAQ:JDSU) rose today.</p><p>Shares of Navistar sputtering today. The engine maker reported its fourth straight quarterly loss and says it will cut 500 jobs. Navistar says its core truck business was hurt by a failed redesign and lower industry demand. The stock fell more than 2 percent to $33 and change.</p><p>HERERA: Dollar General`s earnings beat expectations. The value retailer attracted customers into the stores by selling more groceries and brand name products. The company also reported sales growth that exceeded its competitors. The results warned that frugal shoppers, however, are making it difficult to raise prices.</p><p>At the close, the stock was up almost 5 percent to $56.39.</p><p>And shares of data storage makers Micron Tech and SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) rallied on heavy volume following news of a fire at a rival chipmaker`s plant. That rival, Hynix, was forced to suspend operations at its factory in China. But after an initial assessment, Hynix said it expects to resume production shortly.</p><p>Shares of Micron Tech rose 5 percent to $14.75. And SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) gained 3 percent to $57.14.</p><p>And Green Mountain isn`t just about brewing coffee anymore. It`s also getting into soup. Campbell`s Soup will sell K-cups for Green Mountain`s Keurig machines that will brew a cup of chicken broth. The K-cups will come with pockets of dried noodles and vegetables that you can mix right in. The partnership marks Green Mountain`s first attempt to expand beyond beverages. The stock rose about 1 percent to $86.30, while Campbell saw a fractional gain of $42.92.</p><p>American family piggy banks are bulging a little bit more these days. A new study out today says that thanks to the oil and gas boom and lower energy prices, household incomes are up by $1,200 and according to IHS (NYSE:IHS) that conducted the study for the energy industry, the fracking boom, rather, will boost household incomes by as much as $2,000 by the year 2015, and create more than 3 million jobs throughout the economy over the next five years.</p><p>Joining us now to talk more about this is John Larson. He`s co-author of the study and vice president of the economics at IHS (NYSE:IHS).</p><p>John, thanks for joining us and, you know, this is great news to hear. We all benefitted from lower prices.</p><p>But as you look out and you`re making your forecast out to the year 2020, how much of your assumptions are based on lower energy prices? It might not work out that way, right?</p><p>JOHN LARSON, IHS (NYSE:IHS) VICE PRESIDENT OF ECONOMICS: Well, I think you`re right. There is an important story that has to be told about where the energy prices will go. And when you look at the supply side of the equation, the rapid growth in this unconventional technology has really unlocked a tremendous amount of resource space and you`ve seen tremendous growth in both oil and natural gas production. And so, we feel very confident about that underlying assessment of where that supply will go and where the corresponding price paths will be.</p><p>There is a tremendous wealth of availability of natural gas in this country of around at a dollar price of $4 to $5 MMBtu.</p><p>So, I think when you look at relative to the global prices, and that`s the key, that`s what determines the break-even economics for the underlying plays allowing us to enjoy this energy renaissance and corresponding economic growth, you do see an opportunity for it to continue into 2025 and beyond actually.</p><p>HERERA: You know, John, as Susie mentioned, that`s good news for all of America certainly. But your numbers seem a little bit higher than some of the other studies that are out there. Is that because you base it on something different or your metrics were different than other numbers, why?</p><p>LARSON: Well, it`s important when you look at this industry, you have to understand the full breath of the industry, to supply chain from the wellhead, all the way down to the consumer and the supply network that supports and enables this activity to take place. And so, we`re looking at not just the roughneck that`s working the wellhead, we`re looking at the steel furnace in Pittsburgh that`s fabricating the steel and the pipe fitters and drill bit manufacturers in Ohio.</p><p>And so, we`re trying to capture that full supply chain and then look at the broader macro economic effects that are leading as you said to this income effect for consumers. I think that`s the real highlight is how profound this income effect is for all consumers. And, obviously, when more consumers have more hundred in their wallets they step back into the economy and purchase more goods and services, which in turn spurs greater economic growth.</p><p>So, I don`t think we`re over stating it at all. I think it`s been a profound effect and it`s going to continue to have a profound effect going forward as that income grows for all individuals in this economy.</p><p>GHARIB: And part of this whole energy boom is because of fracking and you mentioned the word \"fracking\" and people right away say about what the environment. I mean, to what extent will environmental concerns or restrictions going forward impact a savings, household savings?</p><p>LARSON: Well, obviously, look at the current set of rules and regulations. Our study was based on a status quo of those current regulatory frameworks that are conducted at the state level, and there is a whole host of permanent (ph) and other regulatory procedures in place. This is an industry that requires a significant amount of activity. You have to go out and explore to identify new places and then conduct all the underlying drilling.</p><p>So, if that activity was curtailed, it does fairly quickly have knock on effects down through the economy and could risk pulling that money out of the pocketbooks of Americans.</p><p>GHARIB: And, John, real quickly, who funded this study?</p><p>LARSON: This study was founded by a coalition of organizations from the American Chemistry Council, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Fertilizer Institute, organizations along those types of natures have helped contribute to analysis we conducted.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, it`s a fascinating study. Thanks so much for coming on the program to tell us about it. John Larson with IHS (NYSE:IHS).</p><p>Sue?</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, two major companies are kick-starting a whole new category of electronics, smart watches -- and some are calling it the most important new product since the launch of the iPad.</p><p>But first, a look at how commodities, treasuries and currencies performed today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: It`s one of the biggest gifts ever given to a college. New York real estate mogul Stephen Ross who is also the owner of the Miami Dolphins is donating $200 million to his alma mater. It`s the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The money will be splint between the Stephen M. Ross School of Business and the school`s athletic department.</p><p>This latest gift`s raises total donations to the university to more than $300 million.</p><p>HERERA: Well, this sounds like something out of those old Dick Tracey comics. But the smartwatch from Samsung is a wearable tech device and it`s now a reality.</p><p>Seema Mody was there for the unveiling in New York City today and she has more on the latest gadget you thought you didn`t need.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Samsung Galaxy Gear.</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The battle for your wrist has begun.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Welcome to the future.</p><p>MODY: Samsung and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) both announcing to the world the smartwatch has arrived. They are the first serious entrance into what`s expected to be a huge market for the tech industry.</p><p>(on camera): Analysts write that the smart watch is the most important product category to watch in a consumer electronics space. And some of the big tech names are taking notice -- Sony (NYSE:SNE), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) all are said to be working on their own version of a smart watch device.</p><p>Gardner (ph) expects that 5 million to 10 million smart watches may ship this year as Samsung and others get it right. And the trend towards wearable tech looks to be here to stay.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it`s a great idea.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can carry it around wherever you go, with every outfit you can go, as long as it looks cute.</p><p>MODY: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) made shock waves when it introduced Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Glass last year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Once they get a little more slim, I think a lot of people -- more people will be interested in it. But right now, it stands out and device some people love it, some people are like I`m not ever wearing that thing.</p><p>MODY: For some reason, data suggests the time for wearable devices to really take off the consumers could be closer at hand, literally. A survey conducted by Forester found that when consumers were asked where they would want to wear a device, 29 percent said clipped to clothing, 28 percent opted for wrist, and while only 12 percent said glass.</p><p>But with today`s announcement, Samsung delivered a clear message to its biggest rival. The battle of consumers is going to get a lot more fierce in the months to come.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Seema Mody in New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: And Samsung might have more invasions to talk about in a few weeks. It`s scheduled a conference in Seoul, South Korea, for November 6th, for investors and analysts and the topic, the future of smart phones. Also on the agenda, Samsung`s long-term growth strategy.</p><p>HERERA: But not to be undone, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung`s biggest rival, of course, for phone sales, it has a big week ahead of it. The company announced an event next Tuesday, September 10th, at its Cupertino, California headquarters. The next day, September 11th, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will host an event in Beijing where it`s expected to announce a deal with China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), that nation`s biggest carrier to finally begin selling the iPhone there.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally tonight, a new building going up in London`s financial district is being called a fry-scaper, and with good reason. The 37-story glass enclosed structure is reflecting so much sunlight that it`s literally melting cars. It actually melted parts of a Jaguar parked outside the building last week. The build`s developer has apologized and has offered to pay for the repairs.</p><p>And, Sue, people in Las Vegas should pay attention. Apparently, the same architect is building a building there and it`s a lot sunnier --</p><p>HERERA: Oh, yes.</p><p>GHARIB: -- and it`s a lot hotter.</p><p>HERERA: Can you imagine calling home, honey, the car is melted? Can you imagine that?</p><p>GHARIB: Especially a Jaguar.</p><p>HERERA: Especially a Jag, exactly. Wow.</p><p>GHARIB: That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Susie Gharib. For more business stories, log on to our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p>HERERA: And I`m Sue Herera. Have a great evening, everyone.

Auto  sales sizzled.  Demand for tracks and crossovers sore as buyers rush into  showrooms.  But prices are rising as well to record levels.  Will that slam  the brakes on the buying frenzy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Power house.  America's  oil boom is so powerful that a new study out today says it will actually  boost the income of American households and create millions of jobs.  But  how and by how much?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  HERERA:  Get smart.  The battle over your wrist has begun.  Samsung  and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) taking the first swing, beating Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) to the punch.  But with big firms investing big money in  smart watches, what's at stake if consumers just don't buy in? </p><p>  All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday,  September 4th. </p><p>  Good evening, everybody.  I'm Sue Herrera, in for Tyler Mathisen. </p><p>  GHARIB:  And I'm Susie Gharib.  Good evening, everyone.</p><p>  On Wall Street today, a red hot rally for the blue chips.  The Dow  posted its biggest gain in more than a month, even though investors are on  edge about a possible military strike against Syria.  They were encouraged  to buy stocks, thanks to robust sales of cars and trucks in August.  The  major stock averages rallied as auto makers posted their strongest month  since the government's cash-for-clunkers incentive program back at the  height of the financial crisis. </p><p>  Here are the closing digits.  The Dow jumped about 97 points, the  NASDAQ rose 36.  That was on the strength of tech stocks.  And S&amp;P added 13  points.</p><p>  HERERA:  And now to break down those August sales figures for  Detroit's big three.</p><p>  General Motor sales rose nearly 15 percent.  That easily beat  expectations. </p><p>  Ford sales rose more than 12 percent from the same month last year.   It's best August in seven years. </p><p>  And Chrysler had the best August in six years with sales up by 11.5  percent led by strong demand for its Ram pickup trucks. </p><p>  With a closer look behind those numbers, we turn to Phil LeBeau in  Chicago with more.</p><p>  Hi, Phil.</p><p>  PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Sue. </p><p>  Three things were driving better than expected sales last month.   Let's start first off by -- in the official number for August, $16.09  million.  That was the sales pace for the month of august.  That is the  strongest monthly auto sales since November of 2007.  So we are in a  territory that we haven't seen in six years. </p><p>  And one reason why is that auto sales last month were helped by a  strong Labor Day weekend.  Those were actually lumped in with all of  August, so that's why you had stronger than expected numbers in part.   Another reason, the people going into dealerships, they were buying in part  because of low interest loans, leases, those are attracting buyers.  Right  now, it's not uncommon to get zero percent financing for loans and leases. </p><p>  The average transaction price tops $31,000.  That is close to an all- time record high.  And when you look at that, you might be saying, well,  who is buying right now?  In part, when you look at the pickup truck  market, it's the contractors, small business owners.  They continue to  replenish their fleets by buying new trucks.  Large pickup sales up 19.3  percent in August, better than the overall sales pace for the industry.</p><p>  And here's a stat I love -- Ford sold one F-series pickup every 42  seconds last month.  Not surprisingly, as it is almost every month.  The F- series was the top-selling vehicle followed by the Camry, the Silverado,  and the Civic.</p><p>  And, Susie and Sue, one last statistic for you.  Last month, the big  three sold 44.1 percent of the vehicles in the United States.  Asian auto  makers sold 47.8.  So, the Asian automakers had passed the big three at  least in the month of August. </p><p>  HERERA:  You know, Phil, you mentioned those interest rates that are  so attractive right, but rates are starting to rise.  Do you expect that  that is going to slow the pace of sales?</p><p>  LEBEAU:  Not for a while.  They're going to have to go up  dramatically, Sue, because the cap of finance organizations for all of the  auto makers, they are intent on keeping those rates as low as possible.   Now, inevitably, as rates move higher, that's going to have some impact on  auto loan rates, as well as lease rates.  But for the foreseeable future,  they are expected to stay low. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Phil, you mentioned in your report that the average car price  is now $31,000.  So, given all the demand going on, will the prices go up  even higher?</p><p>  LEBEAU:  I think so.  I think you're going to see it go up for two  reasons.  One, people are putting more content in their vehicles.  So,  they're willing to say, you know what, if I'm going to pay for this over  the next six or seven years, I'm going to put more content in it, and  that's pushing the price higher.</p><p>  And at the same time, the auto makers are in the sweet spot right now,  Susie.  They can increase production as they want to.  They are not forced  to increase production and as a result, you got a tight supply and that's  allowing dealers to push prices higher. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Well, at least it's a good sign that we have such robust  sales going on.  Phil, thank you so much. </p><p>  LEBEAU:  You bet.</p><p>  GHARIB:  That's Phil LeBeau, reporting from Chicago.</p><p>  To Washington now, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted today  to approve a resolution authorizing a limited military strike against  Syria.  The resolution which passed by a 10-7 vote sets a 60-day limit on  any U.S. military engagement in Syria and bars the deployment of any troops  on the ground for combat duty.  This also sets the stage for a debate and  another vote by the full Senate next week.  That's when lawmakers return  from their five-week summer break.</p><p>  HERERA:  President Obama was in Sweden today meeting with Scandinavian  leaders ahead of the G-20 economic summit that starts Thursday in St.  Petersburg, Russia.  As Secretary of State John Kerry continued to make the  case to U.S. lawmakers to back U.S.-led strike against Syria, the president  tried to shift the onus for military action away from the U.S. and on to  world leaders everywhere. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  In the face of such  barbarism, the international community cannot be silent and that failing to  respond to this attack would only increase the risk for more attacks, and  that possibility that other countries would use these weapons, as well.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  GHARIB:  As the president tries to drum up support from the  international community and Congress debates authorizing military action,  Americans in the nation's heartland have their own opinions about U.S.  involvement in Syria. </p><p>  In Oklahoma, many people expressed strong views about the U.S. getting  involved in Syria civil war. </p><p>  John Harwood joins us now from Midwest City, Oklahoma where he asked  residents there how they feel about the Syrian crisis.</p><p>  I know you have a lot of good stories to tell us, John.</p><p>  JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Susie, lots of  conflicting pressures on lawmakers as they return next week on Syria and on  budget and financial issues, as well.  We got a taste of them here in  Oklahoma's fourth district.  Congressman Tom Cole, the Republican  representative, went to Tinker Air Force Base, a massive facility here, and  heard that the base had been hurt but budget sequester and furloughs.  They  simply can't afford the shut down that some Republicans have threatened. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  GEN. BRUCE LITCHFIELD, TINKER AIR FORCE BASE:  I don't know what you  would do on the flying operations and how that would operate, especially  if, you know, with a mission if they have to do the nuclear mission that  the Navy is responsible for on a day-to-day basis, the counter-drug  counter-operations that you have along with the North American defense.   I'm not sure how you do that in a total shut down. </p><p>  REP. TOM COLE (R), OKLAHOMA:  Come to my town hall tonight.  </p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  HARWOOD:  And indeed, at that town hall tonight, very feisty  conservatives said a shut down is exactly what we need as a tool to get rid  of Obamacare. </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Republicans have got to wake up and get -- you  say, well, I think this will fly, that won't fly and we can't shut the  government down.  Let the government shut down, if that's what they want to  do.  Let Obama be guilty.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  LEBEAU:  And, of course, on Syria, you had speaker after speaker  questioning the president's constitutional authority to act on his own and  demanding that Congress not give him that authority.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Where did he get this?  You know, out of a Cracker  Jack box or what?  It's n out of the Constitution.  Just because the  president made a statement that he should not have made should not bind  Congress to go ahead and approve it.</p><p>  (APPLAUSE)</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  HARWOOD:  Now on that issue, Syria, Congressman Cole sides with the  right in his district and he is leaning against voting to give authority,  but he does want to see a deal on budget and financial issues to spare  Tinker Air Force Base and avoid a financial crisis this fall, guys. </p><p>  GHARIB:  So, John, what exactly did the congressman say about how he's  going to vote on Syria, and also, what did he say about President Obama?   Is he going to win support for military action?</p><p>  HARWOOD:  He's leaning strongly against.  He said he'll listen to  arguments over the next week, but he's going to be a very, very hard sale  for administration.  He says he does think the president has a good chance  of winning this vote. </p><p>House Speaker Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, both  influential among Republicans, have come out in support of the president.   That is a sign that he may be building some momentum in the House, but it's  not a sure thing.</p><p>  HERERA:  Yes, John, how close is this going to vote be?  Because we  heard from both sides of the isle and a number of Democrats are saying  they're going to vote no.  And a couple of Republicans say they're going to  vote yes.  So, how tight is it going to be?</p><p>  HARWOOD:  I think it will be very tight in the House, less so in the  Senate, Democratic-controlled Senate.  It moved out of the Foreign  Relations Committee today, but I do think in the House, it's going to be a  nail biter that will require a very large Democratic vote to go with a  minority of Republican votes. </p><p>  Congressman Cole predicted that most Republicans would not vote with  the speaker and with the president. </p><p>  HERERA:  John Harwood -- John, thank you so much.</p><p>  And while Syria remains the biggest worry for Washington and, of  course, for Wall Street the debate rages on about whether it's time for the  nation central bank to begin easing back on its stimulus plans.  One top  Fed official thinks that time is very near.  John Williams, the president  of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco says the U.S. economy has  nearly enough momentum right now without the need for any additional  monetary stimulus from the Fed.</p><p>  In a speech today in Oregon, Williams said he has an open mind about  tapering but did not offer specific timetable for a possible pull back by  the central bank. </p><p>  GHARIB:  And more from the Central Bank.  Meanwhile, the latest  Federal Reserve Beige Book survey of economic conditions around the nation  lived up to its name today.  There wasn't a whole lot that was new or  unexpected in the Fed's latest region by region break down on the economy. </p><p>  The Fed reports, quote, \"modest and moderate growth across most  regions of the U.S. over the past six weeks or so as consumer spending,  manufacturing and real estate activity all increased.  But some Wall Street  observers think this may be just enough for the central bank to again  consider when to begin tapering back its bond-buying stimulus measures.</p><p>  HERERA:  Mortgage applications rose last week for the first time in a  month, rising more than 1 percent.  That's after a slight dip in lending  rates falling from the highest level so far this year for the week before  and a pickup in refinancing.  The Mortgage Bankers Association said  borrowing costs climbed by more than a full percentage point since late  May. </p><p>  GHARIB:  The U.S. is getting more competitive.  The World Economic  Forum says that U.S. competitiveness among global economies is rising again  after four years of decline.  The U.S., still the world's largest economy,  is now ranked in fifth place for overall competitiveness.  That's up from  seventh last year.</p><p>  HERERA:  Well, the NASDAQ may not have felt very competitive for a  short time today.  The all-electronic exchange suffered a six-minute outage  today in processing quotes and orders, but just for a small number of  stocks.  But the NASDAQ says trading was not interrupted and in a note sent  to traders, they blamed a computer failure.  A backup system successfully  kicked in and the problem was resolved. </p><p>  Today's issue was not related to that massive outage on August 22nd  when trading on all stocks was halted for three hours due to a trading  software glitch.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Still ahead on the program, America is awash in energy, but  does the oil and gas boom help your finances?  A new study says yes.   That's coming up.</p><p>  But, first, here's how the international markets closed today.</p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  GHARIB:  Did the S&amp;P really commit fraud, or is a new $5 billion  lawsuit that it's facing retaliation?</p><p>Standard &amp; Poor's, the ratings agency owned by McGraw-Hill, is facing  a fraud filed by the Justice Department.  The suit alleges that S&amp;P misled  banks and credit unions about the credibility of its ratings on mortgage  backed securities, just ahead of the 2008 financial crisis.  S&amp;P says the  suit is just, quote, \"retaliation\" for being the only major credit rating  agency to take away the U.S.' AAA rating during the recession.  That's when  the Treasury hit its debt ceiling and Congress failed to reach a federal  budget. </p><p>  HERERA:  Another fine for America's largest bank.  JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)  Chase has agreed to pay $18.3 million to settle a class-action lawsuit  claiming it made inadequate disclosure about the resetting of interest  rates on adjustable rate mortgages that it was currently selling. </p><p>  GHARIB:  A big blow for Boeing (NYSE:BA) today.  Delta Airlines  (NYSE:DAL) announced plans to buy 40 new passenger jets worth about $5.5  billion from Airbus.  It's European's plane maker's first order from Delta  in two decades.  The first batch of brand-new A330s will arrive in 2015.   The rest of Delta's order, the smaller A321 jets, which are being phased  out, are due in 2016.</p><p>  HERERA:  Toyota (NYSE:TM) is recalling 369,000 vehicles worldwide.   Its high-end hybrid SUVs may stop running if a hybrid engine system alarm  goes off and its luxury Lexus sedans could stall out because of a loose  engine bolt.  A company spokesman says no accidents related to either  problem have been reported.</p><p>  GHARIB:  We begin our \"Market Focus\" tonight with a retailer that's  having a rough day.  Shares of Francesca's, which sells women's apparel and  accessories, fell sharply after the company reported weaker than expected  earnings and said sales would continue to decline.  It's the latest  retailer to take a hit from cautious spending as more consumers forgo  impulse items like shoes and dresses and focus instead on buying houses and  cars.  The stock fell almost 26 percent to $17.79.</p><p>  A different story, though, for Ciena.  This network equipment-maker  reporting a narrower-than-expected loss and forecasting strong revenue  growth for the current quarter.  The company is benefitting from a recovery  and spending by telecom carriers which are upgrading their wireless and  wire line network, that's creating big demand for network here.  The stock  soaring almost 14 percent to $23.54, and that's also a good trend news for  Ciena's rivals Juniper and JDS Uniphase (NASDAQ:JDSU) rose today.</p><p>  Shares of Navistar sputtering today.  The engine maker reported its  fourth straight quarterly loss and says it will cut 500 jobs.  Navistar  says its core truck business was hurt by a failed redesign and lower  industry demand.  The stock fell more than 2 percent to $33 and change.</p><p>  HERERA:  Dollar General's earnings beat expectations.  The value  retailer attracted customers into the stores by selling more groceries and  brand name products.  The company also reported sales growth that exceeded  its competitors.  The results warned that frugal shoppers, however, are  making it difficult to raise prices. </p><p>  At the close, the stock was up almost 5 percent to $56.39. </p><p>  And shares of data storage makers Micron Tech and SanDisk  (NASDAQ:SNDK) rallied on heavy volume following news of a fire at a rival  chipmaker's plant.  That rival, Hynix, was forced to suspend operations at  its factory in China.  But after an initial assessment, Hynix said it  expects to resume production shortly.  </p><p>  Shares of Micron Tech rose 5 percent to $14.75. And SanDisk  (NASDAQ:SNDK) gained 3 percent to $57.14.</p><p>  And Green Mountain isn't just about brewing coffee anymore.  It's also  getting into soup.  Campbell's Soup will sell K-cups for Green Mountain's  Keurig machines that will brew a cup of chicken broth.  The K-cups will  come with pockets of dried noodles and vegetables that you can mix right  in.  The partnership marks Green Mountain's first attempt to expand beyond  beverages.  The stock rose about 1 percent to $86.30, while Campbell saw a  fractional gain of $42.92.</p><p>  American family piggy banks are bulging a little bit more these days.   A new study out today says that thanks to the oil and gas boom and lower  energy prices, household incomes are up by $1,200 and according to IHS  (NYSE:IHS) that conducted the study for the energy industry, the fracking  boom, rather, will boost household incomes by as much as $2,000 by the year  2015, and create more than 3 million jobs throughout the economy over the  next five years. </p><p>  Joining us now to talk more about this is John Larson.  He's co-author  of the study and vice president of the economics at IHS (NYSE:IHS).</p><p>  John, thanks for joining us and, you know, this is great news to hear.   We all benefitted from lower prices.</p><p>  But as you look out and you're making your forecast out to the year  2020, how much of your assumptions are based on lower energy prices?  It  might not work out that way, right?</p><p>  JOHN LARSON, IHS (NYSE:IHS) VICE PRESIDENT OF ECONOMICS:  Well, I  think you're right.  There is an important story that has to be told about  where the energy prices will go.  And when you look at the supply side of  the equation, the rapid growth in this unconventional technology has really  unlocked a tremendous amount of resource space and you've seen tremendous  growth in both oil and natural gas production.  And so, we feel very  confident about that underlying assessment of where that supply will go and  where the corresponding price paths will be.</p><p>  There is a tremendous wealth of availability of natural gas in this  country of around at a dollar price of $4 to $5 MMBtu. </p><p>  So, I think when you look at relative to the global prices, and that's  the key, that's what determines the break-even economics for the underlying  plays allowing us to enjoy this energy renaissance and corresponding  economic growth, you do see an opportunity for it to continue into 2025 and  beyond actually.</p><p>  HERERA:  You know, John, as Susie mentioned, that's good news for all  of America certainly.  But your numbers seem a little bit higher than some  of the other studies that are out there.  Is that because you base it on  something different or your metrics were different than other numbers, why?</p><p>  LARSON:  Well, it's important when you look at this industry, you have  to understand the full breath of the industry, to supply chain from the  wellhead, all the way down to the consumer and the supply network that  supports and enables this activity to take place.  And so, we're looking at  not just the roughneck that's working the wellhead, we're looking at the  steel furnace in Pittsburgh that's fabricating the steel and the pipe  fitters and drill bit manufacturers in Ohio.</p><p>  And so, we're trying to capture that full supply chain and then look  at the broader macro economic effects that are leading as you said to this  income effect for consumers.  I think that's the real highlight is how  profound this income effect is for all consumers.  And, obviously, when  more consumers have more hundred in their wallets they step back into the  economy and purchase more goods and services, which in turn spurs greater  economic growth. </p><p>  So, I don't think we're over stating it at all.  I think it's been a  profound effect and it's going to continue to have a profound effect going  forward as that income grows for all individuals in this economy.</p><p>  GHARIB:  And part of this whole energy boom is because of fracking and  you mentioned the word \"fracking\" and people right away say about what the  environment.  I mean, to what extent will environmental concerns or  restrictions going forward impact a savings, household savings?</p><p>  LARSON:  Well, obviously, look at the current set of rules and  regulations.  Our study was based on a status quo of those current  regulatory frameworks that are conducted at the state level, and there is a  whole host of permanent (ph) and other regulatory procedures in place.   This is an industry that requires a significant amount of activity.  You  have to go out and explore to identify new places and then conduct all the  underlying drilling. </p><p>  So, if that activity was curtailed, it does fairly quickly have knock  on effects down through the economy and could risk pulling that money out  of the pocketbooks of Americans. </p><p>  GHARIB:  And, John, real quickly, who funded this study? </p><p>  LARSON:  This study was founded by a coalition of organizations from  the American Chemistry Council, the National Association of Manufacturers,  the Fertilizer Institute, organizations along those types of natures have  helped contribute to analysis we conducted. </p><p>  GHARIB:  Well, it's a fascinating study.  Thanks so much for coming on  the program to tell us about it.  John Larson with IHS (NYSE:IHS).</p><p>  Sue?</p><p>  HERERA:  Coming up, two major companies are kick-starting a whole new  category of electronics, smart watches -- and some are calling it the most  important new product since the launch of the iPad.</p><p>  But first, a look at how commodities, treasuries and currencies  performed today. </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  GHARIB:  It's one of the biggest gifts ever given to a college.  New  York real estate mogul Stephen Ross who is also the owner of the Miami  Dolphins is donating $200 million to his alma mater.  It's the University  of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  The money will be splint between the Stephen M.  Ross School of Business and the school's athletic department. </p><p>  This latest gift's raises total donations to the university to more  than $300 million. </p><p>  HERERA:  Well, this sounds like something out of those old Dick Tracey  comics.  But the smartwatch from Samsung is a wearable tech device and it's  now a reality. </p><p>  Seema Mody was there for the unveiling in New York City today and she  has more on the latest gadget you thought you didn't need.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Samsung  Galaxy Gear.</p><p>  SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The  battle for your wrist has begun. </p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome to the future. </p><p>  MODY:  Samsung and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) both announcing to the world  the smartwatch has arrived.  They are the first serious entrance into  what's expected to be a huge market for the tech industry. </p><p>  (on camera):  Analysts write that the smart watch is the most  important product category to watch in a consumer electronics space.  And  some of the big tech names are taking notice -- Sony (NYSE:SNE), Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) all are said to  be working on their own version of a smart watch device.</p><p>  Gardner (ph) expects that 5 million to 10 million smart watches may  ship this year as Samsung and others get it right.  And the trend towards  wearable tech looks to be here to stay.</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it's a great idea. </p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You can carry it around wherever you go, with  every outfit you can go, as long as it looks cute.  </p><p>  MODY:  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) made shock waves when it introduced Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) Glass last year.</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Once they get a little more slim, I think a lot of  people -- more people will be interested in it.  But right now, it stands  out and device some people love it, some people are like I'm not ever  wearing that thing.</p><p>  MODY:  For some reason, data suggests the time for wearable devices to  really take off the consumers could be closer at hand, literally.  A survey  conducted by Forester found that when consumers were asked where they would  want to wear a device, 29 percent said clipped to clothing, 28 percent  opted for wrist, and while only 12 percent said glass. </p><p>  But with today's announcement, Samsung delivered a clear message to  its biggest rival.  The battle of consumers is going to get a lot more  fierce in the months to come. </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Seema Mody in New York. </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GHARIB:  And Samsung might have more invasions to talk about in a few  weeks.  It's scheduled a conference in Seoul, South Korea, for November  6th, for investors and analysts and the topic, the future of smart phones.   Also on the agenda, Samsung's long-term growth strategy. </p><p>  HERERA:  But not to be undone, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung's biggest  rival, of course, for phone sales, it has a big week ahead of it.  The  company announced an event next Tuesday, September 10th, at its Cupertino,  California headquarters.  The next day, September 11th, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  will host an event in Beijing where it's expected to announce a deal with  China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), that nation's biggest carrier to finally begin  selling the iPhone there. </p><p>  GHARIB:  And finally tonight, a new building going up in London's  financial district is being called a fry-scaper, and with good reason.  The  37-story glass enclosed structure is reflecting so much sunlight that it's  literally melting cars.  It actually melted parts of a Jaguar parked  outside the building last week.  The build's developer has apologized and  has offered to pay for the repairs.</p><p>  And, Sue, people in Las Vegas should pay attention.  Apparently, the  same architect is building a building there and it's a lot sunnier -- </p><p>  HERERA:  Oh, yes.</p><p>  GHARIB:  -- and it's a lot hotter. </p><p>  HERERA:  Can you imagine calling home, honey, the car is melted?  Can  you imagine that? </p><p>  GHARIB:  Especially a Jaguar. </p><p>  HERERA:  Especially a Jag, exactly.  Wow.</p><p>  GHARIB:  That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Susie  Gharib.  For more business stories, log on to our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p>  HERERA:  And I'm Sue Herera.  Have a great evening, everyone.  And  we'll see you tomorrow. </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Auto sales sizzled. Demand for tracks and crossovers sore as buyers rush into showrooms. But prices are rising as well to record levels. Will that slam the brakes on the buying frenzy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Power house. America's oil boom is so powerful that a new study out today says it will actually boost the income of American households and create millions of jobs. But how and by how much?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Get smart. The battle over your wrist has begun. Samsung and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) taking the first swing, beating Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to the punch. But with big firms investing big money in smart watches, what's at stake if consumers just don't buy in?</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, September 4th.</p><p>Good evening, everybody. I'm Sue Herrera, in for Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>GHARIB: And I'm Susie Gharib. Good evening, everyone.</p><p>On Wall Street today, a red hot rally for the blue chips. The Dow posted its biggest gain in more than a month, even though investors are on edge about a possible military strike against Syria. They were encouraged to buy stocks, thanks to robust sales of cars and trucks in August. The major stock averages rallied as auto makers posted their strongest month since the government's cash-for-clunkers incentive program back at the height of the financial crisis.</p><p>Here are the closing digits. The Dow jumped about 97 points, the NASDAQ rose 36. That was on the strength of tech stocks. And S&amp;P added 13 points.</p><p>HERERA: And now to break down those August sales figures for Detroit's big three.</p><p>General Motor sales rose nearly 15 percent. That easily beat expectations.</p><p>Ford sales rose more than 12 percent from the same month last year. It's best August in seven years.</p><p>And Chrysler had the best August in six years with sales up by 11.5 percent led by strong demand for its Ram pickup trucks.</p><p>With a closer look behind those numbers, we turn to Phil LeBeau in Chicago with more.</p><p>Hi, Phil.</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Sue.</p><p>Three things were driving better than expected sales last month. Let's start first off by -- in the official number for August, $16.09 million. That was the sales pace for the month of august. That is the strongest monthly auto sales since November of 2007. So we are in a territory that we haven't seen in six years.</p><p>And one reason why is that auto sales last month were helped by a strong Labor Day weekend. Those were actually lumped in with all of August, so that's why you had stronger than expected numbers in part. Another reason, the people going into dealerships, they were buying in part because of low interest loans, leases, those are attracting buyers. Right now, it's not uncommon to get zero percent financing for loans and leases.</p><p>The average transaction price tops $31,000. That is close to an all- time record high. And when you look at that, you might be saying, well, who is buying right now? In part, when you look at the pickup truck market, it's the contractors, small business owners. They continue to replenish their fleets by buying new trucks. Large pickup sales up 19.3 percent in August, better than the overall sales pace for the industry.</p><p>And here's a stat I love -- Ford sold one F-series pickup every 42 seconds last month. Not surprisingly, as it is almost every month. The F- series was the top-selling vehicle followed by the Camry, the Silverado, and the Civic.</p><p>And, Susie and Sue, one last statistic for you. Last month, the big three sold 44.1 percent of the vehicles in the United States. Asian auto makers sold 47.8. So, the Asian automakers had passed the big three at least in the month of August.</p><p>HERERA: You know, Phil, you mentioned those interest rates that are so attractive right, but rates are starting to rise. Do you expect that that is going to slow the pace of sales?</p><p>LEBEAU: Not for a while. They're going to have to go up dramatically, Sue, because the cap of finance organizations for all of the auto makers, they are intent on keeping those rates as low as possible. Now, inevitably, as rates move higher, that's going to have some impact on auto loan rates, as well as lease rates. But for the foreseeable future, they are expected to stay low.</p><p>GHARIB: Phil, you mentioned in your report that the average car price is now $31,000. So, given all the demand going on, will the prices go up even higher?</p><p>LEBEAU: I think so. I think you're going to see it go up for two reasons. One, people are putting more content in their vehicles. So, they're willing to say, you know what, if I'm going to pay for this over the next six or seven years, I'm going to put more content in it, and that's pushing the price higher.</p><p>And at the same time, the auto makers are in the sweet spot right now, Susie. They can increase production as they want to. They are not forced to increase production and as a result, you got a tight supply and that's allowing dealers to push prices higher.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, at least it's a good sign that we have such robust sales going on. Phil, thank you so much.</p><p>LEBEAU: You bet.</p><p>GHARIB: That's Phil LeBeau, reporting from Chicago.</p><p>To Washington now, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted today to approve a resolution authorizing a limited military strike against Syria. The resolution which passed by a 10-7 vote sets a 60-day limit on any U.S. military engagement in Syria and bars the deployment of any troops on the ground for combat duty. This also sets the stage for a debate and another vote by the full Senate next week. That's when lawmakers return from their five-week summer break.</p><p>HERERA: President Obama was in Sweden today meeting with Scandinavian leaders ahead of the G-20 economic summit that starts Thursday in St. Petersburg, Russia. As Secretary of State John Kerry continued to make the case to U.S. lawmakers to back U.S.-led strike against Syria, the president tried to shift the onus for military action away from the U.S. and on to world leaders everywhere.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: In the face of such barbarism, the international community cannot be silent and that failing to respond to this attack would only increase the risk for more attacks, and that possibility that other countries would use these weapons, as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB: As the president tries to drum up support from the international community and Congress debates authorizing military action, Americans in the nation's heartland have their own opinions about U.S. involvement in Syria.</p><p>In Oklahoma, many people expressed strong views about the U.S. getting involved in Syria civil war.</p><p>John Harwood joins us now from Midwest City, Oklahoma where he asked residents there how they feel about the Syrian crisis.</p><p>I know you have a lot of good stories to tell us, John.</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Susie, lots of conflicting pressures on lawmakers as they return next week on Syria and on budget and financial issues, as well. We got a taste of them here in Oklahoma's fourth district. Congressman Tom Cole, the Republican representative, went to Tinker Air Force Base, a massive facility here, and heard that the base had been hurt but budget sequester and furloughs. They simply can't afford the shut down that some Republicans have threatened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEN. BRUCE LITCHFIELD, TINKER AIR FORCE BASE: I don't know what you would do on the flying operations and how that would operate, especially if, you know, with a mission if they have to do the nuclear mission that the Navy is responsible for on a day-to-day basis, the counter-drug counter-operations that you have along with the North American defense. I'm not sure how you do that in a total shut down.</p><p>REP. TOM COLE (R), OKLAHOMA: Come to my town hall tonight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARWOOD: And indeed, at that town hall tonight, very feisty conservatives said a shut down is exactly what we need as a tool to get rid of Obamacare.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Republicans have got to wake up and get -- you say, well, I think this will fly, that won't fly and we can't shut the government down. Let the government shut down, if that's what they want to do. Let Obama be guilty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEBEAU: And, of course, on Syria, you had speaker after speaker questioning the president's constitutional authority to act on his own and demanding that Congress not give him that authority.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where did he get this? You know, out of a Cracker Jack box or what? It's n out of the Constitution. Just because the president made a statement that he should not have made should not bind Congress to go ahead and approve it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARWOOD: Now on that issue, Syria, Congressman Cole sides with the right in his district and he is leaning against voting to give authority, but he does want to see a deal on budget and financial issues to spare Tinker Air Force Base and avoid a financial crisis this fall, guys.</p><p>GHARIB: So, John, what exactly did the congressman say about how he's going to vote on Syria, and also, what did he say about President Obama? Is he going to win support for military action?</p><p>HARWOOD: He's leaning strongly against. He said he'll listen to arguments over the next week, but he's going to be a very, very hard sale for administration. He says he does think the president has a good chance of winning this vote.</p><p>House Speaker Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, both influential among Republicans, have come out in support of the president. That is a sign that he may be building some momentum in the House, but it's not a sure thing.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, John, how close is this going to vote be? Because we heard from both sides of the isle and a number of Democrats are saying they're going to vote no. And a couple of Republicans say they're going to vote yes. So, how tight is it going to be?</p><p>HARWOOD: I think it will be very tight in the House, less so in the Senate, Democratic-controlled Senate. It moved out of the Foreign Relations Committee today, but I do think in the House, it's going to be a nail biter that will require a very large Democratic vote to go with a minority of Republican votes.</p><p>Congressman Cole predicted that most Republicans would not vote with the speaker and with the president.</p><p>HERERA: John Harwood -- John, thank you so much.</p><p>And while Syria remains the biggest worry for Washington and, of course, for Wall Street the debate rages on about whether it's time for the nation central bank to begin easing back on its stimulus plans. One top Fed official thinks that time is very near. John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco says the U.S. economy has nearly enough momentum right now without the need for any additional monetary stimulus from the Fed.</p><p>In a speech today in Oregon, Williams said he has an open mind about tapering but did not offer specific timetable for a possible pull back by the central bank.</p><p>GHARIB: And more from the Central Bank. Meanwhile, the latest Federal Reserve Beige Book survey of economic conditions around the nation lived up to its name today. There wasn't a whole lot that was new or unexpected in the Fed's latest region by region break down on the economy.</p><p>The Fed reports, quote, \"modest and moderate growth across most regions of the U.S. over the past six weeks or so as consumer spending, manufacturing and real estate activity all increased. But some Wall Street observers think this may be just enough for the central bank to again consider when to begin tapering back its bond-buying stimulus measures.</p><p>HERERA: Mortgage applications rose last week for the first time in a month, rising more than 1 percent. That's after a slight dip in lending rates falling from the highest level so far this year for the week before and a pickup in refinancing. The Mortgage Bankers Association said borrowing costs climbed by more than a full percentage point since late May.</p><p>GHARIB: The U.S. is getting more competitive. The World Economic Forum says that U.S. competitiveness among global economies is rising again after four years of decline. The U.S., still the world's largest economy, is now ranked in fifth place for overall competitiveness. That's up from seventh last year.</p><p>HERERA: Well, the NASDAQ may not have felt very competitive for a short time today. The all-electronic exchange suffered a six-minute outage today in processing quotes and orders, but just for a small number of stocks. But the NASDAQ says trading was not interrupted and in a note sent to traders, they blamed a computer failure. A backup system successfully kicked in and the problem was resolved.</p><p>Today's issue was not related to that massive outage on August 22nd when trading on all stocks was halted for three hours due to a trading software glitch.</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead on the program, America is awash in energy, but does the oil and gas boom help your finances? A new study says yes. That's coming up.</p><p>But, first, here's how the international markets closed today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: Did the S&amp;P really commit fraud, or is a new $5 billion lawsuit that it's facing retaliation?</p><p>Standard &amp; Poor's, the ratings agency owned by McGraw-Hill, is facing a fraud filed by the Justice Department. The suit alleges that S&amp;P misled banks and credit unions about the credibility of its ratings on mortgage backed securities, just ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. S&amp;P says the suit is just, quote, \"retaliation\" for being the only major credit rating agency to take away the U.S.' AAA rating during the recession. That's when the Treasury hit its debt ceiling and Congress failed to reach a federal budget.</p><p>HERERA: Another fine for America's largest bank. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase has agreed to pay $18.3 million to settle a class-action lawsuit claiming it made inadequate disclosure about the resetting of interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages that it was currently selling.</p><p>GHARIB: A big blow for Boeing (NYSE:BA) today. Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) announced plans to buy 40 new passenger jets worth about $5.5 billion from Airbus. It's European's plane maker's first order from Delta in two decades. The first batch of brand-new A330s will arrive in 2015. The rest of Delta's order, the smaller A321 jets, which are being phased out, are due in 2016.</p><p>HERERA: Toyota (NYSE:TM) is recalling 369,000 vehicles worldwide. Its high-end hybrid SUVs may stop running if a hybrid engine system alarm goes off and its luxury Lexus sedans could stall out because of a loose engine bolt. A company spokesman says no accidents related to either problem have been reported.</p><p>GHARIB: We begin our \"Market Focus\" tonight with a retailer that's having a rough day. Shares of Francesca's, which sells women's apparel and accessories, fell sharply after the company reported weaker than expected earnings and said sales would continue to decline. It's the latest retailer to take a hit from cautious spending as more consumers forgo impulse items like shoes and dresses and focus instead on buying houses and cars. The stock fell almost 26 percent to $17.79.</p><p>A different story, though, for Ciena. This network equipment-maker reporting a narrower-than-expected loss and forecasting strong revenue growth for the current quarter. The company is benefitting from a recovery and spending by telecom carriers which are upgrading their wireless and wire line network, that's creating big demand for network here. The stock soaring almost 14 percent to $23.54, and that's also a good trend news for Ciena's rivals Juniper and JDS Uniphase (NASDAQ:JDSU) rose today.</p><p>Shares of Navistar sputtering today. The engine maker reported its fourth straight quarterly loss and says it will cut 500 jobs. Navistar says its core truck business was hurt by a failed redesign and lower industry demand. The stock fell more than 2 percent to $33 and change.</p><p>HERERA: Dollar General's earnings beat expectations. The value retailer attracted customers into the stores by selling more groceries and brand name products. The company also reported sales growth that exceeded its competitors. The results warned that frugal shoppers, however, are making it difficult to raise prices.</p><p>At the close, the stock was up almost 5 percent to $56.39.</p><p>And shares of data storage makers Micron Tech and SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) rallied on heavy volume following news of a fire at a rival chipmaker's plant. That rival, Hynix, was forced to suspend operations at its factory in China. But after an initial assessment, Hynix said it expects to resume production shortly.</p><p>Shares of Micron Tech rose 5 percent to $14.75. And SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) gained 3 percent to $57.14.</p><p>And Green Mountain isn't just about brewing coffee anymore. It's also getting into soup. Campbell's Soup will sell K-cups for Green Mountain's Keurig machines that will brew a cup of chicken broth. The K-cups will come with pockets of dried noodles and vegetables that you can mix right in. The partnership marks Green Mountain's first attempt to expand beyond beverages. The stock rose about 1 percent to $86.30, while Campbell saw a fractional gain of $42.92.</p><p>American family piggy banks are bulging a little bit more these days. A new study out today says that thanks to the oil and gas boom and lower energy prices, household incomes are up by $1,200 and according to IHS (NYSE:IHS) that conducted the study for the energy industry, the fracking boom, rather, will boost household incomes by as much as $2,000 by the year 2015, and create more than 3 million jobs throughout the economy over the next five years.</p><p>Joining us now to talk more about this is John Larson. He's co-author of the study and vice president of the economics at IHS (NYSE:IHS).</p><p>John, thanks for joining us and, you know, this is great news to hear. We all benefitted from lower prices.</p><p>But as you look out and you're making your forecast out to the year 2020, how much of your assumptions are based on lower energy prices? It might not work out that way, right?</p><p>JOHN LARSON, IHS (NYSE:IHS) VICE PRESIDENT OF ECONOMICS: Well, I think you're right. There is an important story that has to be told about where the energy prices will go. And when you look at the supply side of the equation, the rapid growth in this unconventional technology has really unlocked a tremendous amount of resource space and you've seen tremendous growth in both oil and natural gas production. And so, we feel very confident about that underlying assessment of where that supply will go and where the corresponding price paths will be.</p><p>There is a tremendous wealth of availability of natural gas in this country of around at a dollar price of $4 to $5 MMBtu.</p><p>So, I think when you look at relative to the global prices, and that's the key, that's what determines the break-even economics for the underlying plays allowing us to enjoy this energy renaissance and corresponding economic growth, you do see an opportunity for it to continue into 2025 and beyond actually.</p><p>HERERA: You know, John, as Susie mentioned, that's good news for all of America certainly. But your numbers seem a little bit higher than some of the other studies that are out there. Is that because you base it on something different or your metrics were different than other numbers, why?</p><p>LARSON: Well, it's important when you look at this industry, you have to understand the full breath of the industry, to supply chain from the wellhead, all the way down to the consumer and the supply network that supports and enables this activity to take place. And so, we're looking at not just the roughneck that's working the wellhead, we're looking at the steel furnace in Pittsburgh that's fabricating the steel and the pipe fitters and drill bit manufacturers in Ohio.</p><p>And so, we're trying to capture that full supply chain and then look at the broader macro economic effects that are leading as you said to this income effect for consumers. I think that's the real highlight is how profound this income effect is for all consumers. And, obviously, when more consumers have more hundred in their wallets they step back into the economy and purchase more goods and services, which in turn spurs greater economic growth.</p><p>So, I don't think we're over stating it at all. I think it's been a profound effect and it's going to continue to have a profound effect going forward as that income grows for all individuals in this economy.</p><p>GHARIB: And part of this whole energy boom is because of fracking and you mentioned the word \"fracking\" and people right away say about what the environment. I mean, to what extent will environmental concerns or restrictions going forward impact a savings, household savings?</p><p>LARSON: Well, obviously, look at the current set of rules and regulations. Our study was based on a status quo of those current regulatory frameworks that are conducted at the state level, and there is a whole host of permanent (ph) and other regulatory procedures in place. This is an industry that requires a significant amount of activity. You have to go out and explore to identify new places and then conduct all the underlying drilling.</p><p>So, if that activity was curtailed, it does fairly quickly have knock on effects down through the economy and could risk pulling that money out of the pocketbooks of Americans.</p><p>GHARIB: And, John, real quickly, who funded this study?</p><p>LARSON: This study was founded by a coalition of organizations from the American Chemistry Council, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Fertilizer Institute, organizations along those types of natures have helped contribute to analysis we conducted.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, it's a fascinating study. Thanks so much for coming on the program to tell us about it. John Larson with IHS (NYSE:IHS).</p><p>Sue?</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, two major companies are kick-starting a whole new category of electronics, smart watches -- and some are calling it the most important new product since the launch of the iPad.</p><p>But first, a look at how commodities, treasuries and currencies performed today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: It's one of the biggest gifts ever given to a college. New York real estate mogul Stephen Ross who is also the owner of the Miami Dolphins is donating $200 million to his alma mater. It's the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The money will be splint between the Stephen M. Ross School of Business and the school's athletic department.</p><p>This latest gift's raises total donations to the university to more than $300 million.</p><p>HERERA: Well, this sounds like something out of those old Dick Tracey comics. But the smartwatch from Samsung is a wearable tech device and it's now a reality.</p><p>Seema Mody was there for the unveiling in New York City today and she has more on the latest gadget you thought you didn't need.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Samsung Galaxy Gear.</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The battle for your wrist has begun.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Welcome to the future.</p><p>MODY: Samsung and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) both announcing to the world the smartwatch has arrived. They are the first serious entrance into what's expected to be a huge market for the tech industry.</p><p>(on camera): Analysts write that the smart watch is the most important product category to watch in a consumer electronics space. And some of the big tech names are taking notice -- Sony (NYSE:SNE), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) all are said to be working on their own version of a smart watch device.</p><p>Gardner (ph) expects that 5 million to 10 million smart watches may ship this year as Samsung and others get it right. And the trend towards wearable tech looks to be here to stay.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's a great idea.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can carry it around wherever you go, with every outfit you can go, as long as it looks cute.</p><p>MODY: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) made shock waves when it introduced Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Glass last year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Once they get a little more slim, I think a lot of people -- more people will be interested in it. But right now, it stands out and device some people love it, some people are like I'm not ever wearing that thing.</p><p>MODY: For some reason, data suggests the time for wearable devices to really take off the consumers could be closer at hand, literally. A survey conducted by Forester found that when consumers were asked where they would want to wear a device, 29 percent said clipped to clothing, 28 percent opted for wrist, and while only 12 percent said glass.</p><p>But with today's announcement, Samsung delivered a clear message to its biggest rival. The battle of consumers is going to get a lot more fierce in the months to come.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Seema Mody in New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: And Samsung might have more invasions to talk about in a few weeks. It's scheduled a conference in Seoul, South Korea, for November 6th, for investors and analysts and the topic, the future of smart phones. Also on the agenda, Samsung's long-term growth strategy.</p><p>HERERA: But not to be undone, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung's biggest rival, of course, for phone sales, it has a big week ahead of it. The company announced an event next Tuesday, September 10th, at its Cupertino, California headquarters. The next day, September 11th, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will host an event in Beijing where it's expected to announce a deal with China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), that nation's biggest carrier to finally begin selling the iPhone there.</p><p>GHARIB: And finally tonight, a new building going up in London's financial district is being called a fry-scaper, and with good reason. The 37-story glass enclosed structure is reflecting so much sunlight that it's literally melting cars. It actually melted parts of a Jaguar parked outside the building last week. The build's developer has apologized and has offered to pay for the repairs.</p><p>And, Sue, people in Las Vegas should pay attention. Apparently, the same architect is building a building there and it's a lot sunnier --</p><p>HERERA: Oh, yes.</p><p>GHARIB: -- and it's a lot hotter.</p><p>HERERA: Can you imagine calling home, honey, the car is melted? Can you imagine that?</p><p>GHARIB: Especially a Jaguar.</p><p>HERERA: Especially a Jag, exactly. Wow.</p><p>GHARIB: That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. For more business stories, log on to our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p>HERERA: And I'm Sue Herera. Have a great evening, everyone.

Apple shows off its newest iPhone. But are the changes to the device too conservative at an especially challenging time for the company?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT: On our shores. Why the bankruptcy of one of the world`s largest shipping companies is causing chaos and confusion and why the effects could ripple through the global economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Slam dunk? What Under Armour is banking on to gain market share in China?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, September 7th.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>The world`s most valuable company captured the attention of Wall Street, Main Street and the iFaithful as it usually does with a big event and unveils a new device.</p><p>But today, there was no new device. The Dow component did not chart a bold, new course or show off major innovation -- though the company might dispute that. It did, however, make some changes to its flagship product, the iPhone.</p><p>But those arguably incremental changes come at a time when the company faces challenges. Its smartphone sales are slowing. Big institutional shareholders are selling and the company is in the middle of a huge tax fight with the European Union. Its stock once a rocket ship has become a bit of a slow-moving barge. Despite rising slightly today, shares are off about 3 percent this year. While the broader Dow index of which it`s a component is up 6 percent.</p><p>We start tonight with Apple`s latest announcement and Josh Lipton has it for us from San Francisco.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Less a revolutionary new product than an evolution, Apple`s CEO Tim Cook unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus today in front of a crowd of Apple die-hards in San Francisco. The new phones have come definite upgrades and one noticeably absent feature. Apple is eliminating the analog headphone jack that began with the first iPod and replacing it with a lightning jack currently used to charge the phone.</p><p>But in an attempt to limit backlash of consumers forced to get new headphones, Apple will have an adapter for older ear buds with all new iPhone models. Or customers will have the option to buy wireless air buds called ear pods.</p><p>Other new features of note, one that address common complaints of users in the past, the first better battery life. Apple claiming up to two hours more juice on the 7 Plus.</p><p>And what may have received the most applause of the day, the long-awaited arrival of a water resistant phone.</p><p>Both new phones will also feature a better camera and processor. Apple`s event today amid concerns with some investors over the company`s pace of innovation and somewhat stagnant sales growth. Sales for the fiscal expected to drop for the first time in 15 years.</p><p>And while the iPhone introduction was the main event today, Apple introduced also the Apple Watch Series 2. Sales of the original watch down 57 percent in the last quarter, according to new estimates by the International Data Corporation. The new watch like the iPhone 7 will be water resistant with new features geared especially towards runners and swimmers.</p><p>Despite all the upgrades, investor reaction was somewhat muted today with the stock basically flat in today`s trade, though it has increased about 10 percent in the past three months.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And now to Apple`s other challenge -- some of the biggest global funds selling their shares. New data of research firm eVestment shows that institutional investors sold the stock in the second quarter. The drop in Apple ownership was bigger than any other major stock. The research firm tells CNBC that some investors and asset managers may be starting to believe that Apple`s big growth days are behind it.</p><p>MATHISEN: Apple is also watching closely what`s happening in Ireland one week after the European Union ruled that Ireland granted Apple undue tax benefits. Ireland`s parliament now appealing the decision. The outcome of the appeal is expected sometime tonight.</p><p>Julia Chatterly reports from Dublin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: An important vote, but also, just a symbolic one from the Irish parliament tonight, voting on whether or not to back the government in their decision to appeal the European Commission`s decision to hit apple with that $14.5 billion tax bill. What the government has been saying all along is this appeal will succeed. Why? Because we never gave Apple any kind of sweetheart deal or preferential treatment, which is fine.</p><p>But there`s a bigger question here. What does this mean for other big tech companies here in Ireland, the likes of Microsoft, Facebook? Could they get the same deal as Apple and is there a huge risk now that these companies get hit with the similar kind of tax bill as Apple at some point in the future? That`s the question I put to the Irish prime minister.</p><p>Listen to what he had to say.</p><p>ENDA KENNY, IRISH PRIME MINISTER: The other cases on appeal to the European court to which Ireland is a party but the amount mentioned here is a staggering amount in comparison to the other countries so from that perspective, it`s a number of years to actually conclude.</p><p>But it sends us a wrong signal from the commission, particularly when Ireland has been one of the foremost players on the OECD program to deal with this problem of a broken corporate tax system internationally by having an international response. We have changed our registration here. We have gotten rid of the status concept. We have gotten rid of the so- called double Irish concept.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, what he was effectively saying there I think is that it`s a tax legacy and the loopholes are closed and didn`t answer the question of whether or not the likes of Microsoft and Facebook are still at risk from a similar issue.</p><p>Now, I did ask him another question, very potent in light of today`s events, whether or not he`ll show solidarity with Apple and buy the iPhone 7 and he got excited and said he owns the iPhone 6 and but that he`s having a few issues understanding its tips and tricks. He said he asked Tim Cook last week if he could help him. He said he would, but for my sense that help could take a while to understand. I think he better stick with the iPhone 6 here and delay on the old upgrade.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Chatterley in Dublin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Well, from the tax battle with the E.U., to a sagging stock and no major overhaul, some are wondering if Apple may have reached a plateau.</p><p>Timothy Lesko is the principal portfolio manager at Granite Investment Advisers. He thinks the company has plenty of room to grow. While Ross Gerber, CEO and president of Gerber Kawasaki says the company has reached the end of its innovation curve.</p><p>Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>We kind of put forth the plateau argument. I want to start with you, Tim, if I could. You`re still bullish on the stock. You think they`re still innovating.</p><p>Tell us why and what they`re doing that you like.</p><p>TIMOTHY LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS PRINCIPAL: Well, I think they`re innovating by creating the digital lifestyle that they have been talking about for ten years. So, they have products that are wearable. They have products that are the phone. They have products on television. They have products in the home from thermostats to, you know, the software on the basis of home automation devices and they`re moving into the car, as well.</p><p>So, if you look two, three years out, I think apple controls the digital lifestyle regardless of what this quarter`s iPhone sales are.</p><p>MATHISEN: Ross Gerber, do you buy this stock as a gross stock? Do you buy it as a value stock or do you just not buy it?</p><p>ROSS GERBER, GERBER KAWASAKI CEO &amp; PRESIDENT: Well, it`s not a growth stock with earnings going down and revenue going down and 12 P/E. It`s a value stock.</p><p>But the issue we have isn`t whether the products are great. They have evolved them as far as they can. The issue we have is, you have to sell more products and make more profits every year for your stock to go up. And they`re just not able to do that anymore. So, what`s the next product that`s going to really grow Apple`s pie?</p><p>MATHISEN: Is it a question then of scarcity of innovation or of market saturation? In other words, there are just so many people who can pay $695 or $649 to buy a phone?</p><p>GERBER: Yes, it`s both. Not only have they got given us really any compelling reason to buy a new phone, but they have another completely -- the market for a high-end phone is full now. So, they have not addressed the fast-growing emerging markets in any way. They need $150 or $200 phone and if it`s really about the ecosystem, build the ecosystem. But you can`t have a phone for rich people around the world.</p><p>HERERA: But, Tim, I would argue that Tim Cook has spent a lot of time recently in India and in China, and he pointed out India in a big way as growth. So, to counter what Ross was just saying, is it one of their biggest opportunities in these emerging markets which are much more populous than other parts of the world?</p><p>LESKO: Well, certainly. And I think, you know, to Ross`s point, they need to be playing toward the growing middle class and upper class in those countries. So, I actually disagree with Ross. I don`t think they need $150 or $200 phone. They`ve never played in low-end products and I don`t expect them to here.</p><p>But, you know, working in those countries is -- there`s a lot of politics and there`s a lot of in-country work to do and I think Tim Cook is laying that groundwork. It may be a while before we see the fruits of that.</p><p>MATHISEN: But how do you get the growth if the market for the high-end phone in the mature markets is a little bit saturated?</p><p>LESKO: It`s a little bit saturated but the phones wear out, batteries wear out and the upgrade cycle continues. So, Apple`s one of the few company that is has a cash cow in the form of the iPhone business domestically and using that cash cow to build out the business in other countries, and in other services. So, where Ross is right, it is not currently a growth company.</p><p>It is building a strong platform to be a player in whatever the next revolution is in communication.</p><p>GERBER: But we know what that revolution is. It`s virtual reality. And they`re the only major tech company that has nothing. They`re missing the boat.</p><p>Look at Facebook, at all-time highs growing like crazy and Oculus is going to be a key part of that growth.</p><p>LESKO: That`s not really fair because Facebook`s revenue doesn`t account to Apple`s services revenue is.</p><p>GERBER: Yes, but it`s a 10-year-old company.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LESKO: Who`s using Oculus and who`s making money on it?</p><p>GERBER: I`m using Oculus and they`re making money.</p><p>LESKO: They`re not making money. They`re making money on ad revenue.</p><p>GERBER: We are talking about the future and the future of virtual reality and that`s a fact.</p><p>HERERA: Very quickly, what are each one of you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LESKO: Well, we own the stock and, you know, for clients that come into us now, we would be buying the stock.</p><p>HERERA: Ross?</p><p>LESKO: But I don`t think people sit in the sofa and use virtual reality to do what they do on a daily basis.</p><p>GERBER: Well, you are just incorrect. We are owners and been sellers of the stock and we have lowered our position.</p><p>HERERA: Gentlemen, thank you both. Timothy, Ross, really appreciate it.</p><p>MATHISEN: That`s what makes a market there.</p><p>Slight rise in Apple share is not enough to lift the broader market today. It closed mixed. The NASDAQ, however, continued its win streak, posting four straight days of gains, notching yet another all-time closing high. Industrials, Dow, fell nearly 12 points to 18,526. NASDAQ, though, added 8, only one in the green today. S&amp;P 500 was off fractionally.</p><p>HERERA: Employers in the U.S. advertised a record number of job openings in July. The Labor Department says there are more than 5.8 million openings in the country. That`s above the peak reached in April and it is a sign that hiring remains healthy despite that disappointing August employment report.</p><p>MATHISEN: A report today from the Federal Reserve showed a tight labor market is not generating substantial inflation pressure. The Fed`s Beige Book, which is a region by region look at the economy across the country, characterized economic growth as modest or maybe even moderate.</p><p>Eamon Javers has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Fed`s Beige Book is out offering a picture of the economic health of the nation at the end of summer 2016. The Fed reports that national economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace from July through late August. The Fed`s contacts across the country generally expect moderate economic growth in the coming months.</p><p>Now, several key economic sectors to watch and consumer spending and tourism, retail sales volumes appeared little changed since the prior reporting period and the Boston, Cleveland and San Francisco districts suggested modest gains on balance.</p><p>In manufacturing, activity was flat to slightly up in general with Chicago in particular reporting a moderate pace of growth.</p><p>In real estate and construction, activity expanded further in most districts. Residential construction was moderate across many districts but robust in San Francisco.</p><p>And in employment and wages, employment expanded at a moderate pace since the previous report, with St. Louis in particular reporting that pressure on wages remains strong. But in general, expectations of wage growth for the coming months were modest.</p><p>Election showed up as a concern for some businesses, including real estate decisions and retail auto sales in some districts.</p><p>And in the Atlanta district which encompasses South Florida, contacts observed fewer international arrivals and we`re monitoring the potential impact of Zika on international travel.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eamon Javers at the Federal Reserve in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, why a massive bankruptcy in the shipping industry may be just what the global economy does not need right now.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Congress has failed to move forward a bill that would help battle the Zika virus. The same bill failed twice before because of bipartisan infighting. Meantime, Florida health officials say they have found seven more homegrown cases of Zika. The state has documented 56 locally transmitted cases.</p><p>MATHISEN: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump today said increased military spending is a national security priority. And he called for an end to automatic budget cuts for military spending as part of what`s known as sequestration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: As soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military. It is so depleted. We will rebuild our military.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: John Harwood following the story tonight from Washington.</p><p>John, what specifically did Mr. Trump call for?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, he proposed some specifics in terms of targets for his spending. For example, he said he wanted to take the army up to 540,000 active duty soldiers from the current roughly 480,000. He wanted to go from 1,100 fighter jets to 1,200 fighter jets, 31 marine battalions to 36. That sort of thing.</p><p>But what he didn`t do is spell out exactly how much it would cost or how to pay for it.</p><p>HERERA: And compared to Ms. Clinton`s positions, how do they differ?</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, he certainly seems to be proposing more than Hillary Clinton and she`s ducked on this question. Last year, while she was fighting a Democratic primary campaign that was centered on domestic issues and ways to raise wages she said we should have a national commission on military spending, way of deferring decisions. We may get a greater hint tonight of her views on defense spending in a forum on commander-in-chief issues that NBC is sponsoring.</p><p>MATHISEN: How important is defense spending as a campaign issue this fall? This is a first time I have heard it come up, John.</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, and that`s no accident. The economy is the top issue that voters say they want to hear about. Terrorism rose to the top of the list after some of the high-profile attacks but that since has receded.</p><p>So, this is an issue that is important for the country and important for the next commander in chief. Not front and center with voters right now.</p><p>MATHISEN: John Harwood, thanks. John in Washington tonight.</p><p>HERERA: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will spin off some of its non-core software assets and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>According to sources who spoke to CNBC, the computer maker plans to spin off and combine its non-core software assets with U.K. -based Microfocus in a deal worth nearly $9 billion. Separately, Hewlett-Packard posted higher than expected profit and sales came in a little light. Shares fell nearly 2 percent in after hours but finished the regular day up 1 percent to $22.08.</p><p>Apache said it has uncovered a Texas oil field that could prove to be a profitable resource.

Shares rose 6 percent $55.13.</p><p>Shares of chipotle continued to surge after a regulatory filing late yesterday revealed that Pershing Square took a nearly 10 percent stake in the restaurant chain. The hedge fund said its new position reflects the view that the stock undervalued. Pershing also added to plan to enter into talks with Chipotle`s management. Shares popped nearly 6 percent to $438.45.</p><p>And Sprouts Farmer`s Market said it expects sales to stall in the current quarter, prompting the company to lower its full-year outlook. The organic food retailer blamed a competitive environment and deflation for the weak guidance. Shares were punished. They fell more than 13 percent to $19.68.</p><p>MATHISEN: Retrophin said its drug intended to treat a rare kidney condition performed well during a mid-stage trial and as a result, the biotech company said it will speak with U.S. regulators about expediting the approval process for the treatment.

And that could ripple through a number of key economic sectors.</p><p>Morgan Brennan explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Hanjin`s bankruptcy is the shipping industry`s biggest ever. The financial collapse that`s debilitating the global supply chain and threatening to delay holiday goods destined for store shelves. The company filed for bankruptcy in South Korea last week, seeking similar protections in the U.S. and dozens of other countries since then.</p><p>Hanjin had been losing money for years, but the move still stunned ports, retailers and carriers around the globe, stranding nearly 80 ships carrying half a million containers filled with clothes, toys, computers and appliances.</p><p>CHRIS WETHERBEE, CITI INVESTMENT RESEARCH: In this case, I think there`s a concern in the U.S. that we can see, you know, a good deal of cargo. They make about 5 percent of the Asia to U.S. trade, that cargo could be frozen for a period of time.</p><p>BRENNAN: Hanjin is the world`s seventh largest container shipping line. Since filing for bankruptcy, Hanjin ships had been in limbo. Stalled from China to California, as ports refuse to handle containers for fear costs won`t be recouped and workers won`t be paid.</p><p>On Tuesday, bankruptcy judge in Newark, New Jersey, granted a temporary order so vessels dock at U.S. ports without fear of seizing assets, something that`s happened in other countries.</p><p>Hanjin will be back in court on Friday. But that doesn`t guarantee cargo will actually make it on shore, let alone be transported by truckers and railways to the final destination. According to court filings, HP has computers stuck on ships and Samsung warns it may be forced to spend millions of dollars chartering planes to move its products. The scenario has sparked comparisons to the labor gridlock that crippled West Coast ports last year.</p><p>WETHERBEE: We`re going to have disruptions here I think over a course of a few weeks. It should not stretch over a matter of a few months and most likely contained from a volume standpoint than what we saw with the West Coast ports 18 months ago.</p><p>BRENNAN: And it`s all happening in the middle of the busy peak season. As retailers and other consumer focused shippers stock up ahead of the holidays. With many fleets suffering from overcapacity, rock bottom rates and weak global economic growth, the fear is Hanjin`s woos could be a sign of more pain to come.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, upping his game. What Under Armour is doing to catch up with Nike and what`s fast becoming one of the most import sneaker markets.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Volkswagen is in talks to make electric cars in China. The automaker is exploring a possible joint venture with a state-run company. VW targeting sales of a million electric vehicles a year worldwide by 2025. China is also investing heavily in alternative energy vehicles as it looks to cut its oil imports and reduce air pollution.</p><p>China and Southeast Asia quickly becoming the most important region for sneaker makers. Nike and Adidas have already seen success in the fast growing market. Now, Under Armour making a big push to catch up with the rivals and it has something that other companies don`t, sports star Stephen Curry.</p><p>Sara Eisen reports tonight from Taipei.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Here in Southeast Asia, it is the new frontline for the global sneaker wars and that`s why Stephen Curry backed by Under Armour toured China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to cultivate a new generation of sneaker consumers. It`s why the battle won`t be played out at a NBA court back in the U.S., but in small gyms across Asia, like here in Taipei where Curry spent hours coaching, meeting, greeting, signing autographs and taking selfies with eager fans.</p><p>But like it did in the U.S., Under Armour here in greater China is playing catch up to Nike who`s been in the market for decades.</p><p>Kevin Plank, the CEO of Under Armour, is trying to do what he did in the U.S. in this market.</p><p>KEVIN PLANK, UNDER ARMOUR CEO: It takes time. You know? Since 2010, we have gone from our first million dollars in business to $3 million in $12 million to over $150 million in revenue this year. And so, we have really just hit that trajectory of growth, and -- but it doesn`t happen overnight.</p><p>Again, when you think about China, you know, you can`t think about it in terms of this year and next three years even. It truly is -- it`s a five- year, ten-year, really a 20-year approach plan and again, it`s got be a gift, it`s got be something which is leaving China with more than you`re walking in and thinking you`re going to pull revenue out of the market.</p><p>EISEN: ESPN tallied a list of most famous global athletes. In top ten, Nike stars like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant at number 11, Steph Curry at number 34. But Curry says he`s just getting started and in fact looks up to the other players not just on the court but what they have managed to do with their brands globally.</p><p>STEPHEN CURRY, 2-TIME NBA MOST VALUABLE PLAYER: There`s always a great examples across from players that are coming before me and so, you know, Kobe`s obviously done a great job of keeping it consistent presence in Asia and once again trying to create an authentic story that`s true to him. As a fan of basketball growing up, I took note of that.</p><p>Everybody does it different way and I want to have something that`s unique to me and to the story of Under Armour and Steph Curry.</p><p>EISEN: But make no mistake, fans across Asia came out in crowds and enthusiastically applauding their hero, missing school, lining up at 5:00 a.m. outside the Under Armour store just to get a glimpse of the NBA all- star. It`s clear Under Armour has a rising star in Curry, globally, at a time when investors have questioned where growth is going to come from. The stock has slid this year after multiplying 24-fold since going public. International could hold the key.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sara Eisen from Taipei.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Good for him.</p><p>MATHISEN: Yes, he`s a nice guy it seems.</p><p>HERERA: That`s what I heard.

The world's richest man makes his biggest charitable  ever at $2 billion.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday,  September 13th.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you good evening, everybody.  And welcome.  </p><p>It was a recipe for gains on Wall Street today.  First, trade tensions  continued to ease.  Then, inflation concerns were tempered once again.  And  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares recovered from yesterday's selloff.  </p><p>You mix it all together and stocks finished the session on the upside.  The  Dow Industrial Average advanced by 147 points today, back above 26,000.   The Nasdaq added 59 led by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the S&amp;P was up by 15.  </p><p>HERERA:  But while stocks were higher today, an influential investor says  the bull market is in its late innings.  And he sold some of his stock  holdings.  </p><p>Appaloosa Management's David Tepper called this a tricky market and cited  the trade war with China in particular.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID TEPPER, APPALOOSA FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT:  If we do the tariffs on  China, that's going to make it a little bit tough on the market here just  going forward.  I don't know if that's an inning question or not an inning  question, but it does get to valuations and where we should be if we put on  a lot of tariffs.  And I'm not saying we shouldn't or should.  Just  factually that's the case.  So, I don't know how that's in the market.  </p><p>And the other thing if we don't have it then, you know, we probably have,  you know, the question is how fast will the economy go?  Because China is  stimulating and they are because they think the tariffs are coming.  And  so, that might have a factor of pushing us into higher interest rates.  So,  it's kind of getting a little tricky at this point in time.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  Tepper says stocks could drop 5 to 20 percent if trade tensions  between the two were -- the world's two largest economies increase.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  In the meantime, oil prices fell today amid talk that continued  trade disputes could dent demand even as supply tightens.  The  International Energy Agency warned that global economic risks were mounting  especially in some key emerging economies.  And at today's settlement the  price of domestic crude dropped by about 2.5 percent.  </p><p>HERERA:  One of the most troubled of the emerging market economies for  investors in recent months has been Turkey.  And today, that country's  central bank finally took some action by raising interest rates sharply.  </p><p>Hadley Gamble is in Istanbul tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HADLEY GAMBLE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Another day of wild  volatility for the Turkish lira following a highly anticipated central bank  decision to raise rates, outstripped expectations and immediately sent the  country's currency lower by as much as 5 percent.  Wiped out earlier gains  following comments from the country's president where he slammed the  central bank and called for a rate cut.  It's just the latest in a tit-for- tat between the government and the central bank that has raised questions  about monetary policy autonomy in the country where the currency has  weakened 67 percent against the dollar year to date.  </p><p>But many economists now predict that slowing growth could trigger a  recession as early as next year.  S&amp;P now warns that the economy could  shrink by a third, the lowest level since 2006.  And already, the drop in  the lira had seen Turkey lose a third of its billionaires.  Despite the  latest moves to boost that confidence, international investors remain  worried.  </p><p>After 15 years in office, President Erdogan has tightened his grip on  power, appointing his son-in-law as minister of finance and himself as the  chairman of the country's $250 billion plus sovereign wealth fund.  And  while many say that this rate rise is a move in the right, it may not be  enough to stabilize the currency against the economic and geopolitical  headwinds.</p><p>For NIGHTL BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hadley Gamble in Istanbul.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Here at home, investors are watching the track of Hurricane  Florence and trying to figure out if the damage will be severe enough to  impact the stock market.  According to CFRA, during the most expensive  storms, the S&amp;P 500 fell by 0.2 percent, the month after the hurricane was  formed.  The index was nearly 4 percent higher in the subsequent three  months.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Hurricane Florence has begun lashing the Carolina coast.  We  have two reports for you tonight.  Contessa Brewer is covering the  preparations under way in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  But we begin  tonight with Jackie DeAngelis in the path of the home in Carolina Beach,  North Carolina.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The wind is  picking up and the ocean waves are making their way up to the dunes, all  ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Florence.  The powerful capturing 2 storm  is expected to crash down on Wilmington, North Carolina tomorrow.  With a  storm surge of 10 to 15 feet, as well as up to 40 inches of rain.  </p><p>Flooding is the number one safety concern as the residents, businesses and  authorities make their final preparations.  So, is the loss of power.  </p><p>Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) has started to shut its Brunswick (NYSE:BC) nuclear  power plant located about four miles from the coast.  Storm surge in this  area predicted at 13 feet.  Duke also says 1 million to 2 million of its 4  million customers in affected areas should brace for outages that could  last days or weeks.  As experience in past storms, power outages that are  long are disruptive and dangerous.  </p><p>GOV. ROY COOPER (D), NORTH CAROLINA:  Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and our  electric co-ops are estimating power losses in the millions.  And families  need to have their emergency supplies ready.  </p><p>DEANGELIS:  While lives are the most valuable asset going into Florence.   Property damage will be surveyed after.  Estimates suggest this storm could  cost between $20 billion and $30 billion.  Core Logic says the total worst- case scenario could elevate that figure to $170 billion.  </p><p>For perspective, Hurricane Ike which hit Texas ten years ago today was also  a category 2.  It caused $40 billion in damage.  The fear is palpable and  the stakes are high.  </p><p>BEN BUNN, EVACUATING FROM NEW BERN, NC:  There is nothing we can do here.   When winds get off three digits, the own thing you can do inside the house  is die.  You can't do anything else.  So -- </p><p>AMY LORIO, NOT EVACUATING:  We are staying.  We live on the Trent River in  Trent Woods.  And we are going to stay and -- I think we can take up to 16  feet of water.  So, I think we'll be OK.  </p><p>DEANGELIS:  The storm was expected to cast a wide net.  And once the outer  bands arrive and the rain starts, it won't stop for days.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jackie DeAngelis, Carolina Beach, North  Carolina.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And now to Contessa in Myrtle Beach.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CONTESSA BREWER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Up and down the  Carolina coastline, this is a scene that's repeated over and over.  Flights  cancelled, empty ticket counters.  For people who have not yet evacuated  ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Florence, they're running out of options.  </p><p>TERRI WETMORE, SOUTH CAROLINA VISITOR:  We didn't realize the flight was  cancelled because we weren't notified.  We turned in our rental vehicle and  we have no way to get out of here.  </p><p>BREWER:  Terri and Ron Wetmore flew to Myrtle Beach for vacation last  weekend, their first flight in 35 years.  Now they are stuck and can't  escape back to Pittsburgh.  </p><p>RON WETMORE, SOUTH CAROLINA VISITOR:  Now what?  What am I -- what am I  going to do?  What am I supposed to do here now?  </p><p>I don't have a vehicle.  I don't have -- nothing is open.  I can't check in  anywhere.  It's -- whatever.  </p><p>BREWER:  As Hurricane Florence bears down on the South Carolina coastline,  visitors and residents have limited options.  With mandatory evacuation  orders, many businesses have been closed for days.  A Waffle House locked  and boarded up is a rare sight.  </p><p>The company tweeted out a picture of its command center and it has what's  known as the Waffle House index.  Green everything is open plenty of food  and electricity.  Yellow, operating on limited supplies and generator  power.  Red, closed.  </p><p>It's a gauge even the federal government monitors in judging disaster  recovery.  </p><p>Amy Leftis has owned the Pan American Pancake House for 35 years.  She has  been through tough storms and is monitoring the Florence.  She, like so  many other business owners in Myrtle Beach, depends on the tourism dollars  from nearly 19 million visitors who come annually.  </p><p>AMY LEFTIS, PAN AMERICAN PANCAKE HOUSE OWNER:  Financially, it makes it  difficult for everyone.  Not just the business owners but all the  employees.  They are not making a living either.  You know, so the  evacuation is definitely hurting the whole Myrtle Beach.  </p><p>BREWER:  She says the decision to stay open gives her an opportunity with  the locals.  Many public stores stayed open until mid afternoon for those  picking up last minute supplies, those intent on riding out the storm.  </p><p>SUSAN COHEN, MYRTLE BEACH RESIDENT:  I'm prepared to house people, any dogs  for six to eight weeks.  </p><p>BREWER:  Shelters are open.  But getting to them now is the challenge.  The  Wetmores got at lift with law enforcement and lucked out with a hotel room  at the last minute.  </p><p>Forecasters are warning of dangerous flooding with long-lasting rainfall  and a storm surge as high as 13 feet.  And authorities insist now is the  time to hunker down and brace for the impact of Hurricane Florence.  </p><p>In Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, I'm Contessa Brewer for NIGHTLY BUSINESS  REPORT.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, the threat of the hurricane has also caused home builder  stocks to fall.  The concern is that catastrophic flooding could result in  new home completions to be delayed to the fourth quarter from the third,  and disruptions might also cause new order growth to slow in this current  quarter.  </p><p>So, as a result shares of PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) and  Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) among others were all lower in today's trading.  </p><p>HERERA:  The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits remains  at the lowest level in nearly half a century.  Initial claims dropped by  1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 204,000, providing more evidence that the  labor market is at or near full employment.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  And as we mentioned earlier in program, a key inflation gauge  rose less than expected in August.  The consumer price index increased  just.2 percent last month.  That followed that pull back in producer prices  that we told you about yesterday.  An increase in the cost of gas and rents  were offset by declines in health care and apparel costs.  </p><p>HERERA:  And even as the economy strengthens, the financial crisis that  started ten years ago remains fresh in investor's minds.  And that means  many are always on the lookout for the next crisis.  </p><p>And as Bob Pisani reports, it may come from an unexpected place.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Could a cyber-attack be  the cause of the next financial crisis?  The big question.  Imagine this.   A criminal gang or a state actor hack into a central bank or a custodial  bank, or a clearing system used to settle stock or bond or derivative  trades.  </p><p>There's not many of these firms.  They are systemically important.  The  operations of one or more of the firms are dramatically disrupted to the  point that the services are shut down.  Key data is damaged or destroyed.  </p><p>It's difficult to replicate the services the firms provide.  So the ripple  effect, and other financials services firm.  This could happen.  On  Wednesday, the depository trust and clearing corporation, which provides  clearing and settlement for U.S. financial firms, released a report saying  cyber threats may become the single most important near-term threat to  financial stability.  </p><p>That's pretty serious.  You know, everybody agrees the next financial  crisis is not going to come in the same form as the old one.  But figuring  out where it could come from is hard.  The credit guys say it's going to be  caused by excessive debt.  The regulators say it could happen if we weaken  the regulatory powers too much.  The traders say fragmented markets and the  rise of passive investing could cause a crisis.  </p><p>Economists will talk about trade tensions and rising nationalism and  threats to longstanding international alliances like NATO or the European  Union.  That could cause a crisis.  </p><p>So, who is right?  Maybe they're all right.  But a lot of people are taking  this cyber-attack as a very real possibility and a real problem for the  financial system.  </p><p>A similar report by the way came out from the office financial research  back in December.  Saying a large scale cyber-attack could disrupt  financial networks, threatening the entire system and the broader economy.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to look at the upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>We begin with Dow component Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) which was upgraded to  market perform from underperform at Northland Capital Markets.  The  analysts there cited the stock more than 20 percent pullback from its most  recent highs.  Price target now is $46.  That stock rose more than 1  percent to $45.57.</p><p>Meanwhile, Snap was upgraded to hold from sell at Pivotal Research.  The  analyst cited the company's long-term potential, saying it outweighs some  of near term risks we've been hearing about lately.  That price target is  $9.  But that stock finished right around that level today at $9.35.  </p><p>HERERA:  Wayfair was downgraded to neutral from buy at Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch.  The analyst is forecasting a deceleration in  growth and rising investment costs into next year.  The price target is  $160.  The shares fell almost 1 percent to $148.04.  </p><p>Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI (NASDAQ:TBUS)) saw its price target raised  from to $140 from $125 at Argus Research.  The analyst says initiatives  used at its Olive Garden brad can be implemented at its other specialty  restaurants.  The rating remains a buy.  The stock was up just a fraction  to $118.85.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, the FDA calls vaping an epidemic.  But what exactly  is vaping?  And Juul?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Big tech has gotten the attention of the Federal Trade  Commission.  The agency is now holding a series of hearings to examine  whether some well-known companies are in fact monopolies, and it comes as  scrutiny from Washington grows.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin has more on that story for us tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Federal Trade  Commission wants to take a look at whether changing technologies demand  changing regulation.  </p><p>The FTC holding two days of hearings on competition and consumer protection  in the 21st century.  </p><p>JOSEPH SIMONS, FTC CHAIRMAN:  Today, our most significant and difficult  consumer protection issues often revolve around the use and abuse of  technological capabilities.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  A series of panels examining whether the tech giants are  monopolies.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) with its dominance of search, Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) with its 2 billion monthly users and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with  its nearly trillion dollar market cap and transformation of retail  landscape.  All of these companies and their peers access to consumer data  raising questions about whether data privacy needs to be regulated  differently.  </p><p>ED LEE, NEW YORK TIMES:  Privacy is one aspect.  And I think that's  something the FTC wants to look at closer at.  I think, you know, they have  always revised rules from time to time.  This might be another moment to  clamp down looking at what the E.U. has done with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  And they might -- the FTC might adopt similar rules  or come closer to the E.U. has been thinking about privacy.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Today's hearings come just after the Internet Association, the  lobbying organization represents tech giants including Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), release suggestions for federal regulations around data  privacy. </p><p>In her testimony on Capitol Hill, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg  saying she believes regulation is inevitable.  But that she hopes it's down  in a way that protects consumers while also enabling companies to continue  to innovate and provide useful services to consumers. </p><p>LEE:  The game now is how much can they participate in that decision  making?  Where will the lobbyist be able to get their way in to sort of  help craft what those new rules will look like?  They are going to accept  it.  The game is how much influence can they have over what that these new  rules look like?</p><p>BOORSTIN:  It's not just the FTC and Congress looking closer.  Attorney  General Jeff Sessions is reportedly preparing an investigation into social  media companies for censorship, amid growing concern that the tech giants  are biased against conservatives.  The regulating impartiality has never  done.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Walmart made a big push into ecommerce a couple years ago when it  purchased jet.com.  Now the world's largest retailers wants to remake the  shopping site and shift its focus.  </p><p>Courtney Reagan explains.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Jet.com is getting  a makeover.  The site began as a low cold front retailer that allowed  shoppers to pay with a debit card or waive returns to save money.  While  that's still part of the offering, it's no longer Jet's main message.  Two  years after Walmart purchased the company for $3 billion, it's making a  renewed push for younger, more affluent city shoppers.  </p><p>SIMON BELSHAM, JET.COM PRESIDET:  We have refocused the business on the  urban consumer.  And it is a very customer-focused business that we are  building.  And we know that there is an opportunity to build something  that's very different from other people in other competitors in the city.  </p><p>REAGAN:  But reports suggest Jet's traffic is declining, increasing the  need to turn the tide.  </p><p>To do that, Jet is adding products from popular brands like Nike  (NYSE:NKE).  Customers will also be able to buy from local businesses like  Orwashers Bakery in New York City.  </p><p>And in the Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), jet.com is promising faster grocery  delivery options, taking a direct aim at its competitors, Whole Foods,  Target (NYSE:TGT) and Fresh Direct.  This allows Jet's parent company  Walmart to reach city shoppers it otherwise wouldn't and get groceries  delivered to them, an important part of Walmart's growth strategy.  </p><p>BELSHAM:  Being part of the Walmart business gives us access to the scale  which helps us with pricing and for the products for consumers, and also  the infrastructure that we have that sits behind the business.  </p><p>REAGAN:  But questions remain whether Jet.com's redesign will help Walmart  in its ongoing competition with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Kroger's same-store sales rise less than expected.  And that's  where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The nation's largest supermarket operator blamed its overall revenue miss  on the transition to new store layouts and a change in its product mix.   Kroger (NYSE:KR) did top profit estimates but it did see its margins weaken  as price cuts and higher freight cost pressured results.  Kroger (NYSE:KR)  shares were off nearly 10 percent today to $28.50.  </p><p>Hershey's is growing its snack portfolio.  The maker of Reese's Peanut  Buttercups said it was buying Pirate brands from B&amp;G Foods for more than  $400 million.  Under the deal, Hershey's will gain control over Pirate's  Booty Popcorn and Smart Puffs.  Hershey's shares were up a fraction today  to $106.60.  </p><p>Meanwhile, \"The New York Post\" is reporting that activist hedge fund HG  Vora Capital has quietly amassed a stake in Caesars Entertainment with the  intention of pushing the casino operator to sell itself.  And as Caesar's  won't consider a sell, then \"The Post\" says HG Vora would like it to sell  significant assets.  Shares of Caesars rose nearly 1 percent today to  $10.45.  </p><p>HERERA:  Shares of Restoration Hardware spiked on news that the retailer's  CEO bought nearly 8,000 RH shares which translates to about $1 million  worth of stock.  RH shares finished up 3 percent to $135.28.  </p><p>After the bell, Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) reported a drop in same store sales  that improved from the previous quarter.  The retailer initially planned to  release results before the market opened but then postponed.  Sears  (NASDAQ:SHLD) says it is still seeking ways to return to profitability.   Shares initially rose in after hours but finished the regular day down 9  percent to $1.21.  </p><p>And also after the bell, Adobe said stronger sales in its creative and  document cloud divisions helped its earnings beat expectations.  The  company also gave upbeat revenue guidance for the current quarter.  </p><p>Separately, CNBC is reporting that Adobe is in talks to buy a privately  held cloud marketing software company in an effort to better compete with  rivals Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL).  The report said  Adobe could pay upwards of $1.5 billion.  Adobe shares were volatile in the  after-hours sessions but they finished the regular day up a fraction to  $268.52.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yesterday, we told you about the concerns the FDA has raised  about the growing use of e-cigarettes by minors.  And today, we're taking a  closer look at Juul.  This is the company that dominates this market with a  valuation of about $16 billion.  </p><p>Aditi Roy has our report tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's sleek, stylish and  looks more like a USB device than a vaporizer.  That's just one reason why  e-cigarette company Juul is so popular among teens.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Those are one of the more popular products that we  sell here.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I mean, on my college campus, it's really popular.  </p><p>ROY:  The FDA says teenage use of the product is so rampant, it's become an  epidemic.  </p><p>SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FDA COMMISSIONER:  There's probably steps they could do to  perhaps even shutdown their online sites.  I'm not sure they're going to be  willing to do that.  But we are willing to step in and remove these flavors  from the market.  We think they are one element of what's making these  products appealing to a youth.  </p><p>ROY:  Juul is one of five e-cigarette companies that have been ordered by  the FDA to submit plans in the next two months how to discouraging teenage  use of their products.  In a statement responding to the commissioners'  remarks, the company says: Juul is intended for current adult smokers only.   We cannot be more emphatic on this point.  No minor or non-nicotine user  should ever try Juul.  </p><p>Its founders have said they started the company to get people to quit  smoking.  </p><p>JAMES MONSEES, JUUL CO-FOUNDER:  But we had always intended to build this  company around the idea of making cigarettes obsolete.  </p><p>ROY:  Colorful pods and flavors like mango and cream, Juul's users include  non-cigarette smokers.  </p><p>Since the company spun off more than a year ago, its growth has  skyrocketed.  Juul now owns 72 percent of the market.  Sales have increased  800 percent in the last year.  And the company is valued at more than $16  billion.  </p><p>But critics say the company's success rides on the youngest users.  Its  early slick social media ads seem to target young people.  Juul has since  replaced those ads, but the craze among youth remains.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's definitely are more popular among the youth.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My nephew is in junior high right now.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Silas (ph)?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And he told me about Juul before I had to hear about  Juul.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you serious?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  That's what kids are doing.  </p><p>ROY:  Unlike traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes don't burn tobacco.   Instead, they have cartridges filled with nicotine making parents like  Laura Bishop Bass worry.  </p><p>LAURA BISHOP BASS, AUSTIN, TEXAS:  I have a 22-year-old daughter and a lot  of her friends are using these products.  And I'm warning them that there  again you are going to be addicted to this tobacco.  </p><p>ROY:  Experts tell us some of the side health effects of nicotine among  youth include asthma and there is evidence linking it to lung disease.  The  FDA says it will soon release data on the growing use of e-cigarettes among  teenagers and the agency could order companies to change their sales and  marketing practices.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, the world's richest man is spending billions to give  back.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  General Motors (NYSE:GM) is recalling one million pickup trucks  and SUVs that could suffer from a steering malfunction.  The automaker has  identified 30 crashes and two injuries connected to this defect, says there  has been no deaths though.  The recall covers certain Chevy Silverado 1500  and GMC 1500 pickups, as well as the Chevy Tahoe, Suburban, GMC Yukon and  Cadillac Escalades from the 2015 model year.  </p><p>HERERA:  The CEO of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world's richest man and now  he's announcing the creation of a multibillion-dollar charitable fund and  outlining his philanthropic plan.  </p><p>Robert Frank has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The world's richest  man is giving away more of his money.  Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie  are launching a new philanthropic fund called the Day One Fund, with a $2  billion commitment.  The fund which Bezos announced on Twitter will focus  on two things, the homeless problem and education for preschoolers in need.  </p><p>In the announcement, Bezos said the Day One Families Fund will work with  existing non-profits to help homeless families and is modeled after the  famous Mary's Place non-profit in Seattle where Bezos lived and which has a  rising homeless problem.  </p><p>The Day One Academy's Fund will launch and run scholarship Montessori-style  preschools in underserved communities.  Bezos wrote that he will use,  quote, the same set of principles that have driven Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  </p><p>The gift follows criticism about Bezos's fortune now at $164 billion  compared with the low pay for some Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) employees.  And it  comes after increased scrutiny of his philanthropy.  He hasn't signed the  giving pledge, and until this announcement, he had given away less than  $170 million.  </p><p>This month, he announced a gift of $10 million to super PAC that helps  elect military vets to Congress.  And last year, he gave $33 million to a  scholarship fund for the Dreamers.  </p><p>Bezos solicited ideas on Twitter last summer for his philanthropy and  tweeted, quote, it feels me with gratitude and optimism to be part of  species so bent on self-improvement.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Robert Frank.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that's it for us tonight.

As local businesses close up shop and hope the  disruptions won't last long.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  How big is too big?  The  FTC is holding hearings to figure that out and eventually decide whether  big tech needs more oversight.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  Giving back.  The world's richest man makes his biggest charitable  ever at $2 billion.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday,  September 13th.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you good evening, everybody.  And welcome.  </p><p> It was a recipe for gains on Wall Street today.  First, trade tensions  continued to ease.  Then, inflation concerns were tempered once again.  And  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares recovered from yesterday's selloff.  </p><p> You mix it all together and stocks finished the session on the upside.  The  Dow Industrial Average advanced by 147 points today, back above 26,000.   The Nasdaq added 59 led by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the S&amp;P was up by 15.  </p><p> HERERA:  But while stocks were higher today, an influential investor says  the bull market is in its late innings.  And he sold some of his stock  holdings.  </p><p>Appaloosa Management's David Tepper called this a tricky market and cited  the trade war with China in particular.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID TEPPER, APPALOOSA FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT:  If we do the tariffs on  China, that's going to make it a little bit tough on the market here just  going forward.  I don't know if that's an inning question or not an inning  question, but it does get to valuations and where we should be if we put on  a lot of tariffs.  And I'm not saying we shouldn't or should.  Just  factually that's the case.  So, I don't know how that's in the market.  </p><p> And the other thing if we don't have it then, you know, we probably have,  you know, the question is how fast will the economy go?  Because China is  stimulating and they are because they think the tariffs are coming.  And  so, that might have a factor of pushing us into higher interest rates.  So,  it's kind of getting a little tricky at this point in time.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  Tepper says stocks could drop 5 to 20 percent if trade tensions  between the two were -- the world's two largest economies increase.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  In the meantime, oil prices fell today amid talk that continued  trade disputes could dent demand even as supply tightens.  The  International Energy Agency warned that global economic risks were mounting  especially in some key emerging economies.  And at today's settlement the  price of domestic crude dropped by about 2.5 percent.  </p><p> HERERA:  One of the most troubled of the emerging market economies for  investors in recent months has been Turkey.  And today, that country's  central bank finally took some action by raising interest rates sharply.  </p><p> Hadley Gamble is in Istanbul tonight.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HADLEY GAMBLE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Another day of wild  volatility for the Turkish lira following a highly anticipated central bank  decision to raise rates, outstripped expectations and immediately sent the  country's currency lower by as much as 5 percent.  Wiped out earlier gains  following comments from the country's president where he slammed the  central bank and called for a rate cut.  It's just the latest in a tit-for- tat between the government and the central bank that has raised questions  about monetary policy autonomy in the country where the currency has  weakened 67 percent against the dollar year to date.  </p><p> But many economists now predict that slowing growth could trigger a  recession as early as next year.  S&amp;P now warns that the economy could  shrink by a third, the lowest level since 2006.  And already, the drop in  the lira had seen Turkey lose a third of its billionaires.  Despite the  latest moves to boost that confidence, international investors remain  worried.  </p><p> After 15 years in office, President Erdogan has tightened his grip on  power, appointing his son-in-law as minister of finance and himself as the  chairman of the country's $250 billion plus sovereign wealth fund.  And  while many say that this rate rise is a move in the right, it may not be  enough to stabilize the currency against the economic and geopolitical  headwinds.</p><p> For NIGHTL BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hadley Gamble in Istanbul.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Here at home, investors are watching the track of Hurricane  Florence and trying to figure out if the damage will be severe enough to  impact the stock market.  According to CFRA, during the most expensive  storms, the S&amp;P 500 fell by 0.2 percent, the month after the hurricane was  formed.  The index was nearly 4 percent higher in the subsequent three  months.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Hurricane Florence has begun lashing the Carolina coast.  We  have two reports for you tonight.  Contessa Brewer is covering the  preparations under way in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  But we begin  tonight with Jackie DeAngelis in the path of the home in Carolina Beach,  North Carolina.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The wind is  picking up and the ocean waves are making their way up to the dunes, all  ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Florence.  The powerful capturing 2 storm  is expected to crash down on Wilmington, North Carolina tomorrow.  With a  storm surge of 10 to 15 feet, as well as up to 40 inches of rain.  </p><p> Flooding is the number one safety concern as the residents, businesses and  authorities make their final preparations.  So, is the loss of power.  </p><p>Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) has started to shut its Brunswick (NYSE:BC) nuclear  power plant located about four miles from the coast.  Storm surge in this  area predicted at 13 feet.  Duke also says 1 million to 2 million of its 4  million customers in affected areas should brace for outages that could  last days or weeks.  As experience in past storms, power outages that are  long are disruptive and dangerous.  </p><p> GOV. ROY COOPER (D), NORTH CAROLINA:  Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and our  electric co-ops are estimating power losses in the millions.  And families  need to have their emergency supplies ready.  </p><p> DEANGELIS:  While lives are the most valuable asset going into Florence.   Property damage will be surveyed after.  Estimates suggest this storm could  cost between $20 billion and $30 billion.  Core Logic says the total worst- case scenario could elevate that figure to $170 billion.  </p><p> For perspective, Hurricane Ike which hit Texas ten years ago today was also  a category 2.  It caused $40 billion in damage.  The fear is palpable and  the stakes are high.  </p><p> BEN BUNN, EVACUATING FROM NEW BERN, NC:  There is nothing we can do here.   When winds get off three digits, the own thing you can do inside the house  is die.  You can't do anything else.  So -- </p><p> AMY LORIO, NOT EVACUATING:  We are staying.  We live on the Trent River in  Trent Woods.  And we are going to stay and -- I think we can take up to 16  feet of water.  So, I think we'll be OK.  </p><p> DEANGELIS:  The storm was expected to cast a wide net.  And once the outer  bands arrive and the rain starts, it won't stop for days.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jackie DeAngelis, Carolina Beach, North  Carolina.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And now to Contessa in Myrtle Beach.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CONTESSA BREWER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Up and down the  Carolina coastline, this is a scene that's repeated over and over.  Flights  cancelled, empty ticket counters.  For people who have not yet evacuated  ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Florence, they're running out of options.  </p><p> TERRI WETMORE, SOUTH CAROLINA VISITOR:  We didn't realize the flight was  cancelled because we weren't notified.  We turned in our rental vehicle and  we have no way to get out of here.  </p><p> BREWER:  Terri and Ron Wetmore flew to Myrtle Beach for vacation last  weekend, their first flight in 35 years.  Now they are stuck and can't  escape back to Pittsburgh.  </p><p> RON WETMORE, SOUTH CAROLINA VISITOR:  Now what?  What am I -- what am I  going to do?  What am I supposed to do here now?  </p><p> I don't have a vehicle.  I don't have -- nothing is open.  I can't check in  anywhere.  It's -- whatever.  </p><p> BREWER:  As Hurricane Florence bears down on the South Carolina coastline,  visitors and residents have limited options.  With mandatory evacuation  orders, many businesses have been closed for days.  A Waffle House locked  and boarded up is a rare sight.  </p><p> The company tweeted out a picture of its command center and it has what's  known as the Waffle House index.  Green everything is open plenty of food  and electricity.  Yellow, operating on limited supplies and generator  power.  Red, closed.  </p><p> It's a gauge even the federal government monitors in judging disaster  recovery.  </p><p> Amy Leftis has owned the Pan American Pancake House for 35 years.  She has  been through tough storms and is monitoring the Florence.  She, like so  many other business owners in Myrtle Beach, depends on the tourism dollars  from nearly 19 million visitors who come annually.  </p><p> AMY LEFTIS, PAN AMERICAN PANCAKE HOUSE OWNER:  Financially, it makes it  difficult for everyone.  Not just the business owners but all the  employees.  They are not making a living either.  You know, so the  evacuation is definitely hurting the whole Myrtle Beach.  </p><p> BREWER:  She says the decision to stay open gives her an opportunity with  the locals.  Many public stores stayed open until mid afternoon for those  picking up last minute supplies, those intent on riding out the storm.  </p><p> SUSAN COHEN, MYRTLE BEACH RESIDENT:  I'm prepared to house people, any dogs  for six to eight weeks.  </p><p> BREWER:  Shelters are open.  But getting to them now is the challenge.  The  Wetmores got at lift with law enforcement and lucked out with a hotel room  at the last minute.  </p><p> Forecasters are warning of dangerous flooding with long-lasting rainfall  and a storm surge as high as 13 feet.  And authorities insist now is the  time to hunker down and brace for the impact of Hurricane Florence.  </p><p> In Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, I'm Contessa Brewer for NIGHTLY BUSINESS  REPORT.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Well, the threat of the hurricane has also caused home builder  stocks to fall.  The concern is that catastrophic flooding could result in  new home completions to be delayed to the fourth quarter from the third,  and disruptions might also cause new order growth to slow in this current  quarter.  </p><p> So, as a result shares of PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) and  Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) among others were all lower in today's trading.  </p><p> HERERA:  The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits remains  at the lowest level in nearly half a century.  Initial claims dropped by  1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 204,000, providing more evidence that the  labor market is at or near full employment.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  And as we mentioned earlier in program, a key inflation gauge  rose less than expected in August.  The consumer price index increased  just.2 percent last month.  That followed that pull back in producer prices  that we told you about yesterday.  An increase in the cost of gas and rents  were offset by declines in health care and apparel costs.  </p><p> HERERA:  And even as the economy strengthens, the financial crisis that  started ten years ago remains fresh in investor's minds.  And that means  many are always on the lookout for the next crisis.  </p><p> And as Bob Pisani reports, it may come from an unexpected place.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Could a cyber-attack be  the cause of the next financial crisis?  The big question.  Imagine this.   A criminal gang or a state actor hack into a central bank or a custodial  bank, or a clearing system used to settle stock or bond or derivative  trades.  </p><p> There's not many of these firms.  They are systemically important.  The  operations of one or more of the firms are dramatically disrupted to the  point that the services are shut down.  Key data is damaged or destroyed.  </p><p> It's difficult to replicate the services the firms provide.  So the ripple  effect, and other financials services firm.  This could happen.  On  Wednesday, the depository trust and clearing corporation, which provides  clearing and settlement for U.S. financial firms, released a report saying  cyber threats may become the single most important near-term threat to  financial stability.  </p><p> That's pretty serious.  You know, everybody agrees the next financial  crisis is not going to come in the same form as the old one.  But figuring  out where it could come from is hard.  The credit guys say it's going to be  caused by excessive debt.  The regulators say it could happen if we weaken  the regulatory powers too much.  The traders say fragmented markets and the  rise of passive investing could cause a crisis.  </p><p> Economists will talk about trade tensions and rising nationalism and  threats to longstanding international alliances like NATO or the European  Union.  That could cause a crisis.  </p><p> So, who is right?  Maybe they're all right.  But a lot of people are taking  this cyber-attack as a very real possibility and a real problem for the  financial system.  </p><p> A similar report by the way came out from the office financial research  back in December.  Saying a large scale cyber-attack could disrupt  financial networks, threatening the entire system and the broader economy.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Time to look at the upgrades and downgrades.</p><p> We begin with Dow component Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) which was upgraded to  market perform from underperform at Northland Capital Markets.  The  analysts there cited the stock more than 20 percent pullback from its most  recent highs.  Price target now is $46.  That stock rose more than 1  percent to $45.57.</p><p> Meanwhile, Snap was upgraded to hold from sell at Pivotal Research.  The  analyst cited the company's long-term potential, saying it outweighs some  of near term risks we've been hearing about lately.  That price target is  $9.  But that stock finished right around that level today at $9.35.  </p><p> HERERA:  Wayfair was downgraded to neutral from buy at Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch.  The analyst is forecasting a deceleration in  growth and rising investment costs into next year.  The price target is  $160.  The shares fell almost 1 percent to $148.04.  </p><p> Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI (NASDAQ:TBUS)) saw its price target raised  from to $140 from $125 at Argus Research.  The analyst says initiatives  used at its Olive Garden brad can be implemented at its other specialty  restaurants.  The rating remains a buy.  The stock was up just a fraction  to $118.85.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, the FDA calls vaping an epidemic.  But what exactly  is vaping?  And Juul?</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Big tech has gotten the attention of the Federal Trade  Commission.  The agency is now holding a series of hearings to examine  whether some well-known companies are in fact monopolies, and it comes as  scrutiny from Washington grows.  </p><p> Julia Boorstin has more on that story for us tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Federal Trade  Commission wants to take a look at whether changing technologies demand  changing regulation.  </p><p> The FTC holding two days of hearings on competition and consumer protection  in the 21st century.  </p><p> JOSEPH SIMONS, FTC CHAIRMAN:  Today, our most significant and difficult  consumer protection issues often revolve around the use and abuse of  technological capabilities.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  A series of panels examining whether the tech giants are  monopolies.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) with its dominance of search, Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) with its 2 billion monthly users and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with  its nearly trillion dollar market cap and transformation of retail  landscape.  All of these companies and their peers access to consumer data  raising questions about whether data privacy needs to be regulated  differently.  </p><p> ED LEE, NEW YORK TIMES:  Privacy is one aspect.  And I think that's  something the FTC wants to look at closer at.  I think, you know, they have  always revised rules from time to time.  This might be another moment to  clamp down looking at what the E.U. has done with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  And they might -- the FTC might adopt similar rules  or come closer to the E.U. has been thinking about privacy.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  Today's hearings come just after the Internet Association, the  lobbying organization represents tech giants including Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), release suggestions for federal regulations around data  privacy. </p><p> In her testimony on Capitol Hill, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg  saying she believes regulation is inevitable.  But that she hopes it's down  in a way that protects consumers while also enabling companies to continue  to innovate and provide useful services to consumers. </p><p> LEE:  The game now is how much can they participate in that decision  making?  Where will the lobbyist be able to get their way in to sort of  help craft what those new rules will look like?  They are going to accept  it.  The game is how much influence can they have over what that these new  rules look like?</p><p> BOORSTIN:  It's not just the FTC and Congress looking closer.  Attorney  General Jeff Sessions is reportedly preparing an investigation into social  media companies for censorship, amid growing concern that the tech giants  are biased against conservatives.  The regulating impartiality has never  done.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Walmart made a big push into ecommerce a couple years ago when it  purchased jet.com.  Now the world's largest retailers wants to remake the  shopping site and shift its focus.  </p><p> Courtney Reagan explains.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Jet.com is getting  a makeover.  The site began as a low cold front retailer that allowed  shoppers to pay with a debit card or waive returns to save money.  While  that's still part of the offering, it's no longer Jet's main message.  Two  years after Walmart purchased the company for $3 billion, it's making a  renewed push for younger, more affluent city shoppers.  </p><p> SIMON BELSHAM, JET.COM PRESIDET:  We have refocused the business on the  urban consumer.  And it is a very customer-focused business that we are  building.  And we know that there is an opportunity to build something  that's very different from other people in other competitors in the city.  </p><p> REAGAN:  But reports suggest Jet's traffic is declining, increasing the  need to turn the tide.  </p><p> To do that, Jet is adding products from popular brands like Nike  (NYSE:NKE).  Customers will also be able to buy from local businesses like  Orwashers Bakery in New York City.  </p><p> And in the Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), jet.com is promising faster grocery  delivery options, taking a direct aim at its competitors, Whole Foods,  Target (NYSE:TGT) and Fresh Direct.  This allows Jet's parent company  Walmart to reach city shoppers it otherwise wouldn't and get groceries  delivered to them, an important part of Walmart's growth strategy.  </p><p> BELSHAM:  Being part of the Walmart business gives us access to the scale  which helps us with pricing and for the products for consumers, and also  the infrastructure that we have that sits behind the business.  </p><p> REAGAN:  But questions remain whether Jet.com's redesign will help Walmart  in its ongoing competition with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Kroger's same-store sales rise less than expected.  And that's  where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The nation's largest supermarket operator blamed its overall revenue miss  on the transition to new store layouts and a change in its product mix.   Kroger (NYSE:KR) did top profit estimates but it did see its margins weaken  as price cuts and higher freight cost pressured results.  Kroger (NYSE:KR)  shares were off nearly 10 percent today to $28.50.  </p><p> Hershey's is growing its snack portfolio.  The maker of Reese's Peanut  Buttercups said it was buying Pirate brands from B&amp;G Foods for more than  $400 million.  Under the deal, Hershey's will gain control over Pirate's  Booty Popcorn and Smart Puffs.  Hershey's shares were up a fraction today  to $106.60.  </p><p> Meanwhile, \"The New York Post\" is reporting that activist hedge fund HG  Vora Capital has quietly amassed a stake in Caesars Entertainment with the  intention of pushing the casino operator to sell itself.  And as Caesar's  won't consider a sell, then \"The Post\" says HG Vora would like it to sell  significant assets.  Shares of Caesars rose nearly 1 percent today to  $10.45.  </p><p> HERERA:  Shares of Restoration Hardware spiked on news that the retailer's  CEO bought nearly 8,000 RH shares which translates to about $1 million  worth of stock.  RH shares finished up 3 percent to $135.28.  </p><p> After the bell, Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) reported a drop in same store sales  that improved from the previous quarter.  The retailer initially planned to  release results before the market opened but then postponed.  Sears  (NASDAQ:SHLD) says it is still seeking ways to return to profitability.   Shares initially rose in after hours but finished the regular day down 9  percent to $1.21.  </p><p> And also after the bell, Adobe said stronger sales in its creative and  document cloud divisions helped its earnings beat expectations.  The  company also gave upbeat revenue guidance for the current quarter.  </p><p> Separately, CNBC is reporting that Adobe is in talks to buy a privately  held cloud marketing software company in an effort to better compete with  rivals Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL).  The report said  Adobe could pay upwards of $1.5 billion.  Adobe shares were volatile in the  after-hours sessions but they finished the regular day up a fraction to  $268.52.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Yesterday, we told you about the concerns the FDA has raised  about the growing use of e-cigarettes by minors.  And today, we're taking a  closer look at Juul.  This is the company that dominates this market with a  valuation of about $16 billion.  </p><p> Aditi Roy has our report tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's sleek, stylish and  looks more like a USB device than a vaporizer.  That's just one reason why  e-cigarette company Juul is so popular among teens.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Those are one of the more popular products that we  sell here.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I mean, on my college campus, it's really popular.  </p><p> ROY:  The FDA says teenage use of the product is so rampant, it's become an  epidemic.  </p><p> SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FDA COMMISSIONER:  There's probably steps they could do to  perhaps even shutdown their online sites.  I'm not sure they're going to be  willing to do that.  But we are willing to step in and remove these flavors  from the market.  We think they are one element of what's making these  products appealing to a youth.  </p><p> ROY:  Juul is one of five e-cigarette companies that have been ordered by  the FDA to submit plans in the next two months how to discouraging teenage  use of their products.  In a statement responding to the commissioners'  remarks, the company says: Juul is intended for current adult smokers only.   We cannot be more emphatic on this point.  No minor or non-nicotine user  should ever try Juul.  </p><p> Its founders have said they started the company to get people to quit  smoking.  </p><p> JAMES MONSEES, JUUL CO-FOUNDER:  But we had always intended to build this  company around the idea of making cigarettes obsolete.  </p><p> ROY:  Colorful pods and flavors like mango and cream, Juul's users include  non-cigarette smokers.  </p><p> Since the company spun off more than a year ago, its growth has  skyrocketed.  Juul now owns 72 percent of the market.  Sales have increased  800 percent in the last year.  And the company is valued at more than $16  billion.  </p><p> But critics say the company's success rides on the youngest users.  Its  early slick social media ads seem to target young people.  Juul has since  replaced those ads, but the craze among youth remains.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's definitely are more popular among the youth.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My nephew is in junior high right now.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Silas (ph)?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And he told me about Juul before I had to hear about  Juul.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you serious?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  That's what kids are doing.  </p><p> ROY:  Unlike traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes don't burn tobacco.   Instead, they have cartridges filled with nicotine making parents like  Laura Bishop Bass worry.  </p><p> LAURA BISHOP BASS, AUSTIN, TEXAS:  I have a 22-year-old daughter and a lot  of her friends are using these products.  And I'm warning them that there  again you are going to be addicted to this tobacco.  </p><p> ROY:  Experts tell us some of the side health effects of nicotine among  youth include asthma and there is evidence linking it to lung disease.  The  FDA says it will soon release data on the growing use of e-cigarettes among  teenagers and the agency could order companies to change their sales and  marketing practices.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, the world's richest man is spending billions to give  back.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  General Motors (NYSE:GM) is recalling one million pickup trucks  and SUVs that could suffer from a steering malfunction.  The automaker has  identified 30 crashes and two injuries connected to this defect, says there  has been no deaths though.  The recall covers certain Chevy Silverado 1500  and GMC 1500 pickups, as well as the Chevy Tahoe, Suburban, GMC Yukon and  Cadillac Escalades from the 2015 model year.  </p><p> HERERA:  The CEO of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world's richest man and now  he's announcing the creation of a multibillion-dollar charitable fund and  outlining his philanthropic plan.  </p><p> Robert Frank has more.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The world's richest  man is giving away more of his money.  Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie  are launching a new philanthropic fund called the Day One Fund, with a $2  billion commitment.  The fund which Bezos announced on Twitter will focus  on two things, the homeless problem and education for preschoolers in need.  </p><p> In the announcement, Bezos said the Day One Families Fund will work with  existing non-profits to help homeless families and is modeled after the  famous Mary's Place non-profit in Seattle where Bezos lived and which has a  rising homeless problem.  </p><p> The Day One Academy's Fund will launch and run scholarship Montessori-style  preschools in underserved communities.  Bezos wrote that he will use,  quote, the same set of principles that have driven Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  </p><p> The gift follows criticism about Bezos's fortune now at $164 billion  compared with the low pay for some Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) employees.  And it  comes after increased scrutiny of his philanthropy.  He hasn't signed the  giving pledge, and until this announcement, he had given away less than  $170 million.  </p><p> This month, he announced a gift of $10 million to super PAC that helps  elect military vets to Congress.  And last year, he gave $33 million to a  scholarship fund for the Dreamers.  </p><p> Bezos solicited ideas on Twitter last summer for his philanthropy and  tweeted, quote, it feels me with gratitude and optimism to be part of  species so bent on self-improvement.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Robert Frank.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And that's it for us tonight.

As local businesses close up shop and hope the disruptions won`t last long.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: How big is too big? The FTC is holding hearings to figure that out and eventually decide whether big tech needs more oversight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Giving back. The world`s richest man makes his biggest charitable ever at $2 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, September 13th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we do bid you good evening, everybody. And welcome.</p><p>It was a recipe for gains on Wall Street today. First, trade tensions continued to ease. Then, inflation concerns were tempered once again. And Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares recovered from yesterday`s selloff.</p><p>You mix it all together and stocks finished the session on the upside. The Dow Industrial Average advanced by 147 points today, back above 26,000. The Nasdaq added 59 led by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the S&amp;P was up by 15.</p><p>HERERA: But while stocks were higher today, an influential investor says the bull market is in its late innings. And he sold some of his stock holdings.</p><p>Appaloosa Management`s David Tepper called this a tricky market and cited the trade war with China in particular.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID TEPPER, APPALOOSA FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT: If we do the tariffs on China, that`s going to make it a little bit tough on the market here just going forward. I don`t know if that`s an inning question or not an inning question, but it does get to valuations and where we should be if we put on a lot of tariffs. And I`m not saying we shouldn`t or should. Just factually that`s the case. So, I don`t know how that`s in the market.</p><p>And the other thing if we don`t have it then, you know, we probably have, you know, the question is how fast will the economy go? Because China is stimulating and they are because they think the tariffs are coming. And so, that might have a factor of pushing us into higher interest rates. So, it`s kind of getting a little tricky at this point in time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: Tepper says stocks could drop 5 to 20 percent if trade tensions between the two were -- the world`s two largest economies increase.</p><p>GRIFFETH: In the meantime, oil prices fell today amid talk that continued trade disputes could dent demand even as supply tightens. The International Energy Agency warned that global economic risks were mounting especially in some key emerging economies. And at today`s settlement the price of domestic crude dropped by about 2.5 percent.</p><p>HERERA: One of the most troubled of the emerging market economies for investors in recent months has been Turkey. And today, that country`s central bank finally took some action by raising interest rates sharply.</p><p>Hadley Gamble is in Istanbul tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HADLEY GAMBLE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Another day of wild volatility for the Turkish lira following a highly anticipated central bank decision to raise rates, outstripped expectations and immediately sent the country`s currency lower by as much as 5 percent. Wiped out earlier gains following comments from the country`s president where he slammed the central bank and called for a rate cut. It`s just the latest in a tit-for- tat between the government and the central bank that has raised questions about monetary policy autonomy in the country where the currency has weakened 67 percent against the dollar year to date.</p><p>But many economists now predict that slowing growth could trigger a recession as early as next year. S&amp;P now warns that the economy could shrink by a third, the lowest level since 2006. And already, the drop in the lira had seen Turkey lose a third of its billionaires. Despite the latest moves to boost that confidence, international investors remain worried.</p><p>After 15 years in office, President Erdogan has tightened his grip on power, appointing his son-in-law as minister of finance and himself as the chairman of the country`s $250 billion plus sovereign wealth fund. And while many say that this rate rise is a move in the right, it may not be enough to stabilize the currency against the economic and geopolitical headwinds.</p><p>For NIGHTL BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Hadley Gamble in Istanbul.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Here at home, investors are watching the track of Hurricane Florence and trying to figure out if the damage will be severe enough to impact the stock market. According to CFRA, during the most expensive storms, the S&amp;P 500 fell by 0.2 percent, the month after the hurricane was formed. The index was nearly 4 percent higher in the subsequent three months.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Hurricane Florence has begun lashing the Carolina coast. We have two reports for you tonight. Contessa Brewer is covering the preparations under way in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. But we begin tonight with Jackie DeAngelis in the path of the home in Carolina Beach, North Carolina.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The wind is picking up and the ocean waves are making their way up to the dunes, all ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Florence. The powerful capturing 2 storm is expected to crash down on Wilmington, North Carolina tomorrow. With a storm surge of 10 to 15 feet, as well as up to 40 inches of rain.</p><p>Flooding is the number one safety concern as the residents, businesses and authorities make their final preparations. So, is the loss of power.</p><p>Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) has started to shut its Brunswick (NYSE:BC) nuclear power plant located about four miles from the coast. Storm surge in this area predicted at 13 feet. Duke also says 1 million to 2 million of its 4 million customers in affected areas should brace for outages that could last days or weeks. As experience in past storms, power outages that are long are disruptive and dangerous.</p><p>GOV. ROY COOPER (D), NORTH CAROLINA: Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and our electric co-ops are estimating power losses in the millions. And families need to have their emergency supplies ready.</p><p>DEANGELIS: While lives are the most valuable asset going into Florence. Property damage will be surveyed after. Estimates suggest this storm could cost between $20 billion and $30 billion. Core Logic says the total worst- case scenario could elevate that figure to $170 billion.</p><p>For perspective, Hurricane Ike which hit Texas ten years ago today was also a category 2. It caused $40 billion in damage. The fear is palpable and the stakes are high.</p><p>BEN BUNN, EVACUATING FROM NEW BERN, NC: There is nothing we can do here. When winds get off three digits, the own thing you can do inside the house is die. You can`t do anything else. So --</p><p>AMY LORIO, NOT EVACUATING: We are staying. We live on the Trent River in Trent Woods. And we are going to stay and -- I think we can take up to 16 feet of water. So, I think we`ll be OK.</p><p>DEANGELIS: The storm was expected to cast a wide net. And once the outer bands arrive and the rain starts, it won`t stop for days.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jackie DeAngelis, Carolina Beach, North Carolina.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And now to Contessa in Myrtle Beach.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CONTESSA BREWER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Up and down the Carolina coastline, this is a scene that`s repeated over and over. Flights cancelled, empty ticket counters. For people who have not yet evacuated ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Florence, they`re running out of options.</p><p>TERRI WETMORE, SOUTH CAROLINA VISITOR: We didn`t realize the flight was cancelled because we weren`t notified. We turned in our rental vehicle and we have no way to get out of here.</p><p>BREWER: Terri and Ron Wetmore flew to Myrtle Beach for vacation last weekend, their first flight in 35 years. Now they are stuck and can`t escape back to Pittsburgh.</p><p>RON WETMORE, SOUTH CAROLINA VISITOR: Now what? What am I -- what am I going to do? What am I supposed to do here now?</p><p>I don`t have a vehicle. I don`t have -- nothing is open. I can`t check in anywhere. It`s -- whatever.</p><p>BREWER: As Hurricane Florence bears down on the South Carolina coastline, visitors and residents have limited options. With mandatory evacuation orders, many businesses have been closed for days. A Waffle House locked and boarded up is a rare sight.</p><p>The company tweeted out a picture of its command center and it has what`s known as the Waffle House index. Green everything is open plenty of food and electricity. Yellow, operating on limited supplies and generator power. Red, closed.</p><p>It`s a gauge even the federal government monitors in judging disaster recovery.</p><p>Amy Leftis has owned the Pan American Pancake House for 35 years. She has been through tough storms and is monitoring the Florence. She, like so many other business owners in Myrtle Beach, depends on the tourism dollars from nearly 19 million visitors who come annually.</p><p>AMY LEFTIS, PAN AMERICAN PANCAKE HOUSE OWNER: Financially, it makes it difficult for everyone. Not just the business owners but all the employees. They are not making a living either. You know, so the evacuation is definitely hurting the whole Myrtle Beach.</p><p>BREWER: She says the decision to stay open gives her an opportunity with the locals. Many public stores stayed open until mid afternoon for those picking up last minute supplies, those intent on riding out the storm.</p><p>SUSAN COHEN, MYRTLE BEACH RESIDENT: I`m prepared to house people, any dogs for six to eight weeks.</p><p>BREWER: Shelters are open. But getting to them now is the challenge. The Wetmores got at lift with law enforcement and lucked out with a hotel room at the last minute.</p><p>Forecasters are warning of dangerous flooding with long-lasting rainfall and a storm surge as high as 13 feet. And authorities insist now is the time to hunker down and brace for the impact of Hurricane Florence.</p><p>In Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, I`m Contessa Brewer for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, the threat of the hurricane has also caused home builder stocks to fall. The concern is that catastrophic flooding could result in new home completions to be delayed to the fourth quarter from the third, and disruptions might also cause new order growth to slow in this current quarter.</p><p>So, as a result shares of PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) and Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) among others were all lower in today`s trading.</p><p>HERERA: The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits remains at the lowest level in nearly half a century. Initial claims dropped by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 204,000, providing more evidence that the labor market is at or near full employment.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And as we mentioned earlier in program, a key inflation gauge rose less than expected in August. The consumer price index increased just.2 percent last month. That followed that pull back in producer prices that we told you about yesterday. An increase in the cost of gas and rents were offset by declines in health care and apparel costs.</p><p>HERERA: And even as the economy strengthens, the financial crisis that started ten years ago remains fresh in investor`s minds. And that means many are always on the lookout for the next crisis.</p><p>And as Bob Pisani reports, it may come from an unexpected place.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Could a cyber-attack be the cause of the next financial crisis? The big question. Imagine this. A criminal gang or a state actor hack into a central bank or a custodial bank, or a clearing system used to settle stock or bond or derivative trades.</p><p>There`s not many of these firms. They are systemically important. The operations of one or more of the firms are dramatically disrupted to the point that the services are shut down. Key data is damaged or destroyed.</p><p>It`s difficult to replicate the services the firms provide. So the ripple effect, and other financials services firm. This could happen. On Wednesday, the depository trust and clearing corporation, which provides clearing and settlement for U.S. financial firms, released a report saying cyber threats may become the single most important near-term threat to financial stability.</p><p>That`s pretty serious. You know, everybody agrees the next financial crisis is not going to come in the same form as the old one. But figuring out where it could come from is hard. The credit guys say it`s going to be caused by excessive debt. The regulators say it could happen if we weaken the regulatory powers too much. The traders say fragmented markets and the rise of passive investing could cause a crisis.</p><p>Economists will talk about trade tensions and rising nationalism and threats to longstanding international alliances like NATO or the European Union. That could cause a crisis.</p><p>So, who is right? Maybe they`re all right. But a lot of people are taking this cyber-attack as a very real possibility and a real problem for the financial system.</p><p>A similar report by the way came out from the office financial research back in December. Saying a large scale cyber-attack could disrupt financial networks, threatening the entire system and the broader economy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to look at the upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>We begin with Dow component Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) which was upgraded to market perform from underperform at Northland Capital Markets. The analysts there cited the stock more than 20 percent pullback from its most recent highs. Price target now is $46. That stock rose more than 1 percent to $45.57.</p><p>Meanwhile, Snap was upgraded to hold from sell at Pivotal Research. The analyst cited the company`s long-term potential, saying it outweighs some of near term risks we`ve been hearing about lately. That price target is $9. But that stock finished right around that level today at $9.35.</p><p>HERERA: Wayfair was downgraded to neutral from buy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch. The analyst is forecasting a deceleration in growth and rising investment costs into next year. The price target is $160. The shares fell almost 1 percent to $148.04.</p><p>Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI (NASDAQ:TBUS)) saw its price target raised from to $140 from $125 at Argus Research. The analyst says initiatives used at its Olive Garden brad can be implemented at its other specialty restaurants. The rating remains a buy. The stock was up just a fraction to $118.85.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Still ahead, the FDA calls vaping an epidemic. But what exactly is vaping? And Juul?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Big tech has gotten the attention of the Federal Trade Commission. The agency is now holding a series of hearings to examine whether some well-known companies are in fact monopolies, and it comes as scrutiny from Washington grows.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more on that story for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Federal Trade Commission wants to take a look at whether changing technologies demand changing regulation.</p><p>The FTC holding two days of hearings on competition and consumer protection in the 21st century.</p><p>JOSEPH SIMONS, FTC CHAIRMAN: Today, our most significant and difficult consumer protection issues often revolve around the use and abuse of technological capabilities.</p><p>BOORSTIN: A series of panels examining whether the tech giants are monopolies. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) with its dominance of search, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with its 2 billion monthly users and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with its nearly trillion dollar market cap and transformation of retail landscape. All of these companies and their peers access to consumer data raising questions about whether data privacy needs to be regulated differently.</p><p>ED LEE, NEW YORK TIMES: Privacy is one aspect. And I think that`s something the FTC wants to look at closer at. I think, you know, they have always revised rules from time to time. This might be another moment to clamp down looking at what the E.U. has done with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). And they might -- the FTC might adopt similar rules or come closer to the E.U. has been thinking about privacy.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Today`s hearings come just after the Internet Association, the lobbying organization represents tech giants including Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), release suggestions for federal regulations around data privacy.</p><p>In her testimony on Capitol Hill, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg saying she believes regulation is inevitable. But that she hopes it`s down in a way that protects consumers while also enabling companies to continue to innovate and provide useful services to consumers.</p><p>LEE: The game now is how much can they participate in that decision making? Where will the lobbyist be able to get their way in to sort of help craft what those new rules will look like? They are going to accept it. The game is how much influence can they have over what that these new rules look like?</p><p>BOORSTIN: It`s not just the FTC and Congress looking closer. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reportedly preparing an investigation into social media companies for censorship, amid growing concern that the tech giants are biased against conservatives. The regulating impartiality has never done.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Walmart made a big push into ecommerce a couple years ago when it purchased jet.com. Now the world`s largest retailers wants to remake the shopping site and shift its focus.</p><p>Courtney Reagan explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Jet.com is getting a makeover. The site began as a low cold front retailer that allowed shoppers to pay with a debit card or waive returns to save money. While that`s still part of the offering, it`s no longer Jet`s main message. Two years after Walmart purchased the company for $3 billion, it`s making a renewed push for younger, more affluent city shoppers.</p><p>SIMON BELSHAM, JET.COM PRESIDET: We have refocused the business on the urban consumer. And it is a very customer-focused business that we are building. And we know that there is an opportunity to build something that`s very different from other people in other competitors in the city.</p><p>REAGAN: But reports suggest Jet`s traffic is declining, increasing the need to turn the tide.</p><p>To do that, Jet is adding products from popular brands like Nike (NYSE:NKE). Customers will also be able to buy from local businesses like Orwashers Bakery in New York City.</p><p>And in the Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), jet.com is promising faster grocery delivery options, taking a direct aim at its competitors, Whole Foods, Target (NYSE:TGT) and Fresh Direct. This allows Jet`s parent company Walmart to reach city shoppers it otherwise wouldn`t and get groceries delivered to them, an important part of Walmart`s growth strategy.</p><p>BELSHAM: Being part of the Walmart business gives us access to the scale which helps us with pricing and for the products for consumers, and also the infrastructure that we have that sits behind the business.</p><p>REAGAN: But questions remain whether Jet.com`s redesign will help Walmart in its ongoing competition with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Kroger`s same-store sales rise less than expected. And that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The nation`s largest supermarket operator blamed its overall revenue miss on the transition to new store layouts and a change in its product mix. Kroger (NYSE:KR) did top profit estimates but it did see its margins weaken as price cuts and higher freight cost pressured results. Kroger (NYSE:KR) shares were off nearly 10 percent today to $28.50.</p><p>Hershey`s is growing its snack portfolio. The maker of Reese`s Peanut Buttercups said it was buying Pirate brands from B&amp;G Foods for more than $400 million. Under the deal, Hershey`s will gain control over Pirate`s Booty Popcorn and Smart Puffs. Hershey`s shares were up a fraction today to $106.60.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"The New York Post\" is reporting that activist hedge fund HG Vora Capital has quietly amassed a stake in Caesars Entertainment with the intention of pushing the casino operator to sell itself. And as Caesar`s won`t consider a sell, then \"The Post\" says HG Vora would like it to sell significant assets. Shares of Caesars rose nearly 1 percent today to $10.45.</p><p>HERERA: Shares of Restoration Hardware spiked on news that the retailer`s CEO bought nearly 8,000 RH shares which translates to about $1 million worth of stock. RH shares finished up 3 percent to $135.28.</p><p>After the bell, Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) reported a drop in same store sales that improved from the previous quarter. The retailer initially planned to release results before the market opened but then postponed. Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) says it is still seeking ways to return to profitability. Shares initially rose in after hours but finished the regular day down 9 percent to $1.21.</p><p>And also after the bell, Adobe said stronger sales in its creative and document cloud divisions helped its earnings beat expectations. The company also gave upbeat revenue guidance for the current quarter.</p><p>Separately, CNBC is reporting that Adobe is in talks to buy a privately held cloud marketing software company in an effort to better compete with rivals Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). The report said Adobe could pay upwards of $1.5 billion. Adobe shares were volatile in the after-hours sessions but they finished the regular day up a fraction to $268.52.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yesterday, we told you about the concerns the FDA has raised about the growing use of e-cigarettes by minors. And today, we`re taking a closer look at Juul. This is the company that dominates this market with a valuation of about $16 billion.</p><p>Aditi Roy has our report tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s sleek, stylish and looks more like a USB device than a vaporizer. That`s just one reason why e-cigarette company Juul is so popular among teens.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Those are one of the more popular products that we sell here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, on my college campus, it`s really popular.</p><p>ROY: The FDA says teenage use of the product is so rampant, it`s become an epidemic.</p><p>SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FDA COMMISSIONER: There`s probably steps they could do to perhaps even shutdown their online sites. I`m not sure they`re going to be willing to do that. But we are willing to step in and remove these flavors from the market. We think they are one element of what`s making these products appealing to a youth.</p><p>ROY: Juul is one of five e-cigarette companies that have been ordered by the FDA to submit plans in the next two months how to discouraging teenage use of their products. In a statement responding to the commissioners` remarks, the company says: Juul is intended for current adult smokers only. We cannot be more emphatic on this point. No minor or non-nicotine user should ever try Juul.</p><p>Its founders have said they started the company to get people to quit smoking.</p><p>JAMES MONSEES, JUUL CO-FOUNDER: But we had always intended to build this company around the idea of making cigarettes obsolete.</p><p>ROY: Colorful pods and flavors like mango and cream, Juul`s users include non-cigarette smokers.</p><p>Since the company spun off more than a year ago, its growth has skyrocketed. Juul now owns 72 percent of the market. Sales have increased 800 percent in the last year. And the company is valued at more than $16 billion.</p><p>But critics say the company`s success rides on the youngest users. Its early slick social media ads seem to target young people. Juul has since replaced those ads, but the craze among youth remains.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s definitely are more popular among the youth.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My nephew is in junior high right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Silas (ph)?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And he told me about Juul before I had to hear about Juul.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you serious?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. That`s what kids are doing.</p><p>ROY: Unlike traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes don`t burn tobacco. Instead, they have cartridges filled with nicotine making parents like Laura Bishop Bass worry.</p><p>LAURA BISHOP BASS, AUSTIN, TEXAS: I have a 22-year-old daughter and a lot of her friends are using these products. And I`m warning them that there again you are going to be addicted to this tobacco.</p><p>ROY: Experts tell us some of the side health effects of nicotine among youth include asthma and there is evidence linking it to lung disease. The FDA says it will soon release data on the growing use of e-cigarettes among teenagers and the agency could order companies to change their sales and marketing practices.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, the world`s richest man is spending billions to give back.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: General Motors (NYSE:GM) is recalling one million pickup trucks and SUVs that could suffer from a steering malfunction. The automaker has identified 30 crashes and two injuries connected to this defect, says there has been no deaths though. The recall covers certain Chevy Silverado 1500 and GMC 1500 pickups, as well as the Chevy Tahoe, Suburban, GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalades from the 2015 model year.</p><p>HERERA: The CEO of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world`s richest man and now he`s announcing the creation of a multibillion-dollar charitable fund and outlining his philanthropic plan.</p><p>Robert Frank has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The world`s richest man is giving away more of his money. Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie are launching a new philanthropic fund called the Day One Fund, with a $2 billion commitment. The fund which Bezos announced on Twitter will focus on two things, the homeless problem and education for preschoolers in need.</p><p>In the announcement, Bezos said the Day One Families Fund will work with existing non-profits to help homeless families and is modeled after the famous Mary`s Place non-profit in Seattle where Bezos lived and which has a rising homeless problem.</p><p>The Day One Academy`s Fund will launch and run scholarship Montessori-style preschools in underserved communities. Bezos wrote that he will use, quote, the same set of principles that have driven Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>The gift follows criticism about Bezos`s fortune now at $164 billion compared with the low pay for some Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) employees. And it comes after increased scrutiny of his philanthropy. He hasn`t signed the giving pledge, and until this announcement, he had given away less than $170 million.</p><p>This month, he announced a gift of $10 million to super PAC that helps elect military vets to Congress. And last year, he gave $33 million to a scholarship fund for the Dreamers.</p><p>Bezos solicited ideas on Twitter last summer for his philanthropy and tweeted, quote, it feels me with gratitude and optimism to be part of species so bent on self-improvement.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And that`s it for us tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth.

The Dow rises for eight straight sessions for the first time in more than a year, crawling ever closer to all-time highs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Deadline looms. The UAW and GM are locked in intense negotiations. The union scandal complicates things as workers get ready to walk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: Bad news for borrowers. Mortgage rates saw their biggest one- week rise in three years and it maybe just the beginning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, September 13th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>The Dow`s rise isn`t flashy but it is there. The blue chip index was up for eight straight sessions. Investors have been in a better mood, primarily because of trade relations with China and a report today that China will exempt some U.S. agricultural products from additional tariffs. That lifted shares of trade sensitive names like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) and it put the Dow within striking distance of new highs.</p><p>At the close, the Dow gained 37 points to 27,291, the Nasdaq fell 17, and S&amp;P 500 was down two. All of the major indexes were higher for the third straight week.</p><p>Bob Pisani takes a closer look at what`s driving the mechanic and why next week could be decisive for Wall Street.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stakes made a modest run of record highs but fell short on this Friday the 13th. The Dow still riding the impressive eight-day win streak. All three major averages up for a third week in a row.</p><p>Four big drivers behind this rally better: U.S.-China trade headlines, lower geopolitical tensions, expectations of more rate cuts from global central banks and a strong U.S. consumer.</p><p>All this retail sales beat estimates and the consumer sentiment rose more than expected, it`s clear the U.S. consumer is the key bright spot in the global economy, that`s why you saw economically sensitive cyclical sectors like banks and transports all leading the charge this week and up again today.</p><p>Big moves in the bond market, by the way. The U.S. 10-year treasury yield seeing its biggest weekly surge since 2016. That move lifted all the regional banks like Comerica (NYSE:CMA) and SunTrust, all up seven to ten percent each. Bond yields bottomed last Wednesday, no surprise that was the bottom for the stock market.</p><p>But investors are treading with caution, ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting next week because they`re worried the stronger data might make the Fed less inclined to keep cutting rates. So, right now, the markets are pricing in roughly 90 percent chance of a quarter point rate cut, about 10 percent odds of the Fed standing pat.</p><p>There`s no shortage of other potential market movers next week. Earnings from FedEx (NYSE:FDX), General Mills (NYSE:GIS), Darden, along with data on industrial production and on housing.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) weighed on the market today and its market value fell back below a trillion dollars after a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst dropped his price target on the stock, saying that Apple`s planned to bundle its newest iPhone with a free year of its streaming video service will harm hardware margins and have a material negative impact on earnings.</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) disputed that call late this afternoon, saying, quote: We do not expect the introduction of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV Plus, including the accounting treatment for the service, to have a material impact on our financial results.</p><p>Nevertheless, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares fell about 2 percent in trade today.</p><p>And very late today, we learned that Disney (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger has resigned from Apple`s board. No reason was given, but as you know, Disney (NYSE:DIS) is also launching a streaming video service to be called Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus.</p><p>HERERA: Well, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other tech companies are being targeted by a House panel. Lawmakers made a public demand for documents and sent letters directly to CEOs as it deepens its investigation into big tech`s power and potential anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>Ylan Mui is in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The House Judiciary Committee is requesting a detailed list of documents from big tech companies, including emails and communications from their top executives. In letter sent directly to the CEOs of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet, lawmakers said they`re interested in competition and digital markets where their dominant firms are engaged in anti-competitive behavior online and whether existing laws and enforcement measures are adequate.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (D-GA): You cannot have a conversation concerning the competitive nature or the size dominance of a Alphabet or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) who the parent company of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) without having also the same concerns because the amount of information that they store and actually keep.</p><p>MUI: Lawmakers called this a milestone in the committee`s bipartisan antitrust investigation, and they asked for some very specific information from each company. They`re especially interested in acquisitions. For Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), that means handing over documents related to Instagram, WhatsApp, Onavo. For Alphabet, it`s DoubleClick, AdMob and YouTube. On Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), they`re looking for information on search algorithms and the pricing for Prime. And for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), lawmakers are focused on why certain apps were removed from the App Store.</p><p>The committee is also seeking any documents that companies have turned over to the Department of Justice and the FTC as part of those antitrust investigations. But today, FTC chairman Joseph Simons said big doesn`t always mean bad.</p><p>JOSEPH SIMONS, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN: On the other hand, though, if they are big and successful because they engage in any competitive conduct, then we want to do something about it.</p><p>MUI: On Capitol Hill, lawmakers said they won`t prejudge the outcome of their investigation and that they`re still on a fact-finding mission.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The Trump administration apparently has plans to unveil a new tax cut plan by the middle of next year. White House adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters today that the plan which he dubbed tax cut 2.0, he said it would be aimed at the middle class, but he did not offer any details beyond that. Earlier this week, recall the president rejected a proposal to index the capital gains tax for inflation saying it would benefit wealthy investors too much.</p><p>HERERA: Health care was a major focus at last night`s Democratic debate in Houston. The candidates clashed over how the system should be revamped, making it the most divisive issue of the campaign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think that Obamacare worked. I think the way we add to it, replace everything that has been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one.</p><p>Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are. My plan for healthcare cost a lot of money. It costs $740 billion. It doesn`t cost $30 trillion.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Status quo over 10 years will be $50 trillion. Every study done shows that Medicare for All is the most cost effective approach to providing health care to every man woman and child in this country.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: On Medicare-for-All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations. But for hardworking families across this country, costs are going to go down and that`s how it should work.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What I favor is something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning and that is a public option, a nonprofit choice that will bring down the cost of insurance cover 12 million more people and bring down the prices for 13 million more people. That is a bold idea.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with the ACA. I proposed Medicare-for-All who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we make it available for the American people.</p><p>And if we`re right as progressives that that public alternative is better, then the American people will figure that out for themselves. I trust the American people to make the right choice for them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: The major health insurers all traded higher in today`s session.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Elsewhere, health experts today have given a thumbs-up to a treatment for children with life-threatening peanut allergies. Late this afternoon, an advisory committee for the FDA voted overwhelmingly in favor of a treatment from Aimmune Therapeutics that we told you about earlier this week.</p><p>Meg Tirrell is with us tonight to talk more about this vote and the treatment.</p><p>Remain us again how it works.</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: So, it`s interesting. We don`t actually refer to it necessarily as a drug because it`s made of peanut flour. So, the whole idea is that by giving small doses at the beginning, ramping them up over time, you can help patients increase their tolerance to peanuts so that they`re protected in case they get accidental peanut exposure.</p><p>HERERA: This was an advisory panel. When does the entire FDA vote on this particular treatment?</p><p>TIRRELL: Right. So this is just an outside panel of advisers to the FDA.</p><p>HERERA: Right.</p><p>TIRRELL: The agency usually follows their recommendations but it doesn`t have to. And so, the agency is set to decide by the end of January.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And cost could become an issue, right?</p><p>TIRRELL: That is the next question, of course. If it gets approval, what will it cost? And the company is called Aimmune Therapeutics, they`ve kind of put out some guidelines where they`re looking maybe between $3,000 and $20,000 a year as the broad range. So it sounds like it`ll be several thousand dollars.</p><p>GRIFFETH: For peanut powder?</p><p>TIRRELL: For very highly regulated peanut powder that`s gone through the FDA approval process, but it`s not just the treatment that patients are going to have to take. It sounds like the FDA might require that they have prescriptions for EpiPens or other epinephrine auto-injectors that go along with this because of the risk for allergic reaction to the product itself.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Very good.</p><p>Meg Tirrell, thanks for staying late for us tonight.</p><p>TIRRELL: Of course.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Appreciate it.</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Southwest was upgraded to outperform from neutral at Macquarie. The analyst there cites the airline`s competitive management team. The price target is $67. The stock rose about one and a half percent to $55.79.</p><p>Etsy was upgraded to outperform from neutral at Wedbush. The analyst cites new initiatives that could drive margin expansion. The price target is $66. The shares rose more than three percent to $56.86.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) was upgraded to buy from neutral at Citi. The analyst says that same store sales momentum should drive that company`s growth going forward. Price target, $188. That stock was up 1 percent to $157 even.</p><p>Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM) was downgraded to hold from by at Loop Capital. The analyst cited expectations for subdued growth. Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM) as you know is among the tech giants affected by the U.S.-China trade war. Price target: $310. That stock was down more than 3 percent today to $290.32.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, our market monitor has some real estate-related names that he says are worth investing in.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: We mentioned today`s strong economic reports bit earlier in our program, but here are some more details, retail sales rose 0.4 percent, which was more than expected. Most of that came from purchases of new autos and building supplies. Economists say the spending is being driven by the strong job market and rising wages.</p><p>A separate report from the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment also rose a bit more than expected. However, while consumers felt more confident, they are also worried about the impact of tariffs.</p><p>GRIFFETH: It was just a few weeks ago, wasn`t it, that mortgage rate seemed to be dropping like a rock. But tonight, we have some bad news for borrowers. They started rising again. In fact, this was the biggest weekly gain for mortgage rates in three years.</p><p>Diana Olick has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If you were hoping to refinance your mortgage at rock-bottom rates, you just missed the boat. The average rate on the -year fixed is now basis points higher than it was on Monday and 36 basis points higher than its last low on September 4th, that according to \"Mortgage News Daily\". And that is the biggest short- term jump since the week following the election of President Trump. That is the bad news for borrowers.</p><p>The good news is that rates are still incredibly low, and in the weeks before this turnaround, rates had fallen to the lowest level in three years. August was actually the best month for mortgage rate drops and 2019 has been the best year since 2011.</p><p>So, it begs the question, is this a short-term correction from those recent lows or a new shift toward rising rates?</p><p>Matthew Graham of \"Mortgage News Daily\" said: That`s a risk worth considering. Any time rates have been moving lower at the best pace in decades for 10 straight months. He said a move even lower would have to be driven by a big deterioration in global economies.</p><p>While rates are still historically low, so many borrowers have already refinanced that the pool of those who could benefit is extremely limited and sensitive.</p><p>When rates dip to their recent low, the number of borrowers with good credit scores who could save on a refinance surged to the largest on record, $11.7 million, according to Black Knight. That has now dipped back by about $2 million, more proof that you can`t time the mortgage market.</p><p>For a NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Sticking with real estate, it`s time now with -- for our weekly market monitor who is investing in real estate investment trusts, otherwise known as REITs. The last time he was with us, he recommended Prologis, Invitation Homes, each up more than 20 percent, and Simon Property, which is down about 10 percent.</p><p>Jeung Hyen is with us, or Hyun, I`m sorry. He`s portfolio manager at Atalanta Capital Management.</p><p>Welcome back. Nice to have you here.</p><p>JEUNG HYUN, ADELANTE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Great. Thanks for having me back.</p><p>HERERA: And you still like real estate and you think it`s going to do well near-term.</p><p>HYUN: Absolutely, near and short-term. I mean, near and longer-term.</p><p>HERERA: Longer-term.</p><p>Let`s get to your first pick and it is Americold Realty Trust. Why do you like it?</p><p>HYUN: Americold is the only publicly traded REIT that focuses on temperature control warehouses, strong food industry fundamentals, as well as a growing consumer preference for fresh but perishable foods should continue to drive demand. We also think Americold is going to be a consolidator in what is a fragmented industry.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Next, I guess it`s a vote on Hawaii. The Hawaiian (NASDAQ:HA) real estate investment trust Alexander &amp; Baldwin (NYSE:ALEX), it`s got a yield of 3.09 percent. Why do you like this one?</p><p>HYUN: Alexander &amp; Baldwin`s a local sharpshooter that owns a diversified portfolio commercial real estate in Hawaii where the economy is doing great. I do want to point out that about two-thirds the portfolio is grocery anchored shopping centers, but we`re comfortable with that exposure because of, one, grocery component and, two, because it just costs more and takes longer for e-tailers to ship their goods to Hawaii.</p><p>HERERA: And we finish up with Invitation Homes. The dividend is just under 2 percent, but you make the point that it is the largest single family rental REIT in the U.S., and it`s in an awful lot of markets.</p><p>HYUN: Yes. This has been our pick for three years in a row. So, the thesis is still intact. The household formation in Invitation`s markets which is mostly Sun Belt states and the West Coast is two times the national average. But the supply of affordable homes does not kept pace with that, that`s the reason why an average tenant stays for more than three years in an Invitation Home.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The Fed is widely expected to cut rates again next week. Is that good or bad for real estate investment trust right now?</p><p>HYUN: I think investors and your viewers should focus more on what`s happening on the long end of the yield curve, what`s happening with the yield on the 10-year, and that`s been going up, which could potentially pressure REITs. In the long run, an improving economy should help everybody, including the landlords.</p><p>I do want to point out that the total return for REITs in the past ten years has been identical to that of the S&amp;P 500 index, which is around 13 percent per year, despite whatever`s been happening with the Fed policy and longer-term interest rates.</p><p>HERERA: That is a good fact.</p><p>Thank you so much, Jeung. Nice to have you with us.</p><p>HYUN: Great, thanks for having me back.</p><p>HERERA: Jeung is with Adelante Capital Management.</p><p>GRIFFETH: PG&amp;E reaches another settlement and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with California`s largest power provider agreeing to an $11 billion settlement to resolve about 85 percent of the insurance claims related to those massive wildfires back in 2017 and `18. The utility which is in the midst of a bankruptcy reorganization reached a billion dollar settlement with other entities back in June. That stock rallied about 11 percent today to $11.18.</p><p>Tyson shares were up today after China said it`s going to exempt U.S. pork from future tariffs. The meat processors pork unit accounts for about 12 percent of its annual sales. That stock was up about 2 percent to $85.17.</p><p>And the FDA said today that some medicines, including Sanofi`s popular heartburn treatment Zantac contained low levels of a probable cancer- causing chemical. That chemical in question is the same one found in a blood pressure medicine that led to recalls last year. Drug safety officials in the U.S. and Europe say they aren`t looking into this issue right now. Shares of the company we`re down a fraction to $43.71.</p><p>HERERA: CloudFlare debuted on Wall Street, opening at $18 a share. The web security company priced its IPO at $15 per share, and one of its co- founders says there is plenty of room for it in the crowded cloud industry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHELLE ZATLYN, CLOUDFLARE CO-FOUNDER: We have this vision of platters and service that customers are choosing to help make sure that their Internet applications are fast, that they`re safe and that they`re reliable around the world. And so, having other players in the market is great but we work alongside all those and custom companies use us together and I think that we`re just getting started.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: Shares soared 20 percent to $18 even.</p><p>UPS must pay about $8.5 million to settle allegations that the company overcharged the federal government for package deliveries. The Justice Department alleges that UPS failed to abide by the terms of its contract with the General Services Administration and overcharged for services from 2007 to 2014. The shares were up a fraction to $122.67.</p><p>Shares of Altria fell on a report from CNBC that Juul`s valuation is, quote, coming down sharply. Altria has a 35 percent stake in the e- cigarette company. According to that report, Altria invested in Juul at about $250 per share in the private market. It has now valued 20 percent lower in a range between $225 to $230.</p><p>Altria struck stock dropped more than 3-1/2 percent to finish at $42.01.</p><p>GRIFFETH: This weekend is a critical one for the United Auto Workers and for General Motors (NYSE:GM). The union`s contract expires late Saturday night. And while the UAW today did agree to temporary labor contract extensions with Ford and with FiatChrysler, GM still faces that deadline, and its leadership is leading negotiations even as a federal corruption probe expands and includes more arrests.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: These are contentious times for the UAW and General Motors (NYSE:GM), both sides believe they should get a better deal in the next labor contract. GM wants you UAW members to pay a greater percentage of their healthcare costs, and allow more flexibility on jobs. Meanwhile, the union wants pay raises and more jobs added in the U.S.</p><p>A particular sticking point, GM`s idling of four plants including one in Lordstown, Ohio. That move has drawn the ire of President Trump who is pushing the company to add more jobs.</p><p>Overshadowing these talks is the growing investigation of UAW leaders either convicted or accused of spending millions of dollars on themselves. The most recent criminal complaint in the case is raising fresh questions about UAW president Gary Jones and former union boss Dennis Williams.</p><p>How that investigation influences the feelings of rank-and-file members is anyone`s guess. If they vote to strike, GM dealers have plenty of inventory and sales are unlikely to be impacted.</p><p>It`s been more than 30 years since the last extended strike at a U.S. automaker, and for now, nobody`s expecting another one. But that could change if auto workers walk off the job this weekend.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Ford is recalling more than 300,000 of its 2017 Ford Explorer vehicles because of a sharp seat frame edge. The automaker says there have been 31 reports of hand injuries. The vehicles were made at a Chicago plant from February of 2016 to October of 2017.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, a controversial way to purchase pets.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RAHEL SOLOMON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For many, pets are more than just furry friends, they`re family. But what a Fido or Teddy Bear could be repossessed just like a car?</p><p>Coming up, what you need to know about the industry of pet leasing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: WeWork is one of this year`s widely anticipated IPOs, but it`s been struggling as of late. Its valuation targets have been falling and according to CNBC could come in below $15 billion. Its private valuation was as high as $47 billion.</p><p>In a filing today, the shared office space company says it plans to make a number of governance changes, which include curtailing the founder`s voting power. The company also eliminated a provision that would have allowed the founder`s wife to lead the search for the successor if ever that time arose. WeWork hopes that such moves will help drum up demand from investors.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Americans spent more than $2 billion purchasing pets last year, but half a dozen states around the country are now cracking down on a controversial payment arrangement for pets that some call predatory. It`s called pet leasing. Supporters say as long as there`s full transparency, what`s the problem?</p><p>But as Rahel Solomon reports now critics argue that a growing number of customers have no idea what a pet lease is or that they`re even signing one bringing.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>SOLOMON: -- Scott and MalteseChase.</p><p>PATTY SMITH, CHASES`S OWNER: Scott fell in love with him as soon as they took him out of the cage and put him in his lap.</p><p>SOLOMON: They bought Chase in June 2018 from Breeders Club of America in Middletown, New Jersey. They negotiated a price, handed over their debit card and prepared to leave, except they were told their card didn`t work.</p><p>SCOTT SMITH, CHASE`S OWNER: And they said, well, why don`t you just finance the dog?</p><p>SOLOMON: The Smiths agreed and signed the contract, planning to pay off the balance right away. But when the bill came their puppy love quickly turned to buyer`s remorse. The financing was actually a pet lease, meaning Chase didn`t belong to them until he was paid off in full.</p><p>According to the ASPCA, pet leases tend to be 18 months to three years long and usually require an additional final payment to keep the animal, in this case, $505.</p><p>JENNIE LINTZ, ASPCA DIRECTOR OF PUPPY HILL INITIATIVES: A dog that costs $2,000 could end up costing a consumer $7,000.</p><p>SOLOMON: If consumer doesn`t make their payments, the financing company can repossess the animal, just like a car.</p><p>LINTZ: We think that there used the threat of repossession unfortunately to basically squeeze as much money out of the consumer as they can.</p><p>SOLOMON: The lending companies associated with the Smith`s contract, Virginia-based My Pet Funding and California-based Monterey Financial declined repeated requests for comment, as did Breeders Club of America, although the store did say it stopped offering pet leases earlier this year.</p><p>The contract that was emailed to the Smith family emphasizes that the agreement is a lease, but the family says in the store, they were shown on an iPad only the areas where a signature is required.</p><p>I think their argument would be, we bolded it, we underlined it, it -- we couldn`t make it more clear. What would you say to that?</p><p>S. SMITH: Then why you didn`t tell me it was financed?</p><p>P. SMITH: Financed and we didn`t see that page?</p><p>SOLOMON: New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy just signed a law in August banning pet leasing, joining California, Indiana, Nevada, New York and Washington.</p><p>U.S. Senator Bob Menendez says the Federal Trade Commission needs to do more to protect consumers.</p><p>SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ): They should know what that ultimate payment is. They should know the terms and conditions. There should be absolute transparency as there is required under the Consumer Lending Act, and we want the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules that ultimately make that happen.</p><p>SOLOMON: After consulting with their lawyer, the Smiths decided not to pursue litigation and paid off Chase within weeks of buying him. And while they agree you can`t put a price on love --</p><p>S. SMITH: Every once in a while, they tell him, he cost me X amount of dollars, but --</p><p>SOLOMON: The Smiths say they wish this love wasn`t so expensive, a whopping $1,200 more than they expected.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Rahel Solomon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: There are other companies, by the way, besides the two that Rahel mentioned that offers similar financing. And the ASPCA also points out, if the pet gets sick or dies while you`re still paying off the lease, the consumer is still on the hook for the money.</p><p>HERERA: Here`s another look at the day on Wall Street. The Dow gained 37 points, the Nasdaq fell 17, the S&amp;P 500 was down two. And it was the third week of gains for all of the major indexes. A good way to go into the weekend.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Indeed.</p><p>HERERA: That`s it for us tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a great weekend, everybody.

The Dow rises  for eight straight sessions for the first time in more than a year,  crawling ever closer to all-time highs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Deadline looms.  The UAW and  GM are locked in intense negotiations.  The union scandal complicates  things as workers get ready to walk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  Bad news for borrowers.  Mortgage rates saw their biggest one- week rise in three years and it maybe just the beginning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday,  September 13th.</p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>The Dow`s rise isn`t flashy but it is there.  The blue chip index was up  for eight straight sessions.  Investors have been in a better mood,  primarily because of trade relations with China and a report today that  China will exempt some U.S. agricultural products from additional tariffs.   That lifted shares of trade sensitive names like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and  Boeing (NYSE:BA) and it put the Dow within striking distance of new highs.</p><p>At the close, the Dow gained 37 points to 27,291, the Nasdaq fell 17, and  S&amp;P 500 was down two.  All of the major indexes were higher for the third  straight week.</p><p>Bob Pisani takes a closer look at what`s driving the mechanic and why next  week could be decisive for Wall Street.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stakes made a modest  run of record highs but fell short on this Friday the 13th.  The Dow still  riding the impressive eight-day win streak.  All three major averages up  for a third week in a row.</p><p>Four big drivers behind this rally better: U.S.-China trade headlines,  lower geopolitical tensions, expectations of more rate cuts from global  central banks and a strong U.S. consumer.</p><p>All this retail sales beat estimates and the consumer sentiment rose more  than expected, it`s clear the U.S. consumer is the key bright spot in the  global economy, that`s why you saw economically sensitive cyclical sectors  like banks and transports all leading the charge this week and up again  today.</p><p>Big moves in the bond market, by the way.  The U.S. 10-year treasury yield  seeing its biggest weekly surge since 2016.  That move lifted all the  regional banks like Comerica (NYSE:CMA) and SunTrust, all up seven to ten  percent each.  Bond yields bottomed last Wednesday, no surprise that was  the bottom for the stock market.</p><p>But investors are treading with caution, ahead of the Federal Reserve  meeting next week because they`re worried the stronger data might make the  Fed less inclined to keep cutting rates.  So, right now, the markets are  pricing in roughly 90 percent chance of a quarter point rate cut, about 10  percent odds of the Fed standing pat.</p><p>There`s no shortage of other potential market movers next week.  Earnings  from FedEx (NYSE:FDX), General Mills (NYSE:GIS), Darden, along with data on  industrial production and on housing.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) weighed on the market today and  its market value fell back below a trillion dollars after a Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS) analyst dropped his price target on the stock, saying that  Apple`s planned to bundle its newest iPhone with a free year of its  streaming video service will harm hardware margins and have a material  negative impact on earnings.</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) disputed that call late this afternoon, saying, quote:  We do not expect the introduction of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV Plus,  including the accounting treatment for the service, to have a material  impact on our financial results.</p><p>Nevertheless, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares fell about 2 percent in trade  today.</p><p>And very late today, we learned that Disney (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger has  resigned from Apple`s board.  No reason was given, but as you know, Disney  (NYSE:DIS) is also launching a streaming video service to be called Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Plus.</p><p>HERERA:  Well, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other tech companies are being  targeted by a House panel.  Lawmakers made a public demand for documents  and sent letters directly to CEOs as it deepens its investigation into big  tech`s power and potential anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>Ylan Mui is in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The House Judiciary  Committee is requesting a detailed list of documents from big tech  companies, including emails and communications from their top executives.   In letter sent directly to the CEOs of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet, lawmakers said they`re  interested in competition and digital markets where their dominant firms  are engaged in anti-competitive behavior online and whether existing laws  and enforcement measures are adequate.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (D-GA):  You cannot have a conversation concerning the  competitive nature or the size dominance of a Alphabet or Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) who the parent company of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or a Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) or an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) without  having also the same concerns because the amount of information that they  store and actually keep.</p><p>MUI:  Lawmakers called this a milestone in the committee`s bipartisan  antitrust investigation, and they asked for some very specific information  from each company.  They`re especially interested in acquisitions.  For  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), that means handing over documents related to  Instagram, WhatsApp, Onavo.  For Alphabet, it`s DoubleClick, AdMob and  YouTube.  On Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), they`re looking for information on  search algorithms and the pricing for Prime.  And for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  lawmakers are focused on why certain apps were removed from the App Store.</p><p>The committee is also seeking any documents that companies have turned over  to the Department of Justice and the FTC as part of those antitrust  investigations.  But today, FTC chairman Joseph Simons said big doesn`t  always mean bad.</p><p>JOSEPH SIMONS, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN:  On the other hand,  though, if they are big and successful because they engage in any  competitive conduct, then we want to do something about it.</p><p>MUI:  On Capitol Hill, lawmakers said they won`t prejudge the outcome of  their investigation and that they`re still on a fact-finding mission.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The Trump administration apparently has plans to unveil a new  tax cut plan by the middle of next year.  White House adviser Larry Kudlow  told reporters today that the plan which he dubbed tax cut 2.0, he said it  would be aimed at the middle class, but he did not offer any details beyond  that.  Earlier this week, recall the president rejected a proposal to index  the capital gains tax for inflation saying it would benefit wealthy  investors too much.</p><p>HERERA:  Health care was a major focus at last night`s Democratic debate in  Houston.  The candidates clashed over how the system should be revamped,  making it the most divisive issue of the campaign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think that Obamacare worked.  I  think the way we add to it, replace everything that has been cut, add a  public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable  insurance, number one.</p><p>Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what  costs are.  My plan for healthcare cost a lot of money.  It costs $740  billion.  It doesn`t cost $30 trillion.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Status quo over 10  years will be $50 trillion.  Every study done shows that Medicare for All  is the most cost effective approach to providing health care to every man  woman and child in this country.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  On Medicare-for-All,  costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to  go up for giant corporations.  But for hardworking families across this  country, costs are going to go down and that`s how it should work.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  What I favor is  something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning and  that is a public option, a nonprofit choice that will bring down the cost  of insurance cover 12 million more people and bring down the prices for 13  million more people.  That is a bold idea.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think we do have to go far  beyond tinkering with the ACA.  I proposed Medicare-for-All who want it.   We take a version of Medicare, we make it available for the American  people.</p><p>And if we`re right as progressives that that public alternative is better,  then the American people will figure that out for themselves.  I trust the  American people to make the right choice for them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The major health insurers all traded higher in today`s session.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, health experts today have given a thumbs-up to a  treatment for children with life-threatening peanut allergies.  Late this  afternoon, an advisory committee for the FDA voted overwhelmingly in favor  of a treatment from Aimmune Therapeutics that we told you about earlier  this week.</p><p>Meg Tirrell is with us tonight to talk more about this vote and the  treatment.</p><p>Remain us again how it works.</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  So, it`s interesting.   We don`t actually refer to it necessarily as a drug because it`s made of  peanut flour.  So, the whole idea is that by giving small doses at the  beginning, ramping them up over time, you can help patients increase their  tolerance to peanuts so that they`re protected in case they get accidental  peanut exposure.</p><p>HERERA:  This was an advisory panel.  When does the entire FDA vote on this  particular treatment?</p><p>TIRRELL:  Right.  So this is just an outside panel of advisers to the FDA.</p><p>HERERA:  Right.</p><p>TIRRELL:  The agency usually follows their recommendations but it doesn`t  have to.  And so, the agency is set to decide by the end of January.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And cost could become an issue, right?</p><p>TIRRELL:  That is the next question, of course.  If it gets approval, what  will it cost?  And the company is called Aimmune Therapeutics, they`ve kind  of put out some guidelines where they`re looking maybe between $3,000 and  $20,000 a year as the broad range.  So it sounds like it`ll be several  thousand dollars.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  For peanut powder?</p><p>TIRRELL:  For very highly regulated peanut powder that`s gone through the  FDA approval process, but it`s not just the treatment that patients are  going to have to take.  It sounds like the FDA might require that they have  prescriptions for EpiPens or other epinephrine auto-injectors that go along  with this because of the risk for allergic reaction to the product itself.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Very good.</p><p>Meg Tirrell, thanks for staying late for us tonight.</p><p>TIRRELL:  Of course.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Appreciate it.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and  Downgrades\".</p><p>Southwest was upgraded to outperform from neutral at Macquarie.  The  analyst there cites the airline`s competitive management team.  The price  target is $67.  The stock rose about one and a half percent to $55.79.</p><p>Etsy was upgraded to outperform from neutral at Wedbush.  The analyst cites  new initiatives that could drive margin expansion.  The price target is  $66.  The shares rose more than three percent to $56.86.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) was upgraded to buy from neutral  at Citi.  The analyst says that same store sales momentum should drive that  company`s growth going forward.  Price target, $188.  That stock was up 1  percent to $157 even.</p><p>Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM) was downgraded to hold from by at Loop Capital.  The  analyst cited expectations for subdued growth.  Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM) as  you know is among the tech giants affected by the U.S.-China trade war.   Price target: $310.  That stock was down more than 3 percent today to  $290.32.</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, our market monitor has some real estate-related names  that he says are worth investing in.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  We mentioned today`s strong economic reports bit earlier in our  program, but here are some more details, retail sales rose 0.4 percent,  which was more than expected.  Most of that came from purchases of new  autos and building supplies.  Economists say the spending is being driven  by the strong job market and rising wages.</p><p>A separate report from the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment  also rose a bit more than expected.  However, while consumers felt more  confident, they are also worried about the impact of tariffs.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  It was just a few weeks ago, wasn`t it, that mortgage rate  seemed to be dropping like a rock.  But tonight, we have some bad news for  borrowers.  They started rising again.  In fact, this was the biggest  weekly gain for mortgage rates in three years.</p><p>Diana Olick has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  If you were hoping to  refinance your mortgage at rock-bottom rates, you just missed the boat.   The average rate on the -year fixed is now basis points higher than it was  on Monday and 36 basis points higher than its last low on September 4th,  that according to \"Mortgage News Daily\".  And that is the biggest short- term jump since the week following the election of President Trump.  That  is the bad news for borrowers.</p><p>The good news is that rates are still incredibly low, and in the weeks  before this turnaround, rates had fallen to the lowest level in three  years.  August was actually the best month for mortgage rate drops and 2019  has been the best year since 2011.</p><p>So, it begs the question, is this a short-term correction from those recent  lows or a new shift toward rising rates?</p><p>Matthew Graham of \"Mortgage News Daily\" said: That`s a risk worth  considering.  Any time rates have been moving lower at the best pace in  decades for 10 straight months.  He said a move even lower would have to be  driven by a big deterioration in global economies.</p><p>While rates are still historically low, so many borrowers have already  refinanced that the pool of those who could benefit is extremely limited  and sensitive.</p><p>When rates dip to their recent low, the number of borrowers with good  credit scores who could save on a refinance surged to the largest on  record, $11.7 million, according to Black Knight.  That has now dipped back  by about $2 million, more proof that you can`t time the mortgage market.</p><p>For a NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Sticking with real estate, it`s time now with -- for our weekly  market monitor who is investing in real estate investment trusts, otherwise  known as REITs.  The last time he was with us, he recommended Prologis,  Invitation Homes, each up more than 20 percent, and Simon Property, which  is down about 10 percent.</p><p>Jeung Hyen is with us, or Hyun, I`m sorry.  He`s portfolio manager at  Atalanta Capital Management.</p><p>Welcome back.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>JEUNG HYUN, ADELANTE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Great.  Thanks  for having me back.</p><p>HERERA:  And you still like real estate and you think it`s going to do well  near-term.</p><p>HYUN:  Absolutely, near and short-term.  I mean, near and longer-term.</p><p>HERERA:  Longer-term.</p><p>Let`s get to your first pick and it is Americold Realty Trust.  Why do you  like it?</p><p>HYUN:  Americold is the only publicly traded REIT that focuses on  temperature control warehouses, strong food industry fundamentals, as well  as a growing consumer preference for fresh but perishable foods should  continue to drive demand.  We also think Americold is going to be a  consolidator in what is a fragmented industry.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Next, I guess it`s a vote on Hawaii.  The Hawaiian (NASDAQ:HA)  real estate investment trust Alexander &amp; Baldwin (NYSE:ALEX), it`s got a  yield of 3.09 percent.  Why do you like this one?</p><p>HYUN:  Alexander &amp; Baldwin`s a local sharpshooter that owns a diversified  portfolio commercial real estate in Hawaii where the economy is doing  great.  I do want to point out that about two-thirds the portfolio is  grocery anchored shopping centers, but we`re comfortable with that exposure  because of, one, grocery component and, two, because it just costs more and  takes longer for e-tailers to ship their goods to Hawaii.</p><p>HERERA:  And we finish up with Invitation Homes.  The dividend is just  under 2 percent, but you make the point that it is the largest single  family rental REIT in the U.S., and it`s in an awful lot of markets.</p><p>HYUN:  Yes.  This has been our pick for three years in a row.  So, the  thesis is still intact.  The household formation in Invitation`s markets  which is mostly Sun Belt states and the West Coast is two times the  national average.  But the supply of affordable homes does not kept pace  with that, that`s the reason why an average tenant stays for more than  three years in an Invitation Home.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The Fed is widely expected to cut rates again next week.  Is  that good or bad for real estate investment trust right now?</p><p>HYUN:  I think investors and your viewers should focus more on what`s  happening on the long end of the yield curve, what`s happening with the  yield on the 10-year, and that`s been going up, which could potentially  pressure REITs.  In the long run, an improving economy should help  everybody, including the landlords.</p><p>I do want to point out that the total return for REITs in the past ten  years has been identical to that of the S&amp;P 500 index, which is around 13  percent per year, despite whatever`s been happening with the Fed policy and  longer-term interest rates.</p><p>HERERA:  That is a good fact.</p><p>Thank you so much, Jeung.  Nice to have you with us.</p><p>HYUN:  Great, thanks for having me back.</p><p>HERERA:  Jeung is with Adelante Capital Management.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  PG&amp;E reaches another settlement and that is where we begin  tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with California`s largest power provider agreeing  to an $11 billion settlement to resolve about 85 percent of the insurance  claims related to those massive wildfires back in 2017 and `18.  The  utility which is in the midst of a bankruptcy reorganization reached a  billion dollar settlement with other entities back in June.  That stock  rallied about 11 percent today to $11.18.</p><p>Tyson shares were up today after China said it`s going to exempt U.S. pork  from future tariffs.  The meat processors pork unit accounts for about 12  percent of its annual sales.  That stock was up about 2 percent to $85.17.</p><p>And the FDA said today that some medicines, including Sanofi`s popular  heartburn treatment Zantac contained low levels of a probable cancer- causing chemical.  That chemical in question is the same one found in a  blood pressure medicine that led to recalls last year.  Drug safety  officials in the U.S. and Europe say they aren`t looking into this issue  right now.  Shares of the company we`re down a fraction to $43.71.</p><p>HERERA:  CloudFlare debuted on Wall Street, opening at $18 a share.  The  web security company priced its IPO at $15 per share, and one of its co- founders says there is plenty of room for it in the crowded cloud industry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHELLE ZATLYN, CLOUDFLARE CO-FOUNDER:  We have this vision of platters  and service that customers are choosing to help make sure that their  Internet applications are fast, that they`re safe and that they`re reliable  around the world.  And so, having other players in the market is great but  we work alongside all those and custom companies use us together and I  think that we`re just getting started.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  Shares soared 20 percent to $18 even.</p><p>UPS must pay about $8.5 million to settle allegations that the company  overcharged the federal government for package deliveries.  The Justice  Department alleges that UPS failed to abide by the terms of its contract  with the General Services Administration and overcharged for services from  2007 to 2014.  The shares were up a fraction to $122.67.</p><p>Shares of Altria fell on a report from CNBC that Juul`s valuation is,  quote, coming down sharply.  Altria has a 35 percent stake in the e- cigarette company.  According to that report, Altria invested in Juul at  about $250 per share in the private market.  It has now valued 20 percent  lower in a range between $225 to $230.</p><p>Altria struck stock dropped more than 3-1/2 percent to finish at $42.01.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  This weekend is a critical one for the United Auto Workers and  for General Motors (NYSE:GM).  The union`s contract expires late Saturday  night.  And while the UAW today did agree to temporary labor contract  extensions with Ford and with FiatChrysler, GM still faces that deadline,  and its leadership is leading negotiations even as a federal corruption  probe expands and includes more arrests.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  These are contentious  times for the UAW and General Motors (NYSE:GM), both sides believe they  should get a better deal in the next labor contract.  GM wants you UAW  members to pay a greater percentage of their healthcare costs, and allow  more flexibility on jobs.  Meanwhile, the union wants pay raises and more  jobs added in the U.S.</p><p>A particular sticking point, GM`s idling of four plants including one in  Lordstown, Ohio.  That move has drawn the ire of President Trump who is  pushing the company to add more jobs.</p><p>Overshadowing these talks is the growing investigation of UAW leaders  either convicted or accused of spending millions of dollars on themselves.   The most recent criminal complaint in the case is raising fresh questions  about UAW president Gary Jones and former union boss Dennis Williams.</p><p>How that investigation influences the feelings of rank-and-file members is  anyone`s guess.  If they vote to strike, GM dealers have plenty of  inventory and sales are unlikely to be impacted.</p><p>It`s been more than 30 years since the last extended strike at a U.S.  automaker, and for now, nobody`s expecting another one.  But that could  change if auto workers walk off the job this weekend.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Ford is recalling more than 300,000 of its 2017 Ford Explorer  vehicles because of a sharp seat frame edge.  The automaker says there have  been 31 reports of hand injuries.  The vehicles were made at a Chicago  plant from February of 2016 to October of 2017.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, a controversial way to purchase pets.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RAHEL SOLOMON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  For many, pets are  more than just furry friends, they`re family.  But what a Fido or Teddy  Bear could be repossessed just like a car?</p><p>Coming up, what you need to know about the industry of pet leasing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  WeWork is one of this year`s widely anticipated IPOs, but it`s  been struggling as of late.  Its valuation targets have been falling and  according to CNBC could come in below $15 billion.  Its private valuation  was as high as $47 billion.</p><p>In a filing today, the shared office space company says it plans to make a  number of governance changes, which include curtailing the founder`s voting  power.  The company also eliminated a provision that would have allowed the  founder`s wife to lead the search for the successor if ever that time  arose.  WeWork hopes that such moves will help drum up demand from  investors.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Americans spent more than $2 billion purchasing pets last year,  but half a dozen states around the country are now cracking down on a  controversial payment arrangement for pets that some call predatory.  It`s  called pet leasing.  Supporters say as long as there`s full transparency,  what`s the problem?</p><p>But as Rahel Solomon reports now critics argue that a growing number of  customers have no idea what a pet lease is or that they`re even signing one  bringing.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>SOLOMON:  -- Scott and MalteseChase.</p><p>PATTY SMITH, CHASES`S OWNER:  Scott fell in love with him as soon as they  took him out of the cage and put him in his lap.</p><p>SOLOMON:  They bought Chase in June 2018 from Breeders Club of America in  Middletown, New Jersey.  They negotiated a price, handed over their debit  card and prepared to leave, except they were told their card didn`t work.</p><p>SCOTT SMITH, CHASE`S OWNER:  And they said, well, why don`t you just  finance the dog?</p><p>SOLOMON:  The Smiths agreed and signed the contract, planning to pay off  the balance right away.  But when the bill came their puppy love quickly  turned to buyer`s remorse.  The financing was actually a pet lease, meaning  Chase didn`t belong to them until he was paid off in full.</p><p>According to the ASPCA, pet leases tend to be 18 months to three years long  and usually require an additional final payment to keep the animal, in this  case, $505.</p><p>JENNIE LINTZ, ASPCA DIRECTOR OF PUPPY HILL INITIATIVES:  A dog that costs  $2,000 could end up costing a consumer $7,000.</p><p>SOLOMON:  If consumer doesn`t make their payments, the financing company  can repossess the animal, just like a car.</p><p>LINTZ:  We think that there used the threat of repossession unfortunately  to basically squeeze as much money out of the consumer as they can.</p><p>SOLOMON:  The lending companies associated with the Smith`s contract,  Virginia-based My Pet Funding and California-based Monterey Financial  declined repeated requests for comment, as did Breeders Club of America,  although the store did say it stopped offering pet leases earlier this  year.</p><p>The contract that was emailed to the Smith family emphasizes that the  agreement is a lease, but the family says in the store, they were shown on  an iPad only the areas where a signature is required.</p><p>I think their argument would be, we bolded it, we underlined it, it -- we  couldn`t make it more clear.  What would you say to that?</p><p>S. SMITH:  Then why you didn`t tell me it was financed?</p><p>P. SMITH:  Financed and we didn`t see that page?</p><p>SOLOMON:  New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy just signed a law in August  banning pet leasing, joining California, Indiana, Nevada, New York and  Washington.</p><p>U.S. Senator Bob Menendez says the Federal Trade Commission needs to do  more to protect consumers.</p><p>SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ):  They should know what that ultimate payment is.   They should know the terms and conditions.  There should be absolute  transparency as there is required under the Consumer Lending Act, and we  want the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules that ultimately make that  happen.</p><p>SOLOMON:  After consulting with their lawyer, the Smiths decided not to  pursue litigation and paid off Chase within weeks of buying him.  And while  they agree you can`t put a price on love --</p><p>S. SMITH:  Every once in a while, they tell him, he cost me X amount of  dollars, but --</p><p>SOLOMON:  The Smiths say they wish this love wasn`t so expensive, a  whopping $1,200 more than they expected.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Rahel Solomon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  There are other companies, by the way, besides the two that  Rahel mentioned that offers similar financing.  And the ASPCA also points  out, if the pet gets sick or dies while you`re still paying off the lease,  the consumer is still on the hook for the money.</p><p>HERERA:  Here`s another look at the day on Wall Street.  The Dow gained 37  points, the Nasdaq fell 17, the S&amp;P 500 was down two.  And it was the third  week of gains for all of the major indexes.  A good way to go into the  weekend.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Indeed.</p><p>HERERA:  That`s it for us tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.  Have a great weekend, everybody.  See you  Monday.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The Dow nears a new high as investor sentiment rises and trade concerns take a backseat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Bringing up sales. It`s not even autumn yet, but already, forecast for holiday spending are spreading cheer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Smokin hot. Money is pouring into the marijuana stocks but will today`s hype be tomorrow`s buzzkill?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday September 19th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we do bid you good evening, everybody, and welcome.</p><p>After two days a pretty decent gains this week, the Dow suddenly finds itself close to an all-time high. The financial sector led the way higher today, getting a lift from the continued rise in interest rates. Tech stocks did not participate in today`s rally, giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) traded lower.</p><p>Here are the closing numbers for this day, the Dow advanced by 158 points to close at 158 points to close at 26,405, the Nasdaq fell by six, the S&amp;P added three.</p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look now at the Dow`s move toward new highs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s a sign that investors are coming to terms with the impact of the tariff wars or simply believe the U.S. economy and American companies are strong enough to withstand any trade pressures. After a lively two-day rally, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has pulled within 1 percent of its all-time high of 26,616, set nearly months ago.</p><p>The latest stage of the Dow advanced has been led by shares of big global industrial stocks such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), exactly the companies once considered most vulnerable to retaliation by China for us imposed tariffs on Chinese goods. The broader S&amp;P 500 made a record high just a few weeks ago, helped in recent months by the huge gains in its big tech stock components. The Dow though was the index hardest hit by ongoing worries over the effect of trade skirmishes on U.S. manufacturing exports.</p><p>Yet so far, analysts see only a marginal potential drag on orders and earnings as a result of the new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports that were made official this week. Stock markets in Asia have also bounced, perhaps an indication that investors had already anticipated and priced in some of the tariff risks.</p><p>Meantime, a rapid rise in treasury yields, another factor that seemed to spook the markets early this year and contributed to the sharp 10 percent correction in February is likewise being taken in stride. The 10-year yield is now climbed above 3 percent this week as the Federal Reserve likely prepares to lift interest rates next week and perhaps again in December.</p><p>This relief rally supporting today owes a lot to the consistently strong U.S. economic data and continued expectations for 20 percent earnings growth for a third straight quarter. The question for investors now as the Dow nears a full recovery is whether those economic tailwinds can carry this market into 2019 as the effect of the U.S. tax cut wanes and interest rates march higher.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So, let`s turn to our bull and our bear guests tonight for their opposing views on this market.</p><p>Jason Draho is the head of America`s asset allocation at UBS Global Wealth Management. He says that this bull market does indeed have more room to run.</p><p>Our bear tonight is Lamar Villere, portfolio manager at Villere &amp; Company, who sees some risks ahead for the market.</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome. Nice to have you with us.</p><p>Jason, I think Mike Santoli made some very interesting points at the end of his report, rising rates valuations that that seemed kind of rich by many, many standards. Why do you think that the market has more room to run?</p><p>JASON DRAHO, UBS GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT: It`s quite simple. It comes down to the economic fundamentals. As you alluded to it, your growth in the U.S. is very solid. There`s no reason to expect that to vanish anytime soon. And without any signs of recession risk certainly in the next 12 months, it`s hard to see the bull market coming to an end. It may not keep going in hires quickly but the fundamentals still very supportive.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Lamar, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said today that the great bull is dead, that we should expect a bear at some point and in part because the Fed is raising rates. There`s that long-held feeling that the Fed lowering rates over the last decade responsible for the great rally, now that they`re reversing course the stock market has to do the same.</p><p>Does that have a feeling of the same that you have for this bear market right now, coming do you feel?</p><p>LAMAR VILLERE, VILLERE &amp; COMPANY PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Sure, I do think that`s one of the catalysts that we`re concerned about. If you look at the fact that over the last several years, we`ve -- what we`ve seen is investors fleeing bonds because there`s just no yield there, and buying these high dividend paying stocks, in fact making some of these very sleepy slow growth stocks wildly outperformed their much faster growing peers. And for a while, you know, that -- from our perspective that didn`t make any sense. But you know if you`re sitting there trying to make some money for your retirement and you think the treasuries are paying 2 percent, you got to find a yield somewhere.</p><p>So, I think we`re a little concerned that there`s going to be a real reversal of that trade and people move back into bonds.</p><p>HERERA: Jason, what are the things you watch as the bull market monitor, which is correlated to economic expansion? There are those who would push back on that and say if you look at history, just because the economy is good doesn`t always mean that the stock market is going to be good. What`s your response to that?</p><p>DRAHO: It`s true that the correlation between economic growth and the stock market is actually quite low on a year-to-year basis, but if you`re looking about the bull market ending or bear market starting, it`s really hard to have that happen unless there`s a recession. And the economic fundamentals just suggest that`s not the case. Growth is very good. It`s likely continue.</p><p>And I do agree that I think rising traits are concerned, but buying historical measures and relative to the strength of the economy interest rates are still low and the Feds going to raise rates and that will become a concern. I think that becomes a concern not until late next year and really 2020. There`s still definitely room for this to kind of continue on before I think those become material risks for the bull market.</p><p>GRIFFETH: What would you buy here, Jason? What`s going to take us higher?</p><p>DRAHO: So, the performance today is interesting. Financials did well, tech didn`t. We`ve been of the view that value stocks should perform well in this environment of good growth, rising rates, rising inflation. If this continues, and if the fears have sort of kind of a growth slowdown because of trade concerns have actually abated, that should be an environment that would support value stocks like financials, like energy. So that`s one area that we`ve been looking to buy.</p><p>HERERA: And I guess the same question on the other side of the coin for you, Lamar. How would you be hedging your bets if indeed, we are going into a more negative cycle for the stock market?</p><p>VILLERE: So, there`s definitely securities you can buy individual names like we buy individual stocks that that might actually perform better in a rising interest rate environment. One of the ones we`ve been buying is Progressive (NYSE:PGR). That`s a situation where rising interest rates actually help them to do better with their invested assets. So there are securities where you can or you can really negate that risk.</p><p>HERERA: Jason, Lamar, thank you so much for joining us for our bull/bear debate tonight.</p><p>Bill?</p><p>GRIFFETH: Elsewhere in other news today, the head of the Chamber of Commerce said today that the White House can still avoid an all-out global trade war at this point. The business group called it the biggest threat facing the economy right now and it`s urging the administration to seal a trilateral lateral NAFTA deal and make progress with Europe on its trade issues. It also wants the U.S. to talk with China rather than resorting to trade retaliation.</p><p>HERERA: But the relationship between the U.S. and China may already be starting to sour. In an interview with the Chinese publication, Alibaba`s Jack Ma backed down from a promise to bring million jobs to the U.S., citing those ongoing trade conflicts between the U.S. and China.</p><p>Ma said, quote, the promise was made on the premise of friendly U.S.-China partnership and rational trade relations that premise no longer exists today, and so, our promise cannot be fulfilled, end quote.</p><p>And in fact today, China`s second-in-command had some harsh words about the rise of protectionism in some parts of the world. Eunice Yoon is in Beijing for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: China`s Premier Li Keqiang spoke at the World Economic Forum in the port city of Tianjin today. He didn`t directly address the escalating trade war with the United States or even mentioned President Trump`s name.</p><p>Instead, he referenced concerns of rising protectionism and repeated China`s promises to open up the economy and give foreign investors fair treatment. On the currency, Li said China would not actively weaken the Yuan to help exporters or engage in competitive currency devaluations, but would keep the Yuan stable.</p><p>What was also missing in the speech was any recognition of China`s contribution to the rising protectionism among its trading partners. The state media had its typical strident response saying China will outlast the tariff war, emerge stronger and it`s not afraid of President Trump`s what they called extreme measures.</p><p>One commentary in the communist party run \"People`s Daily\" argue that President Trump`s trade action doesn`t necessarily impede China`s own economic agenda. \"The People`s Daily\" said: China will instead use the trade dispute as an opportunity to replace imports promote localization or develop export-oriented advanced manufacturing.</p><p>What often gets lost in who wins or loses a trade war is that a big part of China`s made in China 2025 strategy is to develop homegrown technology so China can rely less on foreign technology and other industries. So, that`s what the piece is highlighting that China could be better off in the long run because it wants to develop its own technologies of the future.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Meantime, trade talks with Canada resumed today in Washington, talks that U.S. officials want to see completed by the end of the month.</p><p>Ylan Mui has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Top trade officials from the U.S. and Canada are back in Washington hoping to nail down a deal on NAFTA. Canada`s foreign minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters that the talks have been constructive but more work needs to be done.</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: We are a country that is good at finding compromises, and that`s the talent our negotiators certainly demonstrate. At the same time, our core objective today and this has been the case from the very beginning, is to defend the national interest and that is what we are going to continue to do.</p><p>MUI: October 1st is the deadline for negotiators to produce the written text of a formal deal, and it`s unclear if they`ll be able to pull that off if they don`t reach an agreement in principle by the end of this week. The deadline is designed to give Congress plenty of time to review the deal. Lawmakers must vote to accept any trade agreement and some of them are getting a little bit antsy.</p><p>Congressman Steve Scalise, a member of GOP leadership, warned that lawmakers will not short-circuit the open, transparent and accountable process. If negotiators can`t reach a deal, he said, Congress will have no choice but to consider other options.</p><p>But when it comes to China, Congress is taking a back seat as President Trump turns up the heat with new tariffs on the country`s exports. Nearly a dozen bills have been introduced over the past few months to rein in President Trump`s trade powers by requiring more consultation with Congress. None of those bills have gotten very far however, leaving one Republican senators saying he feels like a helpless bystander.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to take a look now at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>We start with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The price target there was cut to $50 from $56 at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). The analysts cited ongoing delays of one of the company`s processors. But the firm did maintain its equal weight on the stock, equal rating. Shares of the Dow component were up five cents today to $46.15.</p><p>Guggenheim raised its price target on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to $420 from $360. The analysts cited the company`s growth opportunity in India in particular. The firm maintained its buy rating. Stock however fell a fraction to $336.96 today.</p><p>And E-Trade was upgraded to buy from hold at Jefferies. The analyst there says that E-Trade is a takeover candidate. He says the valuation is attractive. Price target $65. That stock rose more than 3 percent today to $55.78.</p><p>HERERA: And still ahead, why retailers have one trillion reasons to rejoice this holiday season.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: European regulators want to know more about how Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) uses its data. The competition commissioner has launched a preliminary look at whether Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) uses information from small retailers to help increase its own sales.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION: It is very early days in this antitrust investigation into Amazon`s business practices. We are gathering information on the issue and we have sent quite a number of questionnaires to market participants in order to understand this issue in full.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: The European Union recently fined Alphabet`s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for allegedly abusing the dominance of its search engine and Android operating systems to favor its own services, a decision that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is appealing.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meanwhile, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is taking a larger chunk of the digital ad market. According to a new study, the company is on track now to be number three in that category they share behind Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is projected to take in more than four and a half billion dollars in digital ad revenue, thanks to strong organic growth and to accounting changes.</p><p>HERERA: And Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may be one of the many winners this holiday shopping season as consumers get ready to open up their wallets.</p><p>Courtney Reagan breaks down the spending forecast.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Less than a hundred days to go until Christmas and it`s already looking like a jolly season for retail. Various forecasts from retail consultancy groups predict total holiday sales will grow between three and more than five and a half percent. Deloitte estimates sales will top $1.1 trillion. Online sales are expected to grow between 16 and 22 percent, with e-commerce making up as much as 20 percent of all holiday spending.</p><p>The forecasts are robust, compared to both the historical average and because it represents solid growth on top of last year`s strong season. The economist calculating the forecasts say strong consumer sentiment low unemployment and stable savings rates are overpowering risks for now but a significant decline in the stock market or higher prices from new tariffs could change the outlooks from being as rosy as Santa`s cheeks.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: So let`s turn to Deloitte`s Rod Sides for more on this holiday spending forecast. He is the U.S. retailer retail leader with his firm`s retail and distribution practice.</p><p>Rod, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>ROD SIDES, DELOITTE U.S. RETAIL LEADER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You`re a pretty popular guy today with this kind of a forecast here.</p><p>You know, we talked in the past about retailers scrambling to find a way to go after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with their online practice, but I guess they`ve found a balance and they`re going to get good demand this year. That`s the message you put out today, right?</p><p>SIDES: Absolutely and we hope so. You know, if you look at the fundamentals with the savings rate being up and being pretty stable, we believe it`s going to really translate into a great holiday season.</p><p>HERERA: Are there risks to that? I mean, there`s a lot going on in Washington. We have a possible trade war with China does the consumer basically put that aside and they`re feeling pretty good about the economy and they continue to spend?</p><p>SIDES: You know, I think the consumer has gotten used to a lot of the noise that`s coming out of Washington. So, as a result, I think the consumer looks at their own pocketbook, really understands where they are and use that as a gauge to determine how much you`re going to spend. So we think that consumers going to continue to be really excited about this holiday.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Are there categories that you especially like, whether it`s apparel or technology or whatever it is?</p><p>SIDES: You know, there`s a couple I think that usually do pretty well in an up economy. Luxury does pretty well as a overall grouping, so some of those items will be jewelry, et cetera, typically has ticked up over the last couple years. Technology, certainly if we have new innovations, do pretty well in this season. And everybody always wants to buy a pair of for whatever reason over the holiday.</p><p>So, I think all those categories to do quite well.</p><p>HERERA: You know one of the things that I`ve noticed because I end up doing this every year is I wait too long and then I have to express the gifts for Christmas, but a lot of the retailers it seems to me have gotten very good at anticipating people like me, the last-minute shopper, and that helps their bottom line.</p><p>SIDES: Oh it certainly does and being able to shorten the windows for delivery certainly helps their ability to meet that demand I like you find myself scrambling at the last minute. So being able to meet those promise ship dates are really important to make sure you get it by the holiday.</p><p>GRIFFETH: There will be winners, but what about losers? Anybody that you feel will lag this year or struggle?</p><p>SIDES: You know, I think if you don`t have a very specific value proposition for the consumer, you`re always going to struggle. So what we find is that when you have unique product and distinctive product or if you`re trading on price, both ends of those spectrums have done quite well. It`s the businesses that are stuck in the middle that really don`t have an identity that I think will struggle over this holiday.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Ron, good to see you. I would say to both you and Sue, it`s never too early to start shopping.</p><p>SIDES: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Rod Sides with Deloitte joining us tonight from Minneapolis.</p><p>HERERA: I do it every year.</p><p>Profit stall at the used car seller Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The online auction company topped revenue estimates but said the disappointing earnings were largely due to costs associated with Hurricane Harvey. Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) said it spent nearly eighty million dollars on temporary storage facilities, overtime wages and employee lodging. Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) shares skidded 13 percent to $55.58.</p><p>Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is reportedly nearing a deal to sell its Simon app which sells complex investment products. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says a number of rival banks including J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) are in advanced talks with Goldman about making investments in that business. Shares of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) rose nearly 3 percent to $235.58.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Drugmaker Crispr Therapeutic said that its planning to offer $200 million worth of its common stock in a new public offering. And as often happens the news of a secondary offering initially sent shares of that company lower in the extended session tonight it also finished the regular session down about 2 percent at 51.89.</p><p>And then after the bell, software company Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) said a rise in subscription revenue helped overall earnings top expectations. Total sales did miss estimates but the company gave weaker than expected guidance for the current quarter and so shares initially fell in the after-hours. They finished the regular day up a fraction to $143.16.</p><p>And the stock of the day had to be Canadian marijuana company Tilray. Shares of most of the cannabis-related stocks have been on a tear lately anyway, but today was just crazy. Trading in Tilray had to be halted five different times during the regular session all due to tremendous volatility. When all was said and done the stock finished up another 38 percent to $214.06. And since its initial public offering just back on July 19th, shares of Tilray are up more than 1,000 percent.</p><p>HERERA: Which got us thinking because it`s estimated that the marijuana industry on a global scale could be worth nearly $60 billion in less than a decade. Corona maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) invested billions into a cannabis producer, and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) said it is closely watching the market for drink infused with CBD, that is the nonpsychoactive component in marijuana.</p><p>So, should investors consider getting in on the action?</p><p>Troy Dayton joins us now to discuss that. He is the co-founder of the Arcview Group.</p><p>Troy, welcome. Nice to have you here. What a day to have you here.</p><p>TROY DAYTON, ARCVIEW GROUP CO-FOUNDER: Thanks for having me. Yes, what a day.</p><p>HERERA: So, tell me where you think we are with the cannabis industry, specifically the stocks, because Bill and I both saw the dot-com bubble and it reminds me of that frankly.</p><p>DAYTON: Yes, I mean, people are clearly very excited about the cannabis industry and the performance of these stocks over the last few days and past few months really shows that. But the prices of these companies -- I mean, they`re bananas. I mean, there`s no way that that`s going to stand over time.</p><p>That being said there are real fundamentals to this market. It`s growing at a 26 percent compound annual growth rate over the next five years, and people love cannabis and they`re very excited. The public opinion is moving very far in favor of legalization, and there`s a lot of hope for additional policy reform. And so, over time, I think people will grow into these -- companies will grow into these valuations, but there`s going to be a lot of volatility along the way.</p><p>GRIFFETH: That policy reform you`re referring to obviously, cannabis is still illegal at the federal level and in some states still here in the United States. That`s a major headwind for this industry, right?</p><p>DAYTON: Absolutely, it`s part of what it`s so interesting to see all these stocks raising so much because a lot of that money can`t get into the U.S. right now. And so, I think there`s a lot of excitement and thinking that policy change is going to happen. And I sure hope all the people who are making so much money on these stocks are going to use some of it to donate to the legalization effort because right now, there are still millions of people that wake up every day and fear of their government for these laws while we`re all trying to make as much money.</p><p>But I think the real opportunity right now is in private companies since the public stocks are so overvalued at the moment, the opportunity is really getting into these companies before they go public. I mean, that`s what we really focus on.</p><p>HERERA: Very quickly, is that the way that corporate America should play it? Because if you`re a publicly traded company buying into an industry that is Bill mentioned federally is illegal, I mean, that`s kind of a dicey proposition. Should they go to the private companies?</p><p>DAYTON: Absolutely. Private or public, you still have the same legal issues to deal with, and that`s why so many companies are looking at Canada and other countries that are passing laws as a place to begin or investing in ancillary companies. You know, you see companies like Scott`s Miracle Grow that are doing agricultural technology and these sorts of things, kind of businesses that grow with the industry.</p><p>GRIFFETH: No pun intended. OK, Troy, thank you very much.</p><p>Troy Dayton with Arcview Group.</p><p>DAYTON: Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, the cost of the cleanup.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: The global poverty rate has fallen to a record low. The World Bank says the proportion of people living below the poverty line has fallen to 10 percent. But the World Bank also warned that the pace of poverty reduction has slowed. The World Bank has a goal of reducing the poverty rate to 3 percent by the year 2030.</p><p>GRIFFETH: President Trump flew to North Carolina today where he toured the damage from Hurricane Florence. He assessed the response and promised to help those displaced.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hurricane Florence was one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the Carolinas, one of the most powerful and devastating storms ever to hit our country. To the families who have lost loved ones, America grieves with you and our hearts break for you. God bless you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The president also predicted a costly cleanup, which is underway with a focus on getting people back into their homes and businesses back up and running.</p><p>Seema Mody is in hard-hit New Bern, North Carolina, for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The hurricane has passed but the flooding and water damage is wreaking havoc across the Carolinas. Here in New Bern, population of 30,000, over 4,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We don`t have flood homeowners insurance. We`re kind of (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Some people lost their homes completely and I just got moderate damage to mine.</p><p>MODY: New Bern`s conference center, a key revenue generator, has suffered water damage, prompting local officials to bring in external help to expedite the repairs.</p><p>PAUL KERBY, SERVPRO DISASTER RECOVERY TEAM: The biggest problem you have with moisture is when it`s on the ground, it also rises up and it damages other parts of the building. So, right now, we`re stabilizing the environment, getting all the wet material out that we can, and getting it ready to be rebuilt after we leave.</p><p>MODY: Complicating the recovery efforts, access to power. Over 200,000 residents are dealing with power outages. And Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) says most of the power will be restored by next Wednesday.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`re almost ready for you, OK?</p><p>MODY: For those still without power and a place to stay, aid groups like Operation Blessing are providing food and supplies, in partnership with Home Depot (NYSE:HD), as well as generous donations coming in from nearby states.</p><p>Based on early estimates, Florence could inflict as much as $22 billion in damages, and the longer the recovery takes, the greater the economic hit on this region.</p><p>CNBC Business News, Seema Mody, New Bern, North Carolina.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And that`s it for us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Good night.

The Dow nears  a new high as investor sentiment rises and trade concerns take a backseat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Bringing up sales.  It's  not even autumn yet, but already, forecast for holiday spending are  spreading cheer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  Smokin hot.  Money is pouring into the marijuana stocks but will  today's hype be tomorrow's buzzkill?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for  Wednesday September 19th.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you good evening, everybody, and welcome.</p><p> After two days a pretty decent gains this week, the Dow suddenly finds  itself close to an all-time high.  The financial sector led the way higher  today, getting a lift from the continued rise in interest rates.  Tech  stocks did not participate in today's rally, giants like Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) traded lower.</p><p> Here are the closing numbers for this day, the Dow advanced by 158 points  to close at 158 points to close at 26,405, the Nasdaq fell by six, the S&amp;P  added three. </p><p> Mike Santoli takes a look now at the Dow's move toward new highs.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's a sign that  investors are coming to terms with the impact of the tariff wars or simply  believe the U.S. economy and American companies are strong enough to  withstand any trade pressures.  After a lively two-day rally, the Dow Jones  Industrial Average has pulled within 1 percent of its all-time high of  26,616, set nearly months ago.  </p><p> The latest stage of the Dow advanced has been led by shares of big global  industrial stocks such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT),  exactly the companies once considered most vulnerable to retaliation by  China for us imposed tariffs on Chinese goods.  The broader S&amp;P 500 made a  record high just a few weeks ago, helped in recent months by the huge gains  in its big tech stock components.  The Dow though was the index hardest hit  by ongoing worries over the effect of trade skirmishes on U.S.  manufacturing exports.</p><p> Yet so far, analysts see only a marginal potential drag on orders and  earnings as a result of the new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports  that were made official this week.  Stock markets in Asia have also  bounced, perhaps an indication that investors had already anticipated and  priced in some of the tariff risks.</p><p> Meantime, a rapid rise in treasury yields, another factor that seemed to  spook the markets early this year and contributed to the sharp 10 percent  correction in February is likewise being taken in stride.  The 10-year  yield is now climbed above 3 percent this week as the Federal Reserve  likely prepares to lift interest rates next week and perhaps again in  December.</p><p> This relief rally supporting today owes a lot to the consistently strong  U.S. economic data and continued expectations for 20 percent earnings  growth for a third straight quarter.  The question for investors now as the  Dow nears a full recovery is whether those economic tailwinds can carry  this market into 2019 as the effect of the U.S. tax cut wanes and interest  rates march higher.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  So, let's turn to our bull and our bear guests tonight for their  opposing views on this market.  </p><p> Jason Draho is the head of America's asset allocation at UBS Global Wealth  Management.  He says that this bull market does indeed have more room to  run.</p><p> Our bear tonight is Lamar Villere, portfolio manager at Villere &amp; Company,  who sees some risks ahead for the market.</p><p> Gentlemen, welcome.  Nice to have you with us.</p><p> Jason, I think Mike Santoli made some very interesting points at the end of  his report, rising rates valuations that that seemed kind of rich by many,  many standards.  Why do you think that the market has more room to run?</p><p> JASON DRAHO, UBS GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  It's quite simple.  It comes  down to the economic fundamentals.  As you alluded to it, your growth in  the U.S. is very solid.  There's no reason to expect that to vanish anytime  soon.  And without any signs of recession risk certainly in the next 12  months, it's hard to see the bull market coming to an end.  It may not keep  going in hires quickly but the fundamentals still very supportive.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Lamar, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said today that the great bull  is dead, that we should expect a bear at some point and in part because the  Fed is raising rates.  There's that long-held feeling that the Fed lowering  rates over the last decade responsible for the great rally, now that  they're reversing course the stock market has to do the same.</p><p> Does that have a feeling of the same that you have for this bear market  right now, coming do you feel?</p><p> LAMAR VILLERE, VILLERE &amp; COMPANY PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Sure, I do think  that's one of the catalysts that we're concerned about.  If you look at the  fact that over the last several years, we've -- what we've seen is  investors fleeing bonds because there's just no yield there, and buying  these high dividend paying stocks, in fact making some of these very sleepy  slow growth stocks wildly outperformed their much faster growing peers.   And for a while, you know, that -- from our perspective that didn't make  any sense.  But you know if you're sitting there trying to make some money  for your retirement and you think the treasuries are paying 2 percent, you  got to find a yield somewhere.</p><p> So, I think we're a little concerned that there's going to be a real  reversal of that trade and people move back into bonds.</p><p> HERERA:  Jason, what are the things you watch as the bull market monitor,  which is correlated to economic expansion?  There are those who would push  back on that and say if you look at history, just because the economy is  good doesn't always mean that the stock market is going to be good.  What's  your response to that?</p><p> DRAHO:  It's true that the correlation between economic growth and the  stock market is actually quite low on a year-to-year basis, but if you're  looking about the bull market ending or bear market starting, it's really  hard to have that happen unless there's a recession.  And the economic  fundamentals just suggest that's not the case.  Growth is very good.  It's  likely continue.</p><p> And I do agree that I think rising traits are concerned, but buying  historical measures and relative to the strength of the economy interest  rates are still low and the Feds going to raise rates and that will become  a concern.  I think that becomes a concern not until late next year and  really 2020.  There's still definitely room for this to kind of continue on  before I think those become material risks for the bull market.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  What would you buy here, Jason?  What's going to take us higher?</p><p> DRAHO:  So, the performance today is interesting.  Financials did well,  tech didn't.  We've been of the view that value stocks should perform well  in this environment of good growth, rising rates, rising inflation.  If  this continues, and if the fears have sort of kind of a growth slowdown  because of trade concerns have actually abated, that should be an  environment that would support value stocks like financials, like energy.   So that's one area that we've been looking to buy.</p><p> HERERA:  And I guess the same question on the other side of the coin for  you, Lamar.  How would you be hedging your bets if indeed, we are going  into a more negative cycle for the stock market?</p><p> VILLERE:  So, there's definitely securities you can buy individual names  like we buy individual stocks that that might actually perform better in a  rising interest rate environment.  One of the ones we've been buying is  Progressive (NYSE:PGR).  That's a situation where rising interest rates  actually help them to do better with their invested assets.  So there are  securities where you can or you can really negate that risk.</p><p> HERERA:  Jason, Lamar, thank you so much for joining us for our bull/bear  debate tonight.</p><p> Bill?</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere in other news today, the head of the Chamber of  Commerce said today that the White House can still avoid an all-out global  trade war at this point.  The business group called it the biggest threat  facing the economy right now and it's urging the administration to seal a  trilateral lateral NAFTA deal and make progress with Europe on its trade  issues.  It also wants the U.S. to talk with China rather than resorting to  trade retaliation.</p><p> HERERA:  But the relationship between the U.S. and China may already be  starting to sour.  In an interview with the Chinese publication, Alibaba's  Jack Ma backed down from a promise to bring million jobs to the U.S.,  citing those ongoing trade conflicts between the U.S. and China.</p><p> Ma said, quote, the promise was made on the premise of friendly U.S.-China  partnership and rational trade relations that premise no longer exists  today, and so, our promise cannot be fulfilled, end quote.</p><p> And in fact today, China's second-in-command had some harsh words about the  rise of protectionism in some parts of the world.  Eunice Yoon is in  Beijing for us tonight.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  China's Premier Li  Keqiang spoke at the World Economic Forum in the port city of Tianjin  today.  He didn't directly address the escalating trade war with the United  States or even mentioned President Trump's name.  </p><p> Instead, he referenced concerns of rising protectionism and repeated  China's promises to open up the economy and give foreign investors fair  treatment.  On the currency, Li said China would not actively weaken the  Yuan to help exporters or engage in competitive currency devaluations, but  would keep the Yuan stable.</p><p> What was also missing in the speech was any recognition of China's  contribution to the rising protectionism among its trading partners.  The  state media had its typical strident response saying China will outlast the  tariff war, emerge stronger and it's not afraid of President Trump's what  they called extreme measures.</p><p> One commentary in the communist party run \"People's Daily\" argue that  President Trump's trade action doesn't necessarily impede China's own  economic agenda.  \"The People's Daily\" said: China will instead use the  trade dispute as an opportunity to replace imports promote localization or  develop export-oriented advanced manufacturing.</p><p> What often gets lost in who wins or loses a trade war is that a big part of  China's made in China 2025 strategy is to develop homegrown technology so  China can rely less on foreign technology and other industries.  So, that's  what the piece is highlighting that China could be better off in the long  run because it wants to develop its own technologies of the future.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Meantime, trade talks with Canada resumed today in Washington,  talks that U.S. officials want to see completed by the end of the month.</p><p> Ylan Mui has more.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Top trade officials from  the U.S. and Canada are back in Washington hoping to nail down a deal on  NAFTA.  Canada's foreign minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters that the  talks have been constructive but more work needs to be done.</p><p> CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  We are a country that is  good at finding compromises, and that's the talent our negotiators  certainly demonstrate.  At the same time, our core objective today and this  has been the case from the very beginning, is to defend the national  interest and that is what we are going to continue to do.</p><p> MUI:  October 1st is the deadline for negotiators to produce the written  text of a formal deal, and it's unclear if they'll be able to pull that off  if they don't reach an agreement in principle by the end of this week.  The  deadline is designed to give Congress plenty of time to review the deal.   Lawmakers must vote to accept any trade agreement and some of them are  getting a little bit antsy.  </p><p> Congressman Steve Scalise, a member of GOP leadership, warned that  lawmakers will not short-circuit the open, transparent and accountable  process.  If negotiators can't reach a deal, he said, Congress will have no  choice but to consider other options.</p><p> But when it comes to China, Congress is taking a back seat as President  Trump turns up the heat with new tariffs on the country's exports.  Nearly  a dozen bills have been introduced over the past few months to rein in  President Trump's trade powers by requiring more consultation with  Congress.  None of those bills have gotten very far however, leaving one  Republican senators saying he feels like a helpless bystander.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Ylan Mui in Washington.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p> We start with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).  The price target there was cut to $50  from $56 at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).  The analysts cited ongoing delays of  one of the company's processors.  But the firm did maintain its equal  weight on the stock, equal rating.  Shares of the Dow component were up  five cents today to $46.15.</p><p> Guggenheim raised its price target on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to $420 from  $360.  The analysts cited the company's growth opportunity in India in  particular.  The firm maintained its buy rating.  Stock however fell a  fraction to $336.96 today.</p><p> And E-Trade was upgraded to buy from hold at Jefferies.  The analyst there  says that E-Trade is a takeover candidate.  He says the valuation is  attractive.  Price target $65.  That stock rose more than 3 percent today  to $55.78.</p><p> HERERA:  And still ahead, why retailers have one trillion reasons to  rejoice this holiday season.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  European regulators want to know more about how Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) uses its data.  The competition commissioner has launched a  preliminary look at whether Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) uses information from  small retailers to help increase its own sales.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION:  It is very  early days in this antitrust investigation into Amazon's business  practices.  We are gathering information on the issue and we have sent  quite a number of questionnaires to market participants in order to  understand this issue in full.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  The European Union recently fined Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  for allegedly abusing the dominance of its search engine and Android  operating systems to favor its own services, a decision that Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) is appealing.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is taking a larger chunk of the  digital ad market.  According to a new study, the company is on track now  to be number three in that category they share behind Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is projected to take in  more than four and a half billion dollars in digital ad revenue, thanks to  strong organic growth and to accounting changes.</p><p> HERERA:  And Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may be one of the many winners this  holiday shopping season as consumers get ready to open up their wallets.</p><p> Courtney Reagan breaks down the spending forecast.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Less than a  hundred days to go until Christmas and it's already looking like a jolly  season for retail.  Various forecasts from retail consultancy groups  predict total holiday sales will grow between three and more than five and  a half percent.  Deloitte estimates sales will top $1.1 trillion.  Online  sales are expected to grow between 16 and 22 percent, with e-commerce  making up as much as 20 percent of all holiday spending.  </p><p> The forecasts are robust, compared to both the historical average and  because it represents solid growth on top of last year's strong season.   The economist calculating the forecasts say strong consumer sentiment low  unemployment and stable savings rates are overpowering risks for now but a  significant decline in the stock market or higher prices from new tariffs  could change the outlooks from being as rosy as Santa's cheeks.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  So let's turn to Deloitte's Rod Sides for more on this holiday  spending forecast.  He is the U.S. retailer retail leader with his firm's  retail and distribution practice.</p><p> Rod, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p> ROD SIDES, DELOITTE U.S. RETAIL LEADER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  You're a pretty popular guy today with this kind of a forecast  here.</p><p> You know, we talked in the past about retailers scrambling to find a way to  go after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with their online practice, but I guess  they've found a balance and they're going to get good demand this year.   That's the message you put out today, right?</p><p> SIDES:  Absolutely and we hope so.  You know, if you look at the  fundamentals with the savings rate being up and being pretty stable, we  believe it's going to really translate into a great holiday season.</p><p> HERERA:  Are there risks to that?  I mean, there's a lot going on in  Washington.  We have a possible trade war with China does the consumer  basically put that aside and they're feeling pretty good about the economy  and they continue to spend?</p><p> SIDES:  You know, I think the consumer has gotten used to a lot of the  noise that's coming out of Washington.  So, as a result, I think the  consumer looks at their own pocketbook, really understands where they are  and use that as a gauge to determine how much you're going to spend.  So we  think that consumers going to continue to be really excited about this  holiday.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Are there categories that you especially like, whether it's  apparel or technology or whatever it is?</p><p> SIDES:  You know, there's a couple I think that usually do pretty well in  an up economy.  Luxury does pretty well as a overall grouping, so some of  those items will be jewelry, et cetera, typically has ticked up over the  last couple years.  Technology, certainly if we have new innovations, do  pretty well in this season.  And everybody always wants to buy a pair of  for whatever reason over the holiday.</p><p> So, I think all those categories to do quite well.</p><p> HERERA:  You know one of the things that I've noticed because I end up  doing this every year is I wait too long and then I have to express the  gifts for Christmas, but a lot of the retailers it seems to me have gotten  very good at anticipating people like me, the last-minute shopper, and that  helps their bottom line.</p><p> SIDES:  Oh it certainly does and being able to shorten the windows for  delivery certainly helps their ability to meet that demand I like you find  myself scrambling at the last minute.  So being able to meet those promise  ship dates are really important to make sure you get it by the holiday.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  There will be winners, but what about losers?  Anybody that you  feel will lag this year or struggle?</p><p> SIDES:  You know, I think if you don't have a very specific value  proposition for the consumer, you're always going to struggle.  So what we  find is that when you have unique product and distinctive product or if  you're trading on price, both ends of those spectrums have done quite well.   It's the businesses that are stuck in the middle that really don't have an  identity that I think will struggle over this holiday.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Ron, good to see you.  I would say to both you and Sue, it's  never too early to start shopping.</p><p> SIDES:  Thank you.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Rod Sides with Deloitte joining us tonight from Minneapolis.</p><p> HERERA:  I do it every year.</p><p> Profit stall at the used car seller Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) and that's where  we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p> The online auction company topped revenue estimates but said the  disappointing earnings were largely due to costs associated with Hurricane  Harvey.  Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) said it spent nearly eighty million dollars  on temporary storage facilities, overtime wages and employee lodging.   Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) shares skidded 13 percent to $55.58.</p><p>Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is reportedly nearing a deal to sell its Simon app  which sells complex investment products.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says a  number of rival banks including J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) are  in advanced talks with Goldman about making investments in that business.   Shares of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) rose nearly 3 percent to $235.58.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Drugmaker Crispr Therapeutic said that its planning to offer  $200 million worth of its common stock in a new public offering.  And as  often happens the news of a secondary offering initially sent shares of  that company lower in the extended session tonight it also finished the  regular session down about 2 percent at 51.89.</p><p> And then after the bell, software company Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) said a rise in  subscription revenue helped overall earnings top expectations.  Total sales  did miss estimates but the company gave weaker than expected guidance for  the current quarter and so shares initially fell in the after-hours.  They  finished the regular day up a fraction to $143.16.</p><p> And the stock of the day had to be Canadian marijuana company Tilray.   Shares of most of the cannabis-related stocks have been on a tear lately  anyway, but today was just crazy. Trading in Tilray had to be halted five  different times during the regular session all due to tremendous  volatility.  When all was said and done the stock finished up another 38  percent to $214.06.  And since its initial public offering just back on  July 19th, shares of Tilray are up more than 1,000 percent.</p><p> HERERA:  Which got us thinking because it's estimated that the marijuana  industry on a global scale could be worth nearly $60 billion in less than a  decade.  Corona maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) invested billions  into a cannabis producer, and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) said it is closely  watching the market for drink infused with CBD, that is the nonpsychoactive  component in marijuana.  </p><p> So, should investors consider getting in on the action?</p><p> Troy Dayton joins us now to discuss that.  He is the co-founder of the  Arcview Group.</p><p> Troy, welcome.  Nice to have you here.  What a day to have you here.</p><p> TROY DAYTON, ARCVIEW GROUP CO-FOUNDER:  Thanks for having me.  Yes, what a  day.</p><p> HERERA:  So, tell me where you think we are with the cannabis industry,  specifically the stocks, because Bill and I both saw the dot-com bubble and  it reminds me of that frankly.</p><p> DAYTON:  Yes, I mean, people are clearly very excited about the cannabis  industry and the performance of these stocks over the last few days and  past few months really shows that.  But the prices of these companies -- I  mean, they're bananas.  I mean, there's no way that that's going to stand  over time.  </p><p> That being said there are real fundamentals to this market.  It's growing  at a 26 percent compound annual growth rate over the next five years, and  people love cannabis and they're very excited.  The public opinion is  moving very far in favor of legalization, and there's a lot of hope for  additional policy reform.  And so, over time, I think people will grow into  these -- companies will grow into these valuations, but there's going to be  a lot of volatility along the way.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  That policy reform you're referring to obviously, cannabis is  still illegal at the federal level and in some states still here in the  United States.  That's a major headwind for this industry, right?</p><p> DAYTON:  Absolutely, it's part of what it's so interesting to see all these  stocks raising so much because a lot of that money can't get into the U.S.  right now.  And so, I think there's a lot of excitement and thinking that  policy change is going to happen.  And I sure hope all the people who are  making so much money on these stocks are going to use some of it to donate  to the legalization effort because right now, there are still millions of  people that wake up every day and fear of their government for these laws  while we're all trying to make as much money.</p><p> But I think the real opportunity right now is in private companies since  the public stocks are so overvalued at the moment, the opportunity is  really getting into these companies before they go public.  I mean, that's  what we really focus on.</p><p> HERERA:  Very quickly, is that the way that corporate America should play  it?  Because if you're a publicly traded company buying into an industry  that is Bill mentioned federally is illegal, I mean, that's kind of a dicey  proposition.  Should they go to the private companies?</p><p> DAYTON:  Absolutely.  Private or public, you still have the same legal  issues to deal with, and that's why so many companies are looking at Canada  and other countries that are passing laws as a place to begin or investing  in ancillary companies.  You know, you see companies like Scott's Miracle  Grow that are doing agricultural technology and these sorts of things, kind  of businesses that grow with the industry.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  No pun intended.  OK, Troy, thank you very much.</p><p> Troy Dayton with Arcview Group.</p><p> DAYTON:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, the cost of the cleanup.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  The global poverty rate has fallen to a record low.  The World  Bank says the proportion of people living below the poverty line has fallen  to 10 percent.  But the World Bank also warned that the pace of poverty  reduction has slowed.  The World Bank has a goal of reducing the poverty  rate to 3 percent by the year 2030.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  President Trump flew to North Carolina today where he toured the  damage from Hurricane Florence.  He assessed the response and promised to  help those displaced.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hurricane Florence was one  of the most powerful storms ever to hit the Carolinas, one of the most  powerful and devastating storms ever to hit our country.  To the families  who have lost loved ones, America grieves with you and our hearts break for  you.  God bless you.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  The president also predicted a costly cleanup, which is underway  with a focus on getting people back into their homes and businesses back up  and running.</p><p> Seema Mody is in hard-hit New Bern, North Carolina, for us tonight.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The hurricane has  passed but the flooding and water damage is wreaking havoc across the  Carolinas.  Here in New Bern, population of 30,000, over 4,000 homes have  been damaged or destroyed.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We don't have flood homeowners insurance.  We're kind  of (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Some people lost their homes completely and I just  got moderate damage to mine.</p><p> MODY:  New Bern's conference center, a key revenue generator, has suffered  water damage, prompting local officials to bring in external help to  expedite the repairs.</p><p> PAUL KERBY, SERVPRO DISASTER RECOVERY TEAM:  The biggest problem you have  with moisture is when it's on the ground, it also rises up and it damages  other parts of the building.  So, right now, we're stabilizing the  environment, getting all the wet material out that we can, and getting it  ready to be rebuilt after we leave.</p><p> MODY:  Complicating the recovery efforts, access to power.  Over 200,000  residents are dealing with power outages.  And Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) says  most of the power will be restored by next Wednesday.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're almost ready for you, OK?</p><p> MODY:  For those still without power and a place to stay, aid groups like  Operation Blessing are providing food and supplies, in partnership with  Home Depot (NYSE:HD), as well as generous donations coming in from nearby  states.</p><p> Based on early estimates, Florence could inflict as much as $22 billion in  damages, and the longer the recovery takes, the greater the economic hit on  this region.</p><p> CNBC Business News, Seema Mody, New Bern, North Carolina.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And that's it for us.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Good night.

The Dow nears  a new high as investor sentiment rises and trade concerns take a backseat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Bringing up sales.  It's  not even autumn yet, but already, forecast for holiday spending are  spreading cheer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Smokin hot.  Money is pouring into the marijuana stocks but will  today's hype be tomorrow's buzzkill?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for  Wednesday September 19th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you good evening, everybody, and welcome.</p><p>After two days a pretty decent gains this week, the Dow suddenly finds  itself close to an all-time high.  The financial sector led the way higher  today, getting a lift from the continued rise in interest rates.  Tech  stocks did not participate in today's rally, giants like Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) traded lower.</p><p>Here are the closing numbers for this day, the Dow advanced by 158 points  to close at 158 points to close at 26,405, the Nasdaq fell by six, the S&amp;P  added three. </p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look now at the Dow's move toward new highs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's a sign that  investors are coming to terms with the impact of the tariff wars or simply  believe the U.S. economy and American companies are strong enough to  withstand any trade pressures.  After a lively two-day rally, the Dow Jones  Industrial Average has pulled within 1 percent of its all-time high of  26,616, set nearly months ago.  </p><p>The latest stage of the Dow advanced has been led by shares of big global  industrial stocks such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT),  exactly the companies once considered most vulnerable to retaliation by  China for us imposed tariffs on Chinese goods.  The broader S&amp;P 500 made a  record high just a few weeks ago, helped in recent months by the huge gains  in its big tech stock components.  The Dow though was the index hardest hit  by ongoing worries over the effect of trade skirmishes on U.S.  manufacturing exports.</p><p>Yet so far, analysts see only a marginal potential drag on orders and  earnings as a result of the new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports  that were made official this week.  Stock markets in Asia have also  bounced, perhaps an indication that investors had already anticipated and  priced in some of the tariff risks.</p><p>Meantime, a rapid rise in treasury yields, another factor that seemed to  spook the markets early this year and contributed to the sharp 10 percent  correction in February is likewise being taken in stride.  The 10-year  yield is now climbed above 3 percent this week as the Federal Reserve  likely prepares to lift interest rates next week and perhaps again in  December.</p><p>This relief rally supporting today owes a lot to the consistently strong  U.S. economic data and continued expectations for 20 percent earnings  growth for a third straight quarter.  The question for investors now as the  Dow nears a full recovery is whether those economic tailwinds can carry  this market into 2019 as the effect of the U.S. tax cut wanes and interest  rates march higher.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, let's turn to our bull and our bear guests tonight for their  opposing views on this market.  </p><p>Jason Draho is the head of America's asset allocation at UBS Global Wealth  Management.  He says that this bull market does indeed have more room to  run.</p><p>Our bear tonight is Lamar Villere, portfolio manager at Villere &amp; Company,  who sees some risks ahead for the market.</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome.  Nice to have you with us.</p><p>Jason, I think Mike Santoli made some very interesting points at the end of  his report, rising rates valuations that that seemed kind of rich by many,  many standards.  Why do you think that the market has more room to run?</p><p>JASON DRAHO, UBS GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  It's quite simple.  It comes  down to the economic fundamentals.  As you alluded to it, your growth in  the U.S. is very solid.  There's no reason to expect that to vanish anytime  soon.  And without any signs of recession risk certainly in the next 12  months, it's hard to see the bull market coming to an end.  It may not keep  going in hires quickly but the fundamentals still very supportive.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Lamar, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said today that the great bull  is dead, that we should expect a bear at some point and in part because the  Fed is raising rates.  There's that long-held feeling that the Fed lowering  rates over the last decade responsible for the great rally, now that  they're reversing course the stock market has to do the same.</p><p>Does that have a feeling of the same that you have for this bear market  right now, coming do you feel?</p><p>LAMAR VILLERE, VILLERE &amp; COMPANY PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Sure, I do think  that's one of the catalysts that we're concerned about.  If you look at the  fact that over the last several years, we've -- what we've seen is  investors fleeing bonds because there's just no yield there, and buying  these high dividend paying stocks, in fact making some of these very sleepy  slow growth stocks wildly outperformed their much faster growing peers.   And for a while, you know, that -- from our perspective that didn't make  any sense.  But you know if you're sitting there trying to make some money  for your retirement and you think the treasuries are paying 2 percent, you  got to find a yield somewhere.</p><p>So, I think we're a little concerned that there's going to be a real  reversal of that trade and people move back into bonds.</p><p>HERERA:  Jason, what are the things you watch as the bull market monitor,  which is correlated to economic expansion?  There are those who would push  back on that and say if you look at history, just because the economy is  good doesn't always mean that the stock market is going to be good.  What's  your response to that?</p><p>DRAHO:  It's true that the correlation between economic growth and the  stock market is actually quite low on a year-to-year basis, but if you're  looking about the bull market ending or bear market starting, it's really  hard to have that happen unless there's a recession.  And the economic  fundamentals just suggest that's not the case.  Growth is very good.  It's  likely continue.</p><p>And I do agree that I think rising traits are concerned, but buying  historical measures and relative to the strength of the economy interest  rates are still low and the Feds going to raise rates and that will become  a concern.  I think that becomes a concern not until late next year and  really 2020.  There's still definitely room for this to kind of continue on  before I think those become material risks for the bull market.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  What would you buy here, Jason?  What's going to take us higher?</p><p>DRAHO:  So, the performance today is interesting.  Financials did well,  tech didn't.  We've been of the view that value stocks should perform well  in this environment of good growth, rising rates, rising inflation.  If  this continues, and if the fears have sort of kind of a growth slowdown  because of trade concerns have actually abated, that should be an  environment that would support value stocks like financials, like energy.   So that's one area that we've been looking to buy.</p><p>HERERA:  And I guess the same question on the other side of the coin for  you, Lamar.  How would you be hedging your bets if indeed, we are going  into a more negative cycle for the stock market?</p><p>VILLERE:  So, there's definitely securities you can buy individual names  like we buy individual stocks that that might actually perform better in a  rising interest rate environment.  One of the ones we've been buying is  Progressive (NYSE:PGR).  That's a situation where rising interest rates  actually help them to do better with their invested assets.  So there are  securities where you can or you can really negate that risk.</p><p>HERERA:  Jason, Lamar, thank you so much for joining us for our bull/bear  debate tonight.</p><p>Bill?</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere in other news today, the head of the Chamber of  Commerce said today that the White House can still avoid an all-out global  trade war at this point.  The business group called it the biggest threat  facing the economy right now and it's urging the administration to seal a  trilateral lateral NAFTA deal and make progress with Europe on its trade  issues.  It also wants the U.S. to talk with China rather than resorting to  trade retaliation.</p><p>HERERA:  But the relationship between the U.S. and China may already be  starting to sour.  In an interview with the Chinese publication, Alibaba's  Jack Ma backed down from a promise to bring million jobs to the U.S.,  citing those ongoing trade conflicts between the U.S. and China.</p><p>Ma said, quote, the promise was made on the premise of friendly U.S.-China  partnership and rational trade relations that premise no longer exists  today, and so, our promise cannot be fulfilled, end quote.</p><p>And in fact today, China's second-in-command had some harsh words about the  rise of protectionism in some parts of the world.  Eunice Yoon is in  Beijing for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  China's Premier Li  Keqiang spoke at the World Economic Forum in the port city of Tianjin  today.  He didn't directly address the escalating trade war with the United  States or even mentioned President Trump's name.  </p><p>Instead, he referenced concerns of rising protectionism and repeated  China's promises to open up the economy and give foreign investors fair  treatment.  On the currency, Li said China would not actively weaken the  Yuan to help exporters or engage in competitive currency devaluations, but  would keep the Yuan stable.</p><p>What was also missing in the speech was any recognition of China's  contribution to the rising protectionism among its trading partners.  The  state media had its typical strident response saying China will outlast the  tariff war, emerge stronger and it's not afraid of President Trump's what  they called extreme measures.</p><p>One commentary in the communist party run \"People's Daily\" argue that  President Trump's trade action doesn't necessarily impede China's own  economic agenda.  \"The People's Daily\" said: China will instead use the  trade dispute as an opportunity to replace imports promote localization or  develop export-oriented advanced manufacturing.</p><p>What often gets lost in who wins or loses a trade war is that a big part of  China's made in China 2025 strategy is to develop homegrown technology so  China can rely less on foreign technology and other industries.  So, that's  what the piece is highlighting that China could be better off in the long  run because it wants to develop its own technologies of the future.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Meantime, trade talks with Canada resumed today in Washington,  talks that U.S. officials want to see completed by the end of the month.</p><p>Ylan Mui has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Top trade officials from  the U.S. and Canada are back in Washington hoping to nail down a deal on  NAFTA.  Canada's foreign minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters that the  talks have been constructive but more work needs to be done.</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  We are a country that is  good at finding compromises, and that's the talent our negotiators  certainly demonstrate.  At the same time, our core objective today and this  has been the case from the very beginning, is to defend the national  interest and that is what we are going to continue to do.</p><p>MUI:  October 1st is the deadline for negotiators to produce the written  text of a formal deal, and it's unclear if they'll be able to pull that off  if they don't reach an agreement in principle by the end of this week.  The  deadline is designed to give Congress plenty of time to review the deal.   Lawmakers must vote to accept any trade agreement and some of them are  getting a little bit antsy.  </p><p>Congressman Steve Scalise, a member of GOP leadership, warned that  lawmakers will not short-circuit the open, transparent and accountable  process.  If negotiators can't reach a deal, he said, Congress will have no  choice but to consider other options.</p><p>But when it comes to China, Congress is taking a back seat as President  Trump turns up the heat with new tariffs on the country's exports.  Nearly  a dozen bills have been introduced over the past few months to rein in  President Trump's trade powers by requiring more consultation with  Congress.  None of those bills have gotten very far however, leaving one  Republican senators saying he feels like a helpless bystander.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Ylan Mui in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>We start with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).  The price target there was cut to $50  from $56 at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).  The analysts cited ongoing delays of  one of the company's processors.  But the firm did maintain its equal  weight on the stock, equal rating.  Shares of the Dow component were up  five cents today to $46.15.</p><p>Guggenheim raised its price target on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to $420 from  $360.  The analysts cited the company's growth opportunity in India in  particular.  The firm maintained its buy rating.  Stock however fell a  fraction to $336.96 today.</p><p>And E-Trade was upgraded to buy from hold at Jefferies.  The analyst there  says that E-Trade is a takeover candidate.  He says the valuation is  attractive.  Price target $65.  That stock rose more than 3 percent today  to $55.78.</p><p>HERERA:  And still ahead, why retailers have one trillion reasons to  rejoice this holiday season.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  European regulators want to know more about how Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) uses its data.  The competition commissioner has launched a  preliminary look at whether Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) uses information from  small retailers to help increase its own sales.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION:  It is very  early days in this antitrust investigation into Amazon's business  practices.  We are gathering information on the issue and we have sent  quite a number of questionnaires to market participants in order to  understand this issue in full.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The European Union recently fined Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  for allegedly abusing the dominance of its search engine and Android  operating systems to favor its own services, a decision that Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) is appealing.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is taking a larger chunk of the  digital ad market.  According to a new study, the company is on track now  to be number three in that category they share behind Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is projected to take in  more than four and a half billion dollars in digital ad revenue, thanks to  strong organic growth and to accounting changes.</p><p>HERERA:  And Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may be one of the many winners this  holiday shopping season as consumers get ready to open up their wallets.</p><p>Courtney Reagan breaks down the spending forecast.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Less than a  hundred days to go until Christmas and it's already looking like a jolly  season for retail.  Various forecasts from retail consultancy groups  predict total holiday sales will grow between three and more than five and  a half percent.  Deloitte estimates sales will top $1.1 trillion.  Online  sales are expected to grow between 16 and 22 percent, with e-commerce  making up as much as 20 percent of all holiday spending.  </p><p>The forecasts are robust, compared to both the historical average and  because it represents solid growth on top of last year's strong season.   The economist calculating the forecasts say strong consumer sentiment low  unemployment and stable savings rates are overpowering risks for now but a  significant decline in the stock market or higher prices from new tariffs  could change the outlooks from being as rosy as Santa's cheeks.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So let's turn to Deloitte's Rod Sides for more on this holiday  spending forecast.  He is the U.S. retailer retail leader with his firm's  retail and distribution practice.</p><p>Rod, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>ROD SIDES, DELOITTE U.S. RETAIL LEADER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You're a pretty popular guy today with this kind of a forecast  here.</p><p>You know, we talked in the past about retailers scrambling to find a way to  go after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with their online practice, but I guess  they've found a balance and they're going to get good demand this year.   That's the message you put out today, right?</p><p>SIDES:  Absolutely and we hope so.  You know, if you look at the  fundamentals with the savings rate being up and being pretty stable, we  believe it's going to really translate into a great holiday season.</p><p>HERERA:  Are there risks to that?  I mean, there's a lot going on in  Washington.  We have a possible trade war with China does the consumer  basically put that aside and they're feeling pretty good about the economy  and they continue to spend?</p><p>SIDES:  You know, I think the consumer has gotten used to a lot of the  noise that's coming out of Washington.  So, as a result, I think the  consumer looks at their own pocketbook, really understands where they are  and use that as a gauge to determine how much you're going to spend.  So we  think that consumers going to continue to be really excited about this  holiday.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Are there categories that you especially like, whether it's  apparel or technology or whatever it is?</p><p>SIDES:  You know, there's a couple I think that usually do pretty well in  an up economy.  Luxury does pretty well as a overall grouping, so some of  those items will be jewelry, et cetera, typically has ticked up over the  last couple years.  Technology, certainly if we have new innovations, do  pretty well in this season.  And everybody always wants to buy a pair of  for whatever reason over the holiday.</p><p>So, I think all those categories to do quite well.</p><p>HERERA:  You know one of the things that I've noticed because I end up  doing this every year is I wait too long and then I have to express the  gifts for Christmas, but a lot of the retailers it seems to me have gotten  very good at anticipating people like me, the last-minute shopper, and that  helps their bottom line.</p><p>SIDES:  Oh it certainly does and being able to shorten the windows for  delivery certainly helps their ability to meet that demand I like you find  myself scrambling at the last minute.  So being able to meet those promise  ship dates are really important to make sure you get it by the holiday.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  There will be winners, but what about losers?  Anybody that you  feel will lag this year or struggle?</p><p>SIDES:  You know, I think if you don't have a very specific value  proposition for the consumer, you're always going to struggle.  So what we  find is that when you have unique product and distinctive product or if  you're trading on price, both ends of those spectrums have done quite well.   It's the businesses that are stuck in the middle that really don't have an  identity that I think will struggle over this holiday.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Ron, good to see you.  I would say to both you and Sue, it's  never too early to start shopping.</p><p>SIDES:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Rod Sides with Deloitte joining us tonight from Minneapolis.</p><p>HERERA:  I do it every year.</p><p>Profit stall at the used car seller Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) and that's where  we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The online auction company topped revenue estimates but said the  disappointing earnings were largely due to costs associated with Hurricane  Harvey.  Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) said it spent nearly eighty million dollars  on temporary storage facilities, overtime wages and employee lodging.   Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) shares skidded 13 percent to $55.58.</p><p>Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is reportedly nearing a deal to sell its Simon app  which sells complex investment products.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says a  number of rival banks including J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) are  in advanced talks with Goldman about making investments in that business.   Shares of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) rose nearly 3 percent to $235.58.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Drugmaker Crispr Therapeutic said that its planning to offer  $200 million worth of its common stock in a new public offering.  And as  often happens the news of a secondary offering initially sent shares of  that company lower in the extended session tonight it also finished the  regular session down about 2 percent at 51.89.</p><p>And then after the bell, software company Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) said a rise in  subscription revenue helped overall earnings top expectations.  Total sales  did miss estimates but the company gave weaker than expected guidance for  the current quarter and so shares initially fell in the after-hours.  They  finished the regular day up a fraction to $143.16.</p><p>And the stock of the day had to be Canadian marijuana company Tilray.   Shares of most of the cannabis-related stocks have been on a tear lately  anyway, but today was just crazy. Trading in Tilray had to be halted five  different times during the regular session all due to tremendous  volatility.  When all was said and done the stock finished up another 38  percent to $214.06.  And since its initial public offering just back on  July 19th, shares of Tilray are up more than 1,000 percent.</p><p>HERERA:  Which got us thinking because it's estimated that the marijuana  industry on a global scale could be worth nearly $60 billion in less than a  decade.  Corona maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) invested billions  into a cannabis producer, and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) said it is closely  watching the market for drink infused with CBD, that is the nonpsychoactive  component in marijuana.  </p><p>So, should investors consider getting in on the action?</p><p>Troy Dayton joins us now to discuss that.  He is the co-founder of the  Arcview Group.</p><p>Troy, welcome.  Nice to have you here.  What a day to have you here.</p><p>TROY DAYTON, ARCVIEW GROUP CO-FOUNDER:  Thanks for having me.  Yes, what a  day.</p><p>HERERA:  So, tell me where you think we are with the cannabis industry,  specifically the stocks, because Bill and I both saw the dot-com bubble and  it reminds me of that frankly.</p><p>DAYTON:  Yes, I mean, people are clearly very excited about the cannabis  industry and the performance of these stocks over the last few days and  past few months really shows that.  But the prices of these companies -- I  mean, they're bananas.  I mean, there's no way that that's going to stand  over time.  </p><p>That being said there are real fundamentals to this market.  It's growing  at a 26 percent compound annual growth rate over the next five years, and  people love cannabis and they're very excited.  The public opinion is  moving very far in favor of legalization, and there's a lot of hope for  additional policy reform.  And so, over time, I think people will grow into  these -- companies will grow into these valuations, but there's going to be  a lot of volatility along the way.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  That policy reform you're referring to obviously, cannabis is  still illegal at the federal level and in some states still here in the  United States.  That's a major headwind for this industry, right?</p><p>DAYTON:  Absolutely, it's part of what it's so interesting to see all these  stocks raising so much because a lot of that money can't get into the U.S.  right now.  And so, I think there's a lot of excitement and thinking that  policy change is going to happen.  And I sure hope all the people who are  making so much money on these stocks are going to use some of it to donate  to the legalization effort because right now, there are still millions of  people that wake up every day and fear of their government for these laws  while we're all trying to make as much money.</p><p>But I think the real opportunity right now is in private companies since  the public stocks are so overvalued at the moment, the opportunity is  really getting into these companies before they go public.  I mean, that's  what we really focus on.</p><p>HERERA:  Very quickly, is that the way that corporate America should play  it?  Because if you're a publicly traded company buying into an industry  that is Bill mentioned federally is illegal, I mean, that's kind of a dicey  proposition.  Should they go to the private companies?</p><p>DAYTON:  Absolutely.  Private or public, you still have the same legal  issues to deal with, and that's why so many companies are looking at Canada  and other countries that are passing laws as a place to begin or investing  in ancillary companies.  You know, you see companies like Scott's Miracle  Grow that are doing agricultural technology and these sorts of things, kind  of businesses that grow with the industry.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  No pun intended.  OK, Troy, thank you very much.</p><p>Troy Dayton with Arcview Group.</p><p>DAYTON:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, the cost of the cleanup.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  The global poverty rate has fallen to a record low.  The World  Bank says the proportion of people living below the poverty line has fallen  to 10 percent.  But the World Bank also warned that the pace of poverty  reduction has slowed.  The World Bank has a goal of reducing the poverty  rate to 3 percent by the year 2030.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  President Trump flew to North Carolina today where he toured the  damage from Hurricane Florence.  He assessed the response and promised to  help those displaced.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hurricane Florence was one  of the most powerful storms ever to hit the Carolinas, one of the most  powerful and devastating storms ever to hit our country.  To the families  who have lost loved ones, America grieves with you and our hearts break for  you.  God bless you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The president also predicted a costly cleanup, which is underway  with a focus on getting people back into their homes and businesses back up  and running.</p><p>Seema Mody is in hard-hit New Bern, North Carolina, for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The hurricane has  passed but the flooding and water damage is wreaking havoc across the  Carolinas.

So, right now, we're stabilizing the  environment, getting all the wet material out that we can, and getting it  ready to be rebuilt after we leave.</p><p>MODY:  Complicating the recovery efforts, access to power.

Bill has the evening off.</p><p>Investors have largely ignored all of the impeachment talk in Washington.   That is until today.  Calls for President Trump`s impeachment gained steam  and stocks hung on every headline during the trading session.</p><p>And then late today, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal inquiry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA (NASDAQ:CA)), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I`m directing  our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella  of impeachment inquiry.  The president must be held accountable.  No one is  above the law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  An increase in uncertainty is never good for stocks, whether it`s  political or economic.</p><p>And today, investors also grappled with weaker than expected economic  reports and concerns over trade with China.  As a result, the Dow Jones  industrial average fell 142 points to 26,807, the Nasdaq was down 118, and  the S&amp;P dropped 25.</p><p>Bob Pisani walks us through today`s return of volatility.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A toxic brew of  economic data.  Negative sentiment on China, trade and politics brought  volatility back to the markets today.  Stocks started positive but began  weakening just after the open on weaker consumer confidence numbers.   Remember, the U.S. consumer is hoping to prop up the world economy and  shortly after 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, President Trump emphasized the  negatives on China trade at his U.N. speech, saying China had not adopted  promised reforms and that it consistently stole intellectual property,  citing Micron as an example.</p><p>Then, about 12:30 Eastern Time, impeachment talk got louder as Speaker  Pelosi said she would make an announcement later today regarding  impeachment.  Markets came off the lows a little after 2:00 p.m. Eastern  Time when the president tweeted he`d be released at a transcript of his  conversation with the Ukraine president tomorrow but stocks drifted again  lower into the closed.</p><p>This is the first day by the way the S&amp;P has moved in a more than 1 percent  range in the last three weeks.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So why does Wall Street suddenly care about politics in  Washington?</p><p>We`re joined now by Jeff Bush, strategist at The Washington Update.</p><p>Welcome back, Jeff.  Nice to see you again.</p><p>JEFF BUSH, THE WASHINGTON UPDATE STRATEGIST:  Nice to see you, too, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  Let me start, first of all, with the issue of trade.  First of  all, the president had some very tough words in his U.N. General Assembly  addressed today to China.  But, secondly, if in -- as these proceedings,  these impeachment proceedings, continue, might it put the Chinese at an  advantage?  Do they wait out this whole process?</p><p>BUSH:  Well, I think that was the Chinese plan leading into that discussion  as well.  I think the president was using today`s speech at the U.N. to  level-set that negotiation once again, to begin that process and building  that relationship back up.  But I think the Chinese were playing a little  bit of slow ball to begin with.</p><p>HERERA:  What about fiscal policy?  Does anything get done as Washington  moves through this process?</p><p>BUSH:  Well, we`re already seeing the movement towards a continuing  resolution.  I think it`s very possible that we end up operating throughout  fiscal year on a continuing resolution, which is disappointing.  It means  that spending stays the same and we can`t begin new projects and new  programs, which is -- you know, not good for our country.  We should be  able to move forward with those programs.</p><p>HERERA:  There`s a lot of headline risk when any situation like this comes  up.  How vulnerable -- I mean, we saw certainly a lot of volatility and  reaction to every headline that came out today.  But as this process  continues, how vulnerable do you think the market is for headline risk?</p><p>BUSH:  Well I think the markets been pricing in a lot more volatility.   We`ve been speaking about it for about a year and a half, that we`re  building in these areas of uncertainty within the economy and within the  markets, and this is just one more to that list.</p><p>Today`s announcement of the impeachment inquiry, it really doesn`t  fundamentally change where we were before we had this understanding of this  Ukrainian situation.  Jerry Nadler was already pursuing that direction,  along with the other committee heads as well.</p><p>HERERA:  But interestingly enough, we didn`t see a lot of volatility.   Perhaps, it was simply that -- you know, that the speaker putting forward  the inquiry that made the difference to the Wall Street.  But --</p><p>BUSH:  That`s correct.</p><p>HERERA:  -- the odds though of the president actually being removed from  office are extremely low.</p><p>BUSH:  Very low.</p><p>HERERA:  So, could this be a move perhaps by the Democrats to get the  Senate back which would change the dynamic in terms of legislation, fiscal  policy, et cetera?</p><p>BUSH:  I actually would probably put forward the opposite opinion.  And  what I mean by that is it`s very hard for an incumbent presidency to  motivate the base in the second term election and if the Democrats pursue  an impeachment proceeding, that`s certainly going to fire up the Republican  base.  I would actually say that would lock in the Senate for the  Republicans just may that based on that effort.</p><p>HERERA:  So how do you see this progressing what might the fallout be for  the economy and for the markets?</p><p>BUSH:  Well, not dissimilar to the impeachment inquiries and impeachment  process that we went through with Bill Clinton.  I think the market will  initially react.  We saw a little bit of that today.  We`ll probably see  more here in the near term, certainly as new headlines hit.  There`s a lot  of things that are going to unfold over the next week with the transcript  coming out tomorrow, the testifying on Thursday.  All those things  represent that headline risk.</p><p>The bottom line, I don`t think there`s fundamental difference at this point  that the market needs to react to.</p><p>HERERA:  On that note, Jeff Bush with The Washington Update, thank you  again.</p><p>BUSH:  Thank you, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  As Bob mentioned earlier in the program, the president`s tough  talk on China during his address to the United Nations General Assembly  also contributed to the downbeat mood on Wall Street.</p><p>Eamon Javers is at the U.N. in New York.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump took  a harsh line on China today at his speech at the U.N., laying out his trade  war as part of a broader campaign that he says is to bring an end to this  process of globalization that he says too many leaders have engaged in over  the past several decades.  The president very specific about what he says  China has been doing wrong in the global economy.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Not only has China declined  to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on  massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation,  product dumping, forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual  property, and also trade secrets on a grand scale.</p><p>JAVERS:  The president`s criticisms of China were expected.  Less expected  though was his criticism of social media giants which he laid into in this  speech.</p><p>TRUMP:  A small number of social media platforms are acquiring immense  power over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say.  My  administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold  the right of free speech.  A free society cannot allow social media giants  to silence the voices of the people.</p><p>JAVERS:  The president also specifically named Iran as being responsible  for those attacks on the Saudi oil refineries that we saw last week.

The  British Supreme Court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson illegally  suspended parliament.  The ruling was a setback for Johnson and it means  that debate over how to leave the European Union can continue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  I have the highest respect of  course for judiciary and for the independence of our courts.  But I must  say I strongly disagree with this judgment and we in the U.K. will not be  deterred from getting on and delivering on the will of the people to come  out of the E.U. on October the 31st, because that is what we were mandated  to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  Johnson has pledged to see the U.K. leave the E.U. at the end of  October, even if there is no deal with the E.U. about how exactly it will  work.</p><p>And now to today`s mixed economic reports.  As mentioned, consumer  confidence fell more than expected in September.  Americans` outlook on the  economy grew more gloomy amid the trade war with China.</p><p>A separate report on housing showed a 3.2 percent gain in home prices in  July, the prices are still cooling in some of the nation`s largest cities.   As we`ve been reporting, lower mortgage rates have drawn homebuyers back  into the market.</p><p>A solid quarter for Nike (NYSE:NKE).  The athletic shoe and apparel company  reported better than expected earnings and revenue amid a sharp increase in  sales in China and despite rising trade tensions between the U.S. and  China.  Now, that sent the stock to a new high in initial after-hours  trading.</p><p>Sara Eisen has more on Nike`s quarter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Nike (NYSE:NKE)  optimists continue to be rewarded with another strong set of results, and  the results were strong around the globe.  But one particular highlight  continues to be China.  Nike (NYSE:NKE) saw 22 percent revenue growth in  China.  That would have been closer to 33 percent if not for the effect of  the stronger U.S. dollar.  That comes despite fears of a slowing Chinese  consumer and trade tensions rising between the U.S. and China.  Tariffs  flying back and forth and concerns about the perception of American brands.</p><p>Despite that, China continues to be the bright spot in the portfolio.  The  other big takeaway, Nike`s going direct to consumer and that`s leading to  higher growth from its rivals in places like North America, its home market  where Nike (NYSE:NKE) saw growth of 4 percent.  It means investing behind  its sneakers app, its Website, and its own stores and relying less on  wholesalers, department stores and Footlocker`s which aren`t doing as well.   Digital is another big part of that strategy.</p><p>And finally, higher margins, higher than the street was expecting and  continuing to rise, showing that Nike (NYSE:NKE) is able to charge more  higher selling prices of its sneakers, delighting consumers with new  innovations like VaporMax and get better margins for it.</p><p>Andy Campion, the CFO, summed it up in the earnings release, saying even  amidst the increasingly volatile macro economic and geopolitical  environment, we expect our unrelenting focus on better serving the consumer  to continue to fuel strong growth across the global portfolio.  The results  from Nike (NYSE:NKE) showed that despite the stronger dollar, weakening  global economy and rising geopolitical risks, Nike (NYSE:NKE) continues to  speak to the consumer.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sara Eisen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And joining us now with more on Nike`s earnings is Mariann  Montagne.  She is a portfolio manager at Gradient Investments.</p><p>Welcome back, Mariann.  Nice to see you again.</p><p>MARIANN MONTAGNE, GRADIENT INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Nice to see you,  too, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  Sara gave us some of the takeaways from Nike`s report.  But what  really stood out to you?</p><p>MONTAGNE:  There were several things that stood out.  I mean, the strengths  in China was phenomenal, but also the margin expansion.  So we had a 1.5  percentage point gain in the gross margin and again, if that`s related to  pricing.  And then, we also had an expansion of the operating margin, which  means they were able to leverage all their fixed expenses and their  marketing.  That was something that pulled back on the report on the prior  quarter.</p><p>And so, it was nice to see that turnaround and they`re very strong back-to- school season.</p><p>HERERA:  Did the strength in China surprised you and do you expect that to  continue given the fact that there`s been very little progress made on the  trade front?</p><p>MONTAGNE:  Right, what I think it shows is that they`re so strong demand  for their particular product.  So we`ve heard reports about the Chinese  trying to stay away from American brands and everything.  I guess they  don`t care when it comes to their kicks.  They just like that Nike  (NYSE:NKE) style and they`re going after it, in all of the greater China,  greater Asia area and Latin America as well.</p><p>So, they`re taking share from others and I think that really speaks well of  the company and how they`re designing product for the particular customers.</p><p>HERERA:  Yes, the innovation certainly stood in the report.  So did their  digital initiatives.  That seems to be paying off.</p><p>MONTAGNE:  Yes.  You know, everyone likes to have their own individual  everything, and they`ve made it so easy to design your own shoes and get  exactly what you want, what you need.  So it`s awesome that they`ve been  able to produce these results.  We did not expect a 28 percent increase in  earnings per share.  We were looking for something more like 6 percent, in  line with the consensus thinking.</p><p>HERERA:  And that`s with a strong currency as well.</p><p>MONTAGNE:  Right, right.  So this has just been, you know, another  demonstration of knowing their customer, being super flexible in terms of  catering to their customers, and really taking share from others.</p><p>HERERA:  What would you say -- was it -- was there anything that that  worried you in the report or where you saw a weak spot?</p><p>MONTAGNE:  I guess if there was any weak spot, it would be in North America  where sales were only up 4 percent.  But I don`t think that number is going  to stay that low for long.</p><p>HERERA: Mariann Montagne with Gradient Investments -- Mariann, thank you so  much.</p><p>MONTAGNE:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and  Downgrades\".</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was upgraded to buy at Jeffries.

ANNE SCHUCHAT, CDC PRINCIPAL DEPUTY DIRECTOR:  It may not even be the  THC or nicotine part.  It may be additives or substances that may be  common.

Across the Atlantic, the  highest court and the European Union issued a landmark ruling in favor of  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).

The plan follows Senator Elizabeth  Warren`s own wealth tax that has helped lift her in the polls.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  What we are saying to  the billionaire class is stop the greed, stop the greed, stop the  corruption, stop stepping on everybody in order to make more and more  billionaires.</p><p>FRANK:  Sanders` plan would affect taxpayers worth $32 million or more or  about 180,000 households in the U.S.  It`s a sliding scale starting at 1  percent but quickly rising to 8 percent for those with over $10 billion.</p><p>Jeff Bezos would pay about $9 billion in wealth taxes just this year under  the plan, along with his income tax, property taxes and capital gains  taxes.

Back in 2015, U.S.  officials disclosed that V.W. had rigged millions of diesel-powered  vehicles to cheat emissions tests for nearly a decade.

There`s a big push  to go back to the moon and NASA is letting Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) lead  the way, awarding it a major contract that could create a lot of jobs.</p><p>Morgan Brennan has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Three, two, one --</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Another step closer  to the moon, NASA awarding Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) a contract.  The deal  valued at up to $4.6 billion to put Orion into production.   The deal to  buy six spacecrafts with an option to up that to twelve.</p><p>SHEILA KAHYAOGLU, JEFFERIES AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE ANALYST:  So this was  Lockheed contract to win.  This is within Lockheed space segment which  accounts for about 20 percent of revenues and segment earnings, and this is  within their satellite sub segment.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Orion was designed for deep space exploration with astronauts.   Hardware belonging to the agency but built by Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).</p><p>NASA plans to use Orion to send astronauts to the moon, a lynchpin in the  Artemis Program to put boots back on the lunar surface in five years and  then establish a permanent outpost.</p><p>Over the years, Orion has drawn criticism due to delays and ballooning  costs.  But this contract signals a shift and commitment to its production  longer-term, cementing Orion`s place prominently in the Artemis program.</p><p>KAHYAOGLU:  I think it sends a strong message that the U.S. is open to  human exploration to the moon and potentially to Mars, and you know, that  program was previously shut down in 2011, and Constellation was cancelled.   So, this reopens that and it says that the U.S. no longer wants to use  other countries` capacity to shuttle human beings back and forth.</p><p>BRENNAN:  But it also speaks to the turf battle between states after  another piece of the Artemis plan went to Alabama`s Marshall Space Flight  Center, Texas lawmakers loudly voiced opposition.</p><p>Orion will be managed at Texas Johnson Space Center, getting to the heart  of why space much like defense is seen as so crucial, not just because of  national security and innovation but because space programs are jobs  programs.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And before we go, here`s a final look at the day on Wall Street.

Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is awarded billions of dollars to power the next lunar landing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Tuesday, September 24th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome. Bill has the evening off.</p><p>Investors have largely ignored all of the impeachment talk in Washington. That is until today. Calls for President Trump`s impeachment gained steam and stocks hung on every headline during the trading session.</p><p>And then late today, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal inquiry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA (NASDAQ:CA)), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I`m directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry. The president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: An increase in uncertainty is never good for stocks, whether it`s political or economic.</p><p>And today, investors also grappled with weaker than expected economic reports and concerns over trade with China. As a result, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 142 points to 26,807, the Nasdaq was down 118, and the S&amp;P dropped 25.</p><p>Bob Pisani walks us through today`s return of volatility.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A toxic brew of economic data. Negative sentiment on China, trade and politics brought volatility back to the markets today. Stocks started positive but began weakening just after the open on weaker consumer confidence numbers. Remember, the U.S. consumer is hoping to prop up the world economy and shortly after 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, President Trump emphasized the negatives on China trade at his U.N. speech, saying China had not adopted promised reforms and that it consistently stole intellectual property, citing Micron as an example.</p><p>Then, about 12:30 Eastern Time, impeachment talk got louder as Speaker Pelosi said she would make an announcement later today regarding impeachment. Markets came off the lows a little after 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time when the president tweeted he`d be released at a transcript of his conversation with the Ukraine president tomorrow but stocks drifted again lower into the closed.</p><p>This is the first day by the way the S&amp;P has moved in a more than 1 percent range in the last three weeks.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So why does Wall Street suddenly care about politics in Washington?</p><p>We`re joined now by Jeff Bush, strategist at The Washington Update.</p><p>Welcome back, Jeff. Nice to see you again.</p><p>JEFF BUSH, THE WASHINGTON UPDATE STRATEGIST: Nice to see you, too, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: Let me start, first of all, with the issue of trade. First of all, the president had some very tough words in his U.N. General Assembly addressed today to China. But, secondly, if in -- as these proceedings, these impeachment proceedings, continue, might it put the Chinese at an advantage? Do they wait out this whole process?</p><p>BUSH: Well, I think that was the Chinese plan leading into that discussion as well. I think the president was using today`s speech at the U.N. to level-set that negotiation once again, to begin that process and building that relationship back up. But I think the Chinese were playing a little bit of slow ball to begin with.</p><p>HERERA: What about fiscal policy? Does anything get done as Washington moves through this process?</p><p>BUSH: Well, we`re already seeing the movement towards a continuing resolution. I think it`s very possible that we end up operating throughout fiscal year on a continuing resolution, which is disappointing. It means that spending stays the same and we can`t begin new projects and new programs, which is -- you know, not good for our country. We should be able to move forward with those programs.</p><p>HERERA: There`s a lot of headline risk when any situation like this comes up. How vulnerable -- I mean, we saw certainly a lot of volatility and reaction to every headline that came out today. But as this process continues, how vulnerable do you think the market is for headline risk?</p><p>BUSH: Well I think the markets been pricing in a lot more volatility. We`ve been speaking about it for about a year and a half, that we`re building in these areas of uncertainty within the economy and within the markets, and this is just one more to that list.</p><p>Today`s announcement of the impeachment inquiry, it really doesn`t fundamentally change where we were before we had this understanding of this Ukrainian situation. Jerry Nadler was already pursuing that direction, along with the other committee heads as well.</p><p>HERERA: But interestingly enough, we didn`t see a lot of volatility. Perhaps, it was simply that -- you know, that the speaker putting forward the inquiry that made the difference to the Wall Street. But --</p><p>BUSH: That`s correct.</p><p>HERERA: -- the odds though of the president actually being removed from office are extremely low.</p><p>BUSH: Very low.</p><p>HERERA: So, could this be a move perhaps by the Democrats to get the Senate back which would change the dynamic in terms of legislation, fiscal policy, et cetera?</p><p>BUSH: I actually would probably put forward the opposite opinion. And what I mean by that is it`s very hard for an incumbent presidency to motivate the base in the second term election and if the Democrats pursue an impeachment proceeding, that`s certainly going to fire up the Republican base. I would actually say that would lock in the Senate for the Republicans just may that based on that effort.</p><p>HERERA: So how do you see this progressing what might the fallout be for the economy and for the markets?</p><p>BUSH: Well, not dissimilar to the impeachment inquiries and impeachment process that we went through with Bill Clinton. I think the market will initially react. We saw a little bit of that today. We`ll probably see more here in the near term, certainly as new headlines hit. There`s a lot of things that are going to unfold over the next week with the transcript coming out tomorrow, the testifying on Thursday. All those things represent that headline risk.</p><p>The bottom line, I don`t think there`s fundamental difference at this point that the market needs to react to.</p><p>HERERA: On that note, Jeff Bush with The Washington Update, thank you again.</p><p>BUSH: Thank you, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: As Bob mentioned earlier in the program, the president`s tough talk on China during his address to the United Nations General Assembly also contributed to the downbeat mood on Wall Street.</p><p>Eamon Javers is at the U.N. in New York.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: President Trump took a harsh line on China today at his speech at the U.N., laying out his trade war as part of a broader campaign that he says is to bring an end to this process of globalization that he says too many leaders have engaged in over the past several decades. The president very specific about what he says China has been doing wrong in the global economy.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property, and also trade secrets on a grand scale.</p><p>JAVERS: The president`s criticisms of China were expected. Less expected though was his criticism of social media giants which he laid into in this speech.</p><p>TRUMP: A small number of social media platforms are acquiring immense power over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say. My administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech. A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people.</p><p>JAVERS: The president also specifically named Iran as being responsible for those attacks on the Saudi oil refineries that we saw last week. The president not though specifying what specific action he wants to take to punish Iran for those attacks.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ayman Javers at the United Nations.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: There was political drama in the United Kingdom as well. The British Supreme Court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson illegally suspended parliament. The ruling was a setback for Johnson and it means that debate over how to leave the European Union can continue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I have the highest respect of course for judiciary and for the independence of our courts. But I must say I strongly disagree with this judgment and we in the U.K. will not be deterred from getting on and delivering on the will of the people to come out of the E.U. on October the 31st, because that is what we were mandated to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: Johnson has pledged to see the U.K. leave the E.U. at the end of October, even if there is no deal with the E.U. about how exactly it will work.</p><p>And now to today`s mixed economic reports. As mentioned, consumer confidence fell more than expected in September. Americans` outlook on the economy grew more gloomy amid the trade war with China.</p><p>A separate report on housing showed a 3.2 percent gain in home prices in July, the prices are still cooling in some of the nation`s largest cities. As we`ve been reporting, lower mortgage rates have drawn homebuyers back into the market.</p><p>A solid quarter for Nike (NYSE:NKE). The athletic shoe and apparel company reported better than expected earnings and revenue amid a sharp increase in sales in China and despite rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Now, that sent the stock to a new high in initial after-hours trading.</p><p>Sara Eisen has more on Nike`s quarter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Nike (NYSE:NKE) optimists continue to be rewarded with another strong set of results, and the results were strong around the globe. But one particular highlight continues to be China. Nike (NYSE:NKE) saw 22 percent revenue growth in China. That would have been closer to 33 percent if not for the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar. That comes despite fears of a slowing Chinese consumer and trade tensions rising between the U.S. and China. Tariffs flying back and forth and concerns about the perception of American brands.</p><p>Despite that, China continues to be the bright spot in the portfolio. The other big takeaway, Nike`s going direct to consumer and that`s leading to higher growth from its rivals in places like North America, its home market where Nike (NYSE:NKE) saw growth of 4 percent. It means investing behind its sneakers app, its Website, and its own stores and relying less on wholesalers, department stores and Footlocker`s which aren`t doing as well. Digital is another big part of that strategy.</p><p>And finally, higher margins, higher than the street was expecting and continuing to rise, showing that Nike (NYSE:NKE) is able to charge more higher selling prices of its sneakers, delighting consumers with new innovations like VaporMax and get better margins for it.</p><p>Andy Campion, the CFO, summed it up in the earnings release, saying even amidst the increasingly volatile macro economic and geopolitical environment, we expect our unrelenting focus on better serving the consumer to continue to fuel strong growth across the global portfolio. The results from Nike (NYSE:NKE) showed that despite the stronger dollar, weakening global economy and rising geopolitical risks, Nike (NYSE:NKE) continues to speak to the consumer.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sara Eisen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And joining us now with more on Nike`s earnings is Mariann Montagne. She is a portfolio manager at Gradient Investments.</p><p>Welcome back, Mariann. Nice to see you again.</p><p>MARIANN MONTAGNE, GRADIENT INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Nice to see you, too, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: Sara gave us some of the takeaways from Nike`s report. But what really stood out to you?</p><p>MONTAGNE: There were several things that stood out. I mean, the strengths in China was phenomenal, but also the margin expansion. So we had a 1.5 percentage point gain in the gross margin and again, if that`s related to pricing. And then, we also had an expansion of the operating margin, which means they were able to leverage all their fixed expenses and their marketing. That was something that pulled back on the report on the prior quarter.</p><p>And so, it was nice to see that turnaround and they`re very strong back-to- school season.</p><p>HERERA: Did the strength in China surprised you and do you expect that to continue given the fact that there`s been very little progress made on the trade front?</p><p>MONTAGNE: Right, what I think it shows is that they`re so strong demand for their particular product. So we`ve heard reports about the Chinese trying to stay away from American brands and everything. I guess they don`t care when it comes to their kicks. They just like that Nike (NYSE:NKE) style and they`re going after it, in all of the greater China, greater Asia area and Latin America as well.</p><p>So, they`re taking share from others and I think that really speaks well of the company and how they`re designing product for the particular customers.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, the innovation certainly stood in the report. So did their digital initiatives. That seems to be paying off.</p><p>MONTAGNE: Yes. You know, everyone likes to have their own individual everything, and they`ve made it so easy to design your own shoes and get exactly what you want, what you need. So it`s awesome that they`ve been able to produce these results. We did not expect a 28 percent increase in earnings per share. We were looking for something more like 6 percent, in line with the consensus thinking.</p><p>HERERA: And that`s with a strong currency as well.</p><p>MONTAGNE: Right, right. So this has just been, you know, another demonstration of knowing their customer, being super flexible in terms of catering to their customers, and really taking share from others.</p><p>HERERA: What would you say -- was it -- was there anything that that worried you in the report or where you saw a weak spot?</p><p>MONTAGNE: I guess if there was any weak spot, it would be in North America where sales were only up 4 percent. But I don`t think that number is going to stay that low for long.</p><p>HERERA: Mariann Montagne with Gradient Investments -- Mariann, thank you so much.</p><p>MONTAGNE: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was upgraded to buy at Jeffries. The analyst says Wall Street is underestimating how much money Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will make from 5G. The price target is $260. Despite the upgrade though, the stock fell a fraction to $217.68.</p><p>Coverage of Disney (NYSE:DIS) was initiated with an outperform rating at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). The analyst calls Disney (NYSE:DIS) the best name in media. As you know, Disney (NYSE:DIS) will soon launch its streaming service. The price target is $173. The shares were down slightly to $131.97.</p><p>Ralph Lauren was upgraded to overweight from neutral at Atlantic Equities. The analyst cites the company solid turnaround and stock valuation. The price target is $138, and the stock was down just a fraction to $92.60.</p><p>Still ahead, Senator Sanders says billionaires should not exist and proposes a new tax on the richest Americans.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: WeWork`s co-founder and CEO was forced to step down from his company. Adam Neumann will become non-executive chairman of the embattled shared office company which had been one of the most valuable startups of the last decade. The resignation is designed to win over investors after WeWork`s initial public offering was delayed and its value declined.</p><p>The governor of Massachusetts has declared a public health emergency and imposed a four month ban on the sales of all vaping products. The state will block sales of e-cigarettes used for tobacco and marijuana. On Capitol Hill, an official from the Centers for Disease Control today told lawmakers that consumers should avoid all vaping products until the cause of recent lung illnesses and deaths is identified.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANNE SCHUCHAT, CDC PRINCIPAL DEPUTY DIRECTOR: It may not even be the THC or nicotine part. It may be additives or substances that may be common. It may be material that is not labeled appropriately. And so, we really do think consumers need to be quite unconscious right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: The doctor also said hundreds of new vaping illnesses have been reported in the last week.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is making an acquisition that sounds like something out of a science fiction novel. It`s buying a company that specializes in allowing humans to control computers using their brains. The size of the deal is reported to be between $500 million and $1 billion dollars. The startup will work to develop augmented reality smart glasses.</p><p>And Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is one of the companies that`s under increased scrutiny from Washington due to privacy and competition issues. Today, the debate over the future of big tech took shape, with developments here and in Europe.</p><p>Ylan Mui is in Washington tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A big win for big tech overseas, but it`s still under siege at home. Across the Atlantic, the highest court and the European Union issued a landmark ruling in favor of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). The court found that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) does not have to apply the right to be forgotten to search results worldwide. E.U. users can only request that personal information be removed from searches that occur within the E.U.</p><p>In a statement, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) said that it`s worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten in Europe and strike a sensible balance between the right to access information and the right to privacy.</p><p>Here in the U.S., California will be the first state to implement a European-style privacy law next year, a new state analysis finds that could cost businesses as much as $16 billion to comply.</p><p>That could all shape the debate on Capitol Hill over the need for a national privacy bill. At the same time, lawmakers are growing more worried about the potential for monopoly power in big tech.</p><p>At a hearing this afternoon, Republicans and Democrats took Internet giant`s and the regulator`s that oversee them to task.</p><p>SEN .MIKE LEE (R-UT), JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Well, I`m encouraged that the FTC and the DOJ are investigating whether the tech giants have violated antitrust laws. I`m also concerned that we might overshoot the mark in our efforts to rein in those firms.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), JUDICIARY COMMITTEE RANKING MEMBER: I`m more concerned that consumers are going to end up with a pie in their face if we don`t start taking action soon.</p><p>MUI: There`s no sign that either party is willing to let up.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Disappointing results for BlackBerry, and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The communication software provider posted weaker than expected revenue, citing softness in its enterprise software unit. BlackBerry also lowered its guidance. The shares fell more than 22 percent to $5.81.</p><p>Engineering and construction firm Fluor (NYSE:FLR) will be cutting its dividend in half and sell its government and equipment rental businesses. The company is looking to raise billion dollars from the asset sale as part of its strategic review. The shares dropped nearly eight and a half percent to $18.95.</p><p>Strong used vehicle sales helped CarMax (NYSE:KMX) top analysts expectations. The auto retailer has now beaten Wall Street`s estimates for six straight quarters, but the stock fell a fraction today to $86.74.</p><p>But AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) is warning customers it will be raising prices to combat tariffs. The company`s CEO says the increase could be as much as 25 percent. This comes as the auto parts retailer saw same store sales rise thank to ongoing demand after market car parts and accessories. The shares dropped about four and a half percent to finish at $1,096.63.</p><p>Electronic manufacturer Jabil topped estimates thanks to an increase in demand for 5G, cloud, energy and health care services. Separately, the company will buy back up to $600 million of its shares. Jabil rose about 5 percent to $32.85.</p><p>Taxing the wealthy has become a common call among some of the Democratic presidential hopefuls. Today, Senator Bernie Sanders released his plan which would hit multibillionaires especially hard.</p><p>Here`s Robert Frank.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Senator Bernie Sanders launching a new wealth tax proposal that would cut billionaire forces in half over the next 15 years. The plan follows Senator Elizabeth Warren`s own wealth tax that has helped lift her in the polls.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What we are saying to the billionaire class is stop the greed, stop the greed, stop the corruption, stop stepping on everybody in order to make more and more billionaires.</p><p>FRANK: Sanders` plan would affect taxpayers worth $32 million or more or about 180,000 households in the U.S. It`s a sliding scale starting at 1 percent but quickly rising to 8 percent for those with over $10 billion.</p><p>Jeff Bezos would pay about $9 billion in wealth taxes just this year under the plan, along with his income tax, property taxes and capital gains taxes. Bill Gates would face an eight and a half billion dollar tax bill, while Warren Buffett would pay around six and a half billion. Now, the top 10 billionaires in the country would pay nearly $60 billion in wealth taxes just this year.</p><p>The economists who advised Sanders on the plan estimated will raise four and a half trillion dollars in revenue over ten years, about twice the amount of Warren`s plan. They said it would have no exemptions, be vigorously enforced to keep tax evasion low, and, quote, entirely close the gap in wealth growth between billionaires and the average American family.</p><p>Polls show that more than 60 percent of voters including nearly half of Republicans support a wealth tax on the richest Americans.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) lands a mega deal to get mankind back to the moon.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Executives at Volkswagen were charged by German prosecutors for allegedly misleading shareholders in the months before the emissions- cheating scandal. The indictment argues that the CEO and chairman along with former CEO martin Winterkorn withheld information about the scandal in an attempt to prop up the automakers stock price. Back in 2015, U.S. officials disclosed that V.W. had rigged millions of diesel-powered vehicles to cheat emissions tests for nearly a decade. Volkswagen is the world`s largest automaker.</p><p>One-point-three million more workers will be able to receive overtime pay. The Labor Department today finalized a rule expanding eligibility, which is effective January 1st. Under that rule, most salaried workers who earn less than $35,000 per year will be eligible, and that`s up from the current threshold of about $23,000.</p><p>And we finished the program tonight with a different kind of story, one that takes us far from politics and to the space race. There`s a big push to go back to the moon and NASA is letting Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) lead the way, awarding it a major contract that could create a lot of jobs.</p><p>Morgan Brennan has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Three, two, one --</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Another step closer to the moon, NASA awarding Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) a contract. The deal valued at up to $4.6 billion to put Orion into production. The deal to buy six spacecrafts with an option to up that to twelve.</p><p>SHEILA KAHYAOGLU, JEFFERIES AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE ANALYST: So this was Lockheed contract to win. This is within Lockheed space segment which accounts for about 20 percent of revenues and segment earnings, and this is within their satellite sub segment.</p><p>BRENNAN: Orion was designed for deep space exploration with astronauts. Hardware belonging to the agency but built by Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).</p><p>NASA plans to use Orion to send astronauts to the moon, a lynchpin in the Artemis Program to put boots back on the lunar surface in five years and then establish a permanent outpost.</p><p>Over the years, Orion has drawn criticism due to delays and ballooning costs. But this contract signals a shift and commitment to its production longer-term, cementing Orion`s place prominently in the Artemis program.</p><p>KAHYAOGLU: I think it sends a strong message that the U.S. is open to human exploration to the moon and potentially to Mars, and you know, that program was previously shut down in 2011, and Constellation was cancelled. So, this reopens that and it says that the U.S. no longer wants to use other countries` capacity to shuttle human beings back and forth.</p><p>BRENNAN: But it also speaks to the turf battle between states after another piece of the Artemis plan went to Alabama`s Marshall Space Flight Center, Texas lawmakers loudly voiced opposition.</p><p>Orion will be managed at Texas Johnson Space Center, getting to the heart of why space much like defense is seen as so crucial, not just because of national security and innovation but because space programs are jobs programs.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And before we go, here`s a final look at the day on Wall Street. The Dow fell 142 points, the Nasdaq was down 118, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 25.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.

I`m Contessa Brewer, in tonight for Sue Herera and Bill Griffeth.</p><p>We begin with an important aspect of the American economy: interest rates. Today, the Federal Reserve lifted the benchmark rate for the third time this career, the eighth time since 2015. Fed Chair Jerome Powell called the economy strong and he said he is not concerned about inflation.</p><p>The upbeat outlook led the central bank to increase its forecast for growth this year and next.</p><p>Steve Liesman is in Washington with more on today`s decision.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Federal Reserve raising interest rates by a quarter percentage point as expected to a new range of 2 to 2.25 percent all but signaling another rate hike is coming as soon as December.</p><p>Fed Chairman Jay Powell was pretty clear why the Fed is taking this course of action.</p><p>POWELL: Our economy is strong. Growth is running at a healthy clip. Unemployment is low. The number of people working is rising steadily. And wages are up. Inflation is low and stable. All of these are very good signs.</p><p>LIESMAN: Amid expectations for the good times to continue Fed officials on average forecast the rates will rise another 75 basis points next year and finish above 3 percent. But Powell also said there are risks out there to raising rates and risks to not raising rates.</p><p>POWELL: If we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery unnecessarily. And inflation falls short of its 2 percent target. Or if we move too slowly, we have an economy that overheats.</p><p>So, we`re -- that`s happened through history. We don`t see any signs of that now. But we`re always trying to navigate between those two shoals. And think that gradually raising interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those risks seriously.</p><p>LIESMAN: Powell didn`t seem overly concerned about the high level of the stock market or lots of debt on the books of corporations. But he did say it represented a risk.</p><p>He also said that tariffs represent a risk to the economy, but hadn`t shown up yet in the economic data.</p><p>So, Powell said these are good times and the Fed thinks by nudging rates higher and stopping at a low, he can let the good times roll just a little bit longer.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER: Well, interest rates influence everything from the economy to the financial markets. So what could the path of rate hikes mean for your investments?</p><p>David Lebovitz is a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</p><p>David, good to you today.</p><p>When we`re talking about this rate hike, what will we expect to see as an impact on the overall economy?</p><p>DAVID LEBOVITZ, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT: So, you know, I think that the Fed, to Chairman Powell`s point, is trying to move gradually. They`re trying to telegraph exactly what they`re doing. But, you know, frankly, with eight rate hikes since 2015, we`ve already a seen a bit of a slowdown this year in auto spending. We`ve seen a slowdown in home spending.</p><p>So, I think higher rates are already taking hold on some of the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the U.S. economy. Obviously, growth has remained relatively robust given all the fiscal stimulus being pumped into the system. But, you know, my expectation is that as rates continue to move higher, you could see the more interest rate sensitive sectors like autos and housing come under pressure over the next few quarters.</p><p>BREWER: And we saw that even today with utilities. Are we expecting to see that markets, stocks with equities here that people might be invested in their 401(k)s?</p><p>LEBOVITZ: So, I think that equities it`s important to draw a line between those stocks that benefit from higher interest rates and those stocks that come under pressure from higher interest rates. You know, a lot of investors have used things like utility stocks, consumer staple stocks, telecom stocks as a way of producing more income in the portfolios over the course of the current expansion given that interest rates have been low for the majority of this economic growth period.</p><p>But, you know, if you think about things like financials, technology, energy, they do fairly well when interest rates rise. So, we think that investors probably need to be more selective at the current juncture. We certainly expect the high dividend paying sectors to remain under pressure, but that doesn`t mean there are no opportunities that investors can take advantage of.</p><p>BREWER: And what`s the impact of these rate hikes on treasuries? We saw the yield moving lower today.</p><p>LEBOVITZ: Yes. So, obviously, when interest rates rise bond prices fall and a lot of investors that I`ve been speaking with have noted they`re seeing negative returns from bond funds for the first time in a number of years. You know, I think the treasury yields coming down today were a reflection of the market interpreting the Fed comments as being a little bit softer, a little bit more dovish than they were expecting.</p><p>Frankly, we still think the path of least resistance for interest rates is higher. The Fed is going to hike again in December. In our view we think two or three times next year. That should lead interest rates grinding higher the next 18 months.</p><p>BREWER: David Lebovitz with J.P. Morgan Asset Management -- David, good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>LEBOVITZ: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BREWER: Interest rates also influence the cost of borrowing, the return on savings and your pocketbook overall. We joined by Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at bankrate.com.</p><p>All right. Let`s dive into the ways that we might see this. When it comes to what a lot of people across the nation have auto loans. Will we see higher rates translating to what we pay per month for autos?</p><p>MARK HAMRICK, BANKRATE.COM SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST: Well, first of all, if you already have an auto loan, that is not likely to change. We are talking about auto loans for future customers. And, you know, our point of living at Bank Rate is to remind people to shop around. That holds true across the borrowing universe.</p><p>And let`s remember that while there may be an average rate of let`s say 5 percent for auto loans and likely be going higher, that shoppers can do better than that and auto makers continue to add incentives including low cost financing.</p><p>BREWER: And what about mortgages? Will you see impact on mortgages?</p><p>HAMRICK: Really more so for adjustable rates. Those who have fixed rates mortgages, obviously, those are fixed by definition. So for those who are either still coming into the market and will expect to be in their homes in future years, a number of years, we generally recommend that they look at fixed rate mortgages and for those who have rates that are going to reset, they want to look at how much longer they`ll be in their home and possibly refinance into a fixed rate mortgage.</p><p>BREWER: All right. And then, finally, I wanted to ask you in terms of the impact on what we`re paying, what about credit card debt? A lot of Americans carry some debt from month-to-month. Will you see of an impact there?</p><p>HAMRICK: Yes, absolutely. I tend to underscore this more than anything else when it comes to borrowing because we`ve now crossed over the trillion dollar level in terms of credit card debt. Since the Fed began tightening, obviously raising its benchmark rate by 2 percent since the beginning in 2015, we have seen the average for credit cards go up from 15 percent level into the 17 percent level.</p><p>And as we have already established here, we do look for perhaps as many as four rate hikes over the coming years. So, that means that we might be two third of the way through the rate hikes. So, at Bank Rate, we continue to advice people to pay down or better off pay off credit card debt and continue to save.</p><p>BREWER: All right. So, if that`s the advice there, are they -- you know, on ways that you avoid some of pain that might come with the rate hike. Do you have advice for people on how to take advantage of a coming rate hike?</p><p>HAMRICK: Absolutely. Well, I like to say that savers were the often forgotten casualties of the low interest rate environment which was essentially the medicine the Federal Reserve had to employ in the midst of a financial crisis. Slowly but surely, we are seeing savings rates rise.</p><p>But again, it`s really amazing -- and this is demonstrated on our site how much variance we see if you just shop around. So, while we might say that for example the average on a one-year CD is below 1 percent. You can get substantially higher than that by shopping, same for 2-year CDs, five-year CDs as well.</p><p>BREWER: All right. Mark Hamrick with BankRate.com, thanks for the advice.</p><p>HAMRICK: Great to be with you. Thank you.</p><p>BREWER: Those inflation comments from the Fed chief set off a chain of events on Wall Street. Bond yields turned lowered, which pressured bank stocks and because of the financial sector which is, of course, critical, the broader market fell, gave up earlier gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 106 points to 26,385. The Nasdaq was off 17. And the S&amp;P 500 was down 9.</p><p>In a speech to the United Nations Security Council, President Trump called out China, not for its trade tactics but for trying to influence the upcoming midterm elections.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Regrettably, we found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November, against my administration. They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade. And we are winning on trade. We are winning at every level.</p><p>We don`t want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREWER: Experts say those comments open up a new front in Trump`s administration posture towards the world`s second largest economy.</p><p>Well, we want to take time to look at today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>IBM was upgraded to buy from neutral at UBS. The analyst cites strong demand for services, artificial intelligence and cloud offerings. The price target is $180. The stock rose more than 1 percent to $151.61.</p><p>GoPro`s rating was lifted to outperform from perform at Oppenheimer. The analyst there calls its product compelling. The price target $9. The stock gained 4 percent to $6.92.</p><p>Activision Blizzard`s price target was raised to $88 at Piper Jaffray. The analyst says the game \"Call of Duty: Black Ops 4\" could help boost earnings. The firm maintains the overweight rating, shares gained 1 percent to $81.57.</p><p>And still ahead, a new phone scam and a call that no parent ever expects to get.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BREWER: San Francisco officials have temporarily should down the city`s new $2 billion transit center after a crack was found in a steel beam. Engineers are now inspecting that beam. The new transit hub opened a month ago. And it`s expected to accommodate 100,000 passengers each weekday.</p><p>The House of Representatives tonight passed an $850 spending bill. That measure funds the Defense Department and includes a plan to avoid a government shutdown Sunday but the president still has to agree and sign the measure.</p><p>Executives from major tech companies were back on Capitol Hill, testifying on consumer privacy. And today, they were pushing lawmakers to establish federal regulations.</p><p>Julia Boorstin explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Executives from AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Twitter and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) taking the stand before the Senate Commerce Committee to answer question base how they protect consumer data in the most effective way to craft regulation.</p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R), SOUTH DAKOTA: There is a strong desire by both Republicans and Democrats and by both industry and public interest groups to work in good faith to reach a consensus on a national consumer data privacy law that will help consumers promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.</p><p>KEITH ENRIGHT, GOOGLE CHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER: We do not sell personal information. We acknowledge we made mistakes in the past from which we learned and improved our privacy program. We understand that the foundation of our business is trust.</p><p>BOORSTIN: With the general consensus that regulation is inevitable, the question is what the laws will look like. And companies would prefer to have federal legislation because the consistency is easier to navigate than a patchwork of state laws.</p><p>The concern many tech giants testifying, this summer, California passed a new privacy law considered comprehensive and stringent, and could hinder their growth.</p><p>ERIC HIPPEAU, LERER HIPPEAU: Now what we are seeing is that the states while the federal government is discussing it and not doing anything, the states are moving, starting with California. And now, they are talking about it. So, the federal government is under pressure now to come up with a law. Otherwise, you`re going to have a patchwork of laws which will be unworkable.</p><p>BOORSTIN: With Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) saying complying with European privacy regulation is a tremendous challenge, warning that similar laws here would hurt start-ups. The question is what regulations will look like.</p><p>STEPHANIE MEHTA, FAST COMPANY: Companies love to complaint about regulation. And yes it`s a burden. But I think the bigger problem for companies is uncertainty. I think that, you know, if they have a regulatory framework they can work within and that they can help shape, which is why I think you`re seeing so many of these big companies say we are in favor of some sort of regulatory framework because they want to be part of the rule-making progress.</p><p>BOORSTIN: With questioning focusing on the potential for mandatory notification of data breaches within a certain time period and question base whether consumer should have to affirmatively opt in to having their data used and shared, Congress is trying to figure out what kind of rules could protect consumers without hindering innovation and growth.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER: CarMax (NYSE:KMX) topped expectations and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The car retailer said new digital initiatives helped drive an increase in same store sales. And that led to an overall earnings beat. The company points to results lifted by higher selling prices for used vehicles. Shared finished the day down more than 1 percent to $74.66.</p><p>Papa John`s ousted founder is not walking away from the pizza chain without a fight. John Schnatter has contacted a number of private equity firms to buy back the restaurant chain he left earlier this year. Several private equity firms reportedly have rejected Schnatter`s proposal to partner on a bid and shares of Papa John`s pop 8 percent to $50.14.</p><p>Online polling company SurveyMonkey made the trading debut after pricing shares above the expected range. The initial public offering put SurveyMonkey`s value at nearly $1.5 billion. And while the company isn`t profitable yet, the CEO says it`s making progress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZANDER LURIE, SURVEYMONKEY CEO: On a net income basis cap, we are still unprofitable. We are bringing on world class shareholders who understand the business model. This is a highly cash generating business. So, in the last 12 months, we had 19 percent free cash flow margin. And because 90 percent of our revenues subscription base, we had really high visibility and cash generation with the business.</p><p>So, we see the opportunity to grow and continue to drive free cash margins. And over time, you will see net income.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREWER: Shares soared 43 percent in their first day of trading, closing at $17.24.</p><p>After the bell, Bed, Bath and Beyond reported a surprise decline in same store sales and missed earnings expectations. The retailer also cut its sales outlook for the year and said profits will come in at the low end of previous guidance. So, as you might expect, shares initially fell in after hours. They finished the regular session down a fraction to $18.81.</p><p>A growing international scheme is leaving a trail of wealth victims across the country. Criminals can call loving families and claim they are holding loved ones for ransom.</p><p>Andrea Day investigates.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you, tell me what you need. I don`t know. Tell me.</p><p>ANDREA DAY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This is an extortion call, the man is desperate to save his son`s live.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Listen, calm down.</p><p>DAY: How real was it for you?</p><p>JAMEY HEATH, MUSIC PRODUCER: How real was it? It was someone had my son. Someone had my son who I had heard crying and screaming in the background, covering his mouth, with a gun to him.</p><p>DAY: Thirty minutes, he says, of complete terror. Jamey Heath had no idea he was being conned. But this is no ordinary hoax. An extortion scheme so paralyzing, the feds can call it a violent crime. FBI special agent Erik Arbuthnot.</p><p>ERIK ARBUTHNOT, FBI SPECIAL AGENT: The victims are wealthy, architects, doctors, lawyers, professional people, get the phone call, make the payment.</p><p>DAY: Heath is a music producer and lives in Los Angeles. Investigators say a recent target for the extortionist. She was inside had his home when he got the call.</p><p>HEATH: I hear them say they`re going to hurt me they`re going to shoot me. And then while he is talking they are going to shoot -- and I hear someone cover his mouth. And someone grabs the phone and says is this Nick`s dad listen to me and listen to me closely. How you respond in the next 20 seconds determine whether or not you see your son again.</p><p>DAY: So, right from the start, you thought it was your son.</p><p>HEATH: Oh, yes, it wasn`t thinking. It was just my son.</p><p>DAY: He rushed to his bank to withdraw cash.</p><p>HEATH: I parked in that driveway. I ran out frantically down the street here, ran into the bank through the glass doors.</p><p>DAY: Once inside, he got a text from his wife.</p><p>HEATH: That said Nick is safe. He`s at school.</p><p>DAY: That`s when he finally called his son.</p><p>According to the FBI, versions of the scheme have been around for about a decade. But it wasn`t until recent years that agents made a startling discovery, while pouring through victim`s phone records.</p><p>Arbuthnot says they found calls made to people across Beverly Hills were coming in from one place.</p><p>ARBUTHNOT: Our investigation has revealed for the most part these phone calls are being made by prisoners in foreign countries, mostly prisoners in Mexico.</p><p>DAY: So you`re telling me that Mexican prisoners have this terrifying scheme down to a science?</p><p>ARBUTHNOT: Yes, yes we are talking about thousands of phone calls over the last few years.</p><p>DAY: This is undercover video aired by the Mexican broadcast network Imagen. It was taken inside a prison in Mexico City. The people you see on the phone here are inmates. According to investigators casually making cold calls, right out in the open.</p><p>So, these prisoners are really hoping to strike it rich with the calls?</p><p>ARBUTHNOT: Absolutely. The whole point of in for enemy is to make money, make money fast, make as much money as possible.</p><p>DAY: The call to Jamie Heath also from Mexico.</p><p>Do you think you`ll ever forget that experience?</p><p>HEATH: No. No, because for me, those 30 minutes my son was taken.</p><p>DAY: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Andrea Day.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER: We reached out to different agencies in Mexico for weeks with no response. The Mexican embassy told us U.S. authorities have not raised the issue during meeting was law enforcement. But the FBI told us they`ve been working with Mexican officials to come up with a plan to shut down this scheme. And the FBI says victims end up wiring money to Mexico or leaving it somewhere in the United States to be picked up.</p><p>The bottom line here, if you get one of these calls, they say you should just hang up.</p><p>Coming up, women in construction, there aren`t many of them. But one rose all the way to the top.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BREWER: Well, here`s a look at what to watch tomorrow. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about allegations of sexual misconduct. Kavanaugh`s accuser has also said she will testify.</p><p>The revised figure for second quarter GDP growth is due out. And we`ll get a look at durable goods orders in August.</p><p>That`s what to watch on Thursday.</p><p>New home sales bounced back in August. Purchases of newly built homes rose 3.5 percent, which was more than expected, and follows two straight monthly declines. The reason weakness is being blamed on rising home prices and higher borrowing costs which have outstripped wage gains.</p><p>Apartment rents are also heading higher, reversing a year long trends. Rents are up nearly 3 percent and the occupancy rate is at almost 96 percent. Increasing demand is coming in part from a shortage of homes for sale, which has led to higher home prices and that in turn has pushed people into the rental market, reducing demand.</p><p>You know, home building is an overwhelmingly male dominated business from the framers on the job site, right up to the C-suite. But one CEO breaks the mold not just for herself but for one of the nation`s largest publicly traded home builders.</p><p>Diana Olick is in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Arizona based Taylor Morrison Homes is the seventh largest publicly traded home builder by revenue. And its CEO Sheryl Palmer is the first and only one of her kind in those ranks, a female CEO.</p><p>SHERYL PALMER, TAYLOR MORRISON CHAIRMAN AND CEO: I`m not certain that this was an intentional path for me. But it`s one that felt right for obviously -- I`ve been in this industry for 20 years. Color blind, I`m gender blind.</p><p>So, they might notice that I`m the single female at the table, but for me, this is just what I do. All the old jokes about there is no line to the ladies -- those are all true. But I -- it doesn`t change me. I always said in business, the day I have to change who I am is probably the day I`ll stop.</p><p>OLICK: Palmer started in home building first at Pulte Homes then Taylor Morrison. She took the company public in 2012.</p><p>You`re at the table.</p><p>PALMER: Um-hmm.</p><p>OLICK: With the other publicly traded CEOs. Have you ever felt minimized? And if so, how?</p><p>PALMER: For sure. Early days, I think if I were to share a view, I almost think it kind of glossed over. I just had to continue and I knew that -- I knew that my positions, my views on the business were right. I would say to the group of CEOs had to get to know me. But now, I think, you know, it`s an equal playing field, but it took time.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>OLICK: And overtime, nearly a dozen years as CEO, Palmer built both her reputation as well as an uncharacteristically female staff given the business.</p><p>Do you promote women more as a leader of this company? Or do they just come to you because of what the company is?</p><p>PALMER: So I think we promote certain skills that are required. And we have a culture that I think attracts certain types of people around personal development. And you know, the passion and the higher purpose of what we as a company stand for.</p><p>We actually don`t have any affinity programs for females. Now, what I would hear from my people services department is that having me in this seat does attract other women. I think it gives hope.</p><p>Nearly 50 percent of our managers that first level management is female. I think it`s about 49.2 percent.</p><p>OLICK: That`s incredibly rare.</p><p>PALMER: That`s incredibly rare.</p><p>OLICK: But given the product, houses, Palmer sees it as just plain common sense.</p><p>PALMER: I will tell you, I think it makes us a better company, because to get the diversity of thinking at our table on a corporate level, at the division table, it`s really critical. Think about who the buyers are today out buying houses. And to miss the opportunity to have the female spot and kind of lens and voice would be shameful.</p><p>OLICK: Taylor Morrison`s board is also female heavy, but even with that achievement, she admits to a glaring problem, one she calls a tragedy.</p><p>PALMER: Women just don`t tend to be there for other women. And I don`t know if that`s a result of there are so few slots at the top that people feel like they have to compete.</p><p>I`m very hopeful that as the industry develops, and as we see more women in the space, that women take the opportunity to embrace the need and help other women as compared to push them down.</p><p>OLICK: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER: Well, before we go, let`s take a look at the day on Wall Street. The Dow fell 106 points, the Nasdaq was off 17 and the S&amp;P slipped 9.</p><p>That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Contessa Brewer. Thank you for watching. Have great night, everyone.

I'm Contessa Brewer, in tonight for Sue Herera  and Bill Griffeth.  </p><p>We begin with an important aspect of the American economy: interest rates.   Today, the Federal Reserve lifted the benchmark rate for the third time  this career, the eighth time since 2015.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell called  the economy strong and he said he is not concerned about inflation.  </p><p>The upbeat outlook led the central bank to increase its forecast for growth  this year and next.  </p><p>Steve Liesman is in Washington with more on today's decision.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Federal Reserve  raising interest rates by a quarter percentage point as expected to a new  range of 2 to 2.25 percent all but signaling another rate hike is coming as  soon as December.  </p><p>Fed Chairman Jay Powell was pretty clear why the Fed is taking this course  of action.  </p><p>POWELL:  Our economy is strong.  Growth is running at a healthy clip.   Unemployment is low.  The number of people working is rising steadily.  And  wages are up.  Inflation is low and stable.  All of these are very good  signs.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  Amid expectations for the good times to continue Fed officials on  average forecast the rates will rise another 75 basis points next year and  finish above 3 percent.  But Powell also said there are risks out there to  raising rates and risks to not raising rates.  </p><p>POWELL:  If we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery  unnecessarily.  And inflation falls short of its 2 percent target.  Or if  we move too slowly, we have an economy that overheats.  </p><p>So, we're -- that's happened through history.  We don't see any signs of  that now.  But we're always trying to navigate between those two shoals.   And think that gradually raising interest rates is the way that we kind of  take both of those risks seriously.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  Powell didn't seem overly concerned about the high level of the  stock market or lots of debt on the books of corporations.  But he did say  it represented a risk.  </p><p>He also said that tariffs represent a risk to the economy, but hadn't shown  up yet in the economic data.  </p><p>So, Powell said these are good times and the Fed thinks by nudging rates  higher and stopping at a low, he can let the good times roll just a little  bit longer.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER:  Well, interest rates influence everything from the economy to the  financial markets.  So what could the path of rate hikes mean for your  investments?  </p><p>David Lebovitz is a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset  Management.  </p><p>David, good to you today.  </p><p>When we're talking about this rate hike, what will we expect to see as an  impact on the overall economy?  </p><p>DAVID LEBOVITZ, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT:   So, you know, I think that the Fed, to Chairman Powell's point, is trying  to move gradually.  They're trying to telegraph exactly what they're doing.   But, you know, frankly, with eight rate hikes since 2015, we've already a  seen a bit of a slowdown this year in auto spending.  We've seen a slowdown  in home spending.  </p><p>So, I think higher rates are already taking hold on some of the most  interest rate sensitive sectors of the U.S. economy.  Obviously, growth has  remained relatively robust given all the fiscal stimulus being pumped into  the system.  But, you know, my expectation is that as rates continue to  move higher, you could see the more interest rate sensitive sectors like  autos and housing come under pressure over the next few quarters.  </p><p>BREWER:  And we saw that even today with utilities.  Are we expecting to  see that markets, stocks with equities here that people might be invested  in their 401(k)s?  </p><p>LEBOVITZ:  So, I think that equities it's important to draw a line between  those stocks that benefit from higher interest rates and those stocks that  come under pressure from higher interest rates.  You know, a lot of  investors have used things like utility stocks, consumer staple stocks,  telecom stocks as a way of producing more income in the portfolios over the  course of the current expansion given that interest rates have been low for  the majority of this economic growth period.  </p><p>But, you know, if you think about things like financials, technology,  energy, they do fairly well when interest rates rise.  So, we think that  investors probably need to be more selective at the current juncture.  We  certainly expect the high dividend paying sectors to remain under pressure,  but that doesn't mean there are no opportunities that investors can take  advantage of.  </p><p>BREWER:  And what's the impact of these rate hikes on treasuries?  We saw  the yield moving lower today.  </p><p>LEBOVITZ:  Yes.  So, obviously, when interest rates rise bond prices fall  and a lot of investors that I've been speaking with have noted they're  seeing negative returns from bond funds for the first time in a number of  years.  You know, I think the treasury yields coming down today were a  reflection of the market interpreting the Fed comments as being a little  bit softer, a little bit more dovish than they were expecting.  </p><p>Frankly, we still think the path of least resistance for interest rates is  higher.  The Fed is going to hike again in December.  In our view we think  two or three times next year.  That should lead interest rates grinding  higher the next 18 months.  </p><p>BREWER:  David Lebovitz with J.P. Morgan Asset Management -- David, good to  see you.  Thank you.  </p><p>LEBOVITZ:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BREWER:  Interest rates also influence the cost of borrowing, the return on  savings and your pocketbook overall.  We joined by Mark Hamrick, senior  economic analyst at bankrate.com.  </p><p>All right.  Let's dive into the ways that we might see this.  When it comes  to what a lot of people across the nation have auto loans.  Will we see  higher rates translating to what we pay per month for autos?  </p><p>MARK HAMRICK, BANKRATE.COM SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST:  Well, first of all, if  you already have an auto loan, that is not likely to change.  We are  talking about auto loans for future customers.  And, you know, our point of  living at Bank Rate is to remind people to shop around.  That holds true  across the borrowing universe.  </p><p>And let's remember that while there may be an average rate of let's say 5  percent for auto loans and likely be going higher, that shoppers can do  better than that and auto makers continue to add incentives including low  cost financing.  </p><p>BREWER:  And what about mortgages?  Will you see impact on mortgages?  </p><p>HAMRICK:  Really more so for adjustable rates.  Those who have fixed rates  mortgages, obviously, those are fixed by definition.  So for those who are  either still coming into the market and will expect to be in their homes in  future years, a number of years, we generally recommend that they look at  fixed rate mortgages and for those who have rates that are going to reset,  they want to look at how much longer they'll be in their home and possibly  refinance into a fixed rate mortgage.  </p><p>BREWER:  All right.  And then, finally, I wanted to ask you in terms of the  impact on what we're paying, what about credit card debt?  A lot of  Americans carry some debt from month-to-month.  Will you see of an impact  there?  </p><p>HAMRICK:  Yes, absolutely.  I tend to underscore this more than anything  else when it comes to borrowing because we've now crossed over the trillion  dollar level in terms of credit card debt.  Since the Fed began tightening,  obviously raising its benchmark rate by 2 percent since the beginning in  2015, we have seen the average for credit cards go up from 15 percent level  into the 17 percent level.  </p><p>And as we have already established here, we do look for perhaps as many as  four rate hikes over the coming years.  So, that means that we might be two  third of the way through the rate hikes.  So, at Bank Rate, we continue to  advice people to pay down or better off pay off credit card debt and  continue to save.  </p><p>BREWER:  All right.  So, if that's the advice there, are they -- you know,  on ways that you avoid some of pain that might come with the rate hike.  Do  you have advice for people on how to take advantage of a coming rate hike?  </p><p>HAMRICK:  Absolutely.  Well, I like to say that savers were the often  forgotten casualties of the low interest rate environment which was  essentially the medicine the Federal Reserve had to employ in the midst of  a financial crisis.  Slowly but surely, we are seeing savings rates rise.  </p><p>But again, it's really amazing -- and this is demonstrated on our site how  much variance we see if you just shop around.  So, while we might say that  for example the average on a one-year CD is below 1 percent.  You can get  substantially higher than that by shopping, same for 2-year CDs, five-year  CDs as well.  </p><p>BREWER:  All right.  Mark Hamrick with BankRate.com, thanks for the advice.  </p><p>HAMRICK:  Great to be with you.  Thank you.  </p><p>BREWER:  Those inflation comments from the Fed chief set off a chain of  events on Wall Street.  Bond yields turned lowered, which pressured bank  stocks and because of the financial sector which is, of course, critical,  the broader market fell, gave up earlier gains.  The Dow Jones Industrial  Average dropped 106 points to 26,385.  The Nasdaq was off 17.  And the S&amp;P  500 was down 9.  </p><p>In a speech to the United Nations Security Council, President Trump called  out China, not for its trade tactics but for trying to influence the  upcoming midterm elections.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Regrettably, we found that  China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election,  coming up in November, against my administration.  They do not want me or  us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on  trade.  And we are winning on trade.  We are winning at every level.  </p><p>We don't want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREWER:  Experts say those comments open up a new front in Trump's  administration posture towards the world's second largest economy.  </p><p>Well, we want to take time to look at today's upgrades and downgrades.  </p><p>IBM was upgraded to buy from neutral at UBS.  The analyst cites strong  demand for services, artificial intelligence and cloud offerings.  The  price target is $180.  The stock rose more than 1 percent to $151.61.  </p><p>GoPro's rating was lifted to outperform from perform at Oppenheimer.  The  analyst there calls its product compelling.  The price target $9.  The  stock gained 4 percent to $6.92.  </p><p>Activision Blizzard's price target was raised to $88 at Piper Jaffray.  The  analyst says the game \"Call of Duty: Black Ops 4\" could help boost  earnings.  The firm maintains the overweight rating, shares gained 1  percent to $81.57.  </p><p>And still ahead, a new phone scam and a call that no parent ever expects to  get.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BREWER:  San Francisco officials have temporarily should down the city's  new $2 billion transit center after a crack was found in a steel beam.   Engineers are now inspecting that beam.  The new transit hub opened a month  ago.  And it's expected to accommodate 100,000 passengers each weekday.  </p><p>The House of Representatives tonight passed an $850 spending bill.  That  measure funds the Defense Department and includes a plan to avoid a  government shutdown Sunday but the president still has to agree and sign  the measure.  </p><p>Executives from major tech companies were back on Capitol Hill, testifying  on consumer privacy.  And today, they were pushing lawmakers to establish  federal regulations.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin explains.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Executives from  AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), Twitter and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) taking the  stand before the Senate Commerce Committee to answer question base how they  protect consumer data in the most effective way to craft regulation.  </p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R), SOUTH DAKOTA:  There is a strong desire by both  Republicans and Democrats and by both industry and public interest groups  to work in good faith to reach a consensus on a national consumer data  privacy law that will help consumers promote innovation, reward  organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up  their act.  </p><p>KEITH ENRIGHT, GOOGLE CHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER:  We do not sell personal  information.  We acknowledge we made mistakes in the past from which we  learned and improved our privacy program.  We understand that the  foundation of our business is trust.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  With the general consensus that regulation is inevitable, the  question is what the laws will look like.  And companies would prefer to  have federal legislation because the consistency is easier to navigate than  a patchwork of state laws.  </p><p>The concern many tech giants testifying, this summer, California passed a  new privacy law considered comprehensive and stringent, and could hinder  their growth.  </p><p>ERIC HIPPEAU, LERER HIPPEAU:  Now what we are seeing is that the states  while the federal government is discussing it and not doing anything, the  states are moving, starting with California.  And now, they are talking  about it.  So, the federal government is under pressure now to come up with  a law.  Otherwise, you're going to have a patchwork of laws which will be  unworkable.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  With Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) saying complying with European privacy  regulation is a tremendous challenge, warning that similar laws here would  hurt start-ups.  The question is what regulations will look like.  </p><p>STEPHANIE MEHTA, FAST COMPANY:  Companies love to complaint about  regulation.  And yes it's a burden.  But I think the bigger problem for  companies is uncertainty.  I think that, you know, if they have a  regulatory framework they can work within and that they can help shape,  which is why I think you're seeing so many of these big companies say we  are in favor of some sort of regulatory framework because they want to be  part of the rule-making progress.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  With questioning focusing on the potential for mandatory  notification of data breaches within a certain time period and question  base whether consumer should have to affirmatively opt in to having their  data used and shared, Congress is trying to figure out what kind of rules  could protect consumers without hindering innovation and growth.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER:  CarMax (NYSE:KMX) topped expectations and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The car retailer said new digital initiatives helped drive an increase in  same store sales.  And that led to an overall earnings beat.  The company  points to results lifted by higher selling prices for used vehicles.   Shared finished the day down more than 1 percent to $74.66.  </p><p>Papa John's ousted founder is not walking away from the pizza chain without  a fight.  John Schnatter has contacted a number of private equity firms to  buy back the restaurant chain he left earlier this year.  Several private  equity firms reportedly have rejected Schnatter's proposal to partner on a  bid and shares of Papa John's pop 8 percent to $50.14.  </p><p>Online polling company SurveyMonkey made the trading debut after pricing  shares above the expected range.  The initial public offering put  SurveyMonkey's value at nearly $1.5 billion.  And while the company isn't  profitable yet, the CEO says it's making progress.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZANDER LURIE, SURVEYMONKEY CEO:  On a net income basis cap, we are still  unprofitable.  We are bringing on world class shareholders who understand  the business model.  This is a highly cash generating business.  So, in the  last 12 months, we had 19 percent free cash flow margin.  And because 90  percent of our revenues subscription base, we had really high visibility  and cash generation with the business.  </p><p>So, we see the opportunity to grow and continue to drive free cash margins.   And over time, you will see net income.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREWER:  Shares soared 43 percent in their first day of trading, closing at  $17.24.  </p><p>After the bell, Bed, Bath and Beyond reported a surprise decline in same  store sales and missed earnings expectations.  The retailer also cut its  sales outlook for the year and said profits will come in at the low end of  previous guidance.  So, as you might expect, shares initially fell in after  hours.  They finished the regular session down a fraction to $18.81.  </p><p>A growing international scheme is leaving a trail of wealth victims across  the country.  Criminals can call loving families and claim they are holding  loved ones for ransom.  </p><p>Andrea Day investigates.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you, tell me what you need.  I don't know.   Tell me.  </p><p>ANDREA DAY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This is an extortion  call, the man is desperate to save his son's live.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Listen, calm down.</p><p>DAY:  How real was it for you?  </p><p>JAMEY HEATH, MUSIC PRODUCER:  How real was it?  It was someone had my son.   Someone had my son who I had heard crying and screaming in the background,  covering his mouth, with a gun to him.  </p><p>DAY:  Thirty minutes, he says, of complete terror.  Jamey Heath had no idea  he was being conned.  But this is no ordinary hoax.  An extortion scheme so  paralyzing, the feds can call it a violent crime.  FBI special agent Erik  Arbuthnot.  </p><p>ERIK ARBUTHNOT, FBI SPECIAL AGENT:  The victims are wealthy, architects,  doctors, lawyers, professional people, get the phone call, make the  payment.  </p><p>DAY:  Heath is a music producer and lives in Los Angeles.  Investigators  say a recent target for the extortionist.  She was inside had his home when  he got the call.  </p><p>HEATH:  I hear them say they're going to hurt me they're going to shoot me.   And then while he is talking they are going to shoot -- and I hear someone  cover his mouth.  And someone grabs the phone and says is this Nick's dad  listen to me and listen to me closely.  How you respond in the next 20  seconds determine whether or not you see your son again.  </p><p>DAY:  So, right from the start, you thought it was your son.  </p><p>HEATH:  Oh, yes, it wasn't thinking.  It was just my son.  </p><p>DAY:  He rushed to his bank to withdraw cash.  </p><p>HEATH:  I parked in that driveway.  I ran out frantically down the street  here, ran into the bank through the glass doors.  </p><p>DAY:  Once inside, he got a text from his wife.  </p><p>HEATH:  That said Nick is safe.  He's at school.  </p><p>DAY:  That's when he finally called his son.  </p><p>According to the FBI, versions of the scheme have been around for about a  decade.  But it wasn't until recent years that agents made a startling  discovery, while pouring through victim's phone records.  </p><p>Arbuthnot says they found calls made to people across Beverly Hills were  coming in from one place.  </p><p>ARBUTHNOT:  Our investigation has revealed for the most part these phone  calls are being made by prisoners in foreign countries, mostly prisoners in  Mexico.  </p><p>DAY:  So you're telling me that Mexican prisoners have this terrifying  scheme down to a science?  </p><p>ARBUTHNOT:  Yes, yes we are talking about thousands of phone calls over the  last few years.  </p><p>DAY:  This is undercover video aired by the Mexican broadcast network  Imagen.  It was taken inside a prison in Mexico City.  The people you see  on the phone here are inmates.  According to investigators casually making  cold calls, right out in the open.  </p><p>So, these prisoners are really hoping to strike it rich with the calls?  </p><p>ARBUTHNOT:  Absolutely.  The whole point of in for enemy is to make money,  make money fast, make as much money as possible.  </p><p>DAY:  The call to Jamie Heath also from Mexico.  </p><p>Do you think you'll ever forget that experience?  </p><p>HEATH:  No.  No, because for me, those 30 minutes my son was taken.  </p><p>DAY:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Andrea Day.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER:  We reached out to different agencies in Mexico for weeks with no  response.  The Mexican embassy told us U.S. authorities have not raised the  issue during meeting was law enforcement.  But the FBI told us they've been  working with Mexican officials to come up with a plan to shut down this  scheme.  And the FBI says victims end up wiring money to Mexico or leaving  it somewhere in the United States to be picked up.  </p><p>The bottom line here, if you get one of these calls, they say you should  just hang up.  </p><p>Coming up, women in construction, there aren't many of them.  But one rose  all the way to the top.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BREWER:  Well, here's a look at what to watch tomorrow.  Supreme Court  nominee Brett Kavanaugh will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee  about allegations of sexual misconduct.  Kavanaugh's accuser has also said  she will testify.  </p><p>The revised figure for second quarter GDP growth is due out.  And we'll get  a look at durable goods orders in August.  </p><p>That's what to watch on Thursday.  </p><p>New home sales bounced back in August.  Purchases of newly built homes rose  3.5 percent, which was more than expected, and follows two straight monthly  declines.  The reason weakness is being blamed on rising home prices and  higher borrowing costs which have outstripped wage gains.  </p><p>Apartment rents are also heading higher, reversing a year long trends.   Rents are up nearly 3 percent and the occupancy rate is at almost 96  percent.  Increasing demand is coming in part from a shortage of homes for  sale, which has led to higher home prices and that in turn has pushed  people into the rental market, reducing demand.  </p><p>You know, home building is an overwhelmingly male dominated business from  the framers on the job site, right up to the C-suite.  But one CEO breaks  the mold not just for herself but for one of the nation's largest publicly  traded home builders.  </p><p>Diana Olick is in Scottsdale, Arizona.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Arizona based Taylor  Morrison Homes is the seventh largest publicly traded home builder by  revenue.  And its CEO Sheryl Palmer is the first and only one of her kind  in those ranks, a female CEO.  </p><p>SHERYL PALMER, TAYLOR MORRISON CHAIRMAN  AND CEO:  I'm not certain that  this was an intentional path for me.  But it's one that felt right for  obviously -- I've been in this industry for 20 years.  Color blind, I'm  gender blind.  </p><p>So, they might notice that I'm the single female at the table, but for me,  this is just what I do.  All the old jokes about there is no line to the  ladies -- those are all true.  But I -- it doesn't change me.  I always  said in business, the day I have to change who I am is probably the day  I'll stop.  </p><p>OLICK:  Palmer started in home building first at Pulte Homes then Taylor  Morrison.  She took the company public in 2012.  </p><p>You're at the table.  </p><p>PALMER:  Um-hmm.  </p><p>OLICK:  With the other publicly traded CEOs.  Have you ever felt minimized?   And if so, how?  </p><p>PALMER:  For sure.  Early days, I think if I were to share a view, I almost  think it kind of glossed over.  I just had to continue and I knew that -- I  knew that my positions, my views on the business were right.  I would say  to the group of CEOs had to get to know me.  But now, I think, you know,  it's an equal playing field, but it took time.</p><p>Thanks.  </p><p>OLICK:  And overtime, nearly a dozen years as CEO, Palmer built both her  reputation as well as an uncharacteristically female staff given the  business.  </p><p>Do you promote women more as a leader of this company?  Or do they just  come to you because of what the company is?  </p><p>PALMER:  So I think we promote certain skills that are required.  And we  have a culture that I think attracts certain types of people around  personal development.  And you know, the passion and the higher purpose of  what we as a company stand for.  </p><p>We actually don't have any affinity programs for females.  Now, what I  would hear from my people services department is that having me in this  seat does attract other women.  I think it gives hope.  </p><p>Nearly 50 percent of our managers that first level management is female.  I  think it's about 49.2 percent.  </p><p>OLICK:  That's incredibly rare.  </p><p>PALMER:  That's incredibly rare.  </p><p>OLICK:  But given the product, houses, Palmer sees it as just plain common  sense.  </p><p>PALMER:  I will tell you, I think it makes us a better company, because to  get the diversity of thinking at our table on a corporate level, at the  division table, it's really critical.  Think about who the buyers are today  out buying houses.  And to miss the opportunity to have the female spot and  kind of lens and voice would be shameful.  </p><p>OLICK:  Taylor Morrison's board is also female heavy, but even with that  achievement, she admits to a glaring problem, one she calls a tragedy.  </p><p>PALMER:  Women just don't tend to be there for other women.  And I don't  know if that's a result of there are so few slots at the top that people  feel like they have to compete.  </p><p>I'm very hopeful that as the industry develops, and as we see more women in  the space, that women take the opportunity to embrace the need and help  other women as compared to push them down.  </p><p>OLICK:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Scottsdale,  Arizona.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER:  Well, before we go, let's take a look at the day on Wall Street.   The Dow fell 106 points, the Nasdaq was off 17 and the S&amp;P slipped 9.  </p><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Contessa Brewer.  Thank  you for watching.

I'm Contessa Brewer, in tonight for Sue Herera  and Bill Griffeth.  </p><p> We begin with an important aspect of the American economy: interest rates.   Today, the Federal Reserve lifted the benchmark rate for the third time  this career, the eighth time since 2015.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell called  the economy strong and he said he is not concerned about inflation.  </p><p> The upbeat outlook led the central bank to increase its forecast for growth  this year and next.  </p><p> Steve Liesman is in Washington with more on today's decision.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Federal Reserve  raising interest rates by a quarter percentage point as expected to a new  range of 2 to 2.25 percent all but signaling another rate hike is coming as  soon as December.  </p><p> Fed Chairman Jay Powell was pretty clear why the Fed is taking this course  of action.  </p><p> POWELL:  Our economy is strong.  Growth is running at a healthy clip.   Unemployment is low.  The number of people working is rising steadily.  And  wages are up.  Inflation is low and stable.  All of these are very good  signs.  </p><p> LIESMAN:  Amid expectations for the good times to continue Fed officials on  average forecast the rates will rise another 75 basis points next year and  finish above 3 percent.  But Powell also said there are risks out there to  raising rates and risks to not raising rates.  </p><p> POWELL:  If we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery  unnecessarily.  And inflation falls short of its 2 percent target.  Or if  we move too slowly, we have an economy that overheats.  </p><p> So, we're -- that's happened through history.  We don't see any signs of  that now.  But we're always trying to navigate between those two shoals.   And think that gradually raising interest rates is the way that we kind of  take both of those risks seriously.  </p><p> LIESMAN:  Powell didn't seem overly concerned about the high level of the  stock market or lots of debt on the books of corporations.  But he did say  it represented a risk.  </p><p> He also said that tariffs represent a risk to the economy, but hadn't shown  up yet in the economic data.  </p><p> So, Powell said these are good times and the Fed thinks by nudging rates  higher and stopping at a low, he can let the good times roll just a little  bit longer.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman in Washington.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BREWER:  Well, interest rates influence everything from the economy to the  financial markets.  So what could the path of rate hikes mean for your  investments?  </p><p> David Lebovitz is a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset  Management.  </p><p> David, good to you today.  </p><p> When we're talking about this rate hike, what will we expect to see as an  impact on the overall economy?  </p><p> DAVID LEBOVITZ, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT:   So, you know, I think that the Fed, to Chairman Powell's point, is trying  to move gradually.  They're trying to telegraph exactly what they're doing.   But, you know, frankly, with eight rate hikes since 2015, we've already a  seen a bit of a slowdown this year in auto spending.  We've seen a slowdown  in home spending.  </p><p> So, I think higher rates are already taking hold on some of the most  interest rate sensitive sectors of the U.S. economy.  Obviously, growth has  remained relatively robust given all the fiscal stimulus being pumped into  the system.  But, you know, my expectation is that as rates continue to  move higher, you could see the more interest rate sensitive sectors like  autos and housing come under pressure over the next few quarters.  </p><p> BREWER:  And we saw that even today with utilities.  Are we expecting to  see that markets, stocks with equities here that people might be invested  in their 401(k)s?  </p><p> LEBOVITZ:  So, I think that equities it's important to draw a line between  those stocks that benefit from higher interest rates and those stocks that  come under pressure from higher interest rates.  You know, a lot of  investors have used things like utility stocks, consumer staple stocks,  telecom stocks as a way of producing more income in the portfolios over the  course of the current expansion given that interest rates have been low for  the majority of this economic growth period.  </p><p> But, you know, if you think about things like financials, technology,  energy, they do fairly well when interest rates rise.  So, we think that  investors probably need to be more selective at the current juncture.  We  certainly expect the high dividend paying sectors to remain under pressure,  but that doesn't mean there are no opportunities that investors can take  advantage of.  </p><p> BREWER:  And what's the impact of these rate hikes on treasuries?  We saw  the yield moving lower today.  </p><p> LEBOVITZ:  Yes.  So, obviously, when interest rates rise bond prices fall  and a lot of investors that I've been speaking with have noted they're  seeing negative returns from bond funds for the first time in a number of  years.  You know, I think the treasury yields coming down today were a  reflection of the market interpreting the Fed comments as being a little  bit softer, a little bit more dovish than they were expecting.  </p><p> Frankly, we still think the path of least resistance for interest rates is  higher.  The Fed is going to hike again in December.  In our view we think  two or three times next year.  That should lead interest rates grinding  higher the next 18 months.  </p><p> BREWER:  David Lebovitz with J.P. Morgan Asset Management -- David, good to  see you.  Thank you.  </p><p> LEBOVITZ:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BREWER:  Interest rates also influence the cost of borrowing, the return on  savings and your pocketbook overall.  We joined by Mark Hamrick, senior  economic analyst at bankrate.com.  </p><p> All right.  Let's dive into the ways that we might see this.  When it comes  to what a lot of people across the nation have auto loans.  Will we see  higher rates translating to what we pay per month for autos?  </p><p> MARK HAMRICK, BANKRATE.COM SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST:  Well, first of all, if  you already have an auto loan, that is not likely to change.  We are  talking about auto loans for future customers.  And, you know, our point of  living at Bank Rate is to remind people to shop around.  That holds true  across the borrowing universe.  </p><p> And let's remember that while there may be an average rate of let's say 5  percent for auto loans and likely be going higher, that shoppers can do  better than that and auto makers continue to add incentives including low  cost financing.  </p><p> BREWER:  And what about mortgages?  Will you see impact on mortgages?  </p><p> HAMRICK:  Really more so for adjustable rates.  Those who have fixed rates  mortgages, obviously, those are fixed by definition.  So for those who are  either still coming into the market and will expect to be in their homes in  future years, a number of years, we generally recommend that they look at  fixed rate mortgages and for those who have rates that are going to reset,  they want to look at how much longer they'll be in their home and possibly  refinance into a fixed rate mortgage.  </p><p> BREWER:  All right.  And then, finally, I wanted to ask you in terms of the  impact on what we're paying, what about credit card debt?  A lot of  Americans carry some debt from month-to-month.  Will you see of an impact  there?  </p><p> HAMRICK:  Yes, absolutely.  I tend to underscore this more than anything  else when it comes to borrowing because we've now crossed over the trillion  dollar level in terms of credit card debt.  Since the Fed began tightening,  obviously raising its benchmark rate by 2 percent since the beginning in  2015, we have seen the average for credit cards go up from 15 percent level  into the 17 percent level.  </p><p> And as we have already established here, we do look for perhaps as many as  four rate hikes over the coming years.  So, that means that we might be two  third of the way through the rate hikes.  So, at Bank Rate, we continue to  advice people to pay down or better off pay off credit card debt and  continue to save.  </p><p> BREWER:  All right.  So, if that's the advice there, are they -- you know,  on ways that you avoid some of pain that might come with the rate hike.  Do  you have advice for people on how to take advantage of a coming rate hike?  </p><p> HAMRICK:  Absolutely.  Well, I like to say that savers were the often  forgotten casualties of the low interest rate environment which was  essentially the medicine the Federal Reserve had to employ in the midst of  a financial crisis.  Slowly but surely, we are seeing savings rates rise.  </p><p> But again, it's really amazing -- and this is demonstrated on our site how  much variance we see if you just shop around.  So, while we might say that  for example the average on a one-year CD is below 1 percent.  You can get  substantially higher than that by shopping, same for 2-year CDs, five-year  CDs as well.  </p><p> BREWER:  All right.  Mark Hamrick with BankRate.com, thanks for the advice.  </p><p> HAMRICK:  Great to be with you.  Thank you.  </p><p> BREWER:  Those inflation comments from the Fed chief set off a chain of  events on Wall Street.  Bond yields turned lowered, which pressured bank  stocks and because of the financial sector which is, of course, critical,  the broader market fell, gave up earlier gains.  The Dow Jones Industrial  Average dropped 106 points to 26,385.  The Nasdaq was off 17.  And the S&amp;P  500 was down 9.  </p><p> In a speech to the United Nations Security Council, President Trump called  out China, not for its trade tactics but for trying to influence the  upcoming midterm elections.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Regrettably, we found that  China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election,  coming up in November, against my administration.  They do not want me or  us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on  trade.  And we are winning on trade.  We are winning at every level.  </p><p> We don't want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREWER:  Experts say those comments open up a new front in Trump's  administration posture towards the world's second largest economy.  </p><p> Well, we want to take time to look at today's upgrades and downgrades.  </p><p>IBM was upgraded to buy from neutral at UBS.  The analyst cites strong  demand for services, artificial intelligence and cloud offerings.  The  price target is $180.  The stock rose more than 1 percent to $151.61.  </p><p> GoPro's rating was lifted to outperform from perform at Oppenheimer.  The  analyst there calls its product compelling.  The price target $9.  The  stock gained 4 percent to $6.92.  </p><p> Activision Blizzard's price target was raised to $88 at Piper Jaffray.  The  analyst says the game \"Call of Duty: Black Ops 4\" could help boost  earnings.  The firm maintains the overweight rating, shares gained 1  percent to $81.57.  </p><p> And still ahead, a new phone scam and a call that no parent ever expects to  get.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> BREWER:  San Francisco officials have temporarily should down the city's  new $2 billion transit center after a crack was found in a steel beam.   Engineers are now inspecting that beam.  The new transit hub opened a month  ago.  And it's expected to accommodate 100,000 passengers each weekday.  </p><p> The House of Representatives tonight passed an $850 spending bill.  That  measure funds the Defense Department and includes a plan to avoid a  government shutdown Sunday but the president still has to agree and sign  the measure.  </p><p> Executives from major tech companies were back on Capitol Hill, testifying  on consumer privacy.  And today, they were pushing lawmakers to establish  federal regulations.  </p><p> Julia Boorstin explains.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Executives from  AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG), Twitter and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) taking the  stand before the Senate Commerce Committee to answer question base how they  protect consumer data in the most effective way to craft regulation.  </p><p> SEN. JOHN THUNE (R), SOUTH DAKOTA:  There is a strong desire by both  Republicans and Democrats and by both industry and public interest groups  to work in good faith to reach a consensus on a national consumer data  privacy law that will help consumers promote innovation, reward  organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up  their act.  </p><p> KEITH ENRIGHT, GOOGLE CHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER:  We do not sell personal  information.  We acknowledge we made mistakes in the past from which we  learned and improved our privacy program.  We understand that the  foundation of our business is trust.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  With the general consensus that regulation is inevitable, the  question is what the laws will look like.  And companies would prefer to  have federal legislation because the consistency is easier to navigate than  a patchwork of state laws.  </p><p> The concern many tech giants testifying, this summer, California passed a  new privacy law considered comprehensive and stringent, and could hinder  their growth.  </p><p> ERIC HIPPEAU, LERER HIPPEAU:  Now what we are seeing is that the states  while the federal government is discussing it and not doing anything, the  states are moving, starting with California.  And now, they are talking  about it.  So, the federal government is under pressure now to come up with  a law.  Otherwise, you're going to have a patchwork of laws which will be  unworkable.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  With Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) saying complying with European privacy  regulation is a tremendous challenge, warning that similar laws here would  hurt start-ups.  The question is what regulations will look like.  </p><p> STEPHANIE MEHTA, FAST COMPANY:  Companies love to complaint about  regulation.  And yes it's a burden.  But I think the bigger problem for  companies is uncertainty.  I think that, you know, if they have a  regulatory framework they can work within and that they can help shape,  which is why I think you're seeing so many of these big companies say we  are in favor of some sort of regulatory framework because they want to be  part of the rule-making progress.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  With questioning focusing on the potential for mandatory  notification of data breaches within a certain time period and question  base whether consumer should have to affirmatively opt in to having their  data used and shared, Congress is trying to figure out what kind of rules  could protect consumers without hindering innovation and growth.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BREWER:  CarMax (NYSE:KMX) topped expectations and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The car retailer said new digital initiatives helped drive an increase in  same store sales.  And that led to an overall earnings beat.  The company  points to results lifted by higher selling prices for used vehicles.   Shared finished the day down more than 1 percent to $74.66.  </p><p>Papa John's ousted founder is not walking away from the pizza chain without  a fight.  John Schnatter has contacted a number of private equity firms to  buy back the restaurant chain he left earlier this year.  Several private  equity firms reportedly have rejected Schnatter's proposal to partner on a  bid and shares of Papa John's pop 8 percent to $50.14.  </p><p> Online polling company SurveyMonkey made the trading debut after pricing  shares above the expected range.  The initial public offering put  SurveyMonkey's value at nearly $1.5 billion.  And while the company isn't  profitable yet, the CEO says it's making progress.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ZANDER LURIE, SURVEYMONKEY CEO:  On a net income basis cap, we are still  unprofitable.  We are bringing on world class shareholders who understand  the business model.  This is a highly cash generating business.  So, in the  last 12 months, we had 19 percent free cash flow margin.  And because 90  percent of our revenues subscription base, we had really high visibility  and cash generation with the business.  </p><p> So, we see the opportunity to grow and continue to drive free cash margins.   And over time, you will see net income.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BREWER:  Shares soared 43 percent in their first day of trading, closing at  $17.24.  </p><p> After the bell, Bed, Bath and Beyond reported a surprise decline in same  store sales and missed earnings expectations.  The retailer also cut its  sales outlook for the year and said profits will come in at the low end of  previous guidance.  So, as you might expect, shares initially fell in after  hours.  They finished the regular session down a fraction to $18.81.  </p><p> A growing international scheme is leaving a trail of wealth victims across  the country.  Criminals can call loving families and claim they are holding  loved ones for ransom.  </p><p> Andrea Day investigates.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do you, tell me what you need.  I don't know.   Tell me.  </p><p> ANDREA DAY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This is an extortion  call, the man is desperate to save his son's live.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Listen, calm down.</p><p> DAY:  How real was it for you?  </p><p> JAMEY HEATH, MUSIC PRODUCER:  How real was it?  It was someone had my son.   Someone had my son who I had heard crying and screaming in the background,  covering his mouth, with a gun to him.  </p><p> DAY:  Thirty minutes, he says, of complete terror.  Jamey Heath had no idea  he was being conned.  But this is no ordinary hoax.  An extortion scheme so  paralyzing, the feds can call it a violent crime.  FBI special agent Erik  Arbuthnot.  </p><p> ERIK ARBUTHNOT, FBI SPECIAL AGENT:  The victims are wealthy, architects,  doctors, lawyers, professional people, get the phone call, make the  payment.  </p><p> DAY:  Heath is a music producer and lives in Los Angeles.  Investigators  say a recent target for the extortionist.  She was inside had his home when  he got the call.  </p><p> HEATH:  I hear them say they're going to hurt me they're going to shoot me.   And then while he is talking they are going to shoot -- and I hear someone  cover his mouth.  And someone grabs the phone and says is this Nick's dad  listen to me and listen to me closely.  How you respond in the next 20  seconds determine whether or not you see your son again.  </p><p> DAY:  So, right from the start, you thought it was your son.  </p><p> HEATH:  Oh, yes, it wasn't thinking.  It was just my son.  </p><p> DAY:  He rushed to his bank to withdraw cash.  </p><p> HEATH:  I parked in that driveway.  I ran out frantically down the street  here, ran into the bank through the glass doors.  </p><p> DAY:  Once inside, he got a text from his wife.  </p><p> HEATH:  That said Nick is safe.  He's at school.  </p><p> DAY:  That's when he finally called his son.  </p><p> According to the FBI, versions of the scheme have been around for about a  decade.  But it wasn't until recent years that agents made a startling  discovery, while pouring through victim's phone records.  </p><p> Arbuthnot says they found calls made to people across Beverly Hills were  coming in from one place.  </p><p> ARBUTHNOT:  Our investigation has revealed for the most part these phone  calls are being made by prisoners in foreign countries, mostly prisoners in  Mexico.  </p><p> DAY:  So you're telling me that Mexican prisoners have this terrifying  scheme down to a science?  </p><p> ARBUTHNOT:  Yes, yes we are talking about thousands of phone calls over the  last few years.  </p><p> DAY:  This is undercover video aired by the Mexican broadcast network  Imagen.  It was taken inside a prison in Mexico City.  The people you see  on the phone here are inmates.  According to investigators casually making  cold calls, right out in the open.  </p><p> So, these prisoners are really hoping to strike it rich with the calls?  </p><p> ARBUTHNOT:  Absolutely.  The whole point of in for enemy is to make money,  make money fast, make as much money as possible.  </p><p> DAY:  The call to Jamie Heath also from Mexico.  </p><p> Do you think you'll ever forget that experience?  </p><p> HEATH:  No.  No, because for me, those 30 minutes my son was taken.  </p><p> DAY:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Andrea Day.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BREWER:  We reached out to different agencies in Mexico for weeks with no  response.  The Mexican embassy told us U.S. authorities have not raised the  issue during meeting was law enforcement.  But the FBI told us they've been  working with Mexican officials to come up with a plan to shut down this  scheme.  And the FBI says victims end up wiring money to Mexico or leaving  it somewhere in the United States to be picked up.  </p><p> The bottom line here, if you get one of these calls, they say you should  just hang up.  </p><p> Coming up, women in construction, there aren't many of them.  But one rose  all the way to the top.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> BREWER:  Well, here's a look at what to watch tomorrow.  Supreme Court  nominee Brett Kavanaugh will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee  about allegations of sexual misconduct.  Kavanaugh's accuser has also said  she will testify.  </p><p> The revised figure for second quarter GDP growth is due out.  And we'll get  a look at durable goods orders in August.  </p><p> That's what to watch on Thursday.  </p><p> New home sales bounced back in August.  Purchases of newly built homes rose  3.5 percent, which was more than expected, and follows two straight monthly  declines.  The reason weakness is being blamed on rising home prices and  higher borrowing costs which have outstripped wage gains.  </p><p> Apartment rents are also heading higher, reversing a year long trends.   Rents are up nearly 3 percent and the occupancy rate is at almost 96  percent.  Increasing demand is coming in part from a shortage of homes for  sale, which has led to higher home prices and that in turn has pushed  people into the rental market, reducing demand.  </p><p> You know, home building is an overwhelmingly male dominated business from  the framers on the job site, right up to the C-suite.  But one CEO breaks  the mold not just for herself but for one of the nation's largest publicly  traded home builders.  </p><p> Diana Olick is in Scottsdale, Arizona.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Arizona based Taylor  Morrison Homes is the seventh largest publicly traded home builder by  revenue.  And its CEO Sheryl Palmer is the first and only one of her kind  in those ranks, a female CEO.  </p><p> SHERYL PALMER, TAYLOR MORRISON CHAIRMAN  AND CEO:  I'm not certain that  this was an intentional path for me.  But it's one that felt right for  obviously -- I've been in this industry for 20 years.  Color blind, I'm  gender blind.  </p><p> So, they might notice that I'm the single female at the table, but for me,  this is just what I do.  All the old jokes about there is no line to the  ladies -- those are all true.  But I -- it doesn't change me.  I always  said in business, the day I have to change who I am is probably the day  I'll stop.  </p><p> OLICK:  Palmer started in home building first at Pulte Homes then Taylor  Morrison.  She took the company public in 2012.  </p><p> You're at the table.  </p><p> PALMER:  Um-hmm.  </p><p> OLICK:  With the other publicly traded CEOs.  Have you ever felt minimized?   And if so, how?  </p><p> PALMER:  For sure.  Early days, I think if I were to share a view, I almost  think it kind of glossed over.  I just had to continue and I knew that -- I  knew that my positions, my views on the business were right.  I would say  to the group of CEOs had to get to know me.  But now, I think, you know,  it's an equal playing field, but it took time.</p><p> Thanks.  </p><p> OLICK:  And overtime, nearly a dozen years as CEO, Palmer built both her  reputation as well as an uncharacteristically female staff given the  business.  </p><p> Do you promote women more as a leader of this company?  Or do they just  come to you because of what the company is?  </p><p> PALMER:  So I think we promote certain skills that are required.  And we  have a culture that I think attracts certain types of people around  personal development.  And you know, the passion and the higher purpose of  what we as a company stand for.  </p><p> We actually don't have any affinity programs for females.  Now, what I  would hear from my people services department is that having me in this  seat does attract other women.  I think it gives hope.  </p><p> Nearly 50 percent of our managers that first level management is female.  I  think it's about 49.2 percent.  </p><p> OLICK:  That's incredibly rare.  </p><p> PALMER:  That's incredibly rare.  </p><p> OLICK:  But given the product, houses, Palmer sees it as just plain common  sense.  </p><p> PALMER:  I will tell you, I think it makes us a better company, because to  get the diversity of thinking at our table on a corporate level, at the  division table, it's really critical.  Think about who the buyers are today  out buying houses.  And to miss the opportunity to have the female spot and  kind of lens and voice would be shameful.  </p><p> OLICK:  Taylor Morrison's board is also female heavy, but even with that  achievement, she admits to a glaring problem, one she calls a tragedy.  </p><p> PALMER:  Women just don't tend to be there for other women.  And I don't  know if that's a result of there are so few slots at the top that people  feel like they have to compete.  </p><p> I'm very hopeful that as the industry develops, and as we see more women in  the space, that women take the opportunity to embrace the need and help  other women as compared to push them down.  </p><p> OLICK:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Scottsdale,  Arizona.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BREWER:  Well, before we go, let's take a look at the day on Wall Street.   The Dow fell 106 points, the Nasdaq was off 17 and the S&amp;P slipped 9.  </p><p> That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Contessa Brewer.  Thank  you for watching.

The  third quarter saw trade clashes and recession signals, but that didn`t stop  the market from staying within reach of all time highs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Speaking out.  How smaller  companies are helping regulators understand just how dominant big tech can  be.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  Finding financial aid.  Have college-bound kids, do you?  Well,  it`s time to fill out a key form if you want to receive any assistance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday,  September 30th.</p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>Well, it may be the start of the week, but it`s the end of the month, and  the end of the third quarter.  A period that was defined by trade tensions,  recession concerns, interest rate worries and now political drama.  But  despite it all, stocks stayed steady.</p><p>Let`s run through the numbers.  Today on the last day of the quarter, the  Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 96 points to 26,916.  The Nasdaq added 59  and the S&amp;P 500 was up 14.</p><p>For the month, all of the major averages were higher.  And for the quarter,  the Dow and the S&amp;P were up, but the Nasdaq dipped slightly.</p><p>And now comes October, a month that historically is volatile, and the next  big hurdle, earnings.</p><p>Bob Pisani is at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  For the third quarter  officially out of the way, the markets are still on track to end the year  strong.  But investors are going to be fixated on the next big catalyst,  and that is earnings.  This next great earnings recession fear that  dominated the first quarter and the fear that companies would dramatically  lower earnings expectations in the second half of the year because of the  tariffs and trade wars, and the global slowdown, none of this has ever come  to pass.</p><p>Earnings have held steady and remain roughly flattish for the first  quarter, the second quarter, and now, for third quarter.  Going in to the  year end, the fourth quarters estimates show a gain of roughly 4 percent.   But still, that`s a big improvement over the last three quarters.  And  that`s good news.</p><p>So, there`s the problem: the two biggest issues that would earn the needle  in earnings in one direction or the other are unresolved.  The first one is  trajectory of trade talks.  Are we going to get more or less tariffs in the  fourth quarter?  And then there`s the Federal Reserve.  Are they on hold  when it comes to rates or are they not on hold?</p><p>And while there`s been no wholesale attempts to lower earnings in a big  way, we do see a couple of troubling trends emerging.  13 of those 14  companies who`ve reported for the fourth quarter have had their estimates  for the fourth quarter come down.  That`s a very high percentage, north of  90 percent, and it`s been very notable downward revisions from some  important bellwethers like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Micron and Carnival  (NYSE:CCL).</p><p>The other trend is energy seeing very big downward positions, even in the  third quarter.  Exploration and production companies like EOG, for example,  estimates have come down 20 percent for this as a group since July because  excessive production of oil is keeping oil prices low.  That`s something to  keep an eye on as well.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mark Luschini joins us now to talk more about these third  quarter earnings expectations.  He`s chief investment officer at Janney  Montgomery Scott.</p><p>Mark, good to see you again.  Welcome back.</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  Thank  you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Certainly no shortage of things to talk about, as we look at  what is traditionally the most volatile month of the year for Wall Street.   But what`s your outlook?  I mean, you know, Bob says flattish earnings are  coming our way.  What do you think?</p><p>LUSCHINI:  Well, we know typically that companies tend to guide a little  bit lower and the beat ratio typically comes in around 75 percent plus or  minus a few percentage points around which generally means that over the  course of the earnings season, earnings tend to trend higher than what are  our original estimates are guesstimating.  And right now, the negative 3  percent level looks daunting, but it shouldn`t be overcome and flatten out.   I think investors are going to start to look toward fourth quarter in 2020  earnings estimates, and so much of that is going to be predicated upon  conditions globally, both as it relates to trade as well as growth.</p><p>HERERA:  And given that, this earnings season, what sector of the market do  you think is going to be key?  Not just for you, but the market overall?</p><p>LUSCHINI:  Well, certainly, Sue, the biggest sector in the market is the  technology sector.  It represents 22 percent of the S&amp;P 500.  So, it`s  going to matter a lot in interprets of the influence on the direction of  the market.  Another big sector however is financials.</p><p>And we see a nice rally in the stock prices here in the month of September.   We`ll see if it`s because investors are sniffing out better earnings to  come from the financial sector growth, which again given its double-digit  weight could help support the market if technology doesn`t, or if in  combination drive the overall market higher.</p><p>So, those are the two I`ll be most focused on.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And energy, what you saw in that graphic, you feel it looks  attractive right now, even as energy prices start to come down again here.</p><p>LUSCHINI:  Well, Bill, one would have to be a pretty hard contrarian to  wade into energy stocks at this juncture because they`ve done nothing but  disappoint here so far this year.  But that said, from a valuation  perspective, there`s two standard deviations below their relative return  against the S&amp;P 500 so far this year.  And so, that would suggest to us  perhaps they`re bombed out sufficiently, as to warrant some attention,  particularly if investors become more confident that perhaps elevated  energy prices or a geopolitical risk premium as a consequence of the attack  on the Saudi Arabian facility could lead to even higher prices in the near  future.</p><p>HERERA:  So, Mark, how much of what you`ve just laid out for us do you  think is already in the market, because there is still a lot of headline  risk as Bill mentioned earlier in the market.  Do earnings trump that or  not?</p><p>LUSCHINI:  Frankly, Sue, I think it`s the macroeconomic issues that trump  earnings at this juncture.  I think that you`re right, it`s baked in at  this point.  We`ve known for some time that earnings were going to face  some difficult comparisons, because 2018 earnings were so strong.  And  we`re finally seeing the base effects of that perhaps fade in the fourth  quarter of this year and for all of 2020.  But that said, if we would get a  resolution or at least some permanence to the truce between China and the  U.S. and we start to detect real convincing signs of global growth  beginning to at least stabilize if not outright improve, that could be  enough even in the absence of third quarter earnings improving to be the  driver for stock prices going into the end of the year.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mark Luschini with Janney Montgomery Scott -- again, always good  to see you, Mark.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>LUSCHINI:  Thank you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You bet.</p><p>HERERA:  Well, part of the reason the market traded higher today was  because of slightly positive economic news out of China and optimism around  the trade talks.  In a statement over the weekend, the Treasury Department  said that the White House is not considering blocking Chinese companies  from listing shares on U.S. stock exchanges.</p><p>As you may recall, that report was one of the reasons why stocks fell on  Friday.  And the Chinese government had something to say about it.</p><p>Here`s Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The foreign ministry  criticized reports that the Trump administration could be limiting U.S.  investments into Chinese firms by saying that any decoupling of China and  the U.S. would harm both sides and cause instability in global markets.   Analysts here, though, say it`s not clear how damaging those restrictions  would be in any case since foreign investors generally play a small role in  domestic stock markets, and China has been trying to make its markets more  attractive to Chinese firms with the launch of its own Nasdaq-style market.</p><p>Separately, China posted more data that surprised to the upside.  But the  improvement is likely only temporary.  Analysts say the stronger orders  were likely due to seasonal factors, possible frontloading and government  stimulus.  The better numbers came one day before China celebrates its 70th  anniversary of the founding of the People`s Republic on Tuesday, expect the  military hardware filled parade and an address by President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Investors will be looking for any clues on his speech on China`s policy  towards the West.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said today  that he hopes the U.S. and China do reach an agreement on trade sometime  soon because he said the trade war has hit America`s heartland especially  hard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER:  It`s been very tough on  American agriculture.  And as you know, my party is very deeply based in  rural America and small town America.</p><p>So, I hope the president can get a good outcome here.  The Chinese have  been stealing our intellectual property and not playing by the rules for a  long time.  So, I admire what he`s trying to do, but I hope we can get a  conclusion of this sometime soon, because rural America really needs it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  According to \"Reuters\", about $19.5 billion in U.S. farm goods  were exported to China in 2017, that figure fell to about $9 billion last  year, after agriculture products were made more expensive by tariffs.</p><p>Senator McConnell also said that farmers would benefit if Congress passed  the new NAFTA, which is now called USMCA.</p><p>HERERA:  The president of the Chicago Fed said the Central Bank`s current  accommodative stance is a good one, but suggested more cuts could be needed  if economic headwinds increased.  Charles Evans considers himself open- minded when it comes to monetary policy and said getting inflation to the  Fed`s target rate of 2 percent has been a challenge over the last six  months.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Oil prices fell sharply today on reports that Saudi Aramco has  fully restored its production capacity following those drone attacks on  those facilities earlier in the month.  The attacks had briefly knocked out  more than 5 million barrels a day of Saudi crude, knocked it offline.   Price of domestic crude here in the U.S. today settled at a one month low.</p><p>HERERA:  Boeing (NYSE:BA) plans to sharpen its focus on safety following  the grounding of its 737 MAX plane.  The announcement comes as the company  enters a critical time of year.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has been following the story for us all along.</p><p>And, Phil, welcome.</p><p>Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg is increasing safety protocols.</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:</p><p>HERERA:  How significant are the moves?</p><p>LEBEAU:  Well, the moves are significant considering the fact that what  Boeing (NYSE:BA) has gone through has exposed a lot of flaws in the process  of developing and building aircraft.  So, certainly, the fact that they`re  going to be taking a greater focus, and people can now step up if they see  a safety issue, that`s certainly going to help in the future.</p><p>Look, it can`t get worse than it already has been for Boeing (NYSE:BA).   But keep in mind, this also comes as people continue to question what was  being done as they developed the 737 MAX.  The most recent report over the  weekend is that this was a plane that as they built the military version of  it, it had safeguards that were not applied also to the commercial version.</p><p>It`s just one more case where people, and you can bet they`ll bring this up  when they question Dennis Muilenburg in Washington, D.C.  People are  saying, what was going on?</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes.  Well, of course, tomorrow starts fourth quarter.  And this  is the time when Boeing (NYSE:BA) said it hoped that the 737 MAX could  return to service.</p><p>What do you think, yes, no?</p><p>LEBEAU:  They`ve got a lot of hurdles they`ve got to clear.  If they`re  going to make it within the next 90 days, think about this.  They`ve still  got to do a recertification flight, and I get no indication that that`s  going to be happening any time soon.</p><p>Then they`ve got to formally ask for the regular lighters to approve the  MAX going back into service.  Then they`ve got have to prepare all these  grounded MAX planes.  Just can`t flip a switch.  That`s going to take  anywhere from 20 to 40 days is the estimate I hear from the airlines.  So,  a lot of things have to happen if the MAX is going to fly by the end of the  year.</p><p>HERERA:  You`re a busy guy these days.  You have another huge story on your  radar, that`s the UAW/GM strike.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Yes.</p><p>HERERA:  Any movement so far today?</p><p>LEBEAU:  They`re still talking.  And everyone says that they are making  progress.  But I get no sense that we see a deal coming any time soon.  So,  keep in mind that the UAW workers, they have been without work.  So,  they`ve been two weeks without work, they missed a paycheck on Friday.</p><p>They are now eligible for strike payments from the UAW.  That comes out to  $250 a week, as they start to get those this week.  That will help a little  bit.</p><p>But, guys, $250 a week, that`s nothing compared to what you`re making if  you`re on the assembly line.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Indeed.  It`s interesting that GM shares have not suffered over  this time frame.  Why is that do you think?</p><p>LEBEAU:  The inventory is still there.  Sales have been hit.  If we see  inventory drop off, especially for pickup trucks, then you would see the  stock really suffer.</p><p>HERERA:  Phil LeBeau, thanks as always, Phil.</p><p>LEBEAU:  You bet.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and  Downgrades\".</p><p>We begin with shares of Bed, Bath and Beyond.  They were upgraded to  outperform from market perform at BMO Capital.  The analyst there cited the  potential for earnings to stabilize over the next couple years.  Stock  price target now, $16.  Shares rose 7 1/2 percent today to $10.64.</p><p>Also at BMO Capital, United Healthcare and Humana (NYSE:HUM) were  downgraded to outperform.  That analyst cited election uncertainty and its  impact on future health care policy.  Price target for UnitedHealthcare is  $249.  For Humana (NYSE:HUM), it`s $290.  The stocks however moved in  opposite directions today, UnitedHealth rose, Humana (NYSE:HUM) was down.</p><p>HERERA:  Apple`s price target was hiked to $265 at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).   The analyst sees sentiment on the stock improving materially.  The firm has  an overweight rating on the stock.  The stock was up 2 percent to $223.97.</p><p>Newell Brands was upgraded to buy from hold at SunTrust.  The analyst there  says the company is on a verge of a turnaround.  The price target is $25,  and the shares gain more than 2-1/2 percent to $18.72.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, Bernie Sanders has a plan to tax corporations and  address the pay gap between CEOs and workers.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  WeWork has now officially pulled its initial public offering.   The embattled office sharing startup formally announced its intent to go  public last month.</p><p>And in the process, it revealed big losses and a confusing corporate  structure.  Then came weak demand for its stock, which led to a reduced  valuation for the company.  Last week, WeWork`s co-founder and CEO Adam  Newman stepped down and gave up his voting power in the process.  And so,  today, the IPO has been shelved.</p><p>HERERA:  Forever 21 has filed for bankruptcy.  The fashion retailer that  helped popularize fast fashion has filed for chapter 11 protection.  The  company which targets teen shoppers said it would cease operation in 40  countries and close up to 178 stores here in the U.S.  Forever 21 plans to  continue to operate its website and simplify its operations while going  through the bankruptcy process.  Analysts say the store was not able to  keep up with the shifting tastes of younger consumers.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A judge today dismissed a lawsuit brought by four states that  challenged a provision of the 2017 tax law that kept state and local tax  deductions.  The judge reaffirmed that cap as part of Congress`s broad  powers to write and pass tax legislation under the Constitution.  He also  said that the states did not show that the cap constrains their decision- making process.</p><p>HERERA:  Senator Bernie Sanders has outlined a new tax plan that targets  corporations.  The aim is to narrow the gap between what they pay their top  executives and what they pay their workers.</p><p>Robert Frank has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Bernie Sanders  announcing this morning that it is, quote, time to send a message to  corporate America.  If you do not end your greed and corruption, he said,  we will end it for you.</p><p>And he hopes to end it with a new inequality tax -- tax would apply to  companies with revenues of more than $100 million both private and public,  where CEO pay is at least times the median salary of their workers.  Now,  it`s a sliding scale starting with half a percent tax and rising to 5  percent for companies whose CEO makes more than 500 times their median  worker.  Now, Sanders said it would raise $150 billion a year.</p><p>Now the companies that would be hardest hit are mostly in retail, banking  and restaurant chains since they have large workforces of lower paid  workers or they have operations in developing countries.</p><p>Now, McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) would pay an additional $110 million in taxes  last year under the plan while Walmart would have had to pay an additional  $800 million and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase would have paid $1 billion more  in taxes.  Now, some of the other companies with large pay gaps include  Chipotle, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), Kohl`s (NYSE:KSS)  and The Gap (NYSE:GPS).</p><p>Now, some market strategists say the plan is more political than practical.</p><p>DAN CLIFTON, STRATEGAS:  There`s a difference between campaigning and  governing.  And from a campaign theme, it fits very well in this theme that  we were talking about income inequality, CEO pay.  I think as a practical  aspect, it would be very difficult to implement.</p><p>FRANK:  The tax is made possible by recent SEC rule that requires companies  to disclose the pay gap.  But there are no set rules for how companies have  to calculate the median pay.  So, like any tax, companies would probably  find ways around it.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Thor Industries (NYSE:THO) drops the hammer and that`s where we  begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with the RV maker topping analyst profit  expectations, thanks to lower costs in North America.  But the company  missed on revenue due to sluggish sales, but investors seem to be focusing  mainly on that bottom line number.  The shares jumped nearly 16 percent to  $56.64.</p><p>Cal-Maine Food says an extreme drop in egg prices hurt the egg producer`s  sales which led to a bigger loss than Wall Street expected.  Egg prices  have dropped by as much as 40 percent of the past year due mainly to an  oversupply that started in early 2018.  Cal-Maine stock dropped about 17 --  about 12 percent today at $39.96.</p><p>And Seattle Genetic says that data from an early stage bladder cancer drug  test showed about a 70 percent overall survival rate when it was combined  with Merck`s Keytruda.  And Wall Street noticed, as multiple brokerage  firms today raised their price target on that biotech company.  And shares  rose more than 12 percent to $85.40.</p><p>HERERA:  Walgreens is joining CBS (NYSE:CBS) in suspending the sales of  Sanofi`s Zantac and other generic heartburn products, as the FDA continues  its review after an online pharmacy cited low levels of a chemical that  could cause cancer.  Both CVS (NYSE:CVS) and Walgreens shares rose more  than one-and-a-half percent.  Sanofi was up a fraction.</p><p>Congressional antitrust investigators are looking at Google`s new Internet  protocol worried it might give the company an unfair advantage by denying  others access to consumer data.  The House sent a letter earlier in the  month asking Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) if it would collect the data for any  commercial purposes.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) claims its goal on this project  is to improve Internet security.  The shares fell a fraction to $1,221.14.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) isn`t the only big tech company under  scrutiny these days.  Other Silicon Valley giants are as well.  And as  regulators investigate their dominance, they are calling on smaller  companies to better understand just how much power the big ones hold.</p><p>Ylan Mui talks to one business who says it`s getting squeezed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE MOLSON HART, VIAHART FOUNDER:  Technically by appearing in this  interview, we could get in a lot of trouble.</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Molson Hart has been  selling toys for almost 10 years.</p><p>HART:  This is another one of my favorite guys.  This is Slowmo, Slowmo the  sloth.</p><p>MUI:  Stuffed animals, a construction toy called Brain Flakes, even  kickboards.</p><p>Where does he sell all of this?</p><p>HART:  Definitely Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) by far.  In 2018, 98 percent of our  revenue actually came from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>MUI:  In a post on \"Medium\", Hart argued that gives Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  enormous power over his business and ultimately harms consumers.</p><p>HART:  If we`re caught selling our products for less on walmart.com, let`s  say, then we sell them on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), then Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  will actually suppress our listings in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) search which  tremendously hurts sales.</p><p>So, what do we do?  We actually end up raising prices on our other  marketplaces to match Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>MUI:  That caught the attention of the FTC.  An investigator reached out  and Hart spent an hour on the phone with him.</p><p>HART:  It`s really hard to find someone who`s willing to speak up about an  issue when it comes to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) because people are afraid to  speak publicly.</p><p>MUI:  Regulators appear to be casting a wide net.  The FTC has reportedly  reached out to Snap in its case against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and a source  tells us the Justice Department has sent a subpoena to DuckDuckGo, a search  engine that`s trying to compete with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>Other Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) rivals like TripAdvisor and Yelp say they`re  finally being heard after trying for years to get the attention of U.S.  regulators.</p><p>LUTHER LOWE, YELP SR. VP OF POLICY:  It can`t just be sort of one squeaky  wheel raising this issue.  It has to be lots of players who are talking  about these issues, in order to spur the government to take action.</p><p>MUI:  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) says its services helped create more choice, not  limit it.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) did not respond to our request for comment.</p><p>For Hart, speaking out publicly violates his contract with Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and means he could end up suspended from the platform.</p><p>HART:  Going into Christmas, we have -- we`re going to hit over a million  dollars or at least get really close to it in inventory.  What happens to  the business if we can`t sell November and December?  We`re a toy seller.   What do we do with that inventory?</p><p>It`s going to be a really long haul from that point on if we were to get in  trouble.</p><p>MUI:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, it`s time to start thinking about college financial  aid, a confusing process but it doesn`t have to be.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  California`s governor has signed into law legislation that allows  college athletes to be paid.  They can now sign endorsement deals and  profit from their name, image and likeness.  The measure is the first of  its kind and analysts say it could transform the economics of college  sports.  The NCAA, which is the governing body of college sports, strictly  prohibits athletes from profiting in any way from their sport.  Many expect  the new law to be challenged in court.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, the fall semester may have just begun.  But for college- bound high school seniors and their parents, now is the time to start  thinking about the next school year.  Starting tomorrow, you can apply for  loans and grants using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid called  FAFSA.</p><p>Our senior personal finance correspondent Sharon Epperson joins us now to  talk about this lovely process.</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT SENIOR PERSONAL FINANCE  CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Why is the FAFSA form so important?</p><p>EPPERSON:  Because it unlocks the gateway to all kinds of aid.  Federal  student aid, yes, but also perhaps state aid, perhaps private institutions  aid.</p><p>When you look back at 2018 statistics, $122 billion in aid was awarded  because people filled out this form, to about nearly 13 million students  and about six thousand colleges participated.  So, there are a lot of  schools that are participating in this, a lot of students that are  participating in it, and their families.</p><p>The key is not that they`re going whether or not they`re going to fill out  the application.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>EPPERSON:  It`s when they fill it out.  That`s going to be very key.</p><p>HERERA:  And when do they start?</p><p>EPPERSON:  Tomorrow, October 1st, the sooner the better, because the  earlier you start, the more likely you are to get aid that may be given on  a first come, first served basis.  So, you want to make sure you apply as  soon as you can, don`t wait until your child has actually gotten into the  school because you need to figure out how you pay for it before that  acceptance even comes or maybe before you even apply.</p><p>And you want to fill it out regardless of your income because this is not  only for grants and scholarships for free money but it`s also a work study.   It`s also loan.  So, you want to make sure that you fill that out, and also  because states and private institutions are using the form.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, what do you need to bring with you as you`re filling out  that form?</p><p>EPPERSON:  Make sure that you have your 2018 tax return.  That`s the one  that they`re going to be looking at.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  OK.</p><p>EPPERSON:  You need to have an ID that is an FSA ID that you get so that  you can go on to the Department of Education Website, your Social Security  number, and then a record of your assets, your bank and brokerage  statements.  Know that your retirement accounts will not be counted for  financial aid.</p><p>HERERA:  It sounds like so much fun.</p><p>How is it -- how is the information really used or processed to determine  what kind of aid or how much aid you can get?</p><p>EPPERSON:  They use it to figure out your EFC, your expected family  contribution.  How much you`re expected to pay for your child`s education.   And the key there is to make sure that you include your assets, as well as  your child`s, and to know that your assets are not counted as much as your  child.</p><p>So, when you`re saving in that 529 plan, it`s not the same as if you`re  putting all that money in your kid`s name.</p><p>HERERA:  Got it.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m so glad that`s past me now.</p><p>EPPERSON:  Oh, lucky you.</p><p>HERERA:  You can hold my hand as I`ve -- as I`ve --</p><p>EPPERSON:  Yes, we`re holding each other`s hands.</p><p>HERERA:  Exactly, we are.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Thank you, Sharon Epperson.  Always good to see you.</p><p>HERERA:  Here`s a look at the final numbers on Wall Street.  The Dow rose  96, the Nasdaq added 59, S&amp;P was up 14.  For the month, all of the major  averages were higher and as for the quarter, the Dow and the sp up, but the  Nasdaq dipped slightly.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for  joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.

Well, it`s time to fill out a key form if you want to receive any assistance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, September 30th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>Well, it may be the start of the week, but it`s the end of the month, and the end of the third quarter. A period that was defined by trade tensions, recession concerns, interest rate worries and now political drama. But despite it all, stocks stayed steady.</p><p>Let`s run through the numbers. Today on the last day of the quarter, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 96 points to 26,916. The Nasdaq added 59 and the S&amp;P 500 was up 14.</p><p>For the month, all of the major averages were higher. And for the quarter, the Dow and the S&amp;P were up, but the Nasdaq dipped slightly.</p><p>And now comes October, a month that historically is volatile, and the next big hurdle, earnings.</p><p>Bob Pisani is at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For the third quarter officially out of the way, the markets are still on track to end the year strong. But investors are going to be fixated on the next big catalyst, and that is earnings. This next great earnings recession fear that dominated the first quarter and the fear that companies would dramatically lower earnings expectations in the second half of the year because of the tariffs and trade wars, and the global slowdown, none of this has ever come to pass.</p><p>Earnings have held steady and remain roughly flattish for the first quarter, the second quarter, and now, for third quarter. Going in to the year end, the fourth quarters estimates show a gain of roughly 4 percent. But still, that`s a big improvement over the last three quarters. And that`s good news.</p><p>So, there`s the problem: the two biggest issues that would earn the needle in earnings in one direction or the other are unresolved. The first one is trajectory of trade talks. Are we going to get more or less tariffs in the fourth quarter? And then there`s the Federal Reserve. Are they on hold when it comes to rates or are they not on hold?</p><p>And while there`s been no wholesale attempts to lower earnings in a big way, we do see a couple of troubling trends emerging. 13 of those 14 companies who`ve reported for the fourth quarter have had their estimates for the fourth quarter come down. That`s a very high percentage, north of 90 percent, and it`s been very notable downward revisions from some important bellwethers like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Micron and Carnival (NYSE:CCL).</p><p>The other trend is energy seeing very big downward positions, even in the third quarter. Exploration and production companies like EOG, for example, estimates have come down 20 percent for this as a group since July because excessive production of oil is keeping oil prices low. That`s something to keep an eye on as well.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Mark Luschini joins us now to talk more about these third quarter earnings expectations. He`s chief investment officer at Janney Montgomery Scott.</p><p>Mark, good to see you again. Welcome back.</p><p>MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Thank you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Certainly no shortage of things to talk about, as we look at what is traditionally the most volatile month of the year for Wall Street. But what`s your outlook? I mean, you know, Bob says flattish earnings are coming our way. What do you think?</p><p>LUSCHINI: Well, we know typically that companies tend to guide a little bit lower and the beat ratio typically comes in around 75 percent plus or minus a few percentage points around which generally means that over the course of the earnings season, earnings tend to trend higher than what are our original estimates are guesstimating. And right now, the negative 3 percent level looks daunting, but it shouldn`t be overcome and flatten out. I think investors are going to start to look toward fourth quarter in 2020 earnings estimates, and so much of that is going to be predicated upon conditions globally, both as it relates to trade as well as growth.</p><p>HERERA: And given that, this earnings season, what sector of the market do you think is going to be key? Not just for you, but the market overall?</p><p>LUSCHINI: Well, certainly, Sue, the biggest sector in the market is the technology sector. It represents 22 percent of the S&amp;P 500. So, it`s going to matter a lot in interprets of the influence on the direction of the market. Another big sector however is financials.</p><p>And we see a nice rally in the stock prices here in the month of September. We`ll see if it`s because investors are sniffing out better earnings to come from the financial sector growth, which again given its double-digit weight could help support the market if technology doesn`t, or if in combination drive the overall market higher.</p><p>So, those are the two I`ll be most focused on.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And energy, what you saw in that graphic, you feel it looks attractive right now, even as energy prices start to come down again here.</p><p>LUSCHINI: Well, Bill, one would have to be a pretty hard contrarian to wade into energy stocks at this juncture because they`ve done nothing but disappoint here so far this year. But that said, from a valuation perspective, there`s two standard deviations below their relative return against the S&amp;P 500 so far this year. And so, that would suggest to us perhaps they`re bombed out sufficiently, as to warrant some attention, particularly if investors become more confident that perhaps elevated energy prices or a geopolitical risk premium as a consequence of the attack on the Saudi Arabian facility could lead to even higher prices in the near future.</p><p>HERERA: So, Mark, how much of what you`ve just laid out for us do you think is already in the market, because there is still a lot of headline risk as Bill mentioned earlier in the market. Do earnings trump that or not?</p><p>LUSCHINI: Frankly, Sue, I think it`s the macroeconomic issues that trump earnings at this juncture. I think that you`re right, it`s baked in at this point. We`ve known for some time that earnings were going to face some difficult comparisons, because 2018 earnings were so strong. And we`re finally seeing the base effects of that perhaps fade in the fourth quarter of this year and for all of 2020. But that said, if we would get a resolution or at least some permanence to the truce between China and the U.S. and we start to detect real convincing signs of global growth beginning to at least stabilize if not outright improve, that could be enough even in the absence of third quarter earnings improving to be the driver for stock prices going into the end of the year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Mark Luschini with Janney Montgomery Scott -- again, always good to see you, Mark. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>LUSCHINI: Thank you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You bet.</p><p>HERERA: Well, part of the reason the market traded higher today was because of slightly positive economic news out of China and optimism around the trade talks. In a statement over the weekend, the Treasury Department said that the White House is not considering blocking Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. stock exchanges.</p><p>As you may recall, that report was one of the reasons why stocks fell on Friday. And the Chinese government had something to say about it.</p><p>Here`s Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The foreign ministry criticized reports that the Trump administration could be limiting U.S. investments into Chinese firms by saying that any decoupling of China and the U.S. would harm both sides and cause instability in global markets. Analysts here, though, say it`s not clear how damaging those restrictions would be in any case since foreign investors generally play a small role in domestic stock markets, and China has been trying to make its markets more attractive to Chinese firms with the launch of its own Nasdaq-style market.</p><p>Separately, China posted more data that surprised to the upside. But the improvement is likely only temporary. Analysts say the stronger orders were likely due to seasonal factors, possible frontloading and government stimulus. The better numbers came one day before China celebrates its 70th anniversary of the founding of the People`s Republic on Tuesday, expect the military hardware filled parade and an address by President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Investors will be looking for any clues on his speech on China`s policy towards the West.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Elsewhere, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said today that he hopes the U.S. and China do reach an agreement on trade sometime soon because he said the trade war has hit America`s heartland especially hard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER: It`s been very tough on American agriculture. And as you know, my party is very deeply based in rural America and small town America.</p><p>So, I hope the president can get a good outcome here. The Chinese have been stealing our intellectual property and not playing by the rules for a long time. So, I admire what he`s trying to do, but I hope we can get a conclusion of this sometime soon, because rural America really needs it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: According to \"Reuters\", about $19.5 billion in U.S. farm goods were exported to China in 2017, that figure fell to about $9 billion last year, after agriculture products were made more expensive by tariffs.</p><p>Senator McConnell also said that farmers would benefit if Congress passed the new NAFTA, which is now called USMCA.</p><p>HERERA: The president of the Chicago Fed said the Central Bank`s current accommodative stance is a good one, but suggested more cuts could be needed if economic headwinds increased. Charles Evans considers himself open- minded when it comes to monetary policy and said getting inflation to the Fed`s target rate of 2 percent has been a challenge over the last six months.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Oil prices fell sharply today on reports that Saudi Aramco has fully restored its production capacity following those drone attacks on those facilities earlier in the month. The attacks had briefly knocked out more than 5 million barrels a day of Saudi crude, knocked it offline. Price of domestic crude here in the U.S. today settled at a one month low.</p><p>HERERA: Boeing (NYSE:BA) plans to sharpen its focus on safety following the grounding of its 737 MAX plane. The announcement comes as the company enters a critical time of year.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has been following the story for us all along.</p><p>And, Phil, welcome.</p><p>Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg is increasing safety protocols.</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:</p><p>HERERA: How significant are the moves?</p><p>LEBEAU: Well, the moves are significant considering the fact that what Boeing (NYSE:BA) has gone through has exposed a lot of flaws in the process of developing and building aircraft. So, certainly, the fact that they`re going to be taking a greater focus, and people can now step up if they see a safety issue, that`s certainly going to help in the future.</p><p>Look, it can`t get worse than it already has been for Boeing (NYSE:BA). But keep in mind, this also comes as people continue to question what was being done as they developed the 737 MAX. The most recent report over the weekend is that this was a plane that as they built the military version of it, it had safeguards that were not applied also to the commercial version.</p><p>It`s just one more case where people, and you can bet they`ll bring this up when they question Dennis Muilenburg in Washington, D.C. People are saying, what was going on?</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes. Well, of course, tomorrow starts fourth quarter. And this is the time when Boeing (NYSE:BA) said it hoped that the 737 MAX could return to service.</p><p>What do you think, yes, no?</p><p>LEBEAU: They`ve got a lot of hurdles they`ve got to clear. If they`re going to make it within the next 90 days, think about this. They`ve still got to do a recertification flight, and I get no indication that that`s going to be happening any time soon.</p><p>Then they`ve got to formally ask for the regular lighters to approve the MAX going back into service. Then they`ve got have to prepare all these grounded MAX planes. Just can`t flip a switch. That`s going to take anywhere from 20 to 40 days is the estimate I hear from the airlines. So, a lot of things have to happen if the MAX is going to fly by the end of the year.</p><p>HERERA: You`re a busy guy these days. You have another huge story on your radar, that`s the UAW/GM strike.</p><p>LEBEAU: Yes.</p><p>HERERA: Any movement so far today?</p><p>LEBEAU: They`re still talking. And everyone says that they are making progress. But I get no sense that we see a deal coming any time soon. So, keep in mind that the UAW workers, they have been without work. So, they`ve been two weeks without work, they missed a paycheck on Friday.</p><p>They are now eligible for strike payments from the UAW. That comes out to $250 a week, as they start to get those this week. That will help a little bit.</p><p>But, guys, $250 a week, that`s nothing compared to what you`re making if you`re on the assembly line.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Indeed. It`s interesting that GM shares have not suffered over this time frame. Why is that do you think?</p><p>LEBEAU: The inventory is still there. Sales have been hit. If we see inventory drop off, especially for pickup trucks, then you would see the stock really suffer.</p><p>HERERA: Phil LeBeau, thanks as always, Phil.</p><p>LEBEAU: You bet.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>We begin with shares of Bed, Bath and Beyond. They were upgraded to outperform from market perform at BMO Capital. The analyst there cited the potential for earnings to stabilize over the next couple years. Stock price target now, $16. Shares rose 7 1/2 percent today to $10.64.</p><p>Also at BMO Capital, United Healthcare and Humana (NYSE:HUM) were downgraded to outperform. That analyst cited election uncertainty and its impact on future health care policy. Price target for UnitedHealthcare is $249. For Humana (NYSE:HUM), it`s $290. The stocks however moved in opposite directions today, UnitedHealth rose, Humana (NYSE:HUM) was down.</p><p>HERERA: Apple`s price target was hiked to $265 at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). The analyst sees sentiment on the stock improving materially. The firm has an overweight rating on the stock. The stock was up 2 percent to $223.97.</p><p>Newell Brands was upgraded to buy from hold at SunTrust. The analyst there says the company is on a verge of a turnaround. The price target is $25, and the shares gain more than 2-1/2 percent to $18.72.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Still ahead, Bernie Sanders has a plan to tax corporations and address the pay gap between CEOs and workers.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: WeWork has now officially pulled its initial public offering. The embattled office sharing startup formally announced its intent to go public last month.</p><p>And in the process, it revealed big losses and a confusing corporate structure. Then came weak demand for its stock, which led to a reduced valuation for the company. Last week, WeWork`s co-founder and CEO Adam Newman stepped down and gave up his voting power in the process. And so, today, the IPO has been shelved.</p><p>HERERA: Forever 21 has filed for bankruptcy. The fashion retailer that helped popularize fast fashion has filed for chapter 11 protection. The company which targets teen shoppers said it would cease operation in 40 countries and close up to 178 stores here in the U.S. Forever 21 plans to continue to operate its website and simplify its operations while going through the bankruptcy process. Analysts say the store was not able to keep up with the shifting tastes of younger consumers.</p><p>GRIFFETH: A judge today dismissed a lawsuit brought by four states that challenged a provision of the 2017 tax law that kept state and local tax deductions. The judge reaffirmed that cap as part of Congress`s broad powers to write and pass tax legislation under the Constitution. He also said that the states did not show that the cap constrains their decision- making process.</p><p>HERERA: Senator Bernie Sanders has outlined a new tax plan that targets corporations. The aim is to narrow the gap between what they pay their top executives and what they pay their workers.</p><p>Robert Frank has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Bernie Sanders announcing this morning that it is, quote, time to send a message to corporate America. If you do not end your greed and corruption, he said, we will end it for you.</p><p>And he hopes to end it with a new inequality tax -- tax would apply to companies with revenues of more than $100 million both private and public, where CEO pay is at least times the median salary of their workers. Now, it`s a sliding scale starting with half a percent tax and rising to 5 percent for companies whose CEO makes more than 500 times their median worker. Now, Sanders said it would raise $150 billion a year.</p><p>Now the companies that would be hardest hit are mostly in retail, banking and restaurant chains since they have large workforces of lower paid workers or they have operations in developing countries.</p><p>Now, McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) would pay an additional $110 million in taxes last year under the plan while Walmart would have had to pay an additional $800 million and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase would have paid $1 billion more in taxes. Now, some of the other companies with large pay gaps include Chipotle, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), Kohl`s (NYSE:KSS) and The Gap (NYSE:GPS).</p><p>Now, some market strategists say the plan is more political than practical.</p><p>DAN CLIFTON, STRATEGAS: There`s a difference between campaigning and governing. And from a campaign theme, it fits very well in this theme that we were talking about income inequality, CEO pay. I think as a practical aspect, it would be very difficult to implement.</p><p>FRANK: The tax is made possible by recent SEC rule that requires companies to disclose the pay gap. But there are no set rules for how companies have to calculate the median pay. So, like any tax, companies would probably find ways around it.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Thor Industries (NYSE:THO) drops the hammer and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with the RV maker topping analyst profit expectations, thanks to lower costs in North America. But the company missed on revenue due to sluggish sales, but investors seem to be focusing mainly on that bottom line number. The shares jumped nearly 16 percent to $56.64.</p><p>Cal-Maine Food says an extreme drop in egg prices hurt the egg producer`s sales which led to a bigger loss than Wall Street expected. Egg prices have dropped by as much as 40 percent of the past year due mainly to an oversupply that started in early 2018. Cal-Maine stock dropped about 17 -- about 12 percent today at $39.96.</p><p>And Seattle Genetic says that data from an early stage bladder cancer drug test showed about a 70 percent overall survival rate when it was combined with Merck`s Keytruda. And Wall Street noticed, as multiple brokerage firms today raised their price target on that biotech company. And shares rose more than 12 percent to $85.40.</p><p>HERERA: Walgreens is joining CBS (NYSE:CBS) in suspending the sales of Sanofi`s Zantac and other generic heartburn products, as the FDA continues its review after an online pharmacy cited low levels of a chemical that could cause cancer. Both CVS (NYSE:CVS) and Walgreens shares rose more than one-and-a-half percent. Sanofi was up a fraction.</p><p>Congressional antitrust investigators are looking at Google`s new Internet protocol worried it might give the company an unfair advantage by denying others access to consumer data. The House sent a letter earlier in the month asking Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) if it would collect the data for any commercial purposes. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) claims its goal on this project is to improve Internet security. The shares fell a fraction to $1,221.14.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) isn`t the only big tech company under scrutiny these days. Other Silicon Valley giants are as well. And as regulators investigate their dominance, they are calling on smaller companies to better understand just how much power the big ones hold.</p><p>Ylan Mui talks to one business who says it`s getting squeezed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE MOLSON HART, VIAHART FOUNDER: Technically by appearing in this interview, we could get in a lot of trouble.</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Molson Hart has been selling toys for almost 10 years.</p><p>HART: This is another one of my favorite guys. This is Slowmo, Slowmo the sloth.</p><p>MUI: Stuffed animals, a construction toy called Brain Flakes, even kickboards.</p><p>Where does he sell all of this?</p><p>HART: Definitely Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) by far. In 2018, 98 percent of our revenue actually came from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>MUI: In a post on \"Medium\", Hart argued that gives Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) enormous power over his business and ultimately harms consumers.</p><p>HART: If we`re caught selling our products for less on walmart.com, let`s say, then we sell them on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), then Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will actually suppress our listings in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) search which tremendously hurts sales.</p><p>So, what do we do? We actually end up raising prices on our other marketplaces to match Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>MUI: That caught the attention of the FTC. An investigator reached out and Hart spent an hour on the phone with him.</p><p>HART: It`s really hard to find someone who`s willing to speak up about an issue when it comes to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) because people are afraid to speak publicly.</p><p>MUI: Regulators appear to be casting a wide net. The FTC has reportedly reached out to Snap in its case against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and a source tells us the Justice Department has sent a subpoena to DuckDuckGo, a search engine that`s trying to compete with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>Other Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) rivals like TripAdvisor and Yelp say they`re finally being heard after trying for years to get the attention of U.S. regulators.</p><p>LUTHER LOWE, YELP SR. VP OF POLICY: It can`t just be sort of one squeaky wheel raising this issue. It has to be lots of players who are talking about these issues, in order to spur the government to take action.</p><p>MUI: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) says its services helped create more choice, not limit it. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) did not respond to our request for comment.</p><p>For Hart, speaking out publicly violates his contract with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and means he could end up suspended from the platform.</p><p>HART: Going into Christmas, we have -- we`re going to hit over a million dollars or at least get really close to it in inventory. What happens to the business if we can`t sell November and December? We`re a toy seller. What do we do with that inventory?</p><p>It`s going to be a really long haul from that point on if we were to get in trouble.</p><p>MUI: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, it`s time to start thinking about college financial aid, a confusing process but it doesn`t have to be.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: California`s governor has signed into law legislation that allows college athletes to be paid. They can now sign endorsement deals and profit from their name, image and likeness. The measure is the first of its kind and analysts say it could transform the economics of college sports. The NCAA, which is the governing body of college sports, strictly prohibits athletes from profiting in any way from their sport. Many expect the new law to be challenged in court.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, the fall semester may have just begun. But for college- bound high school seniors and their parents, now is the time to start thinking about the next school year. Starting tomorrow, you can apply for loans and grants using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid called FAFSA.</p><p>Our senior personal finance correspondent Sharon Epperson joins us now to talk about this lovely process.</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT SENIOR PERSONAL FINANCE CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Why is the FAFSA form so important?</p><p>EPPERSON: Because it unlocks the gateway to all kinds of aid. Federal student aid, yes, but also perhaps state aid, perhaps private institutions aid.</p><p>When you look back at 2018 statistics, $122 billion in aid was awarded because people filled out this form, to about nearly 13 million students and about six thousand colleges participated. So, there are a lot of schools that are participating in this, a lot of students that are participating in it, and their families.</p><p>The key is not that they`re going whether or not they`re going to fill out the application.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>EPPERSON: It`s when they fill it out. That`s going to be very key.</p><p>HERERA: And when do they start?</p><p>EPPERSON: Tomorrow, October 1st, the sooner the better, because the earlier you start, the more likely you are to get aid that may be given on a first come, first served basis. So, you want to make sure you apply as soon as you can, don`t wait until your child has actually gotten into the school because you need to figure out how you pay for it before that acceptance even comes or maybe before you even apply.</p><p>And you want to fill it out regardless of your income because this is not only for grants and scholarships for free money but it`s also a work study. It`s also loan. So, you want to make sure that you fill that out, and also because states and private institutions are using the form.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, what do you need to bring with you as you`re filling out that form?</p><p>EPPERSON: Make sure that you have your 2018 tax return. That`s the one that they`re going to be looking at.</p><p>GRIFFETH: OK.</p><p>EPPERSON: You need to have an ID that is an FSA ID that you get so that you can go on to the Department of Education Website, your Social Security number, and then a record of your assets, your bank and brokerage statements. Know that your retirement accounts will not be counted for financial aid.</p><p>HERERA: It sounds like so much fun.</p><p>How is it -- how is the information really used or processed to determine what kind of aid or how much aid you can get?</p><p>EPPERSON: They use it to figure out your EFC, your expected family contribution. How much you`re expected to pay for your child`s education. And the key there is to make sure that you include your assets, as well as your child`s, and to know that your assets are not counted as much as your child.</p><p>So, when you`re saving in that 529 plan, it`s not the same as if you`re putting all that money in your kid`s name.</p><p>HERERA: Got it.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m so glad that`s past me now.</p><p>EPPERSON: Oh, lucky you.</p><p>HERERA: You can hold my hand as I`ve -- as I`ve --</p><p>EPPERSON: Yes, we`re holding each other`s hands.</p><p>HERERA: Exactly, we are.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Thank you, Sharon Epperson. Always good to see you.</p><p>HERERA: Here`s a look at the final numbers on Wall Street. The Dow rose 96, the Nasdaq added 59, S&amp;P was up 14. For the month, all of the major averages were higher and as for the quarter, the Dow and the sp up, but the Nasdaq dipped slightly.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: No boo hoos at Yahoo! (YHOO). The NASDAQ listed Internet company turns in a stellar earnings performance on a day when the NASDAQ Market itself hits a new record high. Good evening. I'm Paul Kangas in Miami.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: And I'm Susie Gharib in New York City. The NASDAQ's not the only one in the record books today. So are the S&amp;P 500, 100 and the NYSE Composite. Then, the proposed alliance between British Airways (BAB) and American Airlines (AMR) passes a big hurdle, but it has big strings attached.</p><p>Good evening everyone. Looks like there was more action on Wall Street after the close than during regular trading hours today. That's because a terrific earnings report from Internet company Yahoo! sent its shares soaring 16 points in after hours trading to the $202 mark, taking other net stocks along for the ride. All of this on a day when the market saw records almost all across the board. Here's Scott Gurvey.<br/>\u00a0<br/> SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, CORRESPONDENT: Shares of Internet stocks including Yahoo!, Netscape (NSCP), Excite (XCIT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) soared in after hours trading, reversing the decline most suffered during the NASDAQ's public trading hours. The reason was Yahoo!'s better than expected earnings report. The company said after the close that it made $0.15 after excluding a one-time acquisition charge. The Street was expecting $0.09. Yahoo! also announced a 2-for-1 split. The Yahoo! report ended a day, which saw the Dow close at its highest level in two months, and both the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite set new records.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Big technology companies like Microsoft and Intel (INTC) led the NASDAQ, while financial sector stocks drove the big board after Merrill Lynch put a \"buy\" on the pending Travelers (TRV) Citicorp (CCI) merger. It is a little unusual for the market to rally just before the earnings report season begins, but many experts say stocks remain the most attractive place for investors to put their money.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MARY FARRELL, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, PAINEWEBBER: I think if you're a long-term investor, just stay invested. We haven't seen anything that suggests an end to this bull market. Acting very importantly, the returns in fixed income either short or long-term are not going to be competitive with common stocks.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GURVEY: The earnings reporting season does begin in earnest next week, and there will be several reports from the most closely watched sectors.<br/>\u00a0<br/> CHUCK HILL, RESEARCH DIRECTOR, FIRST CALL: The two areas where we've had the most problems in terms of downward revisions this quarter and last quarter, I might add, have been technology and energy. Now the energy companies don't report for another week or so. But we'll see a lot of technology companies reporting.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GURVEY: Two of those companies that, the big tech companies that will be reporting next week on Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel. And an analyst report today saying that Intel and an analyst report today saying that Intel will meet its projections, helped spark a recovery for some of the semiconductor stocks. But after the close, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported a much larger than expected loss. So the jury's still out Susie.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Back to the report on Yahoo!. How significant is this earnings report that Yahoo! came out with today for some of these other Net companies?<br/>\u00a0<br/> GURVEY: Well it is important because so far, they haven't seen a lot of profits for these companies. Any kind of profit that you see is a good news.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: So what does it mean for the stock, still risky?<br/>\u00a0<br/> GURVEY: Well, the stocks are highly priced, and if you believe in price earnings ratios, they're risky.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: All right. Thanks a lot, Scott Gurvey. Over to you now, Paul.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: So, we've seen where the markets finished the day. Now let's see how they got there. Led by an upward surge in some of those big high- tech stocks like Intel, Microsoft and Dell (DELL), stocks on Wall Street headed higher early today. By 11:00 a.m., the NASDAQ Index with a 9 1/2 point gain, edged just above its April 22nd record closing high and the Dow Industrial Average posted a 46 point gain, thanks in part to a 4- point advance in Travelers stock, which as we've mentioned, was boosted by favorable comments from Merrill Lynch.<br/>\u00a0<br/> As the Standard &amp; Poors 500 Index pushed into record high ground in late morning, the rally steadily expanded with New York Exchange breadth turning 16 to 13 positive as afternoon trading progressed. Computer buy programs and short covering purchases added further buoyancy to the market, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average went on to close with a gain of 89.93 points, putting it at 9174.97. That's only about 37 points below the May 13 record closing high.<br/>\u00a0<br/> In today's 100-point trading range, the Dow closed only 9 1/2 points below the best level of the session, up 90 1/2 points from the low of the day. The NASDAQ Composite finished with a gain of 27.28. That's at a record high, 1938.39, and it closed right near its best level of the session.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Big board volume, a little on the disappointing side, down from yesterday at 607.2 million shares, but quite a big more up volume than down volume, not quite 2-to-1 ratio there.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Dow Transport Index edged up only .21.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Utilities up .12.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Closing Tick modestly bullish at +357.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Standard &amp; Poor's 500, an easy record high, up 11.72.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The 100 had a record with a gain of 4.63.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MidCap 400 up just over 3 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And the Bridge Futures Price Index fell .39.<br/>\u00a0<br/>New York Stock Exchange Composite as we mentioned had a record with that gain of over 4 1/2 points. Value Line up 1.73.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Russell2000 Small Cap Index up .93.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And a record for the Wilshire 5000 with that gain of just over 97 3/4 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Relatively stable Pacific Rim markets and slight weakness in the dollar against the yen, had the bond market a bit on the defensive today. And so did supply pressures in the form of the $8 billion offering of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities or TIPS as they're called. The TIPS had just a mediocre reception with the bid to cover ratio at 2.38, which produced a yield of 3.68 percent for these 30- year bonds.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: In the absence of other news, Tax Free and Corporate Issues ended mostly unchanged.<br/>\u00a0<br/> While treasuries closed modestly lower.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The 5-year notes dropping just 1/32.<br/>\u00a0<br/> But a 4/32 loss in the 10-year notes.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Bellwether 30-year bond off 11/32.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Bringing the yield up to 5.63 percent.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And the Lehman Brothers Long Treasury Bond Index off 5 1/10 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> I'll be back shortly to show you where the action was on Wall Street today. Susie.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: All right, Paul. The European Union gave the green light to two big deals today. As expected, it okayed the combination between MCI (MCIC) and WorldCom (WCOM) on the condition that MCI sells off its Internet assets. The deal still needs to be approved by U.S. regulators, and is being challenged by competitor, GTE (GTE).<br/>\u00a0<br/> The EU also gave conditional approval to the alliance of British Airways and American Airlines. And that also faces challenges. Dennis Moore reports.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DENNIS MOORE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, CORRESPONDENT: After two years and the regulatory equivalent of holding at the end of the runway, American Airlines and British Airways think the European legal controllers are ready to clear their plans to merge schedules and marketing.<br/>\u00a0<br/> WILL RIS, V.P., GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, AMERICAN AIRLINES: We think from what we've seen today that it is clearly a step in the right direction, and we're very pleased about that.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MOORE: But before they'll let the alliance roll, the EU regulators want BA and AA to give up between 2 and 300 weekly take-off and landing slots at London's Heathrow and Gatwick Airports. That's more than the two carriers want to give up, but not enough to satisfy would-be competitors.<br/>\u00a0<br/> CYRIL MURPHY, V.P., INTERNATIONAL &amp; REGULATORY AFFAIRS, UNITED AIRLINES: What you're really talking about in London is putting the #1 and #2 carrier together in a marketplace that already has constrained access.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MOORE: The EU regulators also want United (UAL) and its trans- Atlantic partners, Lufthansa (DLAGY) and SAS to give up take-off and landing slots in Frankfurt and other airports. And that, says United, in a formal complaint to the U.S. Government, violates Open Skies Treaties the U.S. has already negotiated.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MURPHY: We are looking for the U.S. Government to get assurances from its European partners that have entered into these agreements, that they're going to honor these rights.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MOORE: The airlines have fallen into a turf war between the European Commission and the individual governments that want to negotiate their own international aviation agreements.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DARRYL JENKINS, AIRLINE CONSULTANT: The turf war as, is that EU is now telling the Brits how to run their airport, all right. And by telling them how to do that, they're also, in fact, telling the United States what the market shares are going to be on certain routes.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MOORE: The EU regulators would effectively be telling American and United how many flights they could fly from certain U.S. cities.<br/>\u00a0<br/> JENKINS: I think the problem is not at the airline level, all right. I think the problem's at the governmental level and the problem is, should the United States government go along with a proposal like this.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MOORE: Late today, the government said it would review the EU's airline alliance opinion but it wants a real Open Skies Treaty. Dennis Moore, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Meanwhile, in Russia, another disappointing day for investors. The Russian Stock Market was down again today, losing more than 2 1/2 percent. So far this year, it's been down 66 percent. And even though the ruble traded up a little bit today, many currency traders are concerned that Russia might have no choice but to devalue its currency.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Joining us now to talk about what might be next for Russia is Melissa Donohue. She covers emerging markets for BridgeNews. Hi, Melissa.<br/>\u00a0<br/> MELISSA DONOHUE, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, BRIDGENEWS: Hi, how are you?<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: All right, you know, so many people are saying that a devaluation of the ruble is almost inevitable. I mean, what are you turning up in your reporting?<br/>\u00a0<br/> DONOHUE: I think a lot of people at this point are thinking a devaluation would cause a lot more harm than good for Russia. And that something is going to come through with an international funding package to protect the country from having to make such a policy move.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: And that's the whole key -- is the International Monetary Fund going to come through with this money, because Russia is saying that they need something like 10 to $15 billion. Russia experts are saying, maybe more like $20 billion. Is the IMF going to come up with this kind of money?<br/>\u00a0<br/> DONOHUE: I think at this point, most people believe, yes. That the IMF will come up with some money, together with the World Bank and maybe some bilateral credits. Investors are looking for, we believe, about 15 to 20 billion, as you said. Russia's asked for about 10 to 15 billion.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: What kind of reserves, dollar reserves, does Russia have at this point?<br/>\u00a0<br/> DONOHUE: Russia has about $16 billion in reserves right now.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Do you believe those numbers?<br/>\u00a0<br/> DONOHUE: Yes, I believe those numbers. That's what analysts are saying. Some of that is not liquid though, some of that is gold. The problem though is they have, this year, over $30 billion in short-term debt maturing. So there is a fairly hefty gap between the amount of reserves they have, and the amount of debt that's maturing.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Now, what about the timing? We were all waiting to hear when this IMF rescue package is going to come through. The IMF saying today that it's not going to commit to any deadline on this. But then there were some Russian officials saying, by the end of next week. Who are we to believe on this?<br/>\u00a0<br/> DONOHUE: Well, it's pretty tough to pinpoint at this point. But what we're hearing is, probably by the end of the month.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: All right. We've got to wait and see what's going to happen. You keep us posted.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DONOHUE: OK. Thank you.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: All right. Thanks a lot. Melissa Donohue, reporter with BridgeNews.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Still ahead on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT: When a big deal helps the little guys. A look at two telecommunications companies that stand to benefit from a merger in their industry.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Women who claim their silicon breast implants made them sick will finally be compensated by the implants maker. Dow Corning has accepted a mediator's offer to pay $3.2 billion to settle claims by at least 170,000 women. The amount is 200 million more than Dow Corning offered in its bankruptcy reorganization plan. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection three years ago, because of those lawsuits. Paul?<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: The shares of Dow Corning's parents, Dow Chemical (DOW) up 7/16 at 97 3/16. And Corning (GLW) lost 1/8 at 35 1/8. It was a wild day on Wall Street. A lot of new records in the popular averages. And the Dow Industrial Average was in 37 points of a record with that gain of nearly 90 points. And the broader market nicely higher by a 17-to-12 ratio. 163 new yearly highs.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Only 78 new lows.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Compaq Computer (CPQ) topped the active list on nearly 14 million shares, edging up 11/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Then the Travelers Group (TRV) up 4 11/16. That move helped the Dow Industrial Average by 19 points. And as you heard Scott say earlier, Merrill Lynch is positive on Citigroup, when it starts trading, will have a \"buy\" recommendation.<br/>\u00a0<br/> RJR Nabisco (RN) on a weak tobacco group, down 1 3/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Philip Morris (MO) dropping 1 5/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/>AT&amp;T (T), fifth in volume, moved up nearly a point.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Philip Services (PHV) up 1/8.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Home Depot (HD) gained 1 11/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/>America Online (AOL) rising 1 7/8.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Chase Manhattan (CMB) down 1 3/8.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) edged up 1/8, but after the close as you heard, it had a second quarter loss, turned out to be $0.45 a share in the red. That was a lot bigger than what the Street estimate was. That was for a $0.20 per share loss.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Citicorp (CCI) up 11 13/16. The other half of the Citigroup to be and Merrill Lynch presently very positive on that as we mentioned.<br/>\u00a0<br/>DST Systems (DST) gained 3 7/8. The computer software services company was named a focus one stock by Merrill Lynch today with a \"buy\" rating.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And then Gateway 2000 (GTW) up 3 3/16. This is a record closing high for Gateway.<br/>\u00a0<br/>General Motors (GM) gained 3 1/4 points. The bargainers had a very long session, and that raised hopes that the strike settlement could be near.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Motorola (MOT) down 2 11/16. After the close yesterday, the company came in with $0.01 in earnings. Street was looking for maybe a $0.04 loss, but the company did warn that the Asian impact will last for the rest of this year. Sterling Commerce (SE) was off 2 11/16 after First Albany Brokerage downgraded it from \"buy\" to \"neutral.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/> PremiumWear (PWA), up 2 7/16. Company says second quarter sales were up 40 percent, and earnings will rise at least that much. The company citing strong demand for its Munsingwear line. That used to be the name of this company.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Advanced Communications (ADG) rose 1 3/8. The company offers local long distance and Internet access in the midwest of the country. Didn't return our calls, but volume today was very much above normal, the 176,000 shares about triple normal volume.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Richfood Holdings (RFH) up 3 1/4 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And Maxim Group (MXG) up 2 9/16. Officials from these two companies made upbeat presentations at Wheat First Union's Conference in Nantucket. Helped both stocks.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Singer Co. (SEW), that's the sewing machine company, down 7/8 and as much as we needled the company, not a single officer returned our call. So no news on the wires.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Apria Healthcare Group (AHG) off 13/16, the second biggest percentage loser. The company says it's gotten six subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Sacramento asking for documents related to its billing practices.<br/>\u00a0<br/>NASDAQ trading, as we mentioned, a record high in the Index with that gain of 27 1/4 points. Volume heavy at 841.8 million shares. 21 stocks higher for every 20 lower.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Yahoo! (YHOO) topped the active list. Now this is where it closed in normal hours, up 4 13/16. But in after hours trading, after that 2-for-1 split news and the much better than expected earnings, it was trading at $202, but it closed down 4 13/16, after the close up $202.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Intel (INTC) up 3 3/16.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Dell Computer (DELL), a nice gain of over 5 points.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Microsoft (MSFT), look at the strength in these companies, up nearly 2 there.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Amazon.com (AMZN) was down 15 at the close, but in after hours trading, that stock was trading around 113.<br/>\u00a0<br/>WorldCom (WCOM) edged up 1/4.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Cisco Systems (CSCO) up 1 1/2.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Lycos (LCOS) down 7 1/2, but it was trading around $82 in after hours trading, all after this good news from Yahoo!<br/>\u00a0<br/>Netscape (NSCP) up 1 1/16. And Excite (XCIT) was down 4 7/8, but it too was trading at around 95 in after hours.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Cardima (CRDM), the big percentage gainer here, up 6 13/32. The FDA has granted marketing approval for the companies viewport balloon catheter.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Semtech (SMTC) down 4 1/16. The company sees second quarter earnings 40 to 50 percent below first quarter earnings.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And FTI Consulting (FTIC) losing 2 3/4. This company's predicting lower than expected second quarter earnings around $0.09 to $0.10 a share. The Street was looking for $0.23 a share.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The American Exchange Index edged up .69. Volume down about 800,000 shares from yesterday, and 11 more issues actually closed lower than higher.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The Standard &amp; Poor's Depositary Receipts (SPY) topped the active list, up 27/32.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And then Unitel Video (UNV), the best percentage gainer, up 3/4. The company came in with a third quarter loss of $0.25 a share, but nowhere near as bad as last year's $0.59 per share loss.<br/>\u00a0<br/> And then Gencor Industries (GX), which manufactures highway construction equipment couldn't explain this nice 2 1/4 point gain, said it had no corporate developments to account for it. That's our Wall Street wrap up. Susie.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Thanks Paul. We've updated you on one telecom merger tonight with the news on WorldCom and MCI. Now an update on another, the merger between Ameritech (AIT) and SBC Communications (SBC). That deal is beginning to look like a windfall to companies that do business with the telecom giants. Diane Eastabrook reports.<br/>\u00a0<br/> DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, CORRESPONDENT: To USN Communications (USNC), an Ameritech/SBC merger could clear a path to thousands of new customers. The two-year old company bundles local, long distance and enhanced services like voice mail that resells them to small businesses that have fewer than 10 telephone lines. USN currently serves the Ameritech region, where it expects to have access to nearly 8 million phone lines by the end of next year. If Ameritech merges with SBC by then, USN says it could potentially have access to nearly 24 million lines.<br/>\u00a0<br/> THOMAS ELLIOTT, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, USN COMMUNICATIONS: They are in a number of other states that represent a huge market. We've seen this sort of thing occur previously where Bell Atlantic (BEL) acquired NYNEX, and what that meant to us was an expansion of our opportunity. It also meant some acceleration in terms of the pace at which the Bell operating companies starting to move towards opening up to our type of business.<br/>\u00a0<br/> EASTABROOK: Tellabs (TLAB) is another company that hopes an Ameritech/SBC merger yields the same kind of benefits Elliott says the NYNEX/Bell Atlantic merger has. Before that merger, Tellabs was making data transport systems for Bell Atlantic, but not for NYNEX. But since the merger, Tellabs has inked a deal with NYNEX worth nearly $0.5 billion. The company speculates Ameritech and SBC's global expansion plans could require a huge expansion in infrastructure.<br/>\u00a0<br/> EASTABROOK: And one analyst, agrees.<br/>\u00a0<br/> OPHELIA BARSKETIS, ANALYST, STEIN ROE &amp; FARNHAM: Obviously, these kind of businesses need everything from fiber optic cables to large switches. Most of these systems now are very sophisticated. There's a lot of software and hardware involved. And so, in that sense, it would be good for the equipment companies.<br/>\u00a0<br/> EASTABROOK: But Barsketis warns, companies like USN Communications and Tellabs could face a long wait before reaping the potential benefits of a merger between Ameritech and SBC. The government must still approve the deal, and that could take anywhere from six to 18 months. Diane Eastabrook, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Tomorrow, we'll profile an American company that manufactures in China with a brand new brand name.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Real estate mogul, Samuel Zell is expanding his empire. His Equity Residential Properties Trust (EQR) is now buying Merry Land &amp; Investment (MRY) for $2.2 billion in stock and debt. This deal only reinforces Equity as the biggest apartment REIT in the country. The news came after the market closed, ahead of that, Equity's stock was down 7/16 at 46 11/16. As for Merry Land, up 11/16 to $23 a share.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Small investors will soon be able to buy government savings bonds that provide a hedge against inflation. The new I-bonds will feature the likenesses of such prominent Americans as Albert Einstein. The bonds will carry two rates. One that stays fixed for the life of the bond, and one that's adjusted every six months based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: Looking for some stocks that have some solid growth potential in their future? Moneyfile commentator and financial columnist, Jim Glassman says, you might want to start small.<br/>\u00a0<br/> JIM GLASSMAN, FINANCIAL COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST: One good way to find bargains is by looking at sectors of the stock market that are lagging behind. Right now, the most obvious is small company stocks, or as they're called, small cap stocks.<br/>\u00a0<br/> The figures just in for the second quarter are truly amazing. The Russell Top 200 Index, which tracks the 200 largest companies in the market -- GE (GE), Coke (KO), et cetera -- returned 4 percent for the three months from April to June. Now that's ahead of the historic averages for all stocks. But the Russell2000, which tracks small caps, was down 5 percent. That continues a strong trend.<br/>\u00a0<br/> For the full first-half, the Russell large caps were up 19 percent. But the small caps, up only 5 percent. Small caps also trailed the market in 1995, 1996 and 1997. What gives?<br/>\u00a0<br/> Well, the current explanation is that worried mutual fund managers want to own large cap stocks, now. So that if they have to bail out, there will be more liquidity, more chance of finding a buyer.<br/>\u00a0<br/> I don't care what the rationale is. As long as nothing fundamental has happened to small caps. And I don't think it has. On the contrary, small companies have the flexibility to do very well in this new economy. The best explanation is that investors, as they often do, have gone overboard in one direction. So let's lean in the other.<br/>\u00a0<br/> If your portfolio is light on small caps, take a close look. I'm Jim Glassman.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Recapping today's market action. The Dow closes up almost 90 points. The NASDAQ Market gains more than 27 points to a new record closing high.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: And finally tonight. The new European currency, the euro, is being trashed, literally. Nine-million coins have already been minted in France in anticipation of the single currency. But they're going to be melted down. And that's because they don't have raised edges, which is the only way that many blind and elderly people can tell the difference between coins.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Also, vending machine operators complained about the new coin saying that they were so similar in weight, that vending machines couldn't tell them apart. So, Paul, to coin a phrase -- back to the drawing board.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: That's it.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: That's it. I still can't believe there's actually going to be a euro. We'll have to see what happens.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: It's going to be a busy mint.<br/>\u00a0<br/> GHARIB: That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Wednesday, July 8.<br/>\u00a0<br/> I'm Susie Gharib in New York City.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Please be sure to join us at our World Wide Web site.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Good night, everyone.<br/>\u00a0<br/> Good night to you, Paul.<br/>\u00a0<br/> KANGAS: Good night, Susie. I'm Paul Kangas in Miami, wishing all of you the best of good buys.<br/>\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBR-R98070800118</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">nitbus1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3T44-F2S0-008R-X05G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142705</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4057\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Nightly Business Report</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 Community Television Foundation\u00a0 of South Florida, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>July 8, 1998</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>YAHOO!

Nikhil manages $42 billion and is the former group chief investment officer at Assicurazioni Generali. I think it took me at the time, like four years, Nikhil, to get you back on, so I'm glad you're more available to us now, thank you for coming on.</p><p>NIKHIL SRINIVASAN, CHAIRMAN INTERNATIONAL, HPS INVESTMENT PARTNERS: Thank you, Francine, it's my pleasure.</p><p>LACQUA: And Christian, thank you for -- for coming on as well. first of all, how should investors look at risk Catalonia? So this is something that was ignored on Friday, and then today, it seems that even spreads between the German and Italian yields are going a little bit crazy.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: You get -- you have to get used to a bit of volatility in this. I think there's a process, and I think your colleague in Barcelona had some comments. My point of view, this request constitutional reform, and that'll take a bit of time, and then at some point then, the Catalonians will decide will they want to vote again based on the reform. So until that happens, that could take several months, it's going to be a bit unsaid, but it's not going to be dramatically bad, I mean, Spanish yields are up seven basis points, and I wouldn't say that's a calamity.</p><p>LACQUA: No, it's not a calamity, but when you look at the ECB and kind of, you know, the fact that they are standing firm, the fact that you see this kind of news, Christian, what does it mean for Spanish GDP overall?</p><p>CHRISTIAN KELLER, HEAD OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH, BARCLAYS: Well, I mean Catalonia as well, very much reported, is 1/5 of the Spanish economy, so it is an important part, but so far, I would actually be of a similar view that, you know, cyclically, Europe looks quite strong right now, you know, and then we have a global recovery that in -- in full swing, we have a synchronized recovery in Europe after, you know, the elections in France which is more of a, you know, real problem early in December or could have been one, and then you had actually, Italy and Spain in particular, cleaning up the bank balance sheet, so now, we have a situation where really, Europe, you know, looks quite good with regard to growth, and I'm not sure whether this -- of course, we have to see how far, you know, this -- this expands now, but this will really be something that will more seriously, fundamentally in a way, derail this recovery that we see in Europe.</p><p>LACQUA: Nikhil, you were saying that basically, when you look at the Spanish bonds, they're falling a touch, but it's nothing to (inaudible) about. Let me bring you over to my chart. This is -- you see the Spanish bonds compared to the Catalonian bonds. For our radio listeners, we will push it out on social media. Any value? I'm not necessarily talking to you about, you know, Catalonian bonds, but any value in European bonds at the moment?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Sure. I mean, look, I mean, what is the Catalonian situation? This is a remnant of the recession, 2008. You could argue that the central bank in Europe, the ECB, should have reacted faster, they didn't. You have in equity in Europe, and you see that through the German election, you see that now through the Catalonian failed election or failed independence vote. I'd say that you have to continue to be loose in Europe in terms of monetary policy, so any tightening, any -- any tapering that the ECB comes up will have to be minor, won't be significant (inaudible), so if spreads blow out a bit -- a bit more, blow out, meaning -- it's a strong word, the spreads widen a bit more, I'd be a buyer.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. This is what we're looking at in terms of spreads for example, between the Italian and Spanish 10-year yield. Christian, how should we view the German elections, the fact that actually, Wolfgang Schaeuble, who's an institution, resigned to make place for someone else partly because of this new coalition being formed, and what do you make of the Italian elections? Is that the biggest risk going forward?</p><p>KELLER: Yes. I think until maybe, the development of the last few days, we have to maybe reassess how -- how far this constitutional crisis in Spain can go, but so -- until now, we always thought the Italian elections coming sometime early next year, were the biggest remaining risk in Europe. In -- in Germany, I think, look, Ms. Merkel is clearly weakened, and I think what it -- how it will -- it will affect a little bit, the fact that these markets have developed about a new German-French access and how much Germany would be willing to share risk possibly in, you know, in further integration of the European Union. On the finance ministry, we will see a different phase. I doubt that we will see a strong change in policy because the likely new minister from the Free Democrats, FDP will probably not be that different from Schaeuble when it comes to policies and attitudes towards risk sharing.</p><p>LACQUA: Nikhil, what would it take for you to buy Italian yields, Italian bonds?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Italian bonds have rallied quite a bit in the last few months. Now probably, I would like a little bit of a spread blow out again in Italy. I don't -- I'm not so worried about the Italian election as other people are (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Why not?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, Italy has created about a million jobs in the last three years, GDP is running to one and a half as opposed to expectation which is below one. I think we -- we don't know how the coalition is going to be formed, it's still too early to tell, but I think that things chug along in Italy. I mean, there are still some long-term -- there are definite long- term concerns, but in the short term, it looks all right, so again, if -- if Italian yields as a -- as a consequence of what's happening in Spain also move out a bit, I'd be a buyer of Italian bonds as well.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you think, Nikhil, that Mario Draghi wakes up this morning and looks at these yields and kind of tries to process, you know, what the Catalonia vote and the upcoming Italian elections mean for his policy?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, it's not just the Catalonia vote, I think he is already (inaudible) I don't know if he has done it directly, but other people in the ECB have -- have hinted the market, they will be pulling back but not significantly, they've got to do that, pull back but not significantly, because you must remember, and I -- I go back to this, Catalonia, German elections, all this is a consequence of tight monetary policy when they could have loosened, OK? They took their time to do it. Now, they've got to take their time to pull back.</p><p>LACQUA: OK, interesting. Nikhil and Christian both stay with us. Christian Keller there and Nikhil, Srinivasan.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: Well, still with us are Christian Keller from Barclays and Nikhil Srinivasan from HPS Investment Partners. Thank you both for sticking around. Christian, let me go to you on Brexit. What do we know, what do we -- it seems messy, right? Is this part and parcel of negotiations or is it more messier than needed?</p><p>KELLER: It's unprecedented. We -- we really have no comparison, right, but I think what is clear that the E.U. was in a -- negotiating from a position of strength, you know, they had no -- you know, they had no reason to really be upfront with, you know, approaching the U.K., they're waiting for the U.K. I think the speech in Florence was very important. I think she touched upon all the outstanding issues. Obviously, she couldn't deliver the details yet that some would have wanted, but the -- the reception in a way on the continent I think was -- was positive. You heard Michel Barnier speaking a few words of English, I think, you know, that is a good sign, and now --</p><p>LACQUA: Always a good sign.</p><p>KELLER: And now, I think it's -- it's really up this -- up to do this week because people will watch whether her concept that she alluded to in the Florence speech basically has a strong backing by her own party. And she must come out of this week in a way as someone who is, you know, sure to be the leader for the coming years, and then I think Brexit could take a more, you know, constructive path than it has maybe over the last past few months.</p><p>LACQUA: Christian, when you revise upwards or downwards your economic forecast for the U.K., do you look at BOE or do you look at Brexit talks, or both?</p><p>KELLER: We -- we look more at -- at Brexit talks in the sense that we look at uncertainty and what could happen to investment. At the moment, you know, we have a U.K. economy that has been much more resilient than people have thought. And you know, consumption has held up very well, and what we see now is, you know, investment in a way, slowing, and you know, the BOE will be important, they may be hiking, and that has an impact on the -- on consumers who pay mortgages, et cetera, but I think if we have an outlook for Brexit that signal some kind of a certainty, I think that would help the U.K. economy over the medium term significantly.</p><p>LACQUA: Have you -- are you a political analyst yet? You know, forget all this investment stuff.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I can do politics.</p><p>LACQUA: Politics, right. Do you need to be like a political analyst to try figure out where you put money in the -- in the U.K. or in the U.S., or not?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: No, absolutely. But I think on Brexit, Christian has all the points right, I don't disagree with anything he said. My point is that, it's a complex issue, negotiating Brexit. I think you have to be incrementalist (ph) about it just because the Europeans are and the whole process is. And don't forget that Britain had about a 15-year up-cycle, barring that '07, '08 situation. So just from a cyclical point of view, having a slower U.K. is expected, and now, doesn't mean it's going to collapse, I just think they just expect slower growth in the U.K.</p><p>LACQUA: What happens to pound? And actually, if pound is weaker, does it make, you know, investments more attractive?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes, pound was in a 1.20, 1.30 range, it's now broken out to 1.33, 1.34, I think it stays around here, and (inaudible) it pulled back a bit, but I think you've got a sterling which is essentially trying to find a base around 1.30, you know, 1.28, 1.30.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. 1.28, 1.30. Christian, first of all, what's your take on -- this is actually one of my favorite charts, and this is U.K. consumer credit, and it's something that I imagine Mark Carney is looking at very closely because of interest rates and the fact that households are so indebted in this country, does this chart worry you?</p><p>KELLER: Well, it is a chart that is important, and I think it is important also because it is behind some of the recent significant change in the attitude of the Bank of England. And if you go through particularly, what some of the MPC members who are considered to be dovish when they turn around in their view, they highlighted a balance sheet of the households and said, deleveraging of -- of households was over, and they have been leveraging, and this is why they argued for a rate hike because they believed they're now in a situation where households are level again, households are robust enough that they could withstand, you know, some increase in interest rates. So I think it's a very important chart and one -- one to follow. Not concerned really, I think, you know, the hikes will be -- we see one hike for now, you know, and I think the Bank of England will -- will act very, very cautiously.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. What's your take on -- on euro-pound actually? So you gave us a level on euro-dollar, is this the most interesting one?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes, range bound, just range bound. Like a lot of currency, I think euro-dollar will be range bound, euro-sterling is range bound, I think you've got -- you got a period of uncertainty, in the U.K. it's Brexit, in Europe now, it's got Spain, Catalonia, et cetera, and of course, ECB policy, so I think between both things, I think you really got a range bound currency across.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. Interesting. I want to talk a little bit more about the global outlook now. Now, in a new report, Barclays has said U.S. growth remains decent if unexciting, while Europe and Japan have shown further upside. The bank expects the Fed to hike in December and twice in 2018, while the ECB is likely to taper further next year. Christian, this is your report, what's the most surprising thing in it?</p><p>KELLER: I think the most surprising in it is if you -- if you look at it again, you know, how well global growth is synchronized. And, you know, there's a lot of questions from investors who say, well, is this as good as it gets? You know, shouldn't one be more cautious now? You know, things have been going very well in particular, if -- if you look at equity valuation in the U.S. But we look at the data, and we see a global economy that continues to expand, where U.S. no longer the cyclical leadership, but we get very good data out of -- out of Europe. Japan's in the economy that has relatively low growth but is running above potential. We see some of the emerging markets like Russia, Brazil, coming out of deep recessions, and we see a China that you saw it over -- over the weekend, continues to hold up quite well. Now, this is something we haven't had for 5, 6 years, and it means, global growth running around 4 percent, and if you look at equity earnings, they correlate very well with global growth, and we think that is basically the -- the big story that is still there, and that's why we continue to be quite constructive.</p><p>LACQUA: Are -- are you -- are you positive about world growth or is it all based on air?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: This is the first time since 2007 that all -- all economies, 40 plus economies counted by the OECD, are showing positive growth, so I am very comfortable with growth.</p><p>LACQUA: How do you feel with inflation though? I| mean, there are -- there are still puzzles, right? And I don't know if it's the Phillips curve being broken or something more sinister out there.</p><p>KELLER: I think, you know, the -- the second part of the surprise is the - - in the data is basically that inflation stays so muted. The good thing is we are creating drops, so unemployment rates are falling in all the key economies, but we don't have the wage growth. Now, whether it's something sinister, I think there are several effect at work, one, it does take time. People are coming back into the labor market, you mentioned Italy earlier. There are people now coming back who were not in the Labor market, that's where the unemployment doesn't fall, because if the participation rates goes up. These are good developments, but I think there is something bigger in the background, that's technology, globalization, and that's why Phillips curves no longer work the way they did in the past, and that's something I think central banks have to grapple with because all their models and all their usual actions are based on, you know, the Phillips curve working.</p><p>LACQUA: And Nikhil, do you worry -- I don't know if you worry about inflation or do you just worry that for example, if you look at the most distorted market (inaudible) most probably the bond market, and so as this kind of, you know, gets re-priced, it could lead to further correction (inaudible).</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes, let's talk about this -- this inflation and this Fed policy, for example. Fed policy is all about normalization. I don't think that it really cares much about inflation as normalizing the interest rate situation.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. But should they care more about inflation?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, they -- they want inflation. I think everything -- OK, if you look at global, you look at reflationary currencies, Aussie dollar, Canadian dollar, basic materials, copper, aluminum, all are pointing to more inflation, OK? We haven't seen it in the U.S., we haven't really seen it anywhere in the world right now, but at least --</p><p>LACQUA: Except for U.K.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes. But things -- if I -- if I look at typical reflationary indicators are all up, but I said, the Feds behavior is about normalizing based on financial stability, it's not really based on well, inflation's going to hit X, and so we've got to do it now. And so the Fed will continue to gradually increase rates, OK? I think we'll get some inflation, probably get some inflation in Germany, it's been going very strong, probably get some inflation generally, in Europe, probably get some everywhere, but we're not going to get as much as people want, so when you look at yields and you say, OK, well, yields are 10-year U.S. at 2.36 today, where is it going? Look, it will go higher. I think all yields were high in the next 12 months.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Guys, thank you so much. Christian Keller there, head of economic research at Barclays, thank you for your time. And Nikhil Srinivasan stays with us, we'll talk a little bit more about the risks out there, we had great comments from Crispin Odey as well. We'll talk about regulation and kind of China as well next.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: Well, still with us, Nikhil Srinivasan, he is from HPS Investment Partners. Nikhil, when you look at the risks out there, so we had Mr. Odey actually quite bearish overall, right, about his view on the world economy. What do you see as the biggest risk out there for markets?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I think the biggest risk, Francine, is complacency. I think people are complacent about the North Korean situation, they're complacent about the Middle East and the Kyrgyzstan independence vote and oil in general, and they're complacent in the U.S. about increased regulation on big Tech. So I think if you look everywhere, I think the biggest risk is complacency. People are saying, well, let's just keep going forward.</p><p>LACQUA: Why are they complacent? Is it something to do with algorithms and the way that the markets are actually right at the moment, or is it that it's impossible to, you know, price in Trump's next move, but also you're going to do with North Korea?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, it's hard to value the level of risk that I'm talking about. So given it's hard to value the risk, given there's a lot of liquidity out there, given the Fed's policies, you know, I'd say that people just want to continue doing what they're doing and they've made money doing it, so you can't argue with that, right? So these are, if you ask me, the biggest risk is complacency because it's not priced in. Korea, it's not pricing in Korean risk.</p><p>LACQUA: What will it take to be priced in? I mean, is it kind of a snowball effect?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, not necessarily. For example, if you are in the Big Tech stocks for example, I think they are not people -- they have come off a bit, I mean, they've come off relative to the market. I think people have to get used to the fact that these companies are going to face more of a (inaudible) going forward, but the ownership of these stocks remains extremely robust, and so you haven't seen a real selloff, 10 percent, but you haven't seen a real selloff for these companies yet, that's one thing.</p><p>LACQUA: Nikhil, do you worry about -- I mean, I don't know what actually your canary in the coal mine, you know, benchmark is, is there something? Will it come from China, or is it really impossible to predict?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: China's fine, Francine. So if you're talking about China, I think people shouldn't worry about China, they --</p><p>LACQUA: Not even the debt --</p><p>SRINIVASAN: No, nothing.</p><p>LACQUA: -- and reserves?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Nothing. I think the currency has shown resilience, currency rallied in the last few weeks. I think the congress is going to go fine, I think you're going to have a slowdown of growth built in because of supply- side reform so they have -- have kicked in, built in because you have this anti-corruption move which is going to taper off. I think going into next year in the (inaudible) we see very, very growth -- good growth in China, I am not worried about China at all.</p><p>LACQUA: Are you worried about emerging markets and the fact that if Fed normalizes? It's been telegraphed for about three years, but are you worried about some kind of correction in emerging markets, just (inaudible) you know, technical Fed?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes, well, because they -- they rallied a lot, so yes, they could correct. I mean, certainly, but I think China will continue to go up, and the Chinese market looks pretty good overall. I think all these emerging markets have run up quite a bit, most of them (inaudible). I would say I'm -- I'm less bearish or less worried about corrections from the oil markets like Russia. I think Russia has more upside as well. I think that, you know, you have to take -- take a step back and say, look, are we still looking at the world through the lens of '07, '08? And every time something happens, we can never tell there's a correction coming, corrections will come. Global economy is growing. It think the biggest uncertainties are the three things that I mentioned.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. But what about politics? Again, if you look at, you know, people voting in Europe for example, sure, GDP is getting higher, you know, joblessness is going down, but actually, one in 10 people voted for a far right candidate in the -- in Germany, they did the same in France.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, there's -- there's economic inequity in Europe, just like it is in another parts of the world. Like, we saw that in the U.S., we're seeing that here as well, that's going to continue, that's not going away.</p><p>LACQUA: Will it get worse?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I think it's going to get worse. But it's not going to get substantially worse, it's going to get worse in terms of (inaudible) voting patterns that continue to show people are disgruntled, at least a large or a visible part of the population is disgruntled. It's -- it's disgruntled here in the U.K., in Germany, in Spain, now you see it, in Italy, everywhere and around the world, so you're going to see that. you're going to see protest votes gathering pace. Now, that's going to impact policy, monetary policy, fiscal policy, you're going to see governments having to run deficits. The U.K. government will have to run their deficit. European governments have to run their deficit. Even the German government which is -- which is in surplus will incrementally have to increase spending on infrastructure and other things, incrementally, gradually, step by step, German style. I think everyone has to accept the fact that there are certain people in the population that are not really gaining from what is headline growth.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, Nikhil, thank you so much. Nikhil Srinivasan there, chairman international, HPS Investment Partners stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: Now, we were just talking with Nikhil Srinivasan, and we have a question from NIB, from a viewer, and this Nikhil is for you. Now, this is a question, we were talking of course, about complacency and the market's complacency, would you say that the complacency originates from the fact that the majority of the disgruntled are not amongst its players? So actually, does this disgruntlement, Nikhil, then -- then becomes something that we should worry about for markets?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: The question is fair. I think (inaudible) players is right. I don't think you have to worry about it is a constant something might happen, but I think it is, the consequence from a policy point of view is governments have to remain relatively loose in the fiscal front, that's it. And on the monetary side, you have to remain loose as well, so that's not - - you know, tightening's not going t to happen, it can't happen if you want the disgruntled to be feeling better off. And I don't think any economy in Europe can tighten today, or in the U.S. I don't think the U.S. can tighten. In fact, the tax cut plans are all going to be fiscally negative, right? Be expansionary, so no, I think fiscal policy has to remain expansionary.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. Which is why you were talking about normalizing, and actually, not tightening. The dollar has strengthened after reports that President Trump and secretary -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have met with Kevin Warsh to discuss nominating him to succeed Fed chair, Janet Yellen. Nikhil, again, I guess for you, it doesn't really matter who's in charge next. I seem to understand about your comments that it will be kind of steady as she goes which is normalizing.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes. I think my point about normalizing was less to do with inflation even though inflation is -- is the core of the Fed alongside employment, I'd say it's more to do with normalizing in General, to ensure financial stability. Ownership of U.S. equities among U.S. households has again, reached a high last seen 10 years ago, and I think the Fed must be concerned, and they must ensure that they don't have any - any accidents down the road, so I think that normalization is far from close.</p><p>LACQUA: Ok. But does it -- it still matters right, if you have someone at the head who's a dove or a hawk, because actually, how you interpret, I mean, you say they shouldn't focus too much on inflation, they just want stability, but so far, inflation has been the cornerstone of how you measure stability.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes. But you see, every time they don't get inflation, they use another measure. They try and say, well, it's going to come, they could suddenly surprise you. Look, these are the comments with people who don't see inflation, yet want to raise rates.</p><p>LACQUA: OK, would you change the mandate? And if you would change the mandate for the Fed, what would you be looking at? I mean, you need metric, right, on - on how you look at it, otherwise, it's a free for all.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I would look -- I mean, I look at something they can't probably include which is capital allocation because when you have a lot of free liquidity you misallocate capital, and that's what's been happening. You know, certain really been bid up, other things like capital investment has been ignore, so -- but I think you can't really change the mandate, that's not my point. My point is that, we were late to normalize, and now, they have to at least, reach a level of normalization they are comfortable with, which maybe, the market decide if that's too high, too low, but what they are comfortable with, and that means high rates.</p><p>LACQUA: Nikhil, what will be a game-changer for you in the U.S.? Is it all to do with monetary policy or does a tax cut for example, repatriation at 10 percent actually, significantly change the way you look at animal spirits U.S.?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I think what would be a game changer if GDP in the U.S. really dropped, say, below 1 percent, which it doesn't seem at this point, likely.</p><p>LACQUA: So why would it do that?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, because I think people aren't ready for that. People are ready -- people accepted a stable one and a half economy, or one and a half, two. People are not ready for something that comes closer to the zero to one, and I think that would surprise people, and that would show finally that, oh, my god, you know, something is wrong, we're not getting the growth they want, and I think that the --</p><p>LACQUA: But you think that's likely, or is --</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I don't think that's likely. At today's setting, I don't see it in the numbers. I can't say it's going to happen, but I'm saying that's your risk, you said , what's your biggest risk? That's my biggest risk, is GDP falling below expectation.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. But what would need to happen for that GDP to fall below expectations?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Just people don't want to buy consumption falls, I mean, retail spending falls. I mean, these are, you know, oil prices, you know the issue. But again, if oil prices go up significant -- I think oil is in a good spot, I don't see we're going to $80, but I see oil pretty well-bid everywhere.</p><p>LACQUA: When you look at infrastructure plans, again, from the Trump administration, does -- does filter through GDP? I mean, it's unclear to me, even these tax cuts, at this point in the cycle, does it filter through inflation, or does it -- or does it work on GDP?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I prefer tax cuts to infrastructure spending. Infrastructure spending is a bit like communism, it works well in theory, not always well in practice.</p><p>LACQUA: Because of lagging time?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Just wastage, slippage, all kinds of things, you know. So the dollar spent on infrastructure doesn't really -- studies have shown infrastructure doesn't yield as much for GDP as tax cuts do, so if you ask me which one I'd prefer, I'd prefer tax cuts.</p><p>LACQUA: What's priced in at the moment in the market?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I think tax cut, something's -- you -- one, Trump success is priced in, and I think it's going to be somewhat linked to tax cuts, which I think is -- is reasonable. I mean, there may be compromises along the way between the two parties, but I think that he'll get something, I'll be surprised if the president doesn't.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. Nikhil, when you look at I guess, the composition, you know, we talked a little bit about around the world, emerging markets, U.S., Europe, is it right to think that Europe will outperform the U.S.? I know we're starting from the very low base.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: No, no, for sure. I have no doubt that the -- Europe will (inaudible) the U.S. votes in terms of overall growth and also as well, markets. I'd rather buy European equities than U.S. equities (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: But equities are exposed globally, so you get, what, you get a discount because of European (inaudible) you?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, I mean, yes. I mean, you know, European equities are both global and low, and I just say, baskets of European stocks are more appealing, I think you're going to have a looser policy directive from the ECB, you know, continued loose policy from the ECB, you're going to have continued loose fiscal from European governments, so Europe looks all right. I mean, you know, you can't call the end Europe, yen to Europe just a year after things have started to really dwell or two years (inaudible) a lot of the countries. Germany's been doing well for a long time.</p><p>LACQUA: It's Europe. Don't we do that every couple of years that it's the end of the world, and end of the -- end of the -- the experiment?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: You know, commentators in this country and the U.S. have been talking about the end of the experiment for a very long time, ever since the crisis, right, they've been wrong, and they're going to continue to be wrong about the end of the experiment, OK? The question then is, can Europe outperform? And Europe's sometimes its own worst enemy. It was too late in terms of loosening monetary policy, you've seen the consequences in Spain yesterday, you know, and so as long as things continue to chug along and, you know, the French-German relationship could just produce positive news for Europe. I think Europe continues to do fine. I think it's -- it's just -- it's a cottage industry to be negative on Europe all the time.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, Nikhil, thank you so much for joining us. We have to get you back on to talk about Japan as well, that's the only thing we kind of didn't do in our 60 minutes (inaudible). Nikhil Srinivasan there from HPS Investment Partners.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Nikhil  manages $42 billion and is the former group chief investment officer at  Assicurazioni Generali.  I think it took me at the time, like four years,  Nikhil, to get you back on, so I'm glad you're more available to us now,  thank you for coming on.</p><p>NIKHIL SRINIVASAN, CHAIRMAN INTERNATIONAL, HPS INVESTMENT PARTNERS:  Thank  you, Francine, it's my pleasure.</p><p>LACQUA:  And Christian, thank you for -- for coming on as well.  first of  all, how should investors look at risk Catalonia?  So this is something  that was ignored on Friday, and then today, it seems that even spreads  between the German and Italian yields are going a little bit crazy.</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  You get -- you have to get used to a bit of volatility in  this.  I think there's a process, and I think your colleague in Barcelona  had some comments.  My point of view, this request constitutional reform,  and that'll take a bit of time, and then at some point then, the  Catalonians will decide will they want to vote again based on the reform.   So until that happens, that could take several months, it's going to be a  bit unsaid, but it's not going to be dramatically bad, I mean, Spanish  yields are up seven basis points, and I wouldn't say that's a calamity.</p><p>LACQUA:  No, it's not a calamity, but when you look at the ECB and kind of,  you know, the fact that they are standing firm, the fact that you see this  kind of news, Christian, what does it mean for Spanish GDP overall?</p><p>CHRISTIAN KELLER, HEAD OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH, BARCLAYS:  Well, I mean  Catalonia as well, very much reported, is 1/5 of the Spanish economy, so it  is an important part, but so far, I would actually be of a similar view  that, you know, cyclically, Europe looks quite strong right now, you know,  and then we have a global recovery that in -- in full swing, we have a  synchronized recovery in Europe after, you know, the elections in France  which is more of a, you know, real problem early in December or could have  been one, and then you had actually, Italy and Spain in particular,  cleaning up the bank balance sheet, so now, we have a situation where  really, Europe, you know, looks quite good with regard to growth, and I'm  not sure whether this -- of course, we have to see how far, you know, this  -- this expands now, but this will really be something that will more  seriously, fundamentally in a way, derail this recovery that we see in  Europe.</p><p>LACQUA:  Nikhil, you were saying that basically, when you look at the  Spanish bonds, they're falling a touch, but it's nothing to (inaudible)  about.  Let me bring you over to my chart.  This is -- you see the Spanish  bonds compared to the Catalonian bonds.  For our radio listeners, we will  push it out on social media.  Any value?  I'm not necessarily talking to  you about, you know, Catalonian bonds, but any value in European bonds at  the moment?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Sure.  I mean, look, I mean, what is the Catalonian situation?   This is a remnant of the recession, 2008.  You could argue that the central  bank in Europe, the ECB, should have reacted faster, they didn't.  You have  in equity in Europe, and you see that through the German election, you see  that now through the Catalonian failed election or failed independence  vote.  I'd say that you have to continue to be loose in Europe in terms of  monetary policy, so any tightening, any -- any tapering that the ECB comes  up will have to be minor, won't be significant (inaudible), so if spreads  blow out a bit -- a bit more, blow out, meaning -- it's a strong word, the  spreads widen a bit more, I'd be a buyer.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  This is what we're looking at in terms of spreads for  example, between the Italian and Spanish 10-year yield.  Christian, how  should we view the German elections, the fact that actually, Wolfgang  Schaeuble, who's an institution, resigned to make place for someone else  partly because of this new coalition being formed, and what do you make of  the Italian elections?  Is that the biggest risk going forward?</p><p>KELLER:  Yes.  I think until maybe, the development of the last few days,  we have to maybe reassess how -- how far this constitutional crisis in  Spain can go, but so -- until now, we always thought the Italian elections  coming sometime early next year, were the biggest remaining risk in Europe.   In -- in Germany, I think, look, Ms. Merkel is clearly weakened, and I  think what it -- how it will -- it will affect a little bit, the fact that  these markets have developed about a new German-French access and how much  Germany would be willing to share risk possibly in, you know, in further  integration of the European Union.  On the finance ministry, we will see a  different phase.  I doubt that we will see a strong change in policy  because the likely new minister from the Free Democrats, FDP will probably  not be that different from Schaeuble when it comes to policies and  attitudes towards risk sharing.</p><p>LACQUA:  Nikhil, what would it take for you to buy Italian yields, Italian  bonds?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Italian bonds have rallied quite a bit in the last few months.   Now probably, I would like a little bit of a spread blow out again in  Italy.  I don't -- I'm not so worried about the Italian election as other  people are (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA:  Why not?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Well, Italy has created about a million jobs in the last three  years, GDP is running to one and a half as opposed to expectation which is  below one.  I think we -- we don't know how the coalition is going to be  formed, it's still too early to tell, but I think that things chug along in  Italy.  I mean, there are still some long-term -- there are definite long- term concerns, but in the short term, it looks all right, so again, if --  if Italian yields as a -- as a consequence of what's happening in Spain  also move out a bit, I'd be a buyer of Italian bonds as well.</p><p>LACQUA:  Do you think, Nikhil, that Mario Draghi wakes up this morning and  looks at these yields and kind of tries to process, you know, what the  Catalonia vote and the upcoming Italian elections mean for his policy?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Well, it's not just the Catalonia vote, I think he is already  (inaudible) I don't know if he has done it directly, but other people in  the ECB have -- have hinted the market, they will be pulling back but not  significantly, they've got to do that, pull back but not significantly,  because you must remember, and I -- I go back to this, Catalonia, German  elections, all this is a consequence of tight monetary policy when they  could have loosened, OK?  They took their time to do it.  Now, they've got  to take their time to pull back.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK, interesting.  Nikhil and Christian both stay with us.   Christian Keller there and Nikhil, Srinivasan.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA:  Well, still with us are Christian Keller from Barclays and Nikhil  Srinivasan from HPS Investment Partners.  Thank you both for sticking  around.  Christian, let me go to you on Brexit.  What do we know, what do  we -- it seems messy, right?  Is this part and parcel of negotiations or is  it more messier than needed?</p><p>KELLER:  It's unprecedented.  We -- we really have no comparison, right,  but I think what is clear that the E.U. was in a -- negotiating from a  position of strength, you know, they had no -- you know, they had no reason  to really be upfront with, you know, approaching the U.K., they're waiting  for the U.K.  I think the speech in Florence was very important.  I think  she touched upon all the outstanding issues.  Obviously, she couldn't  deliver the details yet that some would have wanted, but the -- the  reception in a way on the continent I think was -- was positive.  You heard  Michel Barnier speaking a few words of English, I think, you know, that is  a good sign, and now --</p><p>LACQUA:  Always a good sign.</p><p>KELLER:  And now, I think it's -- it's really up this -- up to do this week  because people will watch whether her concept that she alluded to in the  Florence speech basically has a strong backing by her own party.  And she  must come out of this week in a way as someone who is, you know, sure to be  the leader for the coming years, and then I think Brexit could take a more,  you know, constructive path than it has maybe over the last past few  months.</p><p>LACQUA:  Christian, when you revise upwards or downwards your economic  forecast for the U.K., do you look at BOE or do you look at Brexit talks,  or both?</p><p>KELLER:  We -- we look more at -- at Brexit talks in the sense that we look  at uncertainty and what could happen to investment.  At the moment, you  know, we have a U.K. economy that has been much more resilient than people  have thought.  And you know, consumption has held up very well, and what we  see now is, you know, investment in a way, slowing, and you know, the BOE  will be important, they may be hiking, and that has an impact on the -- on  consumers who pay mortgages, et cetera, but I think if we have an outlook  for Brexit that signal some kind of a certainty, I think that would help  the U.K. economy over the medium term significantly.</p><p>LACQUA:  Have you -- are you a political analyst yet?  You know, forget all  this investment stuff.</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  I can do politics.</p><p>LACQUA:  Politics, right.  Do you need to be like a political analyst to  try figure out where you put money in the -- in the U.K. or in the U.S., or  not?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  No, absolutely.  But I think on Brexit, Christian has all the  points right, I don't disagree with anything he said.  My point is that,  it's a complex issue, negotiating Brexit.  I think you have to be  incrementalist (ph) about it just because the Europeans are and the whole  process is.  And don't forget that Britain had about a 15-year up-cycle,  barring that '07, '08 situation.  So just from a cyclical point of view,  having a slower U.K. is expected, and now, doesn't mean it's going to  collapse, I just think they just expect slower growth in the U.K.</p><p>LACQUA:  What happens to pound?  And actually, if pound is weaker, does it  make, you know, investments more attractive?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Yes, pound was in a 1.20, 1.30 range, it's now broken out to  1.33, 1.34, I think it stays around here, and (inaudible) it pulled back a  bit, but I think you've got a sterling which is essentially trying to find  a base around 1.30, you know, 1.28, 1.30.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  1.28, 1.30.  Christian, first of all, what's your take on --  this is actually one of my favorite charts, and this is U.K. consumer  credit, and it's something that I imagine Mark Carney is looking at very  closely because of interest rates and the fact that households are so  indebted in this country, does this chart worry you?</p><p>KELLER:  Well, it is a chart that is important, and I think it is important  also because it is behind some of the recent significant change in the  attitude of the Bank of England.  And if you go through particularly, what  some of the MPC members who are considered to be dovish when they turn  around in their view, they highlighted a balance sheet of the households  and said, deleveraging of -- of households was over, and they have been  leveraging, and this is why they argued for a rate hike because they  believed they're now in a situation where households are level again,  households are robust enough that they could withstand, you know, some  increase in interest rates.  So I think it's a very important chart and one  -- one to follow.  Not concerned really, I think, you know, the hikes will  be -- we see one hike for now, you know, and I think the Bank of England  will -- will act very, very cautiously.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  What's your take on -- on euro-pound actually?  So you gave  us a level on euro-dollar, is this the most interesting one?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Yes, range bound, just range bound.  Like a lot of currency, I  think euro-dollar will be range bound, euro-sterling is range bound, I  think you've got -- you got a period of uncertainty, in the U.K. it's  Brexit, in Europe now, it's got Spain, Catalonia, et cetera, and of course,  ECB policy, so I think between both things, I think you really got a range  bound currency across.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  Interesting.  I want to talk a little bit more about the  global outlook now.  Now, in a new report, Barclays has said U.S. growth  remains decent if unexciting, while Europe and Japan have shown further  upside.  The bank expects the Fed to hike in December and twice in 2018,  while the ECB is likely to taper further next year.  Christian, this is  your report, what's the most surprising thing in it?</p><p>KELLER:  I think the most surprising in it is if you -- if you look at it  again, you know, how well global growth is synchronized.  And, you know,  there's a lot of questions from investors who say, well, is this as good as  it gets?  You know, shouldn't one be more cautious now?  You know, things  have been going very well in particular, if -- if you look at equity  valuation in the U.S.  But we look at the data, and we see a global economy  that continues to expand, where U.S. no longer the cyclical leadership, but  we get very good data out of -- out of Europe.  Japan's in the economy that  has relatively low growth but is running above potential.  We see some of  the emerging markets like Russia, Brazil, coming out of deep recessions,  and we see a China that you saw it over -- over the weekend, continues to  hold up quite well.  Now, this is something we haven't had for 5, 6 years,  and it means, global growth running around 4 percent, and if you look at  equity earnings, they correlate very well with global growth, and we think  that is basically the -- the big story that is still there, and that's why  we continue to be quite constructive.</p><p>LACQUA:  Are -- are you -- are you positive about world growth or is it all  based on air?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  This is the first time since 2007 that all -- all economies,  40 plus economies counted by the OECD, are showing positive growth, so I am  very comfortable with growth.</p><p>LACQUA:  How do you feel with inflation though?  I| mean, there are --  there are still puzzles, right?  And I don't know if it's the Phillips  curve being broken or something more sinister out there.</p><p>KELLER:  I think, you know, the -- the second part of the surprise is the - - in the data is basically that inflation stays so muted.  The good thing  is we are creating drops, so unemployment rates are falling in all the key  economies, but we don't have the wage growth.  Now, whether it's something  sinister, I think there are several effect at work, one, it does take time.   People are coming back into the labor market, you mentioned Italy earlier.   There are people now coming back who were not in the Labor market, that's  where the unemployment doesn't fall, because if the participation rates  goes up.  These are good developments, but I think there is something  bigger in the background, that's technology, globalization, and that's why  Phillips curves no longer work the way they did in the past, and that's  something I think central banks have to grapple with because all their  models and all their usual actions are based on, you know, the Phillips  curve working.</p><p>LACQUA:  And Nikhil, do you worry -- I don't know if you worry about  inflation or do you just worry that for example, if you look at the most  distorted market (inaudible) most probably the bond market, and so as this  kind of, you know, gets re-priced, it could lead to further correction  (inaudible).</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Yes, let's talk about this -- this inflation and this Fed  policy, for example.  Fed policy is all about normalization.  I don't think  that it really cares much about inflation as normalizing the interest rate  situation.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  But should they care more about inflation?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Well, they -- they want inflation.  I think everything -- OK,  if you look at global, you look at reflationary currencies, Aussie dollar,  Canadian dollar, basic materials, copper, aluminum, all are pointing to  more inflation, OK?  We haven't seen it in the U.S., we haven't really seen  it anywhere in the world right now, but at least --</p><p>LACQUA:  Except for U.K.</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Yes.  But things -- if I -- if I look at typical reflationary  indicators are all up, but I said, the Feds behavior is about normalizing  based on financial stability, it's not really based on well, inflation's  going to hit X, and so we've got to do it now.  And so the Fed will  continue to gradually increase rates, OK?  I think we'll get some  inflation, probably get some inflation in Germany, it's been going very  strong, probably get some inflation generally, in Europe, probably get some  everywhere, but we're not going to get as much as people want, so when you  look at yields and you say, OK, well, yields are 10-year U.S. at 2.36  today, where is it going?  Look, it will go higher.  I think all yields  were high in the next 12 months.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right.  Guys, thank you so much.  Christian Keller there, head  of economic research at Barclays, thank you for your time.  And Nikhil  Srinivasan stays with us, we'll talk a little bit more about the risks out  there, we had great comments from Crispin Odey as well.  We'll talk about  regulation and kind of China as well next.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA:  Well, still with us, Nikhil Srinivasan, he is from HPS Investment  Partners.  Nikhil, when you look at the risks out there, so we had Mr. Odey  actually quite bearish overall, right, about his view on the world economy.   What do you see as the biggest risk out there for markets?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  I think the biggest risk, Francine, is complacency.  I think  people are complacent about the North Korean situation, they're complacent  about the Middle East and the Kyrgyzstan independence vote and oil in  general, and they're complacent in the U.S. about increased regulation on  big Tech.  So I think if you look everywhere, I think the biggest risk is  complacency.  People are saying, well, let's just keep going forward.</p><p>LACQUA:  Why are they complacent?  Is it something to do with algorithms  and the way that the markets are actually right at the moment, or is it  that it's impossible to, you know, price in Trump's next move, but also  you're going to do with North Korea?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Well, it's hard to value the level of risk that I'm talking  about.  So given it's hard to value the risk, given there's a lot of  liquidity out there, given the Fed's policies, you know, I'd say that  people just want to continue doing what they're doing and they've made  money doing it, so you can't argue with that, right?  So these are, if you  ask me, the biggest risk is complacency because it's not priced in.  Korea,  it's not pricing in Korean risk.</p><p>LACQUA:  What will it take to be priced in?  I mean, is it kind of a  snowball effect?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Well, not necessarily.  For example, if you are in the Big  Tech stocks for example, I think they are not people -- they have come off  a bit, I mean, they've come off relative to the market.  I think people  have to get used to the fact that these companies are going to face more of  a (inaudible) going forward, but the ownership of these stocks remains  extremely robust, and so you haven't seen a real selloff, 10 percent, but  you haven't seen a real selloff for these companies yet, that's one thing.</p><p>LACQUA:  Nikhil, do you worry about -- I mean, I don't know what actually  your canary in the coal mine, you know, benchmark is, is there something?   Will it come from China, or is it really impossible to predict?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  China's fine, Francine.  So if you're talking about China, I  think people shouldn't worry about China, they --</p><p>LACQUA:  Not even the debt --</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  No, nothing.</p><p>LACQUA:  -- and reserves?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Nothing.  I think the currency has shown resilience, currency  rallied in the last few weeks.  I think the congress is going to go fine, I  think you're going to have a slowdown of growth built in because of supply- side reform so they have -- have kicked in, built in because you have this  anti-corruption move which is going to taper off.  I think going into next  year in the (inaudible) we see very, very growth -- good growth in China, I  am not worried about China at all.</p><p>LACQUA:  Are you worried about emerging markets and the fact that if Fed  normalizes?  It's been telegraphed for about three years, but are you  worried about some kind of correction in emerging markets, just (inaudible)  you know, technical Fed?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Yes, well, because they -- they rallied a lot, so yes, they  could correct.  I mean, certainly, but I think China will continue to go  up, and the Chinese market looks pretty good overall.  I think all these  emerging markets have run up quite a bit, most of them (inaudible).  I  would say I'm -- I'm less bearish or less worried about corrections from  the oil markets like Russia.  I think Russia has more upside as well.  I  think that, you know, you have to take -- take a step back and say, look,  are we still looking at the world through the lens of '07, '08?  And every  time something happens, we can never tell there's a correction coming,  corrections will come.  Global economy is growing.  It think the biggest  uncertainties are the three things that I mentioned.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  But what about politics?  Again, if you look at, you know,  people voting in Europe for example, sure, GDP is getting higher, you know,  joblessness is going down, but actually, one in 10 people voted for a far  right candidate in the -- in Germany, they did the same in France.</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Well, there's -- there's economic inequity in Europe, just  like it is in another parts of the world.  Like, we saw that in the U.S.,  we're seeing that here as well, that's going to continue, that's not going  away.</p><p>LACQUA:  Will it get worse?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  I think it's going to get worse.  But it's not going to get  substantially worse, it's going to get worse in terms of (inaudible) voting  patterns that continue to show people are disgruntled, at least a large or  a visible part of the population is disgruntled.  It's -- it's disgruntled  here in the U.K., in Germany, in Spain, now you see it, in Italy,  everywhere and around the world, so you're going to see that.  you're going  to see protest votes gathering pace.  Now, that's going to impact policy,  monetary policy, fiscal policy, you're going to see governments having to  run deficits.  The U.K. government will have to run their deficit.   European governments have to run their deficit.  Even the German government  which is -- which is in surplus will incrementally have to increase  spending on infrastructure and other things, incrementally, gradually, step  by step, German style.  I think everyone has to accept the fact that there  are certain people in the population that are not really gaining from what  is headline growth.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right, Nikhil, thank you so much.  Nikhil Srinivasan there,  chairman international, HPS Investment Partners stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA:  Now, we were just talking with Nikhil Srinivasan, and we have a  question from NIB, from a viewer, and this Nikhil is for you.  Now, this is  a question, we were talking of course, about complacency and the market's  complacency, would you say that the complacency originates from the fact  that the majority of the disgruntled are not amongst its players?  So  actually, does this disgruntlement, Nikhil, then -- then becomes something  that we should worry about for markets?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  The question is fair.  I think (inaudible) players is right.   I don't think you have to worry about it is a constant something might  happen, but I think it is, the consequence from a policy point of view is  governments have to remain relatively loose in the fiscal front, that's it.   And on the monetary side, you have to remain loose as well, so that's not - - you know, tightening's not going t to happen, it can't happen if you want  the disgruntled to be feeling better off.  And I don't think any economy in  Europe can tighten today, or in the U.S.  I don't think the U.S. can  tighten.  In fact, the tax cut plans are all going to be fiscally negative,  right?  Be expansionary, so no, I think fiscal policy has to remain  expansionary.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  Which is why you were talking about normalizing, and  actually, not tightening.  The dollar has strengthened after reports that  President Trump and secretary -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have met  with Kevin Warsh to discuss nominating him to succeed Fed chair, Janet  Yellen.  Nikhil, again, I guess for you, it doesn't really matter who's in  charge next.  I seem to understand about your comments that it will be kind  of steady as she goes which is normalizing.</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Yes.  I think my point about normalizing was less to do with  inflation even though inflation is -- is the core of the Fed alongside  employment, I'd say it's more to do with normalizing in General, to ensure  financial stability.  Ownership of U.S. equities among U.S. households has  again, reached a high last seen 10 years ago, and I think the Fed must be  concerned, and they must ensure that they don't have any - any accidents  down the road, so I think that normalization is far from close.</p><p>LACQUA:  Ok.  But does it -- it still matters right, if you have someone at  the head who's a dove or a hawk, because actually, how you interpret, I  mean, you say they shouldn't focus too much on inflation, they just want  stability, but so far, inflation has been the cornerstone of how you  measure stability.</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Yes.  But you see, every time they don't get inflation, they  use another measure.  They try and say, well, it's going to come, they  could suddenly surprise you.  Look, these are the comments with people who  don't see inflation, yet want to raise rates.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK, would you change the mandate?  And if you would change the  mandate for the Fed, what would you be looking at?  I mean, you need  metric, right, on - on how you look at it, otherwise, it's a free for all.</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  I would look -- I mean, I look at something they can't  probably include which is capital allocation because when you have a lot of  free liquidity you misallocate capital, and that's what's been happening.   You know, certain really been bid up, other things like capital investment  has been ignore, so -- but I think you can't really change the mandate,  that's not my point.  My point is that, we were late to normalize, and now,  they have to at least, reach a level of normalization they are comfortable  with, which maybe, the market decide if that's too high, too low, but what  they are comfortable with, and that means high rates.</p><p>LACQUA:  Nikhil, what will be a game-changer for you in the U.S.?  Is it  all to do with monetary policy or does a tax cut for example, repatriation  at 10 percent actually, significantly change the way you look at animal  spirits U.S.?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  I think what would be a game changer if GDP in the U.S. really  dropped, say, below 1 percent, which it doesn't seem at this point, likely.</p><p>LACQUA:  So why would it do that?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Well, because I think people aren't ready for that.  People  are ready -- people accepted a stable one and a half economy, or one and a  half, two.  People are not ready for something that comes closer to the  zero to one, and I think that would surprise people, and that would show  finally that, oh, my god, you know, something is wrong, we're not getting  the growth they want, and I think that the --</p><p>LACQUA:  But you think that's likely, or is --</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  I don't think that's likely.  At today's setting, I don't see  it in the numbers.  I can't say it's going to happen, but I'm saying that's  your risk, you said , what's your biggest risk?  That's my biggest risk, is  GDP falling below expectation.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  But what would need to happen for that GDP to fall below  expectations?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Just people don't want to buy consumption falls, I mean,  retail spending falls.  I mean, these are, you know, oil prices, you know  the issue.  But again, if oil prices go up significant -- I think oil is in  a good spot, I don't see we're going to $80, but I see oil pretty well-bid  everywhere.</p><p>LACQUA:  When you look at infrastructure plans, again, from the Trump  administration, does -- does filter through GDP?  I mean, it's unclear to  me, even these tax cuts, at this point in the cycle, does it filter through  inflation, or does it -- or does it work on GDP?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  I prefer tax cuts to infrastructure spending.  Infrastructure  spending is a bit like communism, it works well in theory, not always well  in practice.</p><p>LACQUA:  Because of lagging time?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Just wastage, slippage, all kinds of things, you know.  So the  dollar spent on infrastructure doesn't really -- studies have shown  infrastructure doesn't yield as much for GDP as tax cuts do, so if you ask  me which one I'd prefer, I'd prefer tax cuts.</p><p>LACQUA:  What's priced in at the moment in the market?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  I think tax cut, something's -- you -- one, Trump success is  priced in, and I think it's going to be somewhat linked to tax cuts, which  I think is -- is reasonable.  I mean, there may be compromises along the  way between the two parties, but I think that he'll get something, I'll be  surprised if the president doesn't.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  Nikhil, when you look at I guess, the composition, you know,  we talked a little bit about around the world, emerging markets, U.S.,  Europe, is it right to think that Europe will outperform the U.S.?  I know  we're starting from the very low base.</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  No, no, for sure.  I have no doubt that the -- Europe will  (inaudible) the U.S. votes in terms of overall growth and also as well,  markets.  I'd rather buy European equities than U.S. equities (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA:  But equities are exposed globally, so you get, what, you get a  discount because of European (inaudible) you?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  Well, I mean, yes.  I mean, you know, European equities are  both global and low, and I just say, baskets of European stocks are more  appealing, I think you're going to have a looser policy directive from the  ECB, you know, continued loose policy from the ECB, you're going to have  continued loose fiscal from European governments, so Europe looks all  right.  I mean, you know, you can't call the end Europe, yen to Europe just  a year after things have started to really dwell or two years (inaudible) a  lot of the countries.  Germany's been doing well for a long time.</p><p>LACQUA:  It's Europe.  Don't we do that every couple of years that it's the  end of the world, and end of the -- end of the -- the experiment?</p><p>SRINIVASAN:  You know, commentators in this country and the U.S. have been  talking about the end of the experiment for a very long time, ever since  the crisis, right, they've been wrong, and they're going to continue to be  wrong about the end of the experiment, OK?  The question then is, can  Europe outperform?  And Europe's sometimes its own worst enemy.  It was too  late in terms of loosening monetary policy, you've seen the consequences in  Spain yesterday, you know, and so as long as things continue to chug along  and, you know, the French-German relationship could just produce positive  news for Europe.  I think Europe continues to do fine.  I think it's --  it's just -- it's a cottage industry to be negative on Europe all the time.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right, Nikhil, thank you so much for joining us.  We have to  get you back on to talk about Japan as well, that's the only thing we kind  of didn't do in our 60 minutes (inaudible).  Nikhil Srinivasan there from  HPS Investment Partners.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Nikhil manages $42 billion and is the former group chief investment officer at Assicurazioni Generali. I think it took me at the time, like four years, Nikhil, to get you back on, so I'm glad you're more available to us now, thank you for coming on.</p><p>NIKHIL SRINIVASAN, CHAIRMAN INTERNATIONAL, HPS INVESTMENT PARTNERS: Thank you, Francine, it's my pleasure.</p><p>LACQUA: And Christian, thank you for -- for coming on as well. first of all, how should investors look at risk Catalonia? So this is something that was ignored on Friday, and then today, it seems that even spreads between the German and Italian yields are going a little bit crazy.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: You get -- you have to get used to a bit of volatility in this. I think there's a process, and I think your colleague in Barcelona had some comments. My point of view, this request constitutional reform, and that'll take a bit of time, and then at some point then, the Catalonians will decide will they want to vote again based on the reform. So until that happens, that could take several months, it's going to be a bit unsaid, but it's not going to be dramatically bad, I mean, Spanish yields are up seven basis points, and I wouldn't say that's a calamity.</p><p>LACQUA: No, it's not a calamity, but when you look at the ECB and kind of, you know, the fact that they are standing firm, the fact that you see this kind of news, Christian, what does it mean for Spanish GDP overall?</p><p>CHRISTIAN KELLER, HEAD OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH, BARCLAYS: Well, I mean Catalonia as well, very much reported, is 1/5 of the Spanish economy, so it is an important part, but so far, I would actually be of a similar view that, you know, cyclically, Europe looks quite strong right now, you know, and then we have a global recovery that in -- in full swing, we have a synchronized recovery in Europe after, you know, the elections in France which is more of a, you know, real problem early in December or could have been one, and then you had actually, Italy and Spain in particular, cleaning up the bank balance sheet, so now, we have a situation where really, Europe, you know, looks quite good with regard to growth, and I'm not sure whether this -- of course, we have to see how far, you know, this -- this expands now, but this will really be something that will more seriously, fundamentally in a way, derail this recovery that we see in Europe.</p><p>LACQUA: Nikhil, you were saying that basically, when you look at the Spanish bonds, they're falling a touch, but it's nothing to (inaudible) about. Let me bring you over to my chart. This is -- you see the Spanish bonds compared to the Catalonian bonds. For our radio listeners, we will push it out on social media. Any value? I'm not necessarily talking to you about, you know, Catalonian bonds, but any value in European bonds at the moment?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Sure. I mean, look, I mean, what is the Catalonian situation? This is a remnant of the recession, 2008. You could argue that the central bank in Europe, the ECB, should have reacted faster, they didn't. You have in equity in Europe, and you see that through the German election, you see that now through the Catalonian failed election or failed independence vote. I'd say that you have to continue to be loose in Europe in terms of monetary policy, so any tightening, any -- any tapering that the ECB comes up will have to be minor, won't be significant (inaudible), so if spreads blow out a bit -- a bit more, blow out, meaning -- it's a strong word, the spreads widen a bit more, I'd be a buyer.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. This is what we're looking at in terms of spreads for example, between the Italian and Spanish 10-year yield. Christian, how should we view the German elections, the fact that actually, Wolfgang Schaeuble, who's an institution, resigned to make place for someone else partly because of this new coalition being formed, and what do you make of the Italian elections? Is that the biggest risk going forward?</p><p>KELLER: Yes. I think until maybe, the development of the last few days, we have to maybe reassess how -- how far this constitutional crisis in Spain can go, but so -- until now, we always thought the Italian elections coming sometime early next year, were the biggest remaining risk in Europe. In -- in Germany, I think, look, Ms. Merkel is clearly weakened, and I think what it -- how it will -- it will affect a little bit, the fact that these markets have developed about a new German-French access and how much Germany would be willing to share risk possibly in, you know, in further integration of the European Union. On the finance ministry, we will see a different phase. I doubt that we will see a strong change in policy because the likely new minister from the Free Democrats, FDP will probably not be that different from Schaeuble when it comes to policies and attitudes towards risk sharing.</p><p>LACQUA: Nikhil, what would it take for you to buy Italian yields, Italian bonds?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Italian bonds have rallied quite a bit in the last few months. Now probably, I would like a little bit of a spread blow out again in Italy. I don't -- I'm not so worried about the Italian election as other people are (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: Why not?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, Italy has created about a million jobs in the last three years, GDP is running to one and a half as opposed to expectation which is below one. I think we -- we don't know how the coalition is going to be formed, it's still too early to tell, but I think that things chug along in Italy. I mean, there are still some long-term -- there are definite long- term concerns, but in the short term, it looks all right, so again, if -- if Italian yields as a -- as a consequence of what's happening in Spain also move out a bit, I'd be a buyer of Italian bonds as well.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you think, Nikhil, that Mario Draghi wakes up this morning and looks at these yields and kind of tries to process, you know, what the Catalonia vote and the upcoming Italian elections mean for his policy?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, it's not just the Catalonia vote, I think he is already (inaudible) I don't know if he has done it directly, but other people in the ECB have -- have hinted the market, they will be pulling back but not significantly, they've got to do that, pull back but not significantly, because you must remember, and I -- I go back to this, Catalonia, German elections, all this is a consequence of tight monetary policy when they could have loosened, OK? They took their time to do it. Now, they've got to take their time to pull back.</p><p>LACQUA: OK, interesting. Nikhil and Christian both stay with us. Christian Keller there and Nikhil, Srinivasan.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: Well, still with us are Christian Keller from Barclays and Nikhil Srinivasan from HPS Investment Partners. Thank you both for sticking around. Christian, let me go to you on Brexit. What do we know, what do we -- it seems messy, right? Is this part and parcel of negotiations or is it more messier than needed?</p><p>KELLER: It's unprecedented. We -- we really have no comparison, right, but I think what is clear that the E.U. was in a -- negotiating from a position of strength, you know, they had no -- you know, they had no reason to really be upfront with, you know, approaching the U.K., they're waiting for the U.K. I think the speech in Florence was very important. I think she touched upon all the outstanding issues. Obviously, she couldn't deliver the details yet that some would have wanted, but the -- the reception in a way on the continent I think was -- was positive. You heard Michel Barnier speaking a few words of English, I think, you know, that is a good sign, and now --</p><p>LACQUA: Always a good sign.</p><p>KELLER: And now, I think it's -- it's really up this -- up to do this week because people will watch whether her concept that she alluded to in the Florence speech basically has a strong backing by her own party. And she must come out of this week in a way as someone who is, you know, sure to be the leader for the coming years, and then I think Brexit could take a more, you know, constructive path than it has maybe over the last past few months.</p><p>LACQUA: Christian, when you revise upwards or downwards your economic forecast for the U.K., do you look at BOE or do you look at Brexit talks, or both?</p><p>KELLER: We -- we look more at -- at Brexit talks in the sense that we look at uncertainty and what could happen to investment. At the moment, you know, we have a U.K. economy that has been much more resilient than people have thought. And you know, consumption has held up very well, and what we see now is, you know, investment in a way, slowing, and you know, the BOE will be important, they may be hiking, and that has an impact on the -- on consumers who pay mortgages, et cetera, but I think if we have an outlook for Brexit that signal some kind of a certainty, I think that would help the U.K. economy over the medium term significantly.</p><p>LACQUA: Have you -- are you a political analyst yet? You know, forget all this investment stuff.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I can do politics.</p><p>LACQUA: Politics, right. Do you need to be like a political analyst to try figure out where you put money in the -- in the U.K. or in the U.S., or not?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: No, absolutely. But I think on Brexit, Christian has all the points right, I don't disagree with anything he said. My point is that, it's a complex issue, negotiating Brexit. I think you have to be incrementalist (ph) about it just because the Europeans are and the whole process is. And don't forget that Britain had about a 15-year up-cycle, barring that '07, '08 situation. So just from a cyclical point of view, having a slower U.K. is expected, and now, doesn't mean it's going to collapse, I just think they just expect slower growth in the U.K.</p><p>LACQUA: What happens to pound? And actually, if pound is weaker, does it make, you know, investments more attractive?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes, pound was in a 1.20, 1.30 range, it's now broken out to 1.33, 1.34, I think it stays around here, and (inaudible) it pulled back a bit, but I think you've got a sterling which is essentially trying to find a base around 1.30, you know, 1.28, 1.30.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. 1.28, 1.30. Christian, first of all, what's your take on -- this is actually one of my favorite charts, and this is U.K. consumer credit, and it's something that I imagine Mark Carney is looking at very closely because of interest rates and the fact that households are so indebted in this country, does this chart worry you?</p><p>KELLER: Well, it is a chart that is important, and I think it is important also because it is behind some of the recent significant change in the attitude of the Bank of England. And if you go through particularly, what some of the MPC members who are considered to be dovish when they turn around in their view, they highlighted a balance sheet of the households and said, deleveraging of -- of households was over, and they have been leveraging, and this is why they argued for a rate hike because they believed they're now in a situation where households are level again, households are robust enough that they could withstand, you know, some increase in interest rates. So I think it's a very important chart and one -- one to follow. Not concerned really, I think, you know, the hikes will be -- we see one hike for now, you know, and I think the Bank of England will -- will act very, very cautiously.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. What's your take on -- on euro-pound actually? So you gave us a level on euro-dollar, is this the most interesting one?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes, range bound, just range bound. Like a lot of currency, I think euro-dollar will be range bound, euro-sterling is range bound, I think you've got -- you got a period of uncertainty, in the U.K. it's Brexit, in Europe now, it's got Spain, Catalonia, et cetera, and of course, ECB policy, so I think between both things, I think you really got a range bound currency across.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. Interesting. I want to talk a little bit more about the global outlook now. Now, in a new report, Barclays has said U.S. growth remains decent if unexciting, while Europe and Japan have shown further upside. The bank expects the Fed to hike in December and twice in 2018, while the ECB is likely to taper further next year. Christian, this is your report, what's the most surprising thing in it?</p><p>KELLER: I think the most surprising in it is if you -- if you look at it again, you know, how well global growth is synchronized. And, you know, there's a lot of questions from investors who say, well, is this as good as it gets? You know, shouldn't one be more cautious now? You know, things have been going very well in particular, if -- if you look at equity valuation in the U.S. But we look at the data, and we see a global economy that continues to expand, where U.S. no longer the cyclical leadership, but we get very good data out of -- out of Europe. Japan's in the economy that has relatively low growth but is running above potential. We see some of the emerging markets like Russia, Brazil, coming out of deep recessions, and we see a China that you saw it over -- over the weekend, continues to hold up quite well. Now, this is something we haven't had for 5, 6 years, and it means, global growth running around 4 percent, and if you look at equity earnings, they correlate very well with global growth, and we think that is basically the -- the big story that is still there, and that's why we continue to be quite constructive.</p><p>LACQUA: Are -- are you -- are you positive about world growth or is it all based on air?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: This is the first time since 2007 that all -- all economies, 40 plus economies counted by the OECD, are showing positive growth, so I am very comfortable with growth.</p><p>LACQUA: How do you feel with inflation though? I| mean, there are -- there are still puzzles, right? And I don't know if it's the Phillips curve being broken or something more sinister out there.</p><p>KELLER: I think, you know, the -- the second part of the surprise is the - - in the data is basically that inflation stays so muted. The good thing is we are creating drops, so unemployment rates are falling in all the key economies, but we don't have the wage growth. Now, whether it's something sinister, I think there are several effect at work, one, it does take time. People are coming back into the labor market, you mentioned Italy earlier. There are people now coming back who were not in the Labor market, that's where the unemployment doesn't fall, because if the participation rates goes up. These are good developments, but I think there is something bigger in the background, that's technology, globalization, and that's why Phillips curves no longer work the way they did in the past, and that's something I think central banks have to grapple with because all their models and all their usual actions are based on, you know, the Phillips curve working.</p><p>LACQUA: And Nikhil, do you worry -- I don't know if you worry about inflation or do you just worry that for example, if you look at the most distorted market (inaudible) most probably the bond market, and so as this kind of, you know, gets re-priced, it could lead to further correction (inaudible).</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes, let's talk about this -- this inflation and this Fed policy, for example. Fed policy is all about normalization. I don't think that it really cares much about inflation as normalizing the interest rate situation.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. But should they care more about inflation?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, they -- they want inflation. I think everything -- OK, if you look at global, you look at reflationary currencies, Aussie dollar, Canadian dollar, basic materials, copper, aluminum, all are pointing to more inflation, OK? We haven't seen it in the U.S., we haven't really seen it anywhere in the world right now, but at least --</p><p>LACQUA: Except for U.K.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes. But things -- if I -- if I look at typical reflationary indicators are all up, but I said, the Feds behavior is about normalizing based on financial stability, it's not really based on well, inflation's going to hit X, and so we've got to do it now. And so the Fed will continue to gradually increase rates, OK? I think we'll get some inflation, probably get some inflation in Germany, it's been going very strong, probably get some inflation generally, in Europe, probably get some everywhere, but we're not going to get as much as people want, so when you look at yields and you say, OK, well, yields are 10-year U.S. at 2.36 today, where is it going? Look, it will go higher. I think all yields were high in the next 12 months.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Guys, thank you so much. Christian Keller there, head of economic research at Barclays, thank you for your time. And Nikhil Srinivasan stays with us, we'll talk a little bit more about the risks out there, we had great comments from Crispin Odey as well. We'll talk about regulation and kind of China as well next.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: Well, still with us, Nikhil Srinivasan, he is from HPS Investment Partners. Nikhil, when you look at the risks out there, so we had Mr. Odey actually quite bearish overall, right, about his view on the world economy. What do you see as the biggest risk out there for markets?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I think the biggest risk, Francine, is complacency. I think people are complacent about the North Korean situation, they're complacent about the Middle East and the Kyrgyzstan independence vote and oil in general, and they're complacent in the U.S. about increased regulation on big Tech. So I think if you look everywhere, I think the biggest risk is complacency. People are saying, well, let's just keep going forward.</p><p>LACQUA: Why are they complacent? Is it something to do with algorithms and the way that the markets are actually right at the moment, or is it that it's impossible to, you know, price in Trump's next move, but also you're going to do with North Korea?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, it's hard to value the level of risk that I'm talking about. So given it's hard to value the risk, given there's a lot of liquidity out there, given the Fed's policies, you know, I'd say that people just want to continue doing what they're doing and they've made money doing it, so you can't argue with that, right? So these are, if you ask me, the biggest risk is complacency because it's not priced in. Korea, it's not pricing in Korean risk.</p><p>LACQUA: What will it take to be priced in? I mean, is it kind of a snowball effect?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, not necessarily. For example, if you are in the Big Tech stocks for example, I think they are not people -- they have come off a bit, I mean, they've come off relative to the market. I think people have to get used to the fact that these companies are going to face more of a (inaudible) going forward, but the ownership of these stocks remains extremely robust, and so you haven't seen a real selloff, 10 percent, but you haven't seen a real selloff for these companies yet, that's one thing.</p><p>LACQUA: Nikhil, do you worry about -- I mean, I don't know what actually your canary in the coal mine, you know, benchmark is, is there something? Will it come from China, or is it really impossible to predict?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: China's fine, Francine. So if you're talking about China, I think people shouldn't worry about China, they --</p><p>LACQUA: Not even the debt --</p><p>SRINIVASAN: No, nothing.</p><p>LACQUA: -- and reserves?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Nothing. I think the currency has shown resilience, currency rallied in the last few weeks. I think the congress is going to go fine, I think you're going to have a slowdown of growth built in because of supply- side reform so they have -- have kicked in, built in because you have this anti-corruption move which is going to taper off. I think going into next year in the (inaudible) we see very, very growth -- good growth in China, I am not worried about China at all.</p><p>LACQUA: Are you worried about emerging markets and the fact that if Fed normalizes? It's been telegraphed for about three years, but are you worried about some kind of correction in emerging markets, just (inaudible) you know, technical Fed?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes, well, because they -- they rallied a lot, so yes, they could correct. I mean, certainly, but I think China will continue to go up, and the Chinese market looks pretty good overall. I think all these emerging markets have run up quite a bit, most of them (inaudible). I would say I'm -- I'm less bearish or less worried about corrections from the oil markets like Russia. I think Russia has more upside as well. I think that, you know, you have to take -- take a step back and say, look, are we still looking at the world through the lens of '07, '08? And every time something happens, we can never tell there's a correction coming, corrections will come. Global economy is growing. It think the biggest uncertainties are the three things that I mentioned.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. But what about politics? Again, if you look at, you know, people voting in Europe for example, sure, GDP is getting higher, you know, joblessness is going down, but actually, one in 10 people voted for a far right candidate in the -- in Germany, they did the same in France.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, there's -- there's economic inequity in Europe, just like it is in another parts of the world. Like, we saw that in the U.S., we're seeing that here as well, that's going to continue, that's not going away.</p><p>LACQUA: Will it get worse?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I think it's going to get worse. But it's not going to get substantially worse, it's going to get worse in terms of (inaudible) voting patterns that continue to show people are disgruntled, at least a large or a visible part of the population is disgruntled. It's -- it's disgruntled here in the U.K., in Germany, in Spain, now you see it, in Italy, everywhere and around the world, so you're going to see that. you're going to see protest votes gathering pace. Now, that's going to impact policy, monetary policy, fiscal policy, you're going to see governments having to run deficits. The U.K. government will have to run their deficit. European governments have to run their deficit. Even the German government which is -- which is in surplus will incrementally have to increase spending on infrastructure and other things, incrementally, gradually, step by step, German style. I think everyone has to accept the fact that there are certain people in the population that are not really gaining from what is headline growth.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, Nikhil, thank you so much. Nikhil Srinivasan there, chairman international, HPS Investment Partners stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>LACQUA: Now, we were just talking with Nikhil Srinivasan, and we have a question from NIB, from a viewer, and this Nikhil is for you. Now, this is a question, we were talking of course, about complacency and the market's complacency, would you say that the complacency originates from the fact that the majority of the disgruntled are not amongst its players? So actually, does this disgruntlement, Nikhil, then -- then becomes something that we should worry about for markets?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: The question is fair. I think (inaudible) players is right. I don't think you have to worry about it is a constant something might happen, but I think it is, the consequence from a policy point of view is governments have to remain relatively loose in the fiscal front, that's it. And on the monetary side, you have to remain loose as well, so that's not - - you know, tightening's not going t to happen, it can't happen if you want the disgruntled to be feeling better off. And I don't think any economy in Europe can tighten today, or in the U.S. I don't think the U.S. can tighten. In fact, the tax cut plans are all going to be fiscally negative, right? Be expansionary, so no, I think fiscal policy has to remain expansionary.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. Which is why you were talking about normalizing, and actually, not tightening. The dollar has strengthened after reports that President Trump and secretary -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have met with Kevin Warsh to discuss nominating him to succeed Fed chair, Janet Yellen. Nikhil, again, I guess for you, it doesn't really matter who's in charge next. I seem to understand about your comments that it will be kind of steady as she goes which is normalizing.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes. I think my point about normalizing was less to do with inflation even though inflation is -- is the core of the Fed alongside employment, I'd say it's more to do with normalizing in General, to ensure financial stability. Ownership of U.S. equities among U.S. households has again, reached a high last seen 10 years ago, and I think the Fed must be concerned, and they must ensure that they don't have any - any accidents down the road, so I think that normalization is far from close.</p><p>LACQUA: Ok. But does it -- it still matters right, if you have someone at the head who's a dove or a hawk, because actually, how you interpret, I mean, you say they shouldn't focus too much on inflation, they just want stability, but so far, inflation has been the cornerstone of how you measure stability.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Yes. But you see, every time they don't get inflation, they use another measure. They try and say, well, it's going to come, they could suddenly surprise you. Look, these are the comments with people who don't see inflation, yet want to raise rates.</p><p>LACQUA: OK, would you change the mandate? And if you would change the mandate for the Fed, what would you be looking at? I mean, you need metric, right, on - on how you look at it, otherwise, it's a free for all.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I would look -- I mean, I look at something they can't probably include which is capital allocation because when you have a lot of free liquidity you misallocate capital, and that's what's been happening. You know, certain really been bid up, other things like capital investment has been ignore, so -- but I think you can't really change the mandate, that's not my point. My point is that, we were late to normalize, and now, they have to at least, reach a level of normalization they are comfortable with, which maybe, the market decide if that's too high, too low, but what they are comfortable with, and that means high rates.</p><p>LACQUA: Nikhil, what will be a game-changer for you in the U.S.? Is it all to do with monetary policy or does a tax cut for example, repatriation at 10 percent actually, significantly change the way you look at animal spirits U.S.?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I think what would be a game changer if GDP in the U.S. really dropped, say, below 1 percent, which it doesn't seem at this point, likely.</p><p>LACQUA: So why would it do that?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, because I think people aren't ready for that. People are ready -- people accepted a stable one and a half economy, or one and a half, two. People are not ready for something that comes closer to the zero to one, and I think that would surprise people, and that would show finally that, oh, my god, you know, something is wrong, we're not getting the growth they want, and I think that the --</p><p>LACQUA: But you think that's likely, or is --</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I don't think that's likely. At today's setting, I don't see it in the numbers. I can't say it's going to happen, but I'm saying that's your risk, you said , what's your biggest risk? That's my biggest risk, is GDP falling below expectation.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. But what would need to happen for that GDP to fall below expectations?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Just people don't want to buy consumption falls, I mean, retail spending falls. I mean, these are, you know, oil prices, you know the issue. But again, if oil prices go up significant -- I think oil is in a good spot, I don't see we're going to $80, but I see oil pretty well-bid everywhere.</p><p>LACQUA: When you look at infrastructure plans, again, from the Trump administration, does -- does filter through GDP? I mean, it's unclear to me, even these tax cuts, at this point in the cycle, does it filter through inflation, or does it -- or does it work on GDP?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I prefer tax cuts to infrastructure spending. Infrastructure spending is a bit like communism, it works well in theory, not always well in practice.</p><p>LACQUA: Because of lagging time?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Just wastage, slippage, all kinds of things, you know. So the dollar spent on infrastructure doesn't really -- studies have shown infrastructure doesn't yield as much for GDP as tax cuts do, so if you ask me which one I'd prefer, I'd prefer tax cuts.</p><p>LACQUA: What's priced in at the moment in the market?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: I think tax cut, something's -- you -- one, Trump success is priced in, and I think it's going to be somewhat linked to tax cuts, which I think is -- is reasonable. I mean, there may be compromises along the way between the two parties, but I think that he'll get something, I'll be surprised if the president doesn't.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. Nikhil, when you look at I guess, the composition, you know, we talked a little bit about around the world, emerging markets, U.S., Europe, is it right to think that Europe will outperform the U.S.? I know we're starting from the very low base.</p><p>SRINIVASAN: No, no, for sure. I have no doubt that the -- Europe will (inaudible) the U.S. votes in terms of overall growth and also as well, markets. I'd rather buy European equities than U.S. equities (inaudible).</p><p>LACQUA: But equities are exposed globally, so you get, what, you get a discount because of European (inaudible) you?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: Well, I mean, yes. I mean, you know, European equities are both global and low, and I just say, baskets of European stocks are more appealing, I think you're going to have a looser policy directive from the ECB, you know, continued loose policy from the ECB, you're going to have continued loose fiscal from European governments, so Europe looks all right. I mean, you know, you can't call the end Europe, yen to Europe just a year after things have started to really dwell or two years (inaudible) a lot of the countries. Germany's been doing well for a long time.</p><p>LACQUA: It's Europe. Don't we do that every couple of years that it's the end of the world, and end of the -- end of the -- the experiment?</p><p>SRINIVASAN: You know, commentators in this country and the U.S. have been talking about the end of the experiment for a very long time, ever since the crisis, right, they've been wrong, and they're going to continue to be wrong about the end of the experiment, OK? The question then is, can Europe outperform? And Europe's sometimes its own worst enemy. It was too late in terms of loosening monetary policy, you've seen the consequences in Spain yesterday, you know, and so as long as things continue to chug along and, you know, the French-German relationship could just produce positive news for Europe. I think Europe continues to do fine. I think it's -- it's just -- it's a cottage industry to be negative on Europe all the time.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, Nikhil, thank you so much for joining us. We have to get you back on to talk about Japan as well, that's the only thing we kind of didn't do in our 60 minutes (inaudible). Nikhil Srinivasan there from HPS Investment Partners.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Nikhil  manages $42 billion and is the former group chief investment officer at  Assicurazioni Generali.  I think it took me at the time, like four years,  Nikhil, to get you back on, so I'm glad you're more available to us now,  thank you for coming on.</p><p> NIKHIL SRINIVASAN, CHAIRMAN INTERNATIONAL, HPS INVESTMENT PARTNERS:  Thank  you, Francine, it's my pleasure.</p><p> LACQUA:  And Christian, thank you for -- for coming on as well.  first of  all, how should investors look at risk Catalonia?  So this is something  that was ignored on Friday, and then today, it seems that even spreads  between the German and Italian yields are going a little bit crazy.</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  You get -- you have to get used to a bit of volatility in  this.  I think there's a process, and I think your colleague in Barcelona  had some comments.  My point of view, this request constitutional reform,  and that'll take a bit of time, and then at some point then, the  Catalonians will decide will they want to vote again based on the reform.   So until that happens, that could take several months, it's going to be a  bit unsaid, but it's not going to be dramatically bad, I mean, Spanish  yields are up seven basis points, and I wouldn't say that's a calamity.</p><p> LACQUA:  No, it's not a calamity, but when you look at the ECB and kind of,  you know, the fact that they are standing firm, the fact that you see this  kind of news, Christian, what does it mean for Spanish GDP overall?</p><p> CHRISTIAN KELLER, HEAD OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH, BARCLAYS:  Well, I mean  Catalonia as well, very much reported, is 1/5 of the Spanish economy, so it  is an important part, but so far, I would actually be of a similar view  that, you know, cyclically, Europe looks quite strong right now, you know,  and then we have a global recovery that in -- in full swing, we have a  synchronized recovery in Europe after, you know, the elections in France  which is more of a, you know, real problem early in December or could have  been one, and then you had actually, Italy and Spain in particular,  cleaning up the bank balance sheet, so now, we have a situation where  really, Europe, you know, looks quite good with regard to growth, and I'm  not sure whether this -- of course, we have to see how far, you know, this  -- this expands now, but this will really be something that will more  seriously, fundamentally in a way, derail this recovery that we see in  Europe.</p><p> LACQUA:  Nikhil, you were saying that basically, when you look at the  Spanish bonds, they're falling a touch, but it's nothing to (inaudible)  about.  Let me bring you over to my chart.  This is -- you see the Spanish  bonds compared to the Catalonian bonds.  For our radio listeners, we will  push it out on social media.  Any value?  I'm not necessarily talking to  you about, you know, Catalonian bonds, but any value in European bonds at  the moment?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Sure.  I mean, look, I mean, what is the Catalonian situation?   This is a remnant of the recession, 2008.  You could argue that the central  bank in Europe, the ECB, should have reacted faster, they didn't.  You have  in equity in Europe, and you see that through the German election, you see  that now through the Catalonian failed election or failed independence  vote.  I'd say that you have to continue to be loose in Europe in terms of  monetary policy, so any tightening, any -- any tapering that the ECB comes  up will have to be minor, won't be significant (inaudible), so if spreads  blow out a bit -- a bit more, blow out, meaning -- it's a strong word, the  spreads widen a bit more, I'd be a buyer.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.  This is what we're looking at in terms of spreads for  example, between the Italian and Spanish 10-year yield.  Christian, how  should we view the German elections, the fact that actually, Wolfgang  Schaeuble, who's an institution, resigned to make place for someone else  partly because of this new coalition being formed, and what do you make of  the Italian elections?  Is that the biggest risk going forward?</p><p> KELLER:  Yes.  I think until maybe, the development of the last few days,  we have to maybe reassess how -- how far this constitutional crisis in  Spain can go, but so -- until now, we always thought the Italian elections  coming sometime early next year, were the biggest remaining risk in Europe.   In -- in Germany, I think, look, Ms. Merkel is clearly weakened, and I  think what it -- how it will -- it will affect a little bit, the fact that  these markets have developed about a new German-French access and how much  Germany would be willing to share risk possibly in, you know, in further  integration of the European Union.  On the finance ministry, we will see a  different phase.  I doubt that we will see a strong change in policy  because the likely new minister from the Free Democrats, FDP will probably  not be that different from Schaeuble when it comes to policies and  attitudes towards risk sharing.</p><p> LACQUA:  Nikhil, what would it take for you to buy Italian yields, Italian  bonds?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Italian bonds have rallied quite a bit in the last few months.   Now probably, I would like a little bit of a spread blow out again in  Italy.  I don't -- I'm not so worried about the Italian election as other  people are (inaudible).</p><p> LACQUA:  Why not?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Well, Italy has created about a million jobs in the last three  years, GDP is running to one and a half as opposed to expectation which is  below one.  I think we -- we don't know how the coalition is going to be  formed, it's still too early to tell, but I think that things chug along in  Italy.  I mean, there are still some long-term -- there are definite long- term concerns, but in the short term, it looks all right, so again, if --  if Italian yields as a -- as a consequence of what's happening in Spain  also move out a bit, I'd be a buyer of Italian bonds as well.</p><p> LACQUA:  Do you think, Nikhil, that Mario Draghi wakes up this morning and  looks at these yields and kind of tries to process, you know, what the  Catalonia vote and the upcoming Italian elections mean for his policy?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Well, it's not just the Catalonia vote, I think he is already  (inaudible) I don't know if he has done it directly, but other people in  the ECB have -- have hinted the market, they will be pulling back but not  significantly, they've got to do that, pull back but not significantly,  because you must remember, and I -- I go back to this, Catalonia, German  elections, all this is a consequence of tight monetary policy when they  could have loosened, OK?  They took their time to do it.  Now, they've got  to take their time to pull back.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK, interesting.  Nikhil and Christian both stay with us.   Christian Keller there and Nikhil, Srinivasan.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> LACQUA:  Well, still with us are Christian Keller from Barclays and Nikhil  Srinivasan from HPS Investment Partners.  Thank you both for sticking  around.  Christian, let me go to you on Brexit.  What do we know, what do  we -- it seems messy, right?  Is this part and parcel of negotiations or is  it more messier than needed?</p><p> KELLER:  It's unprecedented.  We -- we really have no comparison, right,  but I think what is clear that the E.U. was in a -- negotiating from a  position of strength, you know, they had no -- you know, they had no reason  to really be upfront with, you know, approaching the U.K., they're waiting  for the U.K.  I think the speech in Florence was very important.  I think  she touched upon all the outstanding issues.  Obviously, she couldn't  deliver the details yet that some would have wanted, but the -- the  reception in a way on the continent I think was -- was positive.  You heard  Michel Barnier speaking a few words of English, I think, you know, that is  a good sign, and now --</p><p> LACQUA:  Always a good sign.</p><p> KELLER:  And now, I think it's -- it's really up this -- up to do this week  because people will watch whether her concept that she alluded to in the  Florence speech basically has a strong backing by her own party.  And she  must come out of this week in a way as someone who is, you know, sure to be  the leader for the coming years, and then I think Brexit could take a more,  you know, constructive path than it has maybe over the last past few  months.</p><p> LACQUA:  Christian, when you revise upwards or downwards your economic  forecast for the U.K., do you look at BOE or do you look at Brexit talks,  or both?</p><p> KELLER:  We -- we look more at -- at Brexit talks in the sense that we look  at uncertainty and what could happen to investment.  At the moment, you  know, we have a U.K. economy that has been much more resilient than people  have thought.  And you know, consumption has held up very well, and what we  see now is, you know, investment in a way, slowing, and you know, the BOE  will be important, they may be hiking, and that has an impact on the -- on  consumers who pay mortgages, et cetera, but I think if we have an outlook  for Brexit that signal some kind of a certainty, I think that would help  the U.K. economy over the medium term significantly.</p><p> LACQUA:  Have you -- are you a political analyst yet?  You know, forget all  this investment stuff.</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  I can do politics.</p><p> LACQUA:  Politics, right.  Do you need to be like a political analyst to  try figure out where you put money in the -- in the U.K. or in the U.S., or  not?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  No, absolutely.  But I think on Brexit, Christian has all the  points right, I don't disagree with anything he said.  My point is that,  it's a complex issue, negotiating Brexit.  I think you have to be  incrementalist (ph) about it just because the Europeans are and the whole  process is.  And don't forget that Britain had about a 15-year up-cycle,  barring that '07, '08 situation.  So just from a cyclical point of view,  having a slower U.K. is expected, and now, doesn't mean it's going to  collapse, I just think they just expect slower growth in the U.K.</p><p> LACQUA:  What happens to pound?  And actually, if pound is weaker, does it  make, you know, investments more attractive?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Yes, pound was in a 1.20, 1.30 range, it's now broken out to  1.33, 1.34, I think it stays around here, and (inaudible) it pulled back a  bit, but I think you've got a sterling which is essentially trying to find  a base around 1.30, you know, 1.28, 1.30.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.  1.28, 1.30.  Christian, first of all, what's your take on --  this is actually one of my favorite charts, and this is U.K. consumer  credit, and it's something that I imagine Mark Carney is looking at very  closely because of interest rates and the fact that households are so  indebted in this country, does this chart worry you?</p><p> KELLER:  Well, it is a chart that is important, and I think it is important  also because it is behind some of the recent significant change in the  attitude of the Bank of England.  And if you go through particularly, what  some of the MPC members who are considered to be dovish when they turn  around in their view, they highlighted a balance sheet of the households  and said, deleveraging of -- of households was over, and they have been  leveraging, and this is why they argued for a rate hike because they  believed they're now in a situation where households are level again,  households are robust enough that they could withstand, you know, some  increase in interest rates.  So I think it's a very important chart and one  -- one to follow.  Not concerned really, I think, you know, the hikes will  be -- we see one hike for now, you know, and I think the Bank of England  will -- will act very, very cautiously.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.  What's your take on -- on euro-pound actually?  So you gave  us a level on euro-dollar, is this the most interesting one?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Yes, range bound, just range bound.  Like a lot of currency, I  think euro-dollar will be range bound, euro-sterling is range bound, I  think you've got -- you got a period of uncertainty, in the U.K. it's  Brexit, in Europe now, it's got Spain, Catalonia, et cetera, and of course,  ECB policy, so I think between both things, I think you really got a range  bound currency across.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.  Interesting.  I want to talk a little bit more about the  global outlook now.  Now, in a new report, Barclays has said U.S. growth  remains decent if unexciting, while Europe and Japan have shown further  upside.  The bank expects the Fed to hike in December and twice in 2018,  while the ECB is likely to taper further next year.  Christian, this is  your report, what's the most surprising thing in it?</p><p> KELLER:  I think the most surprising in it is if you -- if you look at it  again, you know, how well global growth is synchronized.  And, you know,  there's a lot of questions from investors who say, well, is this as good as  it gets?  You know, shouldn't one be more cautious now?  You know, things  have been going very well in particular, if -- if you look at equity  valuation in the U.S.  But we look at the data, and we see a global economy  that continues to expand, where U.S. no longer the cyclical leadership, but  we get very good data out of -- out of Europe.  Japan's in the economy that  has relatively low growth but is running above potential.  We see some of  the emerging markets like Russia, Brazil, coming out of deep recessions,  and we see a China that you saw it over -- over the weekend, continues to  hold up quite well.  Now, this is something we haven't had for 5, 6 years,  and it means, global growth running around 4 percent, and if you look at  equity earnings, they correlate very well with global growth, and we think  that is basically the -- the big story that is still there, and that's why  we continue to be quite constructive.</p><p> LACQUA:  Are -- are you -- are you positive about world growth or is it all  based on air?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  This is the first time since 2007 that all -- all economies,  40 plus economies counted by the OECD, are showing positive growth, so I am  very comfortable with growth.</p><p> LACQUA:  How do you feel with inflation though?  I| mean, there are --  there are still puzzles, right?  And I don't know if it's the Phillips  curve being broken or something more sinister out there.</p><p> KELLER:  I think, you know, the -- the second part of the surprise is the - - in the data is basically that inflation stays so muted.  The good thing  is we are creating drops, so unemployment rates are falling in all the key  economies, but we don't have the wage growth.  Now, whether it's something  sinister, I think there are several effect at work, one, it does take time.   People are coming back into the labor market, you mentioned Italy earlier.   There are people now coming back who were not in the Labor market, that's  where the unemployment doesn't fall, because if the participation rates  goes up.  These are good developments, but I think there is something  bigger in the background, that's technology, globalization, and that's why  Phillips curves no longer work the way they did in the past, and that's  something I think central banks have to grapple with because all their  models and all their usual actions are based on, you know, the Phillips  curve working.</p><p> LACQUA:  And Nikhil, do you worry -- I don't know if you worry about  inflation or do you just worry that for example, if you look at the most  distorted market (inaudible) most probably the bond market, and so as this  kind of, you know, gets re-priced, it could lead to further correction  (inaudible).</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Yes, let's talk about this -- this inflation and this Fed  policy, for example.  Fed policy is all about normalization.  I don't think  that it really cares much about inflation as normalizing the interest rate  situation.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.  But should they care more about inflation?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Well, they -- they want inflation.  I think everything -- OK,  if you look at global, you look at reflationary currencies, Aussie dollar,  Canadian dollar, basic materials, copper, aluminum, all are pointing to  more inflation, OK?  We haven't seen it in the U.S., we haven't really seen  it anywhere in the world right now, but at least --</p><p> LACQUA:  Except for U.K.</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Yes.  But things -- if I -- if I look at typical reflationary  indicators are all up, but I said, the Feds behavior is about normalizing  based on financial stability, it's not really based on well, inflation's  going to hit X, and so we've got to do it now.  And so the Fed will  continue to gradually increase rates, OK?  I think we'll get some  inflation, probably get some inflation in Germany, it's been going very  strong, probably get some inflation generally, in Europe, probably get some  everywhere, but we're not going to get as much as people want, so when you  look at yields and you say, OK, well, yields are 10-year U.S. at 2.36  today, where is it going?  Look, it will go higher.  I think all yields  were high in the next 12 months.</p><p> LACQUA:  All right.  Guys, thank you so much.  Christian Keller there, head  of economic research at Barclays, thank you for your time.  And Nikhil  Srinivasan stays with us, we'll talk a little bit more about the risks out  there, we had great comments from Crispin Odey as well.  We'll talk about  regulation and kind of China as well next.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> LACQUA:  Well, still with us, Nikhil Srinivasan, he is from HPS Investment  Partners.  Nikhil, when you look at the risks out there, so we had Mr. Odey  actually quite bearish overall, right, about his view on the world economy.   What do you see as the biggest risk out there for markets?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  I think the biggest risk, Francine, is complacency.  I think  people are complacent about the North Korean situation, they're complacent  about the Middle East and the Kyrgyzstan independence vote and oil in  general, and they're complacent in the U.S. about increased regulation on  big Tech.  So I think if you look everywhere, I think the biggest risk is  complacency.  People are saying, well, let's just keep going forward.</p><p> LACQUA:  Why are they complacent?  Is it something to do with algorithms  and the way that the markets are actually right at the moment, or is it  that it's impossible to, you know, price in Trump's next move, but also  you're going to do with North Korea?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Well, it's hard to value the level of risk that I'm talking  about.  So given it's hard to value the risk, given there's a lot of  liquidity out there, given the Fed's policies, you know, I'd say that  people just want to continue doing what they're doing and they've made  money doing it, so you can't argue with that, right?  So these are, if you  ask me, the biggest risk is complacency because it's not priced in.  Korea,  it's not pricing in Korean risk.</p><p> LACQUA:  What will it take to be priced in?  I mean, is it kind of a  snowball effect?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Well, not necessarily.  For example, if you are in the Big  Tech stocks for example, I think they are not people -- they have come off  a bit, I mean, they've come off relative to the market.  I think people  have to get used to the fact that these companies are going to face more of  a (inaudible) going forward, but the ownership of these stocks remains  extremely robust, and so you haven't seen a real selloff, 10 percent, but  you haven't seen a real selloff for these companies yet, that's one thing.</p><p> LACQUA:  Nikhil, do you worry about -- I mean, I don't know what actually  your canary in the coal mine, you know, benchmark is, is there something?   Will it come from China, or is it really impossible to predict?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  China's fine, Francine.  So if you're talking about China, I  think people shouldn't worry about China, they --</p><p> LACQUA:  Not even the debt --</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  No, nothing.</p><p> LACQUA:  -- and reserves?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Nothing.  I think the currency has shown resilience, currency  rallied in the last few weeks.  I think the congress is going to go fine, I  think you're going to have a slowdown of growth built in because of supply- side reform so they have -- have kicked in, built in because you have this  anti-corruption move which is going to taper off.  I think going into next  year in the (inaudible) we see very, very growth -- good growth in China, I  am not worried about China at all.</p><p> LACQUA:  Are you worried about emerging markets and the fact that if Fed  normalizes?  It's been telegraphed for about three years, but are you  worried about some kind of correction in emerging markets, just (inaudible)  you know, technical Fed?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Yes, well, because they -- they rallied a lot, so yes, they  could correct.  I mean, certainly, but I think China will continue to go  up, and the Chinese market looks pretty good overall.  I think all these  emerging markets have run up quite a bit, most of them (inaudible).  I  would say I'm -- I'm less bearish or less worried about corrections from  the oil markets like Russia.  I think Russia has more upside as well.  I  think that, you know, you have to take -- take a step back and say, look,  are we still looking at the world through the lens of '07, '08?  And every  time something happens, we can never tell there's a correction coming,  corrections will come.  Global economy is growing.  It think the biggest  uncertainties are the three things that I mentioned.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.  But what about politics?  Again, if you look at, you know,  people voting in Europe for example, sure, GDP is getting higher, you know,  joblessness is going down, but actually, one in 10 people voted for a far  right candidate in the -- in Germany, they did the same in France.</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Well, there's -- there's economic inequity in Europe, just  like it is in another parts of the world.  Like, we saw that in the U.S.,  we're seeing that here as well, that's going to continue, that's not going  away.</p><p> LACQUA:  Will it get worse?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  I think it's going to get worse.  But it's not going to get  substantially worse, it's going to get worse in terms of (inaudible) voting  patterns that continue to show people are disgruntled, at least a large or  a visible part of the population is disgruntled.  It's -- it's disgruntled  here in the U.K., in Germany, in Spain, now you see it, in Italy,  everywhere and around the world, so you're going to see that.  you're going  to see protest votes gathering pace.  Now, that's going to impact policy,  monetary policy, fiscal policy, you're going to see governments having to  run deficits.  The U.K. government will have to run their deficit.   European governments have to run their deficit.  Even the German government  which is -- which is in surplus will incrementally have to increase  spending on infrastructure and other things, incrementally, gradually, step  by step, German style.  I think everyone has to accept the fact that there  are certain people in the population that are not really gaining from what  is headline growth.</p><p> LACQUA:  All right, Nikhil, thank you so much.  Nikhil Srinivasan there,  chairman international, HPS Investment Partners stays with us.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> LACQUA:  Now, we were just talking with Nikhil Srinivasan, and we have a  question from NIB, from a viewer, and this Nikhil is for you.  Now, this is  a question, we were talking of course, about complacency and the market's  complacency, would you say that the complacency originates from the fact  that the majority of the disgruntled are not amongst its players?  So  actually, does this disgruntlement, Nikhil, then -- then becomes something  that we should worry about for markets?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  The question is fair.  I think (inaudible) players is right.   I don't think you have to worry about it is a constant something might  happen, but I think it is, the consequence from a policy point of view is  governments have to remain relatively loose in the fiscal front, that's it.   And on the monetary side, you have to remain loose as well, so that's not - - you know, tightening's not going t to happen, it can't happen if you want  the disgruntled to be feeling better off.  And I don't think any economy in  Europe can tighten today, or in the U.S.  I don't think the U.S. can  tighten.  In fact, the tax cut plans are all going to be fiscally negative,  right?  Be expansionary, so no, I think fiscal policy has to remain  expansionary.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.  Which is why you were talking about normalizing, and  actually, not tightening.  The dollar has strengthened after reports that  President Trump and secretary -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have met  with Kevin Warsh to discuss nominating him to succeed Fed chair, Janet  Yellen.  Nikhil, again, I guess for you, it doesn't really matter who's in  charge next.  I seem to understand about your comments that it will be kind  of steady as she goes which is normalizing.</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Yes.  I think my point about normalizing was less to do with  inflation even though inflation is -- is the core of the Fed alongside  employment, I'd say it's more to do with normalizing in General, to ensure  financial stability.  Ownership of U.S. equities among U.S. households has  again, reached a high last seen 10 years ago, and I think the Fed must be  concerned, and they must ensure that they don't have any - any accidents  down the road, so I think that normalization is far from close.</p><p> LACQUA:  Ok.  But does it -- it still matters right, if you have someone at  the head who's a dove or a hawk, because actually, how you interpret, I  mean, you say they shouldn't focus too much on inflation, they just want  stability, but so far, inflation has been the cornerstone of how you  measure stability.</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Yes.  But you see, every time they don't get inflation, they  use another measure.  They try and say, well, it's going to come, they  could suddenly surprise you.  Look, these are the comments with people who  don't see inflation, yet want to raise rates.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK, would you change the mandate?  And if you would change the  mandate for the Fed, what would you be looking at?  I mean, you need  metric, right, on - on how you look at it, otherwise, it's a free for all.</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  I would look -- I mean, I look at something they can't  probably include which is capital allocation because when you have a lot of  free liquidity you misallocate capital, and that's what's been happening.   You know, certain really been bid up, other things like capital investment  has been ignore, so -- but I think you can't really change the mandate,  that's not my point.  My point is that, we were late to normalize, and now,  they have to at least, reach a level of normalization they are comfortable  with, which maybe, the market decide if that's too high, too low, but what  they are comfortable with, and that means high rates.</p><p> LACQUA:  Nikhil, what will be a game-changer for you in the U.S.?  Is it  all to do with monetary policy or does a tax cut for example, repatriation  at 10 percent actually, significantly change the way you look at animal  spirits U.S.?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  I think what would be a game changer if GDP in the U.S. really  dropped, say, below 1 percent, which it doesn't seem at this point, likely.</p><p> LACQUA:  So why would it do that?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Well, because I think people aren't ready for that.  People  are ready -- people accepted a stable one and a half economy, or one and a  half, two.  People are not ready for something that comes closer to the  zero to one, and I think that would surprise people, and that would show  finally that, oh, my god, you know, something is wrong, we're not getting  the growth they want, and I think that the --</p><p> LACQUA:  But you think that's likely, or is --</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  I don't think that's likely.  At today's setting, I don't see  it in the numbers.  I can't say it's going to happen, but I'm saying that's  your risk, you said , what's your biggest risk?  That's my biggest risk, is  GDP falling below expectation.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.  But what would need to happen for that GDP to fall below  expectations?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Just people don't want to buy consumption falls, I mean,  retail spending falls.  I mean, these are, you know, oil prices, you know  the issue.  But again, if oil prices go up significant -- I think oil is in  a good spot, I don't see we're going to $80, but I see oil pretty well-bid  everywhere.</p><p> LACQUA:  When you look at infrastructure plans, again, from the Trump  administration, does -- does filter through GDP?  I mean, it's unclear to  me, even these tax cuts, at this point in the cycle, does it filter through  inflation, or does it -- or does it work on GDP?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  I prefer tax cuts to infrastructure spending.  Infrastructure  spending is a bit like communism, it works well in theory, not always well  in practice.</p><p> LACQUA:  Because of lagging time?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Just wastage, slippage, all kinds of things, you know.  So the  dollar spent on infrastructure doesn't really -- studies have shown  infrastructure doesn't yield as much for GDP as tax cuts do, so if you ask  me which one I'd prefer, I'd prefer tax cuts.</p><p> LACQUA:  What's priced in at the moment in the market?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  I think tax cut, something's -- you -- one, Trump success is  priced in, and I think it's going to be somewhat linked to tax cuts, which  I think is -- is reasonable.  I mean, there may be compromises along the  way between the two parties, but I think that he'll get something, I'll be  surprised if the president doesn't.</p><p> LACQUA:  OK.  Nikhil, when you look at I guess, the composition, you know,  we talked a little bit about around the world, emerging markets, U.S.,  Europe, is it right to think that Europe will outperform the U.S.?  I know  we're starting from the very low base.</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  No, no, for sure.  I have no doubt that the -- Europe will  (inaudible) the U.S. votes in terms of overall growth and also as well,  markets.  I'd rather buy European equities than U.S. equities (inaudible).</p><p> LACQUA:  But equities are exposed globally, so you get, what, you get a  discount because of European (inaudible) you?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  Well, I mean, yes.  I mean, you know, European equities are  both global and low, and I just say, baskets of European stocks are more  appealing, I think you're going to have a looser policy directive from the  ECB, you know, continued loose policy from the ECB, you're going to have  continued loose fiscal from European governments, so Europe looks all  right.  I mean, you know, you can't call the end Europe, yen to Europe just  a year after things have started to really dwell or two years (inaudible) a  lot of the countries.  Germany's been doing well for a long time.</p><p> LACQUA:  It's Europe.  Don't we do that every couple of years that it's the  end of the world, and end of the -- end of the -- the experiment?</p><p> SRINIVASAN:  You know, commentators in this country and the U.S. have been  talking about the end of the experiment for a very long time, ever since  the crisis, right, they've been wrong, and they're going to continue to be  wrong about the end of the experiment, OK?  The question then is, can  Europe outperform?  And Europe's sometimes its own worst enemy.  It was too  late in terms of loosening monetary policy, you've seen the consequences in  Spain yesterday, you know, and so as long as things continue to chug along  and, you know, the French-German relationship could just produce positive  news for Europe.  I think Europe continues to do fine.  I think it's --  it's just -- it's a cottage industry to be negative on Europe all the time.</p><p> LACQUA:  All right, Nikhil, thank you so much for joining us.  We have to  get you back on to talk about Japan as well, that's the only thing we kind  of didn't do in our 60 minutes (inaudible).  Nikhil Srinivasan there from  HPS Investment Partners.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Nikhil manages $42 billion and is the former group chief investment officer at Assicurazioni Generali.  I think it took me at the time, like four years, Nikhil, to get you back on, so I'm glad you're more available to us now, thank you for coming on.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Francine, it's my pleasure.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  And Christian, thank you for -- for coming on as well. first of all, how should investors look at risk Catalonia?  So this is something that was ignored on Friday, and then today, it seems that even spreads between the German and Italian yields are going a little bit crazy.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  You get -- you have to get used to a bit of volatility in this.  I think there's a process, and I think your colleague in Barcelona had some comments.  My point of view, this request constitutional reform, and that'll take a bit of time, and then at some point then, the Catalonians will decide will they want to vote again based on the reform.  So until that happens, that could take several months, it's going to be a bit unsaid, but it's not going to be dramatically bad, I mean, Spanish yields are up seven basis points, and I wouldn't say that's a calamity.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  No, it's not a calamity, but when you look at the ECB and kind of, you know, the fact that they are standing firm, the fact that you see this kind of news, Christian, what does it mean for Spanish GDP overall?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>:  Well, I mean Catalonia as well, very much reported, is 1/5 of the Spanish economy, so it is an important part, but so far, I would actually be of a similar view that, you know, cyclically, Europe looks quite strong right now, you know, and then we have a global recovery that in -- in full swing, we have a synchronized recovery in Europe after, you know, the elections in France which is more of a, you know, real problem early in December or could have been one, and then you had actually, Italy and Spain in particular, cleaning up the bank balance sheet, so now, we have a situation where really, Europe, you know, looks quite good with regard to growth, and I'm not sure whether this -- of course, we have to see how far, you know, this -- this expands now, but this will really be something that will more seriously, fundamentally in a way, derail this recovery that we see in Europe.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Nikhil, you were saying that basically, when you look at the Spanish bonds, they're falling a touch, but it's nothing to (inaudible) about.  Let me bring you over to my chart.  This is -- you see the Spanish bonds compared to the Catalonian bonds.  For our radio listeners, we will push it out on social media.  Any value?  I'm not necessarily talking to you about, you know, Catalonian bonds, but any value in European bonds at the moment?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Sure.  I mean, look, I mean, what is the Catalonian situation?  This is a remnant of the recession, 2008.  You could argue that the central bank in Europe, the ECB, should have reacted faster, they didn't.  You have in equity in Europe, and you see that through the German election, you see that now through the Catalonian failed election or failed independence vote.  I'd say that you have to continue to be loose in Europe in terms of monetary policy, so any tightening, any -- any tapering that the ECB comes up will have to be minor, won't be significant (inaudible), so if spreads blow out a bit -- a bit more, blow out, meaning -- it's a strong word, the spreads widen a bit more, I'd be a buyer.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK.  This is what we're looking at in terms of spreads for example, between the Italian and Spanish 10-year yield. Christian, how should we view the German elections, the fact that actually, Wolfgang Schaeuble, who's an institution, resigned to make place for someone else partly because of this new coalition being formed, and what do you make of the Italian elections?  Is that the biggest risk going forward?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>:  Yes.  I think until maybe, the development of the last few days, we have to maybe reassess how -- how far this constitutional crisis in Spain can go, but so -- until now, we always thought the Italian elections coming sometime early next year, were the biggest remaining risk in Europe.  In -- in Germany, I think, look, Ms. Merkel is clearly weakened, and I think what it -- how it will -- it will affect a little bit, the fact that these markets have developed about a new German-French access and how much Germany would be willing to share risk possibly in, you know, in further integration of the European Union.  On the finance ministry, we will see a different phase.  I doubt that we will see a strong change in policy because the likely new minister from the Free Democrats, FDP will probably not be that different from Schaeuble when it comes to policies and attitudes towards risk sharing.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Nikhil, what would it take for you to buy Italian yields, Italian bonds?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Italian bonds have rallied quite a bit in the last few months.  Now probably, I would like a little bit of a spread blow out again in Italy.  I don't -- I'm not so worried about the Italian election as other people are (inaudible).    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Why not?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Well, Italy has created about a million jobs in the last three years, GDP is running to one and a half as opposed to expectation which is below one.  I think we -- we don't know how the coalition is going to be formed, it's still too early to tell, but I think that things chug along in Italy.  I mean, there are still some long-term -- there are definite long-term concerns, but in the short term, it looks all right, so again, if -- if Italian yields as a -- as a consequence of what's happening in Spain also move out a bit, I'd be a buyer of Italian bonds as well.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Do you think, Nikhil, that Mario Draghi wakes up this morning and looks at these yields and kind of tries to process, you know, what the Catalonia vote and the upcoming Italian elections mean for his policy?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Well, it's not just the Catalonia vote, I think he is already (inaudible) I don't know if he has done it directly, but other people in the ECB have -- have hinted the market, they will be pulling back but not significantly, they've got to do that, pull back but not significantly, because you must remember, and I -- I go back to this, Catalonia, German elections, all this is a consequence of tight monetary policy when they could have loosened, OK?  They took their time to do it.  Now, they've got to take their time to pull back.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK, interesting.  Nikhil and Christian both stay with us.  Christian Keller there and Nikhil, Srinivasan.    </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Well, still with us are Christian Keller from Barclays and Nikhil Srinivasan from HPS Investment Partners.  Thank you both for sticking around.  Christian, let me go to you on Brexit.  What do we know, what do we -- it seems messy, right?  Is this part and parcel of negotiations or is it more messier than needed?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>:  It's unprecedented.  We -- we really have no comparison, right, but I think what is clear that the E.U. was in a -- negotiating from a position of strength, you know, they had no -- you know, they had no reason to really be upfront with, you know, approaching the U.K., they're waiting for the U.K.  I think the speech in Florence was very important.  I think she touched upon all the outstanding issues. Obviously, she couldn't deliver the details yet that some would have wanted, but the -- the reception in a way on the continent I think was -- was positive.  You heard Michel Barnier speaking a few words of English, I think, you know, that is a good sign, and now --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Always a good sign.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>:  And now, I think it's -- it's really up this -- up to do this week because people will watch whether her concept that she alluded to in the Florence speech basically has a strong backing by her own party.  And she must come out of this week in a way as someone who is, you know, sure to be the leader for the coming years, and then I think Brexit could take a more, you know, constructive path than it has maybe over the last past few months.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Christian, when you revise upwards or downwards your economic forecast for the U.K., do you look at BOE or do you look at Brexit talks, or both?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>:  We -- we look more at -- at Brexit talks in the sense that we look at uncertainty and what could happen to investment.  At the moment, you know, we have a U.K. economy that has been much more resilient than people have thought.  And you know, consumption has held up very well, and what we see now is, you know, investment in a way, slowing, and you know, the BOE will be important, they may be hiking, and that has an impact on the -- on consumers who pay mortgages, et cetera, but I think if we have an outlook for Brexit that signal some kind of a certainty, I think that would help the U.K. economy over the medium term significantly.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Have you -- are you a political analyst yet?  You know, forget all this investment stuff.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  I can do politics.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Politics, right.  Do you need to be like a political analyst to try figure out where you put money in the -- in the U.K. or in the U.S., or not?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  No, absolutely.  But I think on Brexit, Christian has all the points right, I don't disagree with anything he said.  My point is that, it's a complex issue, negotiating Brexit.  I think you have to be incrementalist (ph) about it just because the Europeans are and the whole process is.  And don't forget that Britain had about a 15-year up-cycle, barring that '07, '08 situation.  So just from a cyclical point of view, having a slower U.K. is expected, and now, doesn't mean it's going to collapse, I just think they just expect slower growth in the U.K.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  What happens to pound?  And actually, if pound is weaker, does it make, you know, investments more attractive?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Yes, pound was in a 1.20, 1.30 range, it's now broken out to 1.33, 1.34, I think it stays around here, and (inaudible) it pulled back a bit, but I think you've got a sterling which is essentially trying to find a base around 1.30, you know, 1.28, 1.30.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK.  1.28, 1.30.  Christian, first of all, what's your take on -- this is actually one of my favorite charts, and this is U.K. consumer credit, and it's something that I imagine Mark Carney is looking at very closely because of interest rates and the fact that households are so indebted in this country, does this chart worry you?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>:  Well, it is a chart that is important, and I think it is important also because it is behind some of the recent significant change in the attitude of the Bank of England.  And if you go through particularly, what some of the MPC members who are considered to be dovish when they turn around in their view, they highlighted a balance sheet of the households and said, deleveraging of -- of households was over, and they have been leveraging, and this is why they argued for a rate hike because they believed they're now in a situation where households are level again, households are robust enough that they could withstand, you know, some increase in interest rates.  So I think it's a very important chart and one -- one to follow.  Not concerned really, I think, you know, the hikes will be -- we see one hike for now, you know, and I think the Bank of England will -- will act very, very cautiously.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK.  What's your take on -- on euro-pound actually?  So you gave us a level on euro-dollar, is this the most interesting one?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Yes, range bound, just range bound.  Like a lot of currency, I think euro-dollar will be range bound, euro-sterling is range bound, I think you've got -- you got a period of uncertainty, in the U.K. it's Brexit, in Europe now, it's got Spain, Catalonia, et cetera, and of course, ECB policy, so I think between both things, I think you really got a range bound currency across.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK.  Interesting.  I want to talk a little bit more about the global outlook now.  Now, in a new report, Barclays has said U.S. growth remains decent if unexciting, while Europe and Japan have shown further upside.  The bank expects the Fed to hike in December and twice in 2018, while the ECB is likely to taper further next year. Christian, this is your report, what's the most surprising thing in it?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>:  I think the most surprising in it is if you -- if you look at it again, you know, how well global growth is synchronized. And, you know, there's a lot of questions from investors who say, well, is this as good as it gets?  You know, shouldn't one be more cautious now?  You know, things have been going very well in particular, if -- if you look at equity valuation in the U.S.  But we look at the data, and we see a global economy that continues to expand, where U.S. no longer the cyclical leadership, but we get very good data out of -- out of Europe.  Japan's in the economy that has relatively low growth but is running above potential.  We see some of the emerging markets like Russia, Brazil, coming out of deep recessions, and we see a China that you saw it over -- over the weekend, continues to hold up quite well.  Now, this is something we haven't had for 5, 6 years, and it means, global growth running around 4 percent, and if you look at equity earnings, they correlate very well with global growth, and we think that is basically the -- the big story that is still there, and that's why we continue to be quite constructive.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Are -- are you -- are you positive about world growth or is it all based on air?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  This is the first time since 2007 that all -- all economies, 40 plus economies counted by the OECD, are showing positive growth, so I am very comfortable with growth.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  How do you feel with inflation though?  I| mean, there are -- there are still puzzles, right?  And I don't know if it's the Phillips curve being broken or something more sinister out there.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>:  I think, you know, the -- the second part of the surprise is the -- in the data is basically that inflation stays so muted.  The good thing is we are creating drops, so unemployment rates are falling in all the key economies, but we don't have the wage growth.  Now, whether it's something sinister, I think there are several effect at work, one, it does take time.  People are coming back into the labor market, you mentioned Italy earlier.  There are people now coming back who were not in the Labor market, that's where the unemployment doesn't fall, because if the participation rates goes up.  These are good developments, but I think there is something bigger in the background, that's technology, globalization, and that's why Phillips curves no longer work the way they did in the past, and that's something I think central banks have to grapple with because all their models and all their usual actions are based on, you know, the Phillips curve working.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  And Nikhil, do you worry -- I don't know if you worry about inflation or do you just worry that for example, if you look at the most distorted market (inaudible) most probably the bond market, and so as this kind of, you know, gets re-priced, it could lead to further correction (inaudible).    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Yes, let's talk about this -- this inflation and this Fed policy, for example.  Fed policy is all about normalization. I don't think that it really cares much about inflation as normalizing the interest rate situation.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK.  But should they care more about inflation?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Well, they -- they want inflation.  I think everything -- OK, if you look at global, you look at reflationary currencies, Aussie dollar, Canadian dollar, basic materials, copper, aluminum, all are pointing to more inflation, OK?  We haven't seen it in the U.S., we haven't really seen it anywhere in the world right now, but at least --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Except for U.K.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  But things -- if I -- if I look at typical reflationary indicators are all up, but I said, the Feds behavior is about normalizing based on financial stability, it's not really based on well, inflation's going to hit X, and so we've got to do it now. And so the Fed will continue to gradually increase rates, OK?  I think we'll get some inflation, probably get some inflation in Germany, it's been going very strong, probably get some inflation generally, in Europe, probably get some everywhere, but we're not going to get as much as people want, so when you look at yields and you say, OK, well, yields are 10-year U.S. at 2.36 today, where is it going?  Look, it will go higher.  I think all yields were high in the next 12 months.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right.  Guys, thank you so much.  Christian Keller there, head of economic research at Barclays, thank you for your time. And Nikhil Srinivasan stays with us, we'll talk a little bit more about the risks out there, we had great comments from Crispin Odey as well.  We'll talk about regulation and kind of China as well next.    </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Well, still with us, Nikhil Srinivasan, he is from HPS Investment Partners.  Nikhil, when you look at the risks out there, so we had Mr. Odey actually quite bearish overall, right, about his view on the world economy.  What do you see as the biggest risk out there for markets?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  I think the biggest risk, Francine, is complacency. I think people are complacent about the North Korean situation, they're complacent about the Middle East and the Kyrgyzstan independence vote and oil in general, and they're complacent in the U.S. about increased regulation on big Tech.  So I think if you look everywhere, I think the biggest risk is complacency.  People are saying, well, let's just keep going forward.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Why are they complacent?  Is it something to do with algorithms and the way that the markets are actually right at the moment, or is it that it's impossible to, you know, price in Trump's next move, but also you're going to do with North Korea?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Well, it's hard to value the level of risk that I'm talking about.  So given it's hard to value the risk, given there's a lot of liquidity out there, given the Fed's policies, you know, I'd say that people just want to continue doing what they're doing and they've made money doing it, so you can't argue with that, right?  So these are, if you ask me, the biggest risk is complacency because it's not priced in.  Korea, it's not pricing in Korean risk.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  What will it take to be priced in?  I mean, is it kind of a snowball effect?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Well, not necessarily.  For example, if you are in the Big Tech stocks for example, I think they are not people -- they have come off a bit, I mean, they've come off relative to the market. I think people have to get used to the fact that these companies are going to face more of a (inaudible) going forward, but the ownership of these stocks remains extremely robust, and so you haven't seen a real selloff, 10 percent, but you haven't seen a real selloff for these companies yet, that's one thing.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Nikhil, do you worry about -- I mean, I don't know what actually your canary in the coalmine, you know, benchmark is, is there something?  Will it come from China, or is it really impossible to predict?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  China's fine, Francine.  So if you're talking about China, I think people shouldn't worry about China, they --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Not even the debt --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  No, nothing.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  -- and reserves?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Nothing.  I think the currency has shown resilience, currency rallied in the last few weeks.  I think the congress is going to go fine, I think you're going to have a slowdown of growth built in because of supply-side reform so they have -- have kicked in, built in because you have this anti-corruption move which is going to taper off.  I think going into next year in the (inaudible) we see very, very growth -- good growth in China, I am not worried about China at all.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Are you worried about emerging markets and the fact that if Fed normalizes?  It's been telegraphed for about three years, but are you worried about some kind of correction in emerging markets, just (inaudible) you know, technical Fed?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Yes, well, because they -- they rallied a lot, so yes, they could correct.  I mean, certainly, but I think China will continue to go up, and the Chinese market looks pretty good overall. I think all these emerging markets have run up quite a bit, most of them (inaudible).  I would say I'm -- I'm less bearish or less worried about corrections from the oil markets like Russia.  I think Russia has more upside as well.  I think that, you know, you have to take -- take a step back and say, look, are we still looking at the world through the lens of '07, '08?  And every time something happens, we can never tell there's a correction coming, corrections will come. Global economy is growing.  It think the biggest uncertainties are the three things that I mentioned.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK.  But what about politics?  Again, if you look at, you know, people voting in Europe for example, sure, GDP is getting higher, you know, joblessness is going down, but actually, one in 10 people voted for a far right candidate in the -- in Germany, they did the same in France.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Well, there's -- there's economic inequity in Europe, just like it is in another parts of the world.  Like, we saw that in the U.S., we're seeing that here as well, that's going to continue, that's not going away.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Will it get worse?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  I think it's going to get worse.  But it's not going to get substantially worse, it's going to get worse in terms of (inaudible) voting patterns that continue to show people are disgruntled, at least a large or a visible part of the population is disgruntled.  It's -- it's disgruntled here in the U.K., in Germany, in Spain, now you see it, in Italy, everywhere and around the world, so you're going to see that.  you're going to see protest votes gathering pace.  Now, that's going to impact policy, monetary policy, fiscal policy, you're going to see governments having to run deficits. The U.K. government will have to run their deficit.  European governments have to run their deficit.  Even the German government which is -- which is in surplus will incrementally have to increase spending on infrastructure and other things, incrementally, gradually, step by step, German style.  I think everyone has to accept the fact that there are certain people in the population that are not really gaining from what is headline growth.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right, Nikhil, thank you so much.  Nikhil Srinivasan there, chairman international, HPS Investment Partners stays with us.    </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Now, we were just talking with Nikhil Srinivasan, and we have a question from NIB, from a viewer, and this Nikhil is for you. Now, this is a question, we were talking of course, about complacency and the market's complacency, would you say that the complacency originates from the fact that the majority of the disgruntled are not amongst its players?  So actually, does this disgruntlement, Nikhil, then -- then becomes something that we should worry about for markets?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  The question is fair.  I think (inaudible) players is right.  I don't think you have to worry about it is a constant something might happen, but I think it is, the consequence from a policy point of view is governments have to remain relatively loose in the fiscal front, that's it.  And on the monetary side, you have to remain loose as well, so that's not -- you know, tightening's not going t to happen, it can't happen if you want the disgruntled to be feeling better off.  And I don't think any economy in Europe can tighten today, or in the U.S.  I don't think the U.S. can tighten.  In fact, the tax cut plans are all going to be fiscally negative, right? Be expansionary, so no, I think fiscal policy has to remain expansionary.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK.  Which is why you were talking about normalizing, and actually, not tightening.  The dollar has strengthened after reports that President Trump and secretary -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have met with Kevin Warsh to discuss nominating him to succeed Fed chair, Janet Yellen.  Nikhil, again, I guess for you, it doesn't really matter who's in charge next.  I seem to understand about your comments that it will be kind of steady as she goes which is normalizing.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  I think my point about normalizing was less to do with inflation even though inflation is -- is the core of the Fed alongside employment, I'd say it's more to do with normalizing in General, to ensure financial stability.  Ownership of U.S. equities among U.S. households has again, reached a high last seen 10 years ago, and I think the Fed must be concerned, and they must ensure that they don't have any - any accidents down the road, so I think that normalization is far from close.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Ok.  But does it -- it still matters right, if you have someone at the head who's a dove or a hawk, because actually, how you interpret, I mean, you say they shouldn't focus too much on inflation, they just want stability, but so far, inflation has been the cornerstone of how you measure stability.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Yes.  But you see, every time they don't get inflation, they use another measure.  They try and say, well, it's going to come, they could suddenly surprise you.  Look, these are the comments with people who don't see inflation, yet want to raise rates.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK, would you change the mandate?  And if you would change the mandate for the Fed, what would you be looking at?  I mean, you need metric, right, on - on how you look at it, otherwise, it's a free for all.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  I would look -- I mean, I look at something they can't probably include which is capital allocation because when you have a lot of free liquidity you misallocate capital, and that's what's been happening.  You know, certain really been bid up, other things like capital investment has been ignore, so -- but I think you can't really change the mandate, that's not my point.  My point is that, we were late to normalize, and now, they have to at least, reach a level of normalization they are comfortable with, which maybe, the market decide if that's too high, too low, but what they are comfortable with, and that means high rates.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Nikhil, what will be a game-changer for you in the U.S.? Is it all to do with monetary policy or does a tax cut for example, repatriation at 10 percent actually, significantly change the way you look at animal spirits U.S.?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  I think what would be a game changer if GDP in the U.S. really dropped, say, below 1 percent, which it doesn't seem at this point, likely.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  So why would it do that?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Well, because I think people aren't ready for that. People are ready -- people accepted a stable one and a half economy, or one and a half, two.  People are not ready for something that comes closer to the zero to one, and I think that would surprise people, and that would show finally that, oh, my god, you know, something is wrong, we're not getting the growth they want, and I think that the --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But you think that's likely, or is --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  I don't think that's likely.  At today's setting, I don't see it in the numbers.  I can't say it's going to happen, but I'm saying that's your risk, you said , what's your biggest risk? That's my biggest risk, is GDP falling below expectation.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK.  But what would need to happen for that GDP to fall below expectations?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Just people don't want to buy consumption falls, I mean, retail spending falls.  I mean, these are, you know, oil prices, you know the issue.  But again, if oil prices go up significant -- I think oil is in a good spot, I don't see we're going to $80, but I see oil pretty well-bid everywhere.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  When you look at infrastructure plans, again, from the Trump administration, does -- does filter through GDP?  I mean, it's unclear to me, even these tax cuts, at this point in the cycle, does it filter through inflation, or does it -- or does it work on GDP?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  I prefer tax cuts to infrastructure spending. Infrastructure spending is a bit like communism, it works well in theory, not always well in practice.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Because of lagging time?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Just wastage, slippage, all kinds of things, you know.  So the dollar spent on infrastructure doesn't really -- studies have shown infrastructure doesn't yield as much for GDP as tax cuts do, so if you ask me which one I'd prefer, I'd prefer tax cuts.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  What's priced in at the moment in the market?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  I think tax cut, something's -- you -- one, Trump success is priced in, and I think it's going to be somewhat linked to tax cuts, which I think is -- is reasonable.  I mean, there may be compromises along the way between the two parties, but I think that he'll get something, I'll be surprised if the president doesn't.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  OK.  Nikhil, when you look at I guess, the composition, you know, we talked a little bit about around the world, emerging markets, U.S., Europe, is it right to think that Europe will outperform the U.S.?  I know we're starting from the very low base.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  No, no, for sure.  I have no doubt that the -- Europe will (inaudible) the U.S. votes in terms of overall growth and also as well, markets.  I'd rather buy European equities than U.S. equities (inaudible).    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  But equities are exposed globally, so you get, what, you get a discount because of European (inaudible) you?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, yes.  I mean, you know, European equities are both global and low, and I just say, baskets of European stocks are more appealing, I think you're going to have a looser policy directive from the ECB, you know, continued loose policy from the ECB, you're going to have continued loose fiscal from European governments, so Europe looks all right.  I mean, you know, you can't call the end Europe, yen to Europe just a year after things have started to really dwell or two years (inaudible) a lot of the countries.  Germany's been doing well for a long time.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  It's Europe.  Don't we do that every couple of years that it's the end of the world, and end of the -- end of the -- the experiment?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SRINIVASAN</emphasis>:  You know, commentators in this country and the U.S. have been talking about the end of the experiment for a very long time, ever since the crisis, right, they've been wrong, and they're going to continue to be wrong about the end of the experiment, OK? The question then is, can Europe outperform?  And Europe's sometimes its own worst enemy.  It was too late in terms of loosening monetary policy, you've seen the consequences in Spain yesterday, you know, and so as long as things continue to chug along and, you know, the French- German relationship could just produce positive news for Europe.  I think Europe continues to do fine.  I think it's -- it's just -- it's a cottage industry to be negative on Europe all the time.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  All right, Nikhil, thank you so much for joining us.  We have to get you back on to talk about Japan as well, that's the only thing we kind of didn't do in our 60 minutes (inaudible).  Nikhil Srinivasan there from HPS Investment Partners.      </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Her interviews and leaked snippets from her forthcoming memoir clearly show how she is angling to fill that role - and also demonstrate how far she still has to go.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Haley's short stint as U.N. ambassador made her a national Republican heroine. She articulately stood up for U.S. interests in calling out North Korea's vicious dictatorship and unreservedly backed Israel, such when she vetoed an Egyptian-sponsored resolution about Jerusalem's status. Haley artfully used her position to make people notice her. She now regularly receives awards from institutions such as the Manhattan Institute and American Enterprise Institute that bestow prestige and approval on potential Republican candidates, occasions that also serve to introduce her to these organization's well-heeled donors.</p><p>The release of her new book, \"With All Due Respect,\" shows the Haley marketing machine in action. The choice of title is intended to emphasize Haley's reputation as a woman who knows how to stand her ground and won't give way to men who try to intimidate her. It is drawn from her retort - \"with all due respect, I don't get confused\" - when an administration official suggested she was out of the loop or befuddled when she made a public statement about President Trump's position on Russia sanctions that the president had abandoned without informing her.</p><p>Even more importantly, Haley's book provides a sense of her political strategy. She states that former secretary of state Rex Tillerson and former White House chief of staff John F. Kelly tried to enlist her in a scheme to oppose Trump within the White House to \"save the country.\" By refusing to go along, Haley both demonstrates her loyalty to Trump and her own independence of thought. This signals to Republicans that Haley is capable of steering an independent course without stabbing Trump in the back, a quality that would help her build the next version of the party without alienating Trump's die-hard base.</p><p>That might be right, but the Republican world is changing fast. Trump started a number of debates within the GOP about the role of government power in domestic affairs and the limitations of government power in foreign affairs. Haley's recent forays don't clarify where she comes down on those questions, but to compete she's going to have to explain where she stands more clearly; her potential rivals are already placing their chits.</p><p>Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) gave a fascinating speech last week at Catholic University in which he outlined a vision for a capitalism that does more for labor and less for owners than a typical Republican might advocate. Rubio has spent the past year positioning himself as someone who would reform capitalism so that business more effectively serves U.S. workers and the national interest, regularly criticizing stock buybacks, for example. His stance has earned him criticism from the high priests of GOP economic orthodoxy, the members of the Wall Street Journal editorial page. But as the 2016 primary showed, Republican primary voters do not always heed that doctrine.</p><p>Rubio is also a foreign policy leader in his own right. He considers China to be a malign influence with a clear and dangerous strategy for global domination. His calls for economic confrontation with the communist power, and for a national economic strategy to combat it, is an original approach that goes far beyond what other Republicans have suggested.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) strikes similar themes on the economy, and he also has emerged as a leading critic of social media firms and Big Tech, calling for their regulation to avoid screen addiction and their use of private power to suppress free speech. Hawley has struck a chord with many Republican voters fearful that Google and Facebook will prevent conservative groups and individuals from using the powerful platforms to advance their views.</p><p>Haley's choice to play it safe makes sense for now. As a former administration official, she is more constrained in differing from Trump lest her disagreements be construed as an attack. But as she revels in the attention, she needs to keep people such as Rubio and Hawley firmly in her view. Eventually she's going to have to chart her own path. And if that path is simply a recitation of the pre-Trump GOP consensus, she'll likely find her star fading while her more adventurous competitors rise.</p><p>             Read more:          </p><p>             Paul Waldman: Nikki Haley's shrewd new memoir shows how Republicans will navigate the post-Trump era          </p><p>             Kathleen Parker: Nikki Haley's comet has a long tail          </p><p>             Paul Waldman: Nikki Haley somehow avoided public humiliation and legal jeopardy          </p><p>             Nikki Haley: When I challenge the president, I do it directly.

The heads of the intelligence agencies - the FBI and the Departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security - joined together to affirm that Russia, China, Iran and other enemies of the United States will seek to interfere in the 2020 election. And with a year before the vote, Congress has done little to act.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the first time in American history, social media is an election issue. Its influence on our democratic process was thrust into the spotlight after Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election exploded into public consciousness, followed by the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a parade of data breaches, privacy concerns and ongoing manipulative business and advertising practices that leave American discourse more vulnerable than ever before.</p><p> As Twitter and Facebook hash out their political ad policies ahead of the 2020 vote, Democratic presidential candidates have seized on the issue. Most of the candidates have dealt in platitudes and left it at that: Do they support \"breaking up\" Big Tech? Would they encourage President Donald Trump's expulsion from Twitter?</p><p> Yet there is one who has championed a more nuanced approach to social media policy: Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.</p><p> Klobuchar is a co-sponsor of the Honest Ads Act, a pragmatic bill that, if passed, could begin a real discussion of social media regulation and its role in our fight against online influence campaigns. The legislation would require disclosure on online political ads so that voters can understand who is targeting them, why they were targeted and how much an advertiser spent to do so.</p><p> The bill has bipartisan support; its first incarnation was co-sponsored with Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., and the late John McCain, R-Ariz. This year, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.. joined Klobuchar and Warner. Despite this bipartisanship, and despite passing in the House as part of the Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act , the bill has never received so much as a markup in the Rules Committee. Along with a group of other bills that aim to update voting infrastructure and otherwise protect the democratic process, it is currently trapped in legislative purgatory.</p><p> Congressional inaction on Honest Ads is even more inexplicable given that social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, have begun to voluntarily comply with portions of the bill. They could - as Honest Ads would require them to - go farther. Facebook's ad library, for instance, reveals only the ages, genders and geographical data of those targeted by political advertisers, though its platform is capable of targeting at a much more granular level. It's this information - whether users were targeted by interest or affinity groups, for example - that would be most useful for researchers identifying disinformation campaigns, which typically exploit societal fissures. The passage of Honest Ads into law would hold social media companies and advertisers accountable for lax enforcement or for skirting the rules. It would also act as a deterrent. Currently, Congress can only send sternly worded letters to social media platforms when they slip up. That does little to encourage compliance - and even less to deter foreign interference.</p><p> Advertising transparency is only part of the solution to the problem of online influence, however, and Klobuchar recognizes that. She has introduced legislation to protect users' privacy online and obtain their informed consent for the use of their data, allowing them to opt out of targeted advertising. She has worked to ensure that online disinformation does not lead to voter suppression. And given that the most successful Russian content in 2016 was amplified organically, without the purchase of a single ad, she is leading a push to empower American citizens through digital citizenship and media literacy programs in schools, thus helping future generations to act more quickly to recognize the tactics of online manipulation.</p><p> None of these bills have been passed, or even made it out of committee. As for Honest Ads, Klobuchar pleaded with her fellow senators for unanimous consent on the bill in October. Online political advertising has \"no rules of the road,\" she told the Senate. \"It is not only unfair, but it is criminal if this continues. It is so easy to do. This is something we could fix right away.\"</p><p> Her motion was denied. The bill, like its siblings, languishes in committee. Klobuchar's nuanced, common-sense proposals are aired only in 90-second, general talking points on the Democratic debate stage, almost invariably overpowered by bolder pronouncements. It's America's loss. Where we ought to be leading on addressing disinformation, we are lagging. Addressing online influence campaigns shouldn't be an issue that concerns only the Democratic Party, but democracy overall.</p><p> Jankowicz is the disinformation fellow at the Wilson Center and the author of the forthcoming book \"How to Lose the Information War: Russia, Fake News and the Future of Conflict</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIA-2536001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289BD037F88F6F NWBKIA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFY-KC21-DXVP-V2K9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Tribune, Stephens Media, LLC, d/b/a The Tribune<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Because the deal had been headed in this direction for some time, the news should not come as a shock. </p><p>Had the deal come to fruition, however, it would have translated into huge gains for Yahoo's bottom line.Although Yahoo has faced a major setback, all is not lost.A Google Of A Would-Be DealTo many, the Googledeal was far from the best option for Yahoo because it would have required Yahoo to surrender control to its biggest competitor. At the same time, to keep regulators happy, Yahoo would be required to maintain its own search engine technology and cost base. A deal with Microsoft(Nasdaq: MSFT ), on the other hand - or better yet, a sale of the business to the software giant - would eliminate these costs completely and create more value for shareholders. (Find out the strategies corporations use to protect themselves from unwanted acquisitions by reading  Corporate Takeover Defense: A Shareholder's Perspective .)With Google's exit, Yahoo could push harder for a deal with Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) for its AOL internet unit. However, this alternative is highly unlikely because Yahoo would have to employ shares to make a purchase. Sure, Time Warner would love to unload AOL onto a willing buyer. But with more than $37 billion in long-term debt, Time Warner would prefer cash over shares as payment. Time Warner is better off holding onto AOL and its rich, albeit rapidly dwindling,  revenues  and cash flow.A Window Into Microsoft's Online Soul?Microsoft CEO <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Ballmer </emphasis>now dismisses the idea of acquiring Yahoo But that doesn't change the fact that Microsoftneeds Yahoo. Despite heavy investment in research and development, none of Microsoft's online initiatives have gained much traction.  Losses  at the software giant's online services business continue to grow. Therefore, Yahoo could provide the online service platform that Microsoftsorely needs.While Ballmer's recent statements rule out the possibility of a full-blown acquisition, no factors would prevent other Microsoft-Yahoo combinations. The two companies could reach a deal that mirrors the proposed search engine partnership with Google. Or, even better, Microsoftcould trade its online business for a stake in Yahoo.Popular And Cash HappyIn any case, Yahoo is not likely to plunge suddenly into the red or shrivel up and die.  The company has $3.3 billion in  cash  and short-term marketable securities as well as zero  debt . Further, it is anticipated that Yahoo will generate $1 billion in  free cash flow  this year. Although its cash flow number is down from the $1.4 billion it saw in 2008, $1 billion is still a hefty sum. Yahoo's portals attract over 500 million users per month and saw an increase of 17% in page views during the third quarter, over the same period last year. Even if Yahoo gets hit hard by the economic downturn, the popular online destination still possesses enormous brand value - something that could be exploited successfully by a big tech company.
