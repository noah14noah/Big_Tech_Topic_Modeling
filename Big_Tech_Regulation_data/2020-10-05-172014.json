for remain has been going through current EU rules and regulations with politicians from other parties to see what red tape could be Jes\u00fas and by consensus I do think that over time there will be opportunities for adjusting somewhat the way in which we do certain kinds of things which may cumulatively incrementally come to matter but I think beyond that actually the main challenge with the face of the same ones that we face now and the main challenges the field regulation not actually about the regulations themselves actually about the extent to which first ball we enforce regulations in an intelligent as opposed to an intelligent way and secondly the extent to which over time he said resorting to regulation as the solution to a particular problems we resort instead more intelligent and emotionally intelligent ways of persuading people to do the things that we think it's safer society they should do which is of course where the whole question of margin behavioural science comes in so you don't think there are huge swathes of regulation or rules that could be through own out the window post-Brexit no word Ida the kind of change that one can make our game to be evolutionary and incremental not massive thumbs up but that it come we aim a little higher David help turn of the behavioural insights team is an expert on behavioural science and has worked at the heart of Whitehall quite often what happens to you when you get to regulatory matters it is presumed you have long Labour discussion and negotiation and eventually settle on a single solution whereas quite often we don't really know where that solution will in fact be affected and it seems very strange thing for Parliament they instead of shooting one law we should introduce more than one variation of this figure out which is more effective might sound crazy but it might actually lead to better kind of outcomes I get a trivial example where was the right food labels a classic regulatory solution which numbers from inside the box mostly would read any of them we have done that work to test for more effective and particularly to go to traffic lights that she does a fork collar works even better in every colour the moment is quite complicated thing to do because you end up in infraction in terms of Italian olive growers saying wait a minute it looks like we get ready we are happy with that it does open some new choices and might sometimes not be a formal regulatory approach to can achieve equivalents in some other way if one think again about Brexit is we became more empirical experimental we spread that will be a very good development things to different parts of the country I am now back in London in the heart of the city the engine of the British economy as financier see it but any programme on the future of Britain has to take very seriously what the city says It's the beating heart of global finance standing outside the Royal exchange where it all began in the 16th century during the referendum campaign much of the city was for remain faring Brexit would cost London its global League of late I have to say I've detected a shift and a new confidence that the city can continue to prosper now let's go inside the cafe of the Royal exchange to meet Gerard Lions he voted to leave And even founded economists for Brexit I want to ask him can the city do well after we leave the EU might even be an opportunity for the city of London to do more for British business outside the capital probably the most interesting and positive aspect for the city since referendums the fact that so many of the big tech companies decided to go ahead or continue with their large-scale investment in London because of finance and technology becoming very intertwined and now there's a great recognition across the globe that outside of Silicon Valley London is becoming the tech centre I think London is in a very positive position the way I would describe been in the EU was it was like walking the wrong way on an escalator this changing global economy but technology networks and globalisation so much growth coming from across the rest of world was in contrast to the EU which almost wanted to go the other way regulating controlling centralising away from the city in the broader economy you really think that there is the duty and responsibility post Brexit to give back something to some of those areas that voted leave to really change policy shift things that direction in favour of non London UK I think we need to face the reality of the situation the UK is a very imbalanced economy that was highlighted at the time the global financial crisis London and the south-east is probably the most competitive region by a long way off the whole of Western Europe at the same time we have some very under performing regions Northern Ireland West Wales and the valleys Cornwell said

companies have a voice technology they are the genuine ones you think because I'm thinking earlier this year the commercial Radio sector here in the UK route to the government to make the point that although they have free access to smart speakers at the moment it might need it might need legislation to ensure that we continue to remain the case and in the future when we say is well aware we have these emerging technology cent and voices a really good example of the big tech companies own point interaction with the customer with the audience I think that's just part and parcel of how the technology is available any brand he is interacting with these speakers is that the gases cut the price of maintaining access at the moment part of this is like a means not just about the companies also the nature of this technology like Alexa is conceived as this kind of anthropomorphic entity hate like you have a relationship and that is the nature of talking you don't talk to abstract brand you talk to things that can talk he can talk back and I think this will cover and that would have been covering this because I think this is potentially a really big issue coming up if you for example there is a dystopian possibility that you talk to a large corporate and that controls coalition everything I think we'll end up there but you know that we have to be mindful of like you know who you're talking to who owns a relationship and what is driving that relationship is it's commercially driven is driven for public service when is appropriate when is not appropriate those things that as a society is something we should start to be aware of I think that's surely some of the concerns that people have about being listened to are entirely justified because they what we say is being recorded and processed outside of that device and Secondly in some circumstances is being listened to by human engineers and human contract is often not even employed by the company said although you know we could be talking typing it in the case of voice there is sometimes a human on the other side was listening to what we've set I think people really do care in the research we did showed that people 25 27% of people won't use smart speaker for a financial transaction because they are worried about they security and potential hacking and I think that we've seen this technology really grow very quickly over the last few years and many ways of regulations and matches as a customer as and citizens we're all just starting to catch up with some of the implications of that and I think that we are all becoming much more conscious about the value of information about the value of our personal data and and how it's being used and whether or not we're comfortable with fat whether were comfortable with what we get in return for sharing that data whether or not companies looking after that data as well as we would like them to say this is really rising up the agenda I think it's great that it's becoming a topic of public debate I would like to see more and more people become very familiar with some of the ways which data is being used for us to talk about it more and in many ways I think the growth of spot smart speakers and his voice Channel is really raising even further in terms of profile and up the agenda of public debate which is really important there is more regulation inevitable then D D ahead say I just hope that we get this right we look at regulation we educate around privacy because even with smart because that's a huge amount you can do to limit how your data is used and how it is collected and so on and so forth but unless people Ta always empowered to make those decisions its mute points I hope that Khan's like I said before there is this tipping point of convenience where actually we just ditching what it's just so helpful to have in the home or have your hands in the inner and smarts in a smartphone that actually we get that right now to McCaw's points the evolution of the mobile payments technology is a really good parallel for this actually because when it was first introduced lots of trust issues that limited adoption and it's only really one for and certainly I can say from my perspective is once you feel assured that your money in this particular case is safe and it's become is become widespread enough that you can trust that this works and and frankly it is so convenient I'm comfortable start adopting it yet at scale and I think it is the same with with voice and smart speakers us I think and the BBC we want to play our part and when when television invented wasn't clear it would be used for the be a space for impartial news full and it is important that we help develop that and I think here to win we want to make sure that</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

chapter people download is a huge market you've got access to the cost of your own apart from that cut of all sales you make so Shona Andes think that AppleGoogle will ever budge on this I think it depends on us that it can Korol a group of other big-name developers which apparently is trying to do in the background so if you can get epic Spotify that the company behind Tendo which has also complained about a 30% fee if you can get a bunch of big developers to Queen of Sletten the status of the popular apps in the app store that begins to look a little more challenging for Apple who at the moment the balance of power is very much with Apple do it they can say we've got all these other games gold these apps we need you actually get a bunch of high-profile about saying we're not happy it but then begins to threaten Apple's power because the app store is obviously reliant on having big developers making apps for them say Think epic by itself will be will be challenged to alter the status quo if but I think if you if it manages to get a bunch of of big-name allies get political support on-side as well in the us a lot of appetite for antitrust regulations the moment politically and maybe have a chance of reducing the cart perhaps interesting times ahead lots and lots and lots of money at stake here Thanks very much for coming on to talk to us all over one of the very few games makers brave enough to come on and talk to us about these issues which again shows perhaps the power of these platforms so move on now to find light which is just this amazing bit of research from Nikita Argo while from University of Oxford and co-author of a study called what Facebook goes down ethical and legal considerations for the demise of big tech obviously talking about the way that big Tech's a big part of our lives and some of us are reliant on it including businesses Nikita Mark Zuckerberg was up before Congress the summer as well the CEO of AppleAmazon and Google all part of this and just hearing which would talk about has been some discussion the us about possibly breaking Facebook cut into small pieces but I've not heard anyone talking about what actually happened if it closed altogether what made you think about the demise of Facebook your research Yeah so are we treat this sort of thought experiment and through that to experiment and try to understand what impact the spec cars and our society and we ask that question you know what would happen if Facebook went away and our analysis led us to as you see in the paper a kind of picture of this company that is systemically important in our society whether we want it or not that breaking up might not be the only thing we can do it if at all and instead we might need to start thinking of them as more infrastructural goods public utilities need to be regulated in that way Yeah these ideas are generated quite a lot of attention in the media some newspapers rated up with headline suggesting that Facebook was too big to fail which obviously allude to the banking crisis I know you didn't like the headline Did you know why it is important to you that this is not your conclusion most important to emphasise that too big to fail is a public statement It's not saying that these companies in our case Facebook granted as any the big banks are too big to fail and therefore should be protected at all costs what we are saying is that we need to acknowledge this systemic and and interconnectedness and scale of these companies and think of ways to mitigate the fallout where the company to fail in an addition to find ways to and add it to prevent companies are becoming bigger and that for these these consequences of failure is becoming more catastrophic the show Shane of obviously Facebook is way more than a social network now was and how deeply embedded is in modern society not only in the Western world around the world clearly Facebook is trying to access different markets for example in India it it tried to sort of Bella some of the gate by a little bit like in the West Google us for many people a gateway to the internet as the primary way you access the internet through Google search engine and Facebook I wanted to do something similar work kind of had a portal that was that was free net it it meant free internet access for poor communities in India have rebelled and through Facebook out and now Facebook trying again to a partnership with local operator called Geo again in Africa it's doing something something similar were trying to sow Bennett suffers as the gateway and and so yes I think for this community you could argue Facebook but to disappear completely Yes you may see reduced access to the internet in the West you know we're all pretty reliant on WhatsApp I am there are other messaging services bee Gees but it would be it would be pretty uncomfortable or what some might disappear tomorrow having said that I think there are other companies that that may be more and better infrastructure go show how powerful all these companies become exposed what goes across all the stories talked about this week is the way that these companies have built up to be such a high status in our lives now kind of the regulation is only Starting to have to potentially catch up with them very sadly that is all we have time for this week</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

said they are willing to re-start Dean nuclear eyes Asian talks with Washington our correspondent Laura Bicker told us more these were two unidentified short range projectiles film Colin the missiles at this time it were fired from get John City in South Pyongan province they were fired eastwards for about 130 kilometres and landed in the Sea of Japan there are still analysing the launch but they have said certainly South Korean military saying that this is a strong concern and are urging North Korea to stop these kinds of threats on the Korean peninsula now the timing is interesting isn't it because it is just hours after Pyongyang said it was willing to resume its denuclearisation talks we got a surprise statement from Pyongyang from the vice foreign minister chest increase his said that North Korea was willing to resume talks with the United States now we wondered whether Renaud Pyongyang was good to issue a statement of this kind in the near future we know all that North Korea has issued a deadline to the United States they want a deal by the end of this year or the sea will choose a new path what a new path interiors were not quite sure so here we have an offer of talks but it is a condition North Korea is saying that it will speak it will talk in late September at a time and Cleese agreed between both sides but it has urged Washington presents a new approach a new deal or it says the talks could fall apart again as for where those talks could take place as a lot of speculation here and saw all the timing is interesting because we're September is around the same time as

ultimately end up Stifling competition in makes it really difficult for other people to train get the staff seen by people who make Google searches Google say said that it is going to co-operate with any kind of investigations and it is open to answering these questions by regulators and anybody else who wants to have a better understanding of these practices that said of course they are in denial that they do anything of that sort you mentioned that the Democrats and Republicans are both involved in this investigation this is just one of a number of challenges is it too big technology firms absolutely so we have this particular investigation that was announced and then last week in new York with state officials there have launched an investigation into the business practices of Facebook and whether they also stifle competition and made it more expensive for advertisers and the Department of justice here in the United States continues its investigation into all of these big tech

opportunity for this year's and it requires that community of scientists at the us to make sure that that doesn't happen Dr Rima know from the University of California with an example of the precision and reliability of a computer program and that TSB Campion Berlin there's a lot to be said for those qualities is that what is a really important part Here's what the physician talked about it when she said that there needs to be a corporation between the technological system and the physician in that case because people need to be trained to work With these systems because we all saw how of example it's lit same oncology where a machine learning system was a lot worse at detecting a skin cancer in people of colour than white people because training data said was not a good training dataset for these purposes but in general you know what we have to be aware of is out the experts working with these systems need to be aware of what they're working with because they are going to be the ones who are calling the shots in the end and there is the shining example from that position Rachel Thomas the key is to have a skilled people working with the algorithms controlling them and manipulating Yes I think it's very important to think about how this you made any algorithm worked together issue that arises is people talk about algorithmic systems is that they just plug and play your changeable with humans even know they used very differently in practice and remind you listening to the real story from the BBC world service with me Paul Henley and this week we're looking at whether you're a slave to the algorithm to what extent the calculations been made about you by artificial intelligence governing the course of your life Let's look at that explosion of data on you as an individual that is now available Hall thing It's fuelled algorithms in the recent past so much more is available before is that the case saying well they are obviously very much more than before there's no question about that but what sort of talk about that positive example because it's very telling Ryan you have a case in which the data about you is being used for a year for your good with your knowledge with the human in the loop so to speak our the concern is that we have so many cases where algorithms almost designed to work against us It's to weed Assad It's nice just to buy something we might not want to be managed that way for that could cause a crisis here we have put in technology and because of lack of regulation or oversight is being used in so many areas without us having a say in how it's used and that rather then how fast spreading is the core problem Abbey sure how do the big tech companies get hold of our data if you're not a fiend on social media is that much about you can find out its them a lot of different things and if you look at what the city of Bristol was doing right now Bristol has but artificial intelligence from IBM and it is using this AI to skim through government databases and look at things like substance abuse work history criminal record other datasets and based on that its identify people who may need help from health care services and police so of it depends on the geographical region depends on company but usually it's either government's supplying the state or its social media internet footprint digital footprint those two were the main data sets that companies are for accessing but an online shopping sites has your preferences and and your tastes in in what you buy it when that information go to whom do they pay for it or that's a big question Mark in front of tech firms It's a big challenge that public policy and government relations teams in these tech firms are trying to address which is how we show the the irresponsibly who should have access to it how much transparency should there be what should we do if there is a data breach we inform the public just a few years ago there was a huge controversy because Kompany got hacked huge amount of data was exposed but the company never informed its users about if I may add one thing because people might be thinking I haven't Is closed a lot about myself on social media there for there's that much but that's underestimating what these algorithms can do for example if a post on Instagram just the colour scheme in your photos can apparently be used by machine-learning algorithms to predict your depression likelihood euro Africa Yes your email frequency you're fit it health stayed words

comfortable knowing that they're the first person to talk to your child about it we I'm a parent I have a ten-year-old and with 10 year old dust thirteen-year-old I'm quite well aware of the kind of things I'm happy talking about the kind of things do you want other people talking about it so we just we just pile little bit of a kind of sensible common-sense editorial judgement we do have a survey running at the moment that's open to subscribers the adult subscribers to the magazine for the children actually everything we think it seems to be reflected in La one of the questions we have is about the sort of subjects happy for us to write about the kind of things that they rather we didn't so Yeah I think who says Catherine year I spent years in an industry where there's been so much talk about young people don't care business model is in decline he got a specialist publication is printed publication is targeting young people and is growing speculation I think it sounds absolutely fabulous I was saying before we came in here I'm delighted I didn't know it exists I'm delighted that it doesn't I'll certainly be buying for my children when they are older old enough to read and on this I think that is very far to know I think stick that when you ask the question about it is playing into parents fears about screen time I actually feel like it it's less a tug between in the written word screen time more tug between them kind of it and I pop if not horses content good quality Into the junk content that it is our talk about Roger she can we will move onto talking in a second Let's get up-to-date with some other media Turkish news It's in the m in the News today because the government commissioned Jason Furman former economic adviser to Barack Obama to lead this review into competition in the tech sector this we have heard some of it published them talk about the News today he wants a code of conduct for tech giants which is vaguely familiar idea now he wants tougher enforcement of competition rules anyone consumers be given more control over their data this really looking at stories like Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram after felled by Snapchat that Labour I had this thought we've heard a lot this before many many times do you think he's changed I do actually I think there have been a string of reviews and com similar conclusions but I think in the each one makes it more likely that this will finally happen becoming very very hard to ignore and Professor firm came to the same conclusion the decaying course of the day before and Jeremy Wright said that's actually there needs to be proper competition markets authority investigation into the digital ad market and that needs to be a wholesale change of competition rules to take account not only of the size of these companies when they buy each other but also the kind of doors they're shutting off the were saying Philip Hammond I think in the end the charts I am 3 statement said the key thing in doorstep idea of a review of the dish as market the other thing this around of course is this much heralded paper on online harm so look these reviews the governor says up you this is a long way with its came across review this one by Jason Furman next week maybe could end up being a week after their is will finally be a government paper on online harm is nice to hear what clear online Hamis but it could include things like Images of self harm or DEET behaviour do have a sense that at a loss whether it's through a new regulator of net whatever might be that we are moving to a new relationship between government and the technology companies in this country I think we have already moved to that I think that when this white paper was first conceived actually the government was very reluctant to legislate and they in 10 years warning that they might do something without actually doing anything whereas now there have been certain Casilla catalyst Sadly like Molly us all and he ought to know who died after seeing Images of men grabbed indeed I think that really crystallised momentum Thank made it impossible for the government to do anything but introduce some at least some laws that all genuinely change behaviour I also think that tech companies have assigned feel the backlash they may still be worth a gargantuan sums of money and they may still have huge numbers of users but there is a really growing sense that they are bad for you I think I think is really interesting question as well and is developing in this debate about how we regulate big tech which is the best way of doing it and there are some important philosophical differences says Firmin review that's really taken a very sort of competition based approach Let's get more rivals in the market Let's have a competition</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

awarded billions of pounds worth of contracts to supply personal protective equipment at the height of the pandemic when global PP supplies became scarce team was fond of Whitehall to try to ensure frontline workers receive the equipment they needed the public accounts committee will consider whether there was adequate transparency and value for money more details from our political correspondent Alex Forsyth at the height of the pandemic global demand for PP skyrocketed the government's usual supply chains largely from China with hugely disrupted as pressure from the NHS frontline group the government asked British business to step up and help source or supply PP ram fame manufacturer in the West Midlands was one such firm in 10 days they turn a derelict site into a factory making 3 million face Pfizer's a week Timothy McQueen is the sales director this project alone has created 500 new jobs this is empty 8 weeks ago and look at it today producing this year inspiring ramp fame praised the government's approach saying it delivered vital kit at a crucial time contracts totalling billions of pounds were issued to around 175 Kompany's some were established manufacturers or suppliers of medical equipment but others seemingly had little experience now some government decisions are subject to a legal challenge by the good law project and the public accounts committee has said it will look into the process by which contracts were awarded in the autumn the Labour MP Meg Hillier chairs the committee we're very concerned about the general lack of focus when you are dealing with something at this pace almost inevitably there will be some attempt at forward the key thing is they will be looking at whether government have mechanisms in place to prevent that and crucially to prevent the wrong equipment and not proper equipment being delivered to the front line there was no prerequisite for firms which won contracts to have previous experience in PPE supply the point was to find new sources in a statement the government said over 2.4 billion items have been delivered with billions more in order to ensure a continuous supply a spokesman said there was a robust process in place to ensure orders were high quality and met strict safety standards with due diligence undertaken on all government contracts the national trust has announced 1200 job losses as it expects to lose up to 200 million \u00a3 this year as a result of the pandemic the charity's director general Hillary McGrady said the lockdown coupled with the longer term

a distinct profile in a specific market the antitrust issues they face are complex and different and each tech titan has his own approached but all will argue that they face plenty of competition and that they are good for America that they built their success the American way and continue to encourage us innovation what Congress has to decide is whether new anti-trust laws are needed to oversee the tech giant's or whether the old ones are good enough today's hearing may not clinched the argument either way no doubt there will be plenty of political theatre but the spectacle of a joint

companies was meant to delve into that Democrat David Sicilian asked if Amazon used its vast amounts of data to unfairly pushed out competitors selling through its store you're saying you use that in any way to promote Amazon products me to have my you're under oath Yes Thank you for your question we we used data to serve our customers and we don't use individual seller dated to directly compete with them the committee However failed to land any hard punches on the firm's reining in big Tech's one of the few by Partizan goals left in Washington but we still see little clarity on how lawmakers planned to take things forward and what they hope will achieve Dave leave their in Washington on the continuing stand-off between lawmakers and big tech how much is actually matter well or follow our markets guest this morning she's fund manager at global equity income and James Henderson investors good morning to you good morning interesting this is a great drama get the popcorn out and sit back and watch but does it really matter to investors the share price and to be honest I don't think it matters too much for Facebook investors at the moment this is not even going to be launched if it does launch next year is not a big part of the investment case at the moment this would be if it did come through really an upside case for between 5 10 years time not within the next few years a meantime we have got surgeries ministers discussing the future big tech and taxes that more of a concern Yes that definite I think generally tech regulation in general would be much more of a concern for tech investors at the moment I think there is a growing consensus that regulation has been a bit lax in the last few years given how big the likes of AmazonGoogleFacebook have become that on both sides of the Atlantic people thinking that regulation will be stepped up Meanwhile back here Sterling 27 month lows yesterday on fears of a Brexit no deal how much further because to go with Yes he is big news in the market yesterday it was why the shape of the market was as it was in the city 100 was up because Sterling was down that's not a coincidence it's the big international earners the likes of GlaxoSmithKline British American tobacco they were up yesterday I think generally the perception is that if we do head towards no deal analysts often talk about parity with the dollar that assesses the one 24 it is at the moment as you say this is already about a two-year low and Cif parity would be at a very extreme reaction and that is what analysts tend to talk about it if Brexit is off the table people tend to think of as game that for average versus the dollar which is about one 50 and parity in a worst case scenario for exchange and often get it wrong but the charity Would have pretty severe real world effect wouldn't huge effect if you think about the effect on consumer going abroad holidays be a lot more expensive or here in the UK in a lot of domestic companies need to import a lot of their raw materials they become a lot more expensive those costs would ultimately be passed onto consumers would have effect on inflation in the UK so this is not just about the stock market that FX has a genuine real world effect that would be a real pay cut for people in reality if we did go to acting now because inflation data out in the next couple of hours later this month will be interesting to watch but in the meantime more for the markets to gaze at Christine Lagarde confirming that she is stepping down from top job at the IMF that surprising timing perhaps but it's fire the starting gun on the race to replace the exact is the ratings been out who can replace her the IMF and one of the names being talked about is possibly Mark Carney traditionally the IMF has been sent had always by European Mark Carney the Canadian but he does have British Irish passports which to put him forward for the job effectively he is one of a long list of people are speculating Yes Andrew is also the CV being dusted off at the moment we saw how Christine Lagarde play that role doing great crisis for example but how much does this job matter economy and we have got a nice flat of traders for example does it really matter of them matters a lot not necessarily for if you are if you're investing in developed markets maybe the UK US it possibly doesn't matter too much it definitely does matter if you're an emerging markets investor it the IMF played a huge role in Argentina last year I think widely perceived done quite a good job there so far they gave him a decent amount of money they have since followed up on that I think it does matter in context if you if you are an emerging market investors think it matters that there is this IMF but stop there effectively and this is going on of course the US earnings season is not quite the unfolding in the background bank earnings in the spotlight particularly with the spectre of low interest rates

a lot of these applications start with a medical problem ADHD in children or prostate takes further for people who lost the use of Lim threw a stroke or something like that but when you're talking about enhancing the ability to bring to recover from that or enhance concentration law or focusing power of the mind a little tweak to help do that now that's great for somebody suffering from a condition but if you're applying to ordinary people to to healthy volunteers you can quickly see how you might get a situation where people were able to think just a little bit sharper that little they had that little bit better capacity in their memory that sort of thing now once you begin to to bring that out into wider society why wouldn't people want to be the best they can be an ethical concerns really I suppose are about whether you're gonna see these things can be expensive there's no two ways about it are you going to see this one group of people move away from ordinary people because they have enhanced capacity empower done with that enhanced capacity for o'clock this morning with a report on the patter of little bit later on here from the lead author from the Royal society the he is 16 minutes past 6 does Google has too much power in the world of online advertising that's the question American lawmakers are asking his dominant with that and the rest of the business News Yes the attorney general's 48 of America's 50 states have become a joint investigation Google's power according to the latest industry figures these ones searches overnight from eMarketer Google takes 37% of online ads in the United States its market share with 48 billion $ a year the investigation simply with Google was too dominant and crowding out competitors Samira Hussain BBC business reporter new York filed this report this really happens these days in Washington DC people from both sides of the political aisle working together but togethers state officials stood on the steps of the Supreme court announcing an antitrust investigation into the internet giant Google today 50 attorney general also Republican and Democrat mayor and women black white and Hispanic from different states and territories are staying together as one team investigate Nation into a good horse potential monopolistic behaviour while Democrats and Republicans may be from different parties we will have a comment and and that is we are charged with the responsibility to protect the American consumer from this on where the search engine giant or not this is not a total jerk to the opposite this is actually for the benefit of the tech ecosystem to help level the playing field the tech playing field is currently dominated by for companies AppleAmazonGoogle and

regulate more in the space do you come up with new tools for digital market that actually expand opportunities for competition I believe that's probably where we're headed and trust will not be enough in a blog post published last week Google acknowledged it had received requests for information from the Department of justice about its business practices and Google went on to say that it has always worked constructively with regulators and will continue to do so these investigations come at a time when consumers have lost confidence in tech companies they've been unable to safeguard people's

for instance something you Percy have looked at cannot think about introducing what it says with a number of very significant growth opportunities a big reason why we're here in London is to meet with our partners on the media and on the business side to Tatooine exploit unique opportunities like this one import investment area and we won at leverage globally and nationally recognised content arm in a live stream across news and politics sports entertainment or initial step last year was provide that service a free ad supported basis in the 4th quarter we had or 6 hours of live streaming content on the platform in those 3 categories on the success that has exceeded our expectations across every measure we like to build on that momentum we think you need up to do that with our partners in Europe but what about previous lives what about paid for service users be one of the principles of many social media giant's many big tech companies from Google to Facebook have always talked about the fact that they are ultimately freed to consume we think it is really critical to look at the Broad spectrum of opportunities for growth would do the test right now to understand a premium

any in the specifics on and action at approach to talk about in fact Jack Dorsey is also CEO of square is that something that undermines his authority to within Twitter win Twitter be more effectively running at full-time see it no-one cares more about Twitter and is more passion about Twitter's Jack Dorsey and he gives every ounce of that he can bring to the table for company every day III could be happy to have him as a partner in a company could be happy to have him as a leader would be better for us to see you come from the world of investment Bank and Goldman you were with huge companies a very clearly led would be more effective the jackdaws was a 100 said dedicated to the growth Twitter we knew what that as CEO the most powerful thing about Jack is that he was a co-founder of the

manager Janus Henderson Rory these technologies not sound like things happening a long way away but very important because along the market's growth we've seen this year Imran record highs has come mainly in these big tech stocks like Facebook like Amazon like Google exactly the technologies and huge up former this year more broadly looking at earnings this week we do need a result to be quite good for the SNP 500s up 10% it States in order to justify those valuations we do need to see a good result we can see a huge amount of sectors reporting this week's not just tech but also the Pharma companies industrials banks will be able to get a really broad view how the economy because there was a warning from the IMF yesterday any any throw line but to live from the IMF saying there could be a market creation valuations are very high or high things got very high or what do you think having even if if we do get good numbers more these different takers will that be enough to support the market to put them even higher in the way and seeing is that we it 8 9 years into a very long run evaluations are above average so in order to keep that going you do need to have genuinely good earnings gracing song Laura who but it is going to be clear in my trust we are taking a gearing down we have become more cautious answer we do think that relations are relatively high no that's not to say there aren't good find opportunities out there It's just a note of caution about how long markets performed well for another to caution the estate from Alex Brazier who's the director of financial

they are still growing to be clear that they would have been growing at a much faster rate had these warnings not happening had Brexit happened to the banks are monitoring these details incredibly closely but to be clear no thought for some like Virgin money they haven't been through downturns before it will be really interesting to see what happens when the books are not stressed just how their areas clear also from speak to Alex braziers a fan of star wars is a good exit from speech she will ask whether the economic Galaxy is destined to be up in as it strikes back with there's a new hope the Gotze can be a safer place thanks to return the regulator the pink star Wars jokes Farby lost on some people it definitely awesome thing and yesterday was a bird the serious fraud office got

sometimes manufacturers really know what the book but this is the solution to that problem was to stop putting ingredient labels on things and have that be regulated right and then once you give for consumers transparent reliable information they can make choices about whether or not they want to buy things as they start making choices about whether or not they want to buy things manufacturers become a lot more responsible magically because they can't so if it is a challenge there when win you can buy things in a global market place over the internet the regulator's job is certainly got much much harder well I am very pro regulation of private I think that the the symbol of this wild West but we live in right now is this this and use a licence agreement had to tell a lie every time you use a new product which is Yes I read the terms and conditions if you do look at them they're written by lawyers basically make sure the company doesn't get sued so when you talk about private security internal things question we should ask is do you trust Google you trust Facebook do you trust Amazon and I think most people listening to this probably like no 3 times if you have a microphone in your home that is listening to everything saying I am aware they may be they may be able if they really wanted to do it at any your hand in your and Jews alike agreement that you read very thoroughly before you check the box saying read it probably says they can their minds I think it should it should be very explicit what is being captured what is not being captured what is being done with that it's not being done with the case they get caught doing inappropriate things with these things the penalties have to be very busy because we're catching them on wine 1000 kg each have to make sure that at any time in world history when we should understand we really can't trust these big tech giants with the information It's now Caro's work for Rolls-Royce you worried about the

be working some of the most challenging markets from a security perspective we are saying an organisation that a lot of people look Catton are interesting thing you've taken yourself attack highly sophisticated remains highly sophisticated customers say we take it we take a profoundly seriously have got much time as but I'm interested in this is how it affects the Labour market and whether it requires more skills from people of your skills last word to you Kevin on YouTube as the inventor of the name internet of things have you thought about the be societal and it all all technology helps human race thrive OK we have more people than ever before living longer about lives than ever before and that's that's enabled by technology and the internet of things is just the latest technology is going to lay enable more people live longer more fulfilling lives and I think Labour Labour question is is part of that I am I'm a radical I don't believe people should have to have jobs good be great if we could eliminate the need for jobs and people spend more time with their families of painting painting or writing poems and and insists it is ever since agriculture was invented we have had this very notion that most of the suspects spend most of our waking lives like working for somebody else doing something we don't want to be doing and if we can replace that with automation that great as long as we do something like universal basic income that Make sure that everybody can still survive so we're very interesting future ahead of us as we are that automate away a lot of work and we need to get used to the idea that is not actually a bad thing good point at which to end this conversation we need to leave that my guests Kevin Ashton you just turned the man who coined the term internet

quickly and we could not get them into an R-Rated tank and transport and probably two or 3 miles downstream where we know of the river flows will be OK with any sense of when the rivers are likely to get back to normal very difficult to say because it depends on the rain what we really need is he's catchment wide drain not not just the thunderstorms we have been seeing it will take 2.4 weeks of good steady rain to get the rivers back to where they need to be so it's certainly not an overnight fix and unfortunately the forecast beyond this weekend looks like turning very settled and dry again that was Dave Throup from the environment agency talking to Marfa would be back in Warwickshire throughout the programme Let's take a moment to look at their claim that democracy is under threat from misinformation target at us through social media to play on our fears and prejudices That's the conclusion of one of them from a report by the digital culture media and sport committee who want to see tougher regulation on some of these tech companies were Caton-Jones is our technology correspondent Rory is there anything new in this report had a few bike to this story of last month well morning Simon Yeah I think what it does is pull together as a vast sweep of this inquiry which started off looking kind of failure of the fake news phenomenon and zeroed in on the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the behaviour of campaigners during the EU referendum campaign and that there is new detail there is a lot of detail about what Cambridge Analytica was up to and also about aggregate IQ Canadian firm said to be linked to Cambridge Analytica which was a player which was used by the vote leave campaign and separately the the leave campaign during the EU referendum and there are allegations which have been detailed in the in the report about the links between the two of them we saw last week electoral Commission finding that they were linked and finding some of the participants So more evidence on all of that as the underlying all of this there's an assumption that this kind of campaigning this kind of targeted content or adverts actually works and can in every say democracy is under threat you're making assumptions this this these techniques work Yeah well I mean one of the striking things this week was that the the committee published a whole series of adverts placed on Facebook by vote leave and be leave during the 2016 campaign place during the final days before people voted and the point that the committee was making was that these these adverts had not been visible in the way that a billboard diesel or a leaflet posted through your door they were reaching millions of people with their quite strong messages but it wasn't completely clear where they were coming from and is a great call for much no clear transparency in in the way of campaigning works in the digital era the rules not being fit for the digital era OK we will talk to somebody who's an expert in political campaigning and read a book on this very subject get some of the response from the tech sector this recommendation tougher regulation potentially even higher taxes on some of those big tech companies it is 18 minutes past 7 the opportunities Brexit presents to rewrite the rules on farm subsidies will that have a dramatic effect on the way we farm in the UK but even more profound impact may come from a new technological revolutions just gearing up across industry agriculture it may not be long before the autonomous tractors be used today give way to an army of robots that can plant tend to read and harvest our crops crops that will themselves tell the robots what they need and when they're ready to be harvested our science editor Tom Fielden has been down to the farm of the future harvest has come early this year across the country massive got bikes this one the lumbering reader feel it is an impressive machine capable of scything 30 good part time we are you break every hour and as such it represents the pinnacle of a decades long drive to intensified and mechanised farming grinding out increases in productivity through economies of scale farming is not immune to the technological revolution that's transforming so many aspects of modern life the information revolution a big data artificial intelligence and robotics the mantra bigger faster stronger that so dominated industrial agriculture may be about to be swept away and think I got away with it if we look at what happened</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

as with competition and data so with copyright the future of the web is being written in Brussels rather than Silicon Valley European football's governing body Uefa has opened disciplinary proceedings into racist behaviour during England's match in Montenegro last night the euro Twenty20 qualifier which Gareth Southgate's side won 5 one was marred by racist chants by some home supporters towards England players the Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said that the abuse was a disaster and the campaign group kick it out said Montenegro should be expelled from the competition Our sports editor Dan Roan has this assessment I feel very uncomfortable for a good feeling that here is a racial chanting already when Dani Alves is ticking before that far side on the field the this was another hugely impressive performance by youthful England team in pot greets but of it the 5 one win was overshadowed by racist abuse with Raheem Sterling gesturing to a section of the home supporters after he scored and the FA today condemning what it called abhorrent chanting towards some of the team's players Danny rose seems to have been subjected to the worst treatment but it wasn't confined to the Spurs defender as the 18 year old Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi e told Middle Eastern broadcaster beIN Sports after he made his full debut when you hear stuff like that from the fans is not right is unacceptable and heard Uefa do it properly because obviously when I went over there are numerous he heard it was seeing someone start of the stuff that we can't just keep your head keep strong and very Uefa's President today called the incident a disaster and the governing body has charged Montenegro with racist behaviour if found guilty the minimum punishment they can expect is a partial stadium closure qualifying is also likely but Troy Townsend football's anti discrimination campaign group kick It out says the time has now come to get tougher is closed in the stadium for a game that is not but be against England were big or expulsion more worth it I'm all for that enough is enough you can't plan this tournament to sort yourself out if referees become aware of racist abuse they have the power to halt or even abandoned matches the England manager Gareth Southgate said he only became aware of the issue towards the end of the game may ask his players if they want to walk off the field in future there is precedent in 2017 Pescara's Sulley Muntari left the pitch during an Italian League game against Calgary because of abuse but in a season in which allegations of racism

long queue of regulators wanting answers as to how the personal data of 50 million users was allegedly taken their investigation by the information Commissioner here as parliamentary inquiry congressional inquiries and the US federal trade Commission is looking as well and this is possibly they have an even bigger fee and the Facebookbubble has finally burst Sarah Lacy is the founder of panto investigative journalism website which covers Silicon Valley said all this really is about how Facebook's safeguard its data it is fairer firm suggestion said has been lax estate in the past last couple years even before we got this scandal people are really starting to lose faith and you know Thank you very is Facebooktelling us the truth about the Dana or how well they know their day and we repeatedly had cases where Facebookcame out and said they had overstated video capture advertisers that's certainly didn't inspire confidence the people paying the money and then we had this brawling waved a revelations came out around the third out that Russia tempered in the election and then you know even for their executives went to testify in Congress there are still new numbers coming out and they haven't a moving targets its richly ironic for car company that a couple years ago he seemed to be in the running to be the first trillion-dollar market cap the history of love support and we know we more about us than anyone else an understanding that they'd be run by data but now the acting like the use of the data was shock and also the whole point around the use of data and the allowing other people to get your data it's partly because it's the commercial reason behind its part Facebooksaw what Apple has done in building an ecosystem of apps they wanted to encourage third party to do something similar to help make more money the irony here is what Facebook's thought people I think the executives people working at Facebookbelieve that a week earlier with the true intentions but that was that some health Facebookbecause required real identity would make a film where a nicer place Meanwhile the decade you through Facebookit was supposed to be something that Aiden Webb less nasty and how regulators the course could could find face which I think would really Warriors of people actually start to stop using it is summoning tournament actually happen I think when you've got a side a couple of billion people better that would have to be beyond the biggest protests in human history pretty thick death it is but I do think when I watch she certainly is who are the people using Facebookthese are calmer waters some wall Street pressure went of these reports that teens are using here even though it had Instagram this and some pressure on young people and influencers for lacking Snapchat is certainly our Facebookrow everything I had I had come a the air and you are making a dent in Snapchat because of bad and I think we will get you with a sad music yet there still will be people in emerging markets using Facebookfriend sense there still will be they made their way is jobs it is aimed a blue collar workers I think will be interesting to see is the FPO the prickly people once a canal you've cheered this on for years start really deleted the app mean just a little while ago we saw one of their WhatsApp founders tweed that it was time to delete Facebookget his account is already dead I mean when someone gives you a 16 billion $ is to acquire the company you keep your workout that's telling his mishap adjust very quickly so aware his Mark Zuckerberg that's a great question according to the company he and Cheryl Sandberg are working around the clock that is all here are your worries I Ways they called an emergency EDF and today at headquarters and neither she nor Cheryl were there that's pretty shocking given this is a company and even by text found her standards if really really just a strength all the terms of how it is run by Mark Zuckerberg how he has the final say and everything so for either of them nor Cheryl to be able to face their employees in the wave of theirs it sits pretty poor leadership by anyone step wait and see if they break cover Thank you very much Sarah Lacy of pay and the Silicon Valley website markers this morning is James Bevan chief investment officer NCCL alien this man from James state Silicon Valley we're expecting from the European Commission today its plans on how to tax Silicon Valley the big tech companies more and talking about so Philip Hammond talked about last week which is

its 17 minutes past 7 nerve the challengers companies face protecting their businesses from cyber security incidents are very great and Simon Jack that to tell us more Yes and no surprise they are becoming more common these cyber-attacks with as more data in this mortar hack but new research from PwC revealed that insiders at current or former employees top the list of sources of those attacks

going to be affected by activity they are not going to be able to recover later on here Airlines would be a good example of that versus those businesses who receive activity deferred into the second half if the virus outbreak starts diminish in terms of its said disruption I think what we're seeing in terms of Airlines is the potential for the Chinese state coming in by those assets from Highland Airlines and then sell them on to other Chinese slightly more profitable Chinese airlines such as China China southern China Eastern and actually if you think about it big economic disruptive events the state stepping in to provide support and then sell of the most profitable asset exactly what should be happening just talking and Lloyds Bank a good example of the the times this morning has a piece about empty shelves in the UK even the effect of the krona virus on those long logistics chain which keeper shelves full here in the UK win might this because we know that Chinese ports been pretty much closed for a couple of weeks there will be an impact the race and the impact is deferred in terms of the impact on our supply chain because a lot of those ships with their supplies been to see it takes 3 to 4 weeks for them to come across now given the shutdown import for about a month or so into that he will be starting to see the frontline impact of those supplying it chain disruptions and clearly then if Kevin 19 starts to improve the disruption has diminished will also get that lag before supply catch-up so indeed the impact between the headlines when actually a lot of your listeners will see the impact on the shelves in supermarkets will there will be a lag in there for between 3 and 4 weeks if it's clear this is it this is a big thing for the world economy the Chinese economy why I keep asking the question why our world stock markets still sailing on completely unscathed in the US market in particular not quite at record highs but not far off central banks in is the simple answer as central banks continue to offer her a super accommodative monetary conditions so low interest rates continue to expand their balance sheets and in that environment keeping interest rates on government debt corporate debt very very low what alternative to many investors have if they want heels they have to get interest assets even though there are risks and many of them around the global economy picture about the way the UK economy is run there's a thing called the office for budget responsibility which has been a watchdog to the UK government's spending plans for a while now and it's looking for a new hip Robert Chote movement since it was set up he explained what does the OBR do you and Hazard has done it it holds the government to account on its projections for tax and spending growth and by doing so provides An independent assessment to avoid the politicise Asian of those those forecasts now has done it I think it is quite successfully held the government to account what is the challenge for the successor to Robert Chote will it is if the government sticks to the target of the now ex-chancellor Sajid Javid put in the public domain for growth of two . 72.8% the ABI is likely on the 11th of March to suggest that trend growth the UK is one Maxwell one half there's a big gap emerging that we see what happens in the us where the executive in terms of the Trump administration forecast 3% growth for a decade and their equipment the ABI the congressional budget office think that run rate is close to 2% that stand-off may come to these shores credibility get Thank you very much Simon French from Panmure Gordon now should big tech groups like AmazonFacebookGoogle be forced to share the mountain of data they held us with smaller rivals with the European Commission thinks that perhaps they should It's part of a suggested new City regulations also include possible restrictions on artificial intelligence technologies Charlotte Walker Osborne as a partner and international head of artificial intelligence and technology at the law firm Eversheds Sutherland and she joins us now good morning Charlotte just tell us what the European Commission proposing on data sharing and morning Dominic it I think the European Commission's really seeking to allow data sharing in a manner that will help society as a whole also whilst its white paper doesn't actually yet go into a lot of detail about that it is pretty clear that it wants to encourage that say that everyone can maximise the kind of ability to monetise and also have a societal benefits so it talks quite a lot about the partnership between the public sector and private sector and actually sharing of data for the greater good a bit but farming Google or Facebook I said listen I've put all the technology in place and it's allowed me to click the state It's my data and share with anybody who might come along and want to eat my lunch well I think there's a lot of

executive of TechUK he also joined us that represents technology chemist during what was your reaction to what chance said yesterday when we didn't win the like we think there are 3 things wrong with it the first is that the complexity of the UK already has one of the most complex if not most complex tax goes over banking tell you just how many pages and guidance but this will add more to it and it is not simple and practical uneasy has as its definitions will undermine this the second thing is that then brings uncertainty into this and if you're investing in a business in the UK are trying to grow a business we've heard a lot recently about the number of big tech companies that the UK's growing how successful we are attracting investment so my one of these companies that will be taxed and you think about it quite a broad spread a car auction site Toro told booking site any sort of online marketplace may be people haven't thought of the last thing of course what's needed here is international reformers stand said we need to act on its because all businesses are digitising is not just about tech companies should be about every kind of come from farmer of fashion finance and UK by going it alone is actually contradicting spoke in the wheels of the international effort into big tick films bring on themselves if they spend all their time trying to root turnover sales made in the UK through lower tax jurisdictions which is what they do then they can only expect given the neck eventually well but the point about it is you need to have a tax code that works in the new world but international and that digital weather is much more value likely than physical but it's better to put it together as because it's never gonna happen Gration line but it is happening in the OECD is actually planning to reduce its proposals at the very time the Chancellor's is planning to bring so that you have a choice you can join in the lead an international effort to get it fixed or you go it alone Mrs this looks to us like going alone and therefore exposes the UK to the kind of international retaliation and threatened to do the deed would you expect the Americans to retaliate because that because obviously America has decided not to do this context being very opposed to read my lips is is his own man and expressionism Stevenage has already said if you do this kind of thing to the EU then we regard that as a trade barrier her work but said it could well be retaliation if you wait for the OECD you could be waiting a long time because it would need American essays and has discussed America's not well hair hair and in the point about this is a few if you get enough people focused on this and have an international OBOs thanks every kind of business every kind of industry all of a sudden it makes more sense if you look as if you're just targeting 3 or 4 of America's top companies why with those great Thank you much indeed from ticket and also then Neagle from Clifford chance for markets this morning is Lucy Macdonald chief investment officer for global Equalizer Alli and only is going back to the budget when Italy for example put into their big spending budget just a few weeks ago the markets moved against Italy sharp Leave people solder telling government if the borrowing costs up we're talking about a giveaway budget here do you think that will happen to the UK the net to give away another Everton I need a real focus the UK is going to continue to be on on Brexit and so this is going to be a little bit of a sideshow or while the concern is really over the next few months exactly what happens with that deal so I would not expect a big impact are neither standing up market although if markets do test the credibility of what what politicians say enough as we discussed earlier with with earners Martens the the chance was no longer talking about balancing the budget has ditched all those medium term targets must fix or international lenders think about the UK maybe the ages at the edges but I think it's all relative then they look across the other side of the house and and it's it's it's less really constrained their essay that's I think what what the market and given an early test of this new digital tax because Facebook reports tomorrow today and and there you have a company which is is no 2.5 billion users which is growing in the 30% switches got very strong margins However it's coming up against regulation GDPR it's coming up against now taxation and a slowing of momentum in in user engagement and that's what we will be looking at very closely because there's been a shift and engagement from Facebook to Instagram which is within its boundaries but still that's changing and there is concern among the investors about that that growth rates so that's where the real those folks will be and a background of of increased taxation is never have end in a related point yesterday in the us markets the there was a big sell-off of technology

nineteen-sixties covering a period of 20 years the novel jumps back and forth between Manchester and East Pakistan or Bangladesh's it would later become known after the bitter civil war has team and family there is the title It's a story about what it means to leave behind everything you know and try and make a new life in a strange land when not everyone except you shone as a son is an award-winning short story writer Hashi and families her first novel she joins us now welcome to fun where and congratulations on the book Shahnaz it what a start by telling us why you wanted to tell a story inspired by your grandparent Pankhurst is great to be on the show I for me I think about family stories are universal in their appeal I think the context behind and differs across at the heart

Woods founding Dean of the Blavatnik school of government and Professor of global economic governance at the University of Oxford is in our Oxford studio and Gerrard lines is in our Tunbridge Wells studio former economic adviser to Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London now chief economic strategist at that wealth and board member of the Bank of China good morning good morning and deadlines what do you think of the deal I think Boris Johnson still Spa better for the economy than Theresa May's deal I think this is the biggest positive is likely to come in the next stage in terms of trade negotiations but also I think there will be an immediate quick Quinn for the economy in a sense it removes uncertainty we've already seen the financial markets give the thumbs up in the last week with Sterling strengthening I think that same positive sentiment is likely to be seen in terms of a boost business confidence maybe business investment or allow the Chancellor to go ahead and feel empowered to announce an infrastructure boosting the early November budget and stronger \u00a3 itself will keep inflation of uncertainty and for a time he does it I think the key thing is the next stage you seek to make a success of leaving the European Union might think Brexit is a great positive for the country and the economy to make a success we need to get 3 things right a domestic economic agenda our relationship with the rest of the world than 90% of global growth this from outside the European Union next two decades and a sense of future relationship with the EU the problem with Theresa May's deal was our future relationship with the EU was going to tie our hands on domestic policy and our relationship with the rest of the world Boris Johnson deal and frees up their so not only about having a good sensible future relationship with the EU that we needed to negotiate the next 15 months it is also about in parrying us and the domestic economy and on the global agenda as well and that's right think the still gives us a lot more room for manoeuvre for first words what do you think Yes well I agree that those are the 3 issues where Britain stands now let's not forget the our politicians have spent the last two years arguing about what kind of bus ticket to buy we haven't even got on the bus yet and it will be a very long bus ride and we don't yet have agreement on what the destination is where is it that we're actually going to get to so when people say we just want this done in Britain has two choices if it's going to get on that but it's got to accept we've got to be honest with that with the people that this will be a very long bus ride but where are we heading I think that but what has really changed since the referendum is the choice of destinations because Britain is now have to decide is it going to be an economy which more or less lines up with the United States standards in things like financial services banking agriculture or is it going to be an economy that more or less lines up with the European Union standards and on things like environment financial services and banking tax and regulation of the big tech companies agriculture and food I think probably most Brits most parliamentarians want to line up with the European Union so this is all to play for now and I think what we've got to now be honest about is that the choice there isn't a third choice It's not as if Britain Ken in today's world economy session an entirely third way Gerrard lines is I mean I can do you agree that there's a choice even if you think the choice should be more America the EU might think Professor Woods has touched on many issues I've talked about myself and I think though her outcome is the wrong one this is not a choice between Britain deciding to follow America as opposed to deciding from the EU but we just need a sense of realism first and foremost the UK is a very imbalanced economy Clearly there are many things we should have done the last 40 years we were in the EU that we didn't do it would be more empowered to do the outside but the same time we need a vision a sense of direction It's about repositioning the UK in a changing group growing global economy and financial services the fears of 3 years ago had effectively been replaced by a sense of reality that the UK is a global financial centre but we do need to compete not only against the York against Singapore in terms of the environment and workers rights UK has been at the forefront of pushing these I think we will now with Parliament responsive to people's votes based art domestic agenda then that will actually make sure we are at the forefront of those clearly in other areas as Professor Wood has touched on their global rules and regulations natural leap 8% of UK firms that sell into the EU market will have resigned you agree with me it will be realistic we've got to be realistic about the fact that to do a free trade agreement with the United with the European Union it takes around at least 5 years if you look at Japan if you look at Canada the other big G7 economies it takes 5 years we need a long transition period for going to be realistic it is not realistic to think that Britain can conclude a free trade agreement in the next</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

consider a new regulator would have the power to break them up will also be talking about bird boxes and the of people protested at Stansted to due to be sentenced today you're listening to their Radio 4 Michelle Hussain and John Humphrys of our art of art art It's 7 o'clock on Wednesday the 6th of February the News headlines this morning President Trump has used his delayed state of the Union address who urged Democrats to work with him are refusing to abandon the immigration policy that led to the showdown of the United States government shutdown of the state government a senior Taliban negotiators told the BBC the group does not want to take control of Afghanistan by force and Labour is promising to create a new regulator for the big tech companies to give people control over their personal data and protect children from online harm News is read by Susan Rae in the annual state of the Union address President Trump has made an appeal to the Democrats to co-operate with him for the good of the American people the speech had been delayed by a week because of the row over the funding of a wall along the border with Mexico the stand-off which led to the partial shutdown of the US government Mr. Trump urged Democrats to choose greatness of gridlock and implement what he called a common-sense Proposal that would make America safe our North America correspondent Aleem Maqbool watched the speech in Washington Donald Trump's very statesman-like message to open his address was the US politicians of all persuasions have to work together we must reject the politics of revenge resistance and retribution and British boundless potential of co-operation and compromise and coming good strike inside the house chamber of the President gave his speech the Democratic congresswoman all wearing the white of the suffragette movement as a message there be no rolling back of women's rights under their watch they sat through a list of the president's economic achievements and many grimaced as he took his first big swipe at his opponents an economic miracle was taking place in the United States and the only thing that can stop there are foolish towards politics for we get jealous partisan investigate issues a reference there to Robert Mueller's Russia probe and so after talking in conciliatory terms the president went on to focus on the very thing that caused so much political division in recent weeks immigration and his plans for a border wall for the Democrats have been so vehemently against him building simply put walls work and walls say moved blind he was well over the border wall just led to the longest government shutdown of US history shot dead the president didn't mention in a speech that lasted an hour and a half the Democrat responded by saying that America was made stronger by immigrants not walls military veterans reformed ex-offenders and a young girl who survived cancer among those invited to the capital to hear the President's speech as Mr. Trump presented himself as a leader with an inclusive policy agenda reducing the cost of drugs to eradicating Aids and introducing paid family leave with his assessment of the president's approaches our North America editor Jon Sopel it was as though Donald Trump spent the past few months learning a new language last night trying it out for the first time where once he sought to divide and pick fights last night he tried to be a unifier the politics of grievance percent victory isn't winning for our party it's winning for our country he said and on it went some Democrats in Congress laugh incredulously but the President is responding to a new political reality looking over his shoulder last night with the new Democratic party leader of the house Nancy Pelosi in the audience those Democrats who want to replace him as president in Twenty20 ity with disdain the mid-term elections last November saw Democrats winning in the suburbs winning massively among women the political environment for him has become a lot tougher through the middle the president is seeking to thread is an attempt to broaden support without alienating the Trump base and his tough talk about the border was designed for them but how does he get the funding for that wall that is still his biggest challenge Mr. Trump announced he would be holding a second summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il on the 27th and 28th February in Vietnam</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

not sinister exactly but it's very very convenient to have things which just can't be read and one of the companies of sporting to get our agreement something and they know full well we're not reading I think that area in an impossible position actually and very often they do know that people don't read them and they really do try to do their best to at least make them accessible enough to read them there in a double bind me Yes these things are deliberate the reason their deliberate is because the complexity of some of these services and the difficulty of trying to explain them in a way that regulators are satisfied with is a real challenge anyone who's ever drafted privacy notice a policy sitting out there and I'm sure there are some will be nodding agreeing It's incredibly difficult trying to get him the level of information that regulators actually want so I'm kind of straddle between the tea I'd like to it is deliberate in the detail is deliberate but I don't think it's deliberately obfuscating the think I think companies do know is that when they say click here to say you access and agree they know that we live likely start with a lie which we have read these regulations these terms and conditions we are clicking say we read them and they think they are that they haven't You have the 3 seconds to read the winner takes all morning what you're saying but I do think that rather than being deliberately long which is absolutely unfair the company's it would be perhaps fair to say that there is a certain laziness in how they approach them the stuff that struck me while I was doing this was things like Apple accompany his public image is all about relentless optimisation shaving off sharp edges having these clean sleep devices that had its terms and conditions references to products hit it has shot down a year or two ago that it just wasn't seen as a thing that this user experience focused company should actually be putting time on legally there was no reason to remove those days you didn't heart the company to get customers to greet them a lesson plus other good players they could have gotten rid of any shares they really approached the terms and conditions as a product as a thing that they use are expected to interact with are needed and I haven't got your opinion on the city I'm pretty as far as the cynical body that is done deliberately but it is not done deliberately it means that our agreement is pretty much irrelevant well I do take your point cloud because sometimes the debt ceiling in the way in which some of these provisions in terms and conditions and documents are presented that it almost seems like evasive manoeuvres in terms of trying to track down specific parts of information and privacy notice so for example I totally take prisoners point I agree with that they do fall between a rock and a hard place and that they have all the information they have to provide what happens information who is being shared with the purposes the safeguards and one but at the same time they need to make it clear and accessible and legible to the ordinary user and even tailor it for example for users their children at the same time it's just so interesting how for even small today a huge big tech firms how easily accessible certain information how very inaccessible other piece of information can be said for instance even with some of the big tech companies won't name names spec it and it is quite it interesting how for example if you want to exercise their rights if you have an issue if you want to make a complaint getting access to that particular person that particular department can be notoriously difficult and for some say smaller and medium companies in all these obligations and all these compliance requirements have become very onerous and quite expensive they start to automate these things start used a system whereby they are taking out person now because it's saving costs at the same time meeting compliance but at the same time it can be incredibly difficult for you to get a response if you are an individual who has a complaint for what I should really get going about whether we should be caring about data protection since the dying who what why is it important why why should we care about it we can about because of how much did he put out there we put so much data out there about ourselves consciously and unconsciously and if you look at the Genesis of the law if fathers human rights laws say you look at where the special categories of Deidre things like health religion sexual orientation and lifestyle it's about characteristics about ourselves that we can change and potentially having those characteristics having a detrimental affect on us and I think the principle behind and protection are and privacy is laudable and just not sure that the GDPR is the right piece of legislation to do up for as region they have been</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

after almost two centuries next year's sensors could be the last one ever carried out the UK's national statisticians Sir Ian Diamond was appointed last year said that in the future there could be better and cheaper alternatives to the compulsory survey each household in Britain which takes place every 10 years our home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw reports the UK census provides valuable information about the population which helps the government councils and other organisations plan public services but it's increasingly expensive project for England and Wales alone cost next year will be more than 900 million \u00a3 double the amount spent in 2011 Sir Ian Diamond said his officials were conducting research to find out if other data sources could be used instead such as the ordinance survey council tax records in GP lists combined with regular large-scale population surveys the national statistician said it might be possible to replicate the richness of data supplied by the census in a less costly and more timely way Sir Ian said he expected to make a recommendation to the government on the way forward after the research and next year's census had been evaluated one

reasonable thing but if online companies were made responsible for user generated content well it would be quite a change they say the change that would harm free speech still government is expected to press ahead as we were hearing the news of plans to make Ofcom the broadcasting watchdog responsible for enforcing a new duty on the tech companies the culture Secretary Nicky Morgan outlined how that duty of care might work platforms will have an obligation to comply with the terms and conditions when they say we don't host certain content or we want to protect vulnerable users children for example we will take things down quickly when complaints are made actual what that says is if they don't do that they are potentially a breach of their duty of care and the regulator will the old Satan construct termed the Oceans what you can do about it back in December we spoke to Lucy Alexander whose teenage son Felix killed himself after being bullied online she now campaigns in this part of the cyber-bullying task for shooters big tech needs to be reined in need to use the tech available to them Felix was bullied online predominantly from the age of about 13 nice pays it was a platform that there was no regulation on they all had smartphones at this stage it is very difficult for us as parents to try and find out what was happening to him he had access to all sorts of content that we had no idea what it Mars freedom of speech is all well and good but with that comes responsibility I think they have taken a bit of responsibility for what they publish on their platforms Andy Burrows's head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC is here in the studio morning to you good morning to welcome what the government's doing we do welcome this step the duty of care legislation is something the NSPCC has been campaigning for since 2017 this potentially can be a transformative moved to set out a British model for how we can regulate to protect children online and in turn that can go on and become the global standard for how this should be done under Ofcom the right regular we think Ofcom is the right regulator has the existing blend of regulatory expertise that it can bring to to introducing tackling the problems we see with tech firms crucially as well that will help to ensure that we can get the regulator up and running and taking decisions quickly and there is an urgency here because NSPCC figures have shown that every day since the online Hamas white paper when the government first set out its intention last year every day since then we've seen 90 cyber related crimes against children it is vital we do see this action swiftly a note of caution scepticism even from our Rajan media editor in the News there which you heard you sitting here

or gambling online more than those who drank alcohol smoked or taken drugs MPs have accused the government of failing to build a relationship with India that could result in trade deals after the UK leaves the European Union the Commons foreign affairs committee says easing visa restrictions on students and workers entering Britain from India will be crew a crucial part of any trade negotiation as Sangita Myska reports India's economic weight in global ambition makes it a priority to do business with it has the world's second fastest growing economy behind China today's report says that means that represents essential investment sales opportunities for a post-Brexit Britain opportunities that have until now been missed the committee warns that any indie UK trade deal will almost certainly have to include an easing of visa restrictions particularly for students and workers it says the so-called hostile environment that once existed at the home office must be replaced by a re-set relationship but sends a more welcoming message the singer Liam Gallagher has told the BBC that he's a freak out about levels of knife crime in London because his children are the age of many of the victims he was speaking to our entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson the former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher has strong words for the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan I think I ever comes up his wealthy long the resultant Walt of a lifetime and diners of Gallagher who now lives in Highgate North London says the rise of knife crime attacks in the capital has made him very worried as a parent the time you wake up in the morning the 16 year-old kid being nice that I've got kids a agent remain free to me right now and when asked about recent revelations concerning MPs admitting to taking drugs he was not impressed as they sip politicians taking drugs money get him doing it all on the Girona William Gallas go was speaking ahead of his appearance at this weekend's Glastonbury festival where a number of MPs are also on the line-up Colin Paterson reporting Liam Gallagher is not running to be our next Prime Minister it is now 10 past 8 they are being condemned for destroying our privacy for undermining democracy for encouraging racism and hate speech sharing Images the promote terrorism encourage the young and vulnerable to take their own lives no wonder the cries heard again and again that it is time to regulate Facebook this morning though that call comes from an unfamiliar source but very familiar voice Facebook's head of global affairs and communications Sir Nick Clegg was delivering a major speech in Berlin later today before it I asked him whether he whether Facebook we're really saying please regulators of Yes not just Facebook but the online world as a whole has developed so fast in such a short period of time Roger Federer became number one in men's tennis two days before Facebook was invented to the Federer era has lasted longer than Facebook we forget though these companies are huge and affect every aspect of our lives or socialise our business lies nonetheless it all happened such a short period of time I think we are sort of somewhat breathlessly trying to catch up with that pace of growth and now put a guard rails in place rules in place and it's not for private company however big or small to come up with those rules it is for Democratic politicians in the Democratic world to do so on privacy on how elections are conducted on hateful content all those kind of things I want to talk through some of those areas but let's talk about the principle first of all because the cynics might say here is Nick Clegg effectively PR man for Mark Zuckerberg had a lot of flak saying look this is your problem not our problem if you're worried about These things you do something about it don't ask us to do something about well have not just providing PR gloss I sort of sense my new job I'm responsible for how these policies are set to air their very substantive on how to tackle terrorist content online how to protect elections outside interference to summit was and if you're saying I don't blame us nothing we can do if you think there's a problem you go and sorted out but I think the issue of blame I think it is absolutely right that companies like Facebook acknowledge the mistakes they have made and of course mistakes have been made it is just that I don't think it is in any way conceivable and more than that I don't think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which users profoundly is import important as how technology serve society and in the end this is not something that the big tech companies from the United States or elsewhere can or should do on their own I want to see and

would you reduce the availability of that sort of harmful content What I am announcing today is savers approaching government would be to dealing with what I think is a disastrously distorted digital market and what we want to see from the government in the next few months and years in their overdue plan to deal with online arms my central point is that we have an emerging data monopolies that have undermined market and we have dissipated regulatory action across too many regulators to address the harms caused by some of these big take part any you add another one always think we need a dedicated to regulator that would actually look at have proper powers that can be enforced and create a body of Essex around this some of the harm done with these tech platforms other than focus on those sorts of structures how about looking in more detail the actual laws and the government is working on laws to make social media firms remove illegal content is also a suggestion that the firms could be reclassified as publishers that would make them legally liable for content on their on their websites and and through the platforms which you support that if the government seriously proposing that we will definitely take a look at that and take that very seriously and they have been reluctant to do so in recent years which is why we're trying to look away dealing with your own proposals were narrow proposals where we've been looking to Germany where there's a proper judicially a sort of overseen take time process that's done speedily which strives to strike a balance between free expression and prohibiting lit distribute distribution of hateful content I think has probably the best approach because that balances everyone concerned in this space but if the government I'm no government Minister said it yesterday it if they choose and has some newspaper stories if they choose to go down the road of badging social media firms as publishers we will definitely look at it on and take very seriously that you seem to be implying that whatever sort of action the company's take you on the face of it you just think they're too big and too powerful is that your your instinct Yes my view it's a competition laws are not fit for the age of big data and what I mean by that is that would we don't trigger merger controls as a result of data emerges it there is a network effect created by these big tech platforms lurching or requiring new firms and when they bring their user base together it gives them enormous value an enormous power in the market so they can competitors because it but if you take an example of Instagram which is very much in focus at the moment after Molly Russell case if that was broken up new had 3 or 4 Instagram's how does that mean that there is no automatic follow up that means the amount of harmful content is reduced was a network effect as a result of the dataset been merchant fact what we have seen with Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and other platforms it is a unilateral decision by the chief executive the company Mark Zuckerberg to merge these datasets which we think is very dangerous and under my And that democracy is a link between the size of the company the amount of harmful content what would give them greater power and it's harder for governments and regulators to deal with and and more coming aching beauty just sticking that Instagram example if you have 3 or 4 Instagram does that make it more complicated have the kind of conversation you're suggesting what it means that harms done and a magnified by the network effect as well somewhat on really saying is we need a regulator that Yeah the moment the regulatory arrangements in the UK had dissipated across too many institutions the advertising standards authority got so wrong the information Commissioner's office of com another regulators sort of look at this and I think the information Commissioner's me of lobbyists lawyers have made sure that these big data monopolies have slipped through the cracks of regulation so we are saying we need a new regulator to deal with it and and we know this is very hard I have got all the answers to your listeners this morning because these are global companies but these challenges being faced in a cross across sort of the EU and in domestic legislature this around the world and we think that when companies these global companies tried in the UK our own competition and regulatory arrangements need to be tightened to make sure we don't get some of it undermining of democracy with and yet with the spread of fake news and hate</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

the committee's recommendations protected Tom Baldwin is the author of how politics and the media crashed of democracy also worked as spin-doctor for Ed Miliband in the 2015 election and Eileen Burbidge is a partner passion capital and chair of tech nation which the government funded organisation to accelerate the digital economy across the UK good morning to you both if I could start with you and you know we've gone from TV ads to billboards direct Mail is the step change in while democracy is threatened by the technology the book Ctrl delete the discussions really needs 8 30 here Christ it is the relationship between politics and the media the one hand and the information age the other and in that sense of Donald Trump the next few days I have the gathering crisis around Brexit the most vivid example of I think the I just let it go we are we having this conversation because some people think they just can't believe that Donald Trump got elected and only by creating some sort of conspiracy that bovine masses being led by people who are brainwashing them via the internet is the only way we can explain what has actually happened I did the need for people who might want to look for excuses the Russian troll once they knew each Dutch the old Etonian data scrapers but I think there's a difference I mean it's a different thing of boats are anchored League guided missile the social media out that we have seen Donald Trump and I'm the leave campaign of them but the need for a political weapon ever invented a report today that the leaked by vote leave campaign with their contempt of Parliament but always with the support they make some good accommodation a good country I don't think they go far enough transparency you have to be that all together if you're going to get a solution your Let's get that the technology role in all of this and Eileen to wit when these of the issues first emerged the the big tech companies said listen we're just a platform of a publisher we've got this so much content we can't really be expected to monitor everything on it we're all where are we now do they accept there they are publishers not platforms can morning in Surrey but my voice first well to that question they do except that they have a bigger role than just being platforms now I think that's quite clear whether that's and reluctance they tried to this point and not his a different issue but this you need knowledge that they have a greater responsibility and just putting their hands up and saying right we are simply platforms having said that while They have as much influence as most publishers do this clearly a role in between which is being now defined by what they do and I do think there is a switch of emphasis on this because of the result because of what happened in the American election I don't think the outcry would have happened and when people start it seemed that I get more that run of results for women's shoes then I'd use the beginning men's shoes in my feed for example nobody seems to complain about that quite as much it is a lot to do with the subject matter and I think that's right go it is very important and it is a threat to what people think they are generally get from these contracts if I could just look at some of the committee's recommendations social media sites sites should be held responsible for harmful content on their services and that's another one here technology companies should be taxed to fund education and regulation that's an interesting one big energy companies pay for Ofgem shouldn't the tech companies pay to for that for self-regulation I think that's quite reasonable I think the devil is in the details of course how it is implemented how regulations going monetary he's also of up for grabs I think that's where it's it we have to be very careful and I do agree with your recommendations have to do with updating for modernising for a digital age and something because they haven't been touched for so many years or rules around campaigning and and what comes out the electoral commission I do think political ads to need to be have clearly illustrated as such just as they would on any other medium it could you not fight fire with fire for the people who complained that the voters the votes were influenced in this way they and mainly they think the right has been very good at this colleague to fight fire with fire and do the same kind of campaign on the other side or is this something about from perhaps the far right that feel less constrained by that say truth and taste and therefore a much better uses of these kind of techniques we'll do our best within the law</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

profit of 18 billion $ last year about 14 billion \u00a3 What on earth notice they undertake of fine from Ofcom so it's absolutely vital that we see the regulator have the teeth has the appropriate tools first of all to get into the bonnet of how these companies operate what steps if any that taking to protect children's safety but then there is a stringent package of enforcement measures available to them suggest that kind of fines we're talking about so we would like to see fines equivalent to GDP art the data protection legislation said that up to 4% of global turnover but that has to be accompanied as well we think by a combination of criminal sanctions now they should apply both to tech platforms as corporate entities but we also think it's hugely important that we see a name director scheme when name directors have responsibility for holding matching tattoos really interesting I have to say I am I'm slightly surprised and I think people will really know the you are suggesting not that their son had would ease sanctions we might talk about fine here there but actually that there is as you put it a criminal sanctions and fines that we really do have an impact on these companies and if that isn't the case if the government doesn't go for that then frankly it's not gonna work is absolutely we need to see a regulator that has teeth that has the resources and the sanctions that are necessary to take conclave some of the largest companies in the world now if the UK government has the appetite to do that it absolutely can deliver this the UK we know is one of

children are by keeping them at school but that isn't actually and needles and break we should encourage parents to get their children vaccinated I am a non medical professionals do not know the dangers involved and having facsimiles like the old and I do think that that's the answer rather than excluding anyone from anything how Yeah I suggest a baulk at the idea of punishing Charlton for the decision the choice of parents within the day is a decision choice for parents against consider bison its advice states respect that some people are still free to make a choice in that the government minister like and what the most fascinating thing about the story is from from my research I think is that Lee other social media firms face of such have a real responsibility actually to to actually have a level look at what is going around like wildfire on their networks unchecked unverified scaremongering fake news which is allowed to the government are trying to clamp down on this but it is a can of worms of these being wrestled with for and it there is that is I think driving this is the sort of Mahan around the citystate said he's calling the those firms in the company's on Monday in requiring them to his word requiring them to take down he called the lines are up there about this we've seen again again again everything the same injured in action for us to voice any time that Minister is calling in big big tech firms and Canada flight California and he really really tell of the times not good enough these these are ruthless companies trying to make a lot of money in doing so very well in Leicester's change legislation Mr. is actual powers given to regulator nothing will change but then if you have got ahead of the it at NHS England said this is a time bomb and this what do you do if you can't do anything about a better education campaign the government spends hundreds of thousands of pounds every day on on every week on on Facebook and social media firms advertising Theresa May's Brexit deal what the NHS and bit of money advertising the truth the backs families to the ban on and then I can definitely not the children can't be punished for the efforts of people many to undermine vaccination programmes often I was saving the libertarian and life faces as health Secretary there was a concerted effort to undermine the HPV vaccination programme at that time I remember going earlier them that's a major programme that came from but for the libertarian right I have to say aided and abetted by certain newspapers to undermine the MMR fact I think that is the root cause of this someone called Harry cold out here is I remember very vividly not just social media Harry I remember the Mail newspapers running campaigns to undermine the MMR vaccine to score political points against the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair who would not reveal whether or not he had his child vaccinated even though people were saying undermining public confidence that vaccine was causing real damage to the vaccination programme so what I would say the answer to this is is a robust defence by experts and then politicians citing the evidence of those experts to defend vaccination programmes have allowed them to be eroded far too much we need to get back to a position in politics where the evidence and the science guides what we do rather the screaming headlines of right-wing newspapers Mr. 0 schoolchildren the time a bike is a really serious point it like the refused to confirm whether their children have the MMR boxing I think actually added to use some of the distressed and worried parents talking about it Would be a politician I will confirm both of my children have had all their vaccinations member when required by the NHS and we talk about things go round like while in the city of Liverpool when my father was a polio was going round the be was game Rameez to go around killing his friends and that is the message we have to send out about whether kids go to school or not they should be allowed to go to school whatever the parents do it is saying it is deeply deeply irresponsible to end this country's vaccination programme in the end the fact that we have the ball got rid of some of the terrible diseases like polio and TB the my parents grew up living in fear of that is what vaccinations do that is why we should absolutely be published Matt Hancock said he said locked on the wheel he duty he could not rule out preventing unvaccinated children going into schools and nurseries whereas the education Secretary Damian Hines says children as others have about should never be excluded</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

meant to get better consumer services or better offerings and more value from the companies are giving to us run DC that way and now quite a limited share some at figures from an academic research that's been done recently so if you just Paul in this is a US audience but if you Paul are a group of young people and say how many you would be randomly willing to share your email contacts that same in exchange for more relevant advertising services etc for scissor them more say no we don't want to share our friends emails without one show something even and inaccurate However if there are no edged with the RAF for a say a free pizza I think this is actually been done in an MIT survey many of them was say should go ahead and take very male so this is Dan of the time aren't out if you're the kind of deal the law needs to be remembered yourself go online see how easy it is to click through and how many times you're given these sort of very soft nudges to force you gently nudging in to give more information it happens all the time aren't people don't really understand how that information is being used how wide its Being used they certainly don't understand the value of that data in exchange for wet again I can tell you it's a heck of a lot more than a pizza it is heckled more than Peter but if we don't value it how could you make a valuation for it and if we well because we need transparency and that's what we don't have the on if you go back to back down Smith father of modern capitalism from markets to work he believed there needed to be 3 things in place equal access to information transparent prices and shared moral framework I would argue that none of those things are in play when we are dealing with big attack I mean Burbage we're starting to see more more stringent response among policy makers to challenge the dominant position of some of these companies I seem to recall day not so long ago when we were falling over ourselves government to get Google or whatever to come into our countries and start up everything and so on now the that the mood music music has changed entirely do you think that greater regulation better regulation is the answer better regulation is definitely part of the answer and I think the challenge though is that all this is unprecedented it hasn't happened before as you say part of the reason and cities including the UK used follow over themselves trying to track these big companies is because they employ a lot of people they bring a lot of skilled jobs to the market and I think the other question is when they start offering services have become so ubiquitous and so far richer they also affect Labour lost me look at Burberry London for example then it starts to take on a whole different type of responsibility and something Yes I think we need better regulation that means more informed regulators I do think that just means more conversations between these companies and regulators that so I just responded the idea how many jobs these firms create a big platform firms GoogleFacebook even while Sabrina something like that create many many fewer jobs arm and then even the previous generation tech firms and certainly then the big industrial firms the past how could you change I mean that in the past technologies have always driven out other and previous technology is with whatever that largely because customers have chosen to go with them rather than with what existed before and presumably you have to work with that some power rather than simply saying well that's dreadful absolutely absolutely not I am not saying that the technology itself as dreadful are I think our understanding and regulation that has been dreadful I think these firms are probably going to have to be either broken up into divisions are a bit more manageable or in some way a restructure and so that we can all sharing the value of our data I'm actually a proponent of people owning some of the economic value of their own data and that something is being discussed by a lot of economists one of the things that I'm in babies that pundits and politicians the us talking about saying that maybe some of these big tech companies should be regarded in the same way as public utilities like water electricity and so on a regulated in that fashion</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
