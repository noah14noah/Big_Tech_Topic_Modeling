Welcome to all of you in the United States and around the world. I'm Fareed Zakaria, coming to you live from New York.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ZAKARIA (voice-over): On today's show, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>meets Davos. The America First president was in snowy Switzerland this week meeting the globalists he loves to deride.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ZAKARIA: Why did he go?</p><p>TRUMP: I believe in America.</p><p>ZAKARIA: What did he say?</p><p>TRUMP: America First does not mean America alone.</p><p>ZAKARIA: What might he have learned? We'll discuss it all with a terrific panel.</p><p>And an exclusive interview with <person><nameText>Benjamin Netanyahu </nameText></person>on <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Did that announcement dash any remaining hopes of a two-state solution or did it strengthen those hopes?</p><p>Finally, move over Davos men, Davos woman is now running the show. The co-chairs of the World Economic Forum were all women.</p><p>CHRISTINE LAGARDE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND: Even without testosterone we can actually produce positive constructive energy.</p><p>ZAKARIA: But is there parody of the sexes? I'll give you facts and figures.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZAKARIA: But first, here is my take. Ever since <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was elected president, I've said when he did something right, I'd say so. That's gotten me into trouble with some viewers but I'm going to do it again. On Friday, at the World Economic Forum, Trump gave a good speech that was forthright, intelligence and conciliatory, embracing the world rather than condemning it. If the speech represents a new approach for the president, it will be a huge step forward. But of course, the problem with Trump is by tomorrow morning he might veer off in an entirely different direction.</p><p>The <person><nameText>Trump presidency </nameText></person>so far is composed of three parts. Trump One is the circus, the tweets, the outlandish claims, the reality TV-like show. Trump Two is the dark populism and the demagogic assaults on minorities, the press, the judiciary and other institutions. Trump Three is the conventional Republican president following a very standard GOP agenda, tax cuts, deregulation, the hawkish foreign policy guided by mainstream advisors, like Gary Cohn and <person><nameText>Jim Mattis. </nameText></person>We could be entertained by the circus, we should be appalled by the demagogue, but we have to be encouraged by Trump the Republican. That's not because I agree with the ideas he's put forth in the agenda. I continue to think the tax cut is fiscally irresponsible, blowing a huge hole in the deficit that will starve public investment and effectively transfer government funds from the poor to the rich. On the other hand, his deregulatory push could be an important reform of an administrative state that has grown burdensome and overly complex.</p><p>Trump's policies and his cheerleading rhetoric have, without question, boosted business confidence, which as Larry Summers has often noted is the cheapest form of economic stimulus.</p><p>But whatever you think of the policies, the larger point is that Trump the conventional Republican is working within the American system, rather than trying to destroy it. It's possible that the weight of the presidency and challenges of the job pushed Trump towards a more sobering responsible path. It's also possible that Trump simply decided for now, for one day, decide with his moderate advisors.</p><p>He often seems to be an unstable compound of Trump's one, two and three on a single day, tweeting out juvenile absurdities and lashing out, but also promoting some sensible policy. Even at Davos, he couldn't stop himself from attacking the news media and repeatedly making false or misleading claims.</p><p>The mood this year among the global elite at Davos was upbeat. The world is experiencing synchronic global growth, something very rare. But underneath this good cheer, there's disquiet. Partly because people remember their optimism just before the global recession hit. But there's also unease. But also, while global economics looks reasonably stable, global politics is in turmoil. The old-world order created and led by the United States is eroding and the new great powers that are entering this stage are mostly illiberal and narrow minded. What will the world look like when China, Russia, Turkey and India, among others, have much more weight in global affairs?</p><p>[10:05:00] In that context, the role, capacity and intentions of the United States and its president become central. If the American president in these times seems uncommitted to the international system, hostile to the world, indifferent to democratic values and mercurial in temper, that's especially dangerous today. So when Trump behaves better, as he did on Friday, everyone breathes a sigh of relief.</p><p>I don't seek to normalize <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>but I do believe that, given the stakes, America and the world are better off for these moments when he behaves more like a normal president.</p><p>For more, go to CNN.com/Fareed and read my \"Washington Post\" column this week.</p><p>And let's get started.</p><p>You just heard my take. Let's see what my powerhouse panel thinks of <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>Davos debut. In London, Zanny Minton Beddoes joins us, the editor-in-chief of \"The Economist.\" The magazine's new edition is all about \"The Next War, The Growing Threat of Major Conflict in Today's World.\" Rana Foroohar is in Rome today. She's a global business columnist for the \"FT\" and CNN's global economic analyst. And with me here in New York is Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group.</p><p>Zanny, let me ask you, you were at Davos. I saw you there. The mood was buoyant because of the growth. Do the leaders deserve the credit for this synchronist global growth? Are they right?</p><p>ZANNY MINTON BEDDOES, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE ECONOMIST: Well, collectively, they do deserve some credit. I'm not sure <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>deserves quite as much credit as he was taking. But, yes, the global economy is absolutely buoyant and it's going to grow at a very strong level, very synchronized. And I think as a result, there is in the short term quite a lot of sense of euphoria. But underneath that, I think there are some deep concerns. You highlighted some of them. But people breathed a sigh of relief that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>there was Trump on best behavior, Trump with the Teleprompter, and that reinforced the sense of relief and optimism and even euphoria that you had.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Rana, the best line I know about Davos I think Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, who says, \"Davos is where billionaires tell millionaires how the middle class feels.\" The billionaires and millionaires were very happy. But will it translate?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: I can't think of a way to put it better.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Will it translate to the middle class?</p><p>FOROOHAR: You know, I think -- no, I have to agree with Jamie Dimon on this. I think Davos is a counter indicator for how most of the population is feeling. It's true, CEOs were buoyant. And I spoke to many. They are excited about the Trump tax cuts. More than his speech, they were looking at what's been done so far. The tax cuts and deregulation in the U.S.</p><p>My concern is really this is a short-term fix and a Band-Aid. That tax cut didn't have a quid pro quo for the kind of real Main Street investment that we all want to see, infrastructure, long-term fixes to education, real CapEx spending. The spending that I'm hearing that is going to be done by business is either happening in sectors not as labor intensive. The technology sector will do a lot, but they don't employ a lot of people. A lot of it will go into share buybacks. Again, that will bolster the wealth of the top 20 percent but that won't do a lot for the lower 80.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Ian Bremmer, you tweeted that this is not just this speech but the last couple of speeches that Trump has given on foreign policy, he's been remarkably sensible, which means he's actually stuck to the script in the Teleprompter.</p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP: There's no question Teleprompter Trump is better and more acceptable international than Twitter Trump. The problem is that Twitter Trump is who Trump really is. When you get him off of reading other peoples' words, you then have a problem. If he could get out of his own way -- Christine Lagarde opened Davos this year saying not only is the economy doing better than any point in the last 10 years, but Trump's tax bill is a piece of the reason for that. If he could sit back and let the economy do its work and let his many competent advisors work, it would be fine. The big news this week is Trump tried to fire Mueller and he was being retrained. Continually Trump is his worst enemy.</p><p>ZAKARIA: It's all very fascinating.</p><p>Zanny, very quickly, do you think when you listen to all this what was going on at Davos, do you think that they were giving Trump credit? In other words, particularly European CEOs, whom you know very well, they are not very -- they are hostile to Trump, openly hostile. Did they change their minds?</p><p>[10:09:55] MINTON BEDDOES: They are openly hostile to many of the things Trump does, but delighted the fact their share prices are soaring, and the American economy is booming. And I was struck by the degree to which European CEOs were very happy to say the tax cut was great for them, too. I think CEOs are as quick to turn their tune as anybody else. And I thought there was a remarkably quick shift in opinion there. I agree with Rana that much of it is not justified and, hopefully, we can get on to that. The mood there was remarkably upbeat.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Fascinating.</p><p>We're going to come back and talk about something else, which is, other than Trump and geopolitics, there was a big story in Davos worth hearing about. Rana Foroohar will explain when we come back, as will all the others.</p><p>[10:15:00] ZAKARIA: And we are back with \"The Economist's\" Zanny Minton Beddoes in London. We have \"F.T.'s\" Rana Foroohar in Rome, and Ian Bremmer here in New York.</p><p>Rana, you point out that if you look at the number of sessions, and much of the talk at Davos this year, it was about something else that people are actually very worried about. Explain.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Absolutely. A.I., big data, the digital revolution was the hot topic. And what is interesting to me, it's been that way many years at Davos but this year you got the sense it was going way beyond the tech sector itself and going to every kind of business model. I spoke to an insurance executive, for example, that told me sensors in cars and homes would enable his industry to write personalized policies. That's also going to result in some kind of a digital underclass. We've seen workers being left behind by technology. We may see people that can't be insured or get health care policies.</p><p>What is concerning is that the state will be, of course, left to pick up the pieces, but the state, as you've talked about in your column, and I'm talking about in my column in \"F.T.\" tomorrow, is it's very weak right now. Politics are polarized. Western liberal democratic states are being asked to do more than they can't. What is interesting is more authoritarian states, like China, may actually be better positioned in the short term to manage this disruption. But that also raises the specter of sort of an authoritarian technologically adept state that is wrecking privacy. So lots of big political issues.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Zanny, my sense is the tech companies at Davos, who are usually the stars of the show, are also aware that this new sense that technology is, first of all, causing a lot of job losses, might be creating these monopolies, is ushering in a new wave of feelings about how to handle technology and big tech.</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: I think that's absolutely right. Rana is completely right. There were lots of sessions on A.I. and how it will change jobs and lose jobs. That's been a subject for some years at Davos. For me, the two new elements of tech were that there was a really powerful sense of a tech-lash, a political backlash against the big tech companies. The Googles, Facebooks are no longer the great shining lights of western capitalism. They are too big, too concentrated. And all kinds of people are worried about that.</p><p>And the second element, also slightly more worrying, is the number of people that said to me China is ahead of us in A.I. and we have a real problem. The sense of A.I. as something as part of a geopolitical rift between -- or struggle for supremacy between China and the U.S.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Ian, so there's always that undercurrent at Davos, as well. Is China gaining ground? Is the United States losing out in the key sectors? Again, on the surface, the American boom makes that seem not true, but what's your sense?</p><p>BREMMER: Chinese growth is adding a hell of a lot more to the global economy than American growth is at this point, and that continues to be the case every year. Also, Chinese technology, driven by the state, as opposed to the United States. Trump is talking about manufacturing jobs. He's talking about coal. He's not talking about investing in A.I. That's a sector the Chinese want to dominate. I think both of those really worry the Davos group, especially because the two dominant forces in A.I. in the world today are ideologically opposed to the multilateral developmental approach of Davos. You've got the Libertarians in Silicon Valley and you have the authoritarian state capitals of Beijing. That unnerves the folks in a really big way.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Rana, do you sense, as a result of all of this, you're going to have a Chinese-American clash?</p><p>FOROOHAR: I think you are. I think you're going to have a splinter net really. You already see China going in a different direction than not only the U.S. but Europe in terms of how they are thinking about the Internet and regulating the Internet. Very tight ties between the state and tech firms there. An unlimited ability to collect data. I spoke to several western data scientists that were sort of envious about how easy it is to collect data, which is, of course, the basis of A.I., in China, even as they were worried about the authoritarian impact of all that data collection. So it is a very disruptive time to say the least.</p><p>ZAKARIA: And, Zanny, let me ask you, and this is television and we have a minute. Quickly, tell me why you chose to highlight the danger of not just conflict but actually of war in \"The Economist\" this week?</p><p>MINTON BEDDOES: Two reasons. We think there's a growing risk of great power conflict. One is an immediate risk, North Korea. We have a terrific piece that shows the risk of a preventive attack by the United States is probably much greater than many people think. And secondly, all the things we've been talking about, a rising China, taking its place in the world, plus technological changes in the nature of warfare, we think makes the risk much greater than many people realize.</p><p>[10:20:06] ZAKARIA: It's a terrific cover story. You should all read it.</p><p>Thank you all. Fascinating panel.</p><p>When we come back, my exclusive interview from Davos with Israeli Prime Minister <person><nameText>Benjamin Netanyahu. </nameText></person>I'll ask him about the Iran deal, the U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem, and about his own corruption scandal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA: Welcome back to GPS. I'm Fareed Zakaria, coming to you now from Davos, the small Swiss ski town that, for the last week, was home to the World Economic Forum. <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>appearance here grabbed the biggest headlines by far. But his fellow world leaders were out in full force.</p><p>On Thursday, I interviewed Israel's Prime Minister <person><nameText>Benjamin Netanyahu </nameText></person>onstage at the forum.</p><p>It was almost two months ago that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>announced he was recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capitol, and that he hoped to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv. Shortly thereafter, the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to condemn America's decision. But this week, the administration doubled down. Vice President Pence speaking at Israel's Knesset on Monday set a date saying the new embassy will open before 2019 is out. What does it all mean for peace?</p><p>Here is my interview with the prime minister.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[10:25:20] ZAKARIA: Prime Minister, pleasure to have you.</p><p><person><nameText>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, </nameText></person>ISRALI PRIME MINISTER: It's good to be with you again.</p><p>ZAKARIA: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>did something that I'm sure you've wanted an American president to do for a long time, which is announce that the United States will move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And the Arab leaders whom I talked to, who are not unsympathetic to Israel at this point, say, look, the reason we're opposed to this, this should be part of a final deal. The status of Jerusalem should not be decided arbitrarily and unilaterally. We want this solved but in a way that helps produce some kind of a permanent settlement. Do you understand that point that people make?</p><p>NETANYAHU: I understand that they say it, but I think they are wrong. Let me tell you why. Where is my office, the prime minister's office? In Jerusalem? Right next to us is the Knesset, our parliament. Where is that? In Jerusalem. Right next to that is the Supreme Court, the only real only independent Supreme Court in a very large radius in our turbulent region. Where is that? In Jerusalem? The seat of government is in Jerusalem. This has been the case for the 70 years of Israel's existence that we're celebrating ow. Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people since the time of King David. That's only 3,000 years ago. So <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>made history by recognizing history, recognizing these indelible facts of the past and the present. And under any peace agreement, you know that the capital of Israel will continue to Jerusalem. And the seat of our government will continue to be in Jerusalem.</p><p>I think, on the contrary, he did a great service for peace because peace can only be based on truth, on reality. And denying the simple fact Israel's capital is Jerusalem is -- pushes peace backward by creating an illusion, fantasy. You can't build peace on fantasy.</p><p>ZAKARIA: But about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NETANYAHU: It's a vision but it has to be grounded in reality.</p><p>ZAKARIA: A number of Palestinians reacted to the Trump administration's decision by saying it appears that <person><nameText>Benjamin Netanyahu </nameText></person>is essentially signaling the end of the two-state solution, we should now move to a one-state solution. What we now asked for, since we will never have our own state with our own capital, what we ask for is political rights since we live under Israeli sovereignty. Mubarak (ph) said that. Hamad Nashrali (ph) said that. Is that a possible consequence of this, that the Palestinians will move to asking for a one-state solution?</p><p>NETANYAHU: I think it's a complete distortion. I don't think they really mean it. I think they want to govern themselves, which I don't have any problem with that.</p><p>I'll tell you what my position is. It's a simple one. I haven't changed it, by the way. From the day I gave the speech, the principles have always been the same. The Palestinians should have all the powers to govern themselves, but none of the powers to threaten us, which means that, in any political arrangement, Israel must retain the overriding security control in the tiny area west of the Jordan, from the Jordan to the Mediterranean, because, otherwise, you'll have Daesh, ISIS come in, Hamas come in, which means Iran, and that's the end of peace. That's the end of the Palestinian Authorities. That's the end -- it could a perceptible, a powerful threat to the survival of Israel. So I never mince words about that. Israel will retain the overriding security control. But other than that, the Palestinians will be free to govern themselves. I don't think there's a problem with that. People say, yes, but if they don't have control over the military and security of things, that's not real sovereignty. You can't have another country retain the military forces, you know, a former enemy. How could that happen? Well, how about American forces in Germany, almost 80 years after the fact, or in --</p><p>ZAKARIA: Japan.</p><p>NETANYAHU: -- Japan and so on.</p><p>We live in a complex world. We have a mosaic of failed states in the Middle East. We don't want to create another failed state. And the key fundament of stability and of success and of peace is security. Israel will maintain that security for our benefit but also for the benefit of the Palestinians.</p><p>ZAKARIA: You know there are a number of people that say the problem with no progress on this issue is that, over time, you will have a vast number of Palestinians who live under Israeli sovereignty and, in that circumstance, Israel will not be able to be Jewish and democratic, that in other words, it will lose its democratic character because it will be ruling over a large group of people without giving them rights, or it will lose its Jewish character because of the number of Palestinians will overwhelm the number of Israeli Jews.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Do you -- do you buy that trade-off?</p><p>NETANYAHU: I think there is a third option. I don't think we necessarily -- I don't want to annex the Palestinians as citizens of Israel, and I don't want to have them as our subjects. They can live in their own sphere, govern themselves with their own powers, their own parliament, their own flag, their -- embassies, what have you, the whole trappings, except the powers that are needed that we need to retain in order to protect ourselves.</p><p>And this is not a gimmick. It's not a spin. It's real. This is the kind of arrangement that we have to...</p><p>ZAKARIA: But what country has ever done that?</p><p>You talk about Germany and Japan. Germany and Japan have -- have control over their military. They're not -- I mean, you're not -- if you were to give the Palestinians the deal the Germans got after World War II, the Palestinians would be happy. I mean, that's...</p><p>NETANYAHU: No, actually, they say, \"We don't want any residual forces and residual military presence beyond, I don't know, two or three years.\" It's now going on 80 years that -- that the Americans are there.</p><p>ZAKARIA: But Germany had -- you know, Germany has full sovereignty in its -- in military and defense.</p><p>NETANYAHU: Well, I think that, when the Palestinians demonstrate that they can, you know, they can actually govern those territories and not have them taken over by Hamas or by ISIS, then come and ask me again.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Is Jared Kushner going to make peace in the Middle East?</p><p>NETANYAHU: If the Palestinians...</p><p>ZAKARIA: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>says that he -- that he has a chance of doing it.</p><p>NETANYAHU: Look, it's a very able team that the president has. They have many, many abilities. The thing that people don't realize is that these people have made their mark in the markets in real estate. Now, this is not only a real estate deal; it's fundamentally not a real estate deal but a problem of recognizing Israel's existence, the problem of not recognizing a Jewish state in any boundary. But it also has its real estate elements. And they're, I have to say, very creative, you know, and I wait to see what they'll put down, but I don't rule it out. Because I think we need peace. I think the Palestinians need peace.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA: Next on \"GPS,\" Iran. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has said he has waived sanctions against that nation for the last time unless European allies get tougher on Iran. Has Obama's nuclear deal reached the beginning of its end? I'll ask Prime Minister Netanyahu when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA: The president said something quite dramatic recently, that he was not going to renew the waiver of sanctions on Iran, which means that, at some point, it is quite possible that the United States will unilaterally withdraw from the Iran deal. Then Iran would have the option, presumably, of beginning to enrich uranium again, go down a path, a nuclear path, again.</p><p>Isn't that a bad outcome for Israel?</p><p>NETANYAHU: No. I think that the present deal is so deeply flawed that it guarantees that Iran will have what it needs to make nuclear weapons, including enrichment of fissile material, on a vast scale. This is what is problematic with the deal. It just gives them a timeline and it says, within X years, eight years, whatever, from now...</p><p>ZAKARIA: But wouldn't it be better for you to have heard it be 15 years from now than next month?</p><p>NETANYAHU: No, because what they can do today is at best enrich uranium for one weapon. Under the deal, they will be able to enrich uranium for 100, 200 bombs, and that's...</p><p>ZAKARIA: Fifteen years from now?</p><p>NETANYAHU: Maybe eight or 10. And they could break out, \"let's rush create a nuclear -- an arsenal of nuclear weapons,\" unimpeded by any international agreement. In fact, the agreement lets them do it.</p><p>So this is why the deal is so bad, because it gives Iran, the preeminent terrorist state of our time, the wherewithal to produce nuclear weapons, nuclear bombs. They could give it to proxies, terrorists; they could use it themselves. That's where we don't want to get to.</p><p>So I don't particularly care if they fix the deal or if they cancel the deal, keep it or nix it. The important part for me is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear arsenal, because Iran not only spreads terror worldwide; Iran openly says that it's going to use those weapons and use every weapon they have to annihilate Israel. We're not going to let that happen.</p><p>ZAKARIA: When you talk to European leaders, certainly when I've talked to European leaders, and certainly their public statements, they say they support the deal; they do not see any reason to amend it. They believe Iran is in compliance with the deal and they think it produces stability.</p><p>So when you talk to them and say \"Fix the deal,\" do they tell you, \"Yes, we're going to fix the deal,\" or do they say what they're saying publicly, which is, \"The deal is good; there's no -- there's nothing to -- no fixing needs to be done?\"</p><p>NETANYAHU: Well, I'll tell you what I tell them, you know...</p><p>ZAKARIA: What I'm hoping is you'll tell me what they tell you privately.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>NETANYAHU: Well, I'm sure you do. But I can say that the fact that they signed a bad deal doesn't mean that they have to keep a bad deal. In history, when you've had instances of nations signing very bad deals and living, if they manage to live, to regret it -- there was such a deal, by the way, most recently with North Korea. They had a deal. Everybody said, \"That's it, you know, the North Koreans will keep the deal and it will prevent North Korea from having nuclear weapons; they will join the community of nations.\" So much for that.</p><p>ZAKARIA: But wouldn't we all...</p><p>NETANYAHU: They signed a deal.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Wouldn't we wish for a deal, given that there are inspectors in Iran; given that it's much more difficult to -- are you comfortable with an Iran that -- where there's no deal and it can do whatever it wants to...</p><p>NETANYAHU: I don't think -- I don't think it can do everything. First of all, the inspections are -- are deeply flawed because Iran says you cannot inspect military sites. So if you're the Iranian regime, where do you think you're going to do your weaponization? Where do you think you're going to do the other elements of a secret nuclear program? In military sites. But they say you can't inspect it. This is one example of how flawed this deal is.</p><p>Secondly, look, Iran doesn't rush forward to make nuclear weapons because they can suffer crippling sanctions. That brought them to --- to their senses last time, a number of times. Second, they also might think, correctly, that if they try to rush for a bomb, there will be countries that would prevent them. I don't want to speak in the name of another country, but I guarantee you I speak in my name; we will not let them acquire a nuclear weapon.</p><p>ZAKARIA: When you look at the Middle East -- you and I have talked about this before -- it seems as though...</p><p>NETANYAHU: And, by the way, the Arab states -- again, unnamed -- the Arab states, unnamed, agree with me.</p><p>ZAKARIA: So we are just about to name them.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>It seems as though...</p><p>NETANYAHU: You want to name the unnamed states?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ZAKARIA: Exactly.</p><p>NETANYAHU: Go ahead, name the unnamed states.</p><p>ZAKARIA: It seems as though Israel is today in a closer strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia and Egypt than at any point in its history, and that at this point, that is the defining feature of the Middle East, a kind of anti-Iran alliance in which Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Israel are the crucial players. Would you agree?</p><p>NETANYAHU: I'd agree that there is an alignment of Israel and other countries in the Middle East that would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. And certainly, in my lifetime, I never saw anything like it, and I'm at the age of the state of Israel, more or less, so it's an extraordinary thing.</p><p>Yes, it starts with a common concern with a common enemy, which is radical Islam, either of the radical Sunnis, Daesh, before that Al Qaida, which Israel fights, and has prevented, by the way, dozens of terrorist, major terrorist attacks not only in the Middle East but throughout the world and saved the lives of many, many citizens, because our intel is second to none, and also our common stance against Iran.</p><p>That's one source. What is not recognized is that there is another source of this closeness and it's their desire to make use of the civilian technology that Israel has, in water or in agriculture, or in I.T. and other areas to better the lives -- health -- to better the lives of their citizens. I view that as a great promise for peace. I think it's changing attitudes not only on the level of the regimes. We poll the Arab world; we see the beginning of changes, significant change in the attitude towards Israel in the Arab publics -- not all of them, and not yet majorities, but significant minorities. That's hope. That's a future of peace.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA: Up next, I'll ask Prime Minister Netanyahu about himself, specifically the criminal probes that are swirling around him and his associates. He has already been questioned numerous times by Israeli authorities. What happens next?</p><p>ZAKARIA: \"There will be nothing because there is nothing.\" That's a quote not from <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>about the Russia investigation but from Prime Minister <person><nameText>Benjamin Netanyahu. </nameText></person>It's become a mantra of sorts for him when he's asked to comment on the investigations swirling around him.</p><p>The Israeli police named Netanyahu a suspect in two cases involving bribery, fraud and breach of trust. He's been interviewed multiple times by authorities and his former chief of staff agreed last summer to testify against Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p><p>Here, again, <person><nameText>Benjamin Netanyahu.</nameText></person></p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA: Mr. Prime Minister, you -- you will understand I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask this question. It's about your own political future. You face in Israel serious investigations. How should the world see this? Should the world look at this and say, \"This is Israeli democracy at work, where no one is above the law, above scrutiny, above investigation, or do you regard this as a political witch hunt?\"</p><p>NETANYAHU: Well, no one is above the law in Israel, and that's the case in this case, too. But I'm also confident that nothing will come of it because there's nothing to come out. So I think that it's just a question of time. And next year -- yeah, invite me next year; we'll do it once a year...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>... and you'll see if I'm proven right. You'll see that I am.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Finally, you just came back from a trip to India.</p><p>NETANYAHU: Yeah.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Tell us what is it that all these countries that you have now been going to that are deepening their ties with Israel -- what is it that they are trying to get from Israel?</p><p>NETANYAHU: Two things: they want security, protection against terrorism. And Israel is second to none in providing this valuable intelligence that has also prevented, for example, planes from being blown out in the sky. That's not only a problem for the country that suffers that tragedy but for all international civil aviation. Israel has been the leading force to protect the lives and the -- the critical facilities of many, many states. That's the first thing. Everybody wants that. Because the firmaments of -- the sparks of radical Islam are flying into every continent and to every country.</p><p>The second thing that they want is the future. It's not only to push back the bad; it's to seize the good. We're in a world of tremendous change. I mean, you've been talking about it. It's basically the confluence of big data, artificial intelligence and connectivity that's changing industries. Israel has a car industry within a matter of years. We make -- 85 percent of the value of a car is soon going to be software. And all the other stuff, you know, the body, the chassis, the tires, the engine, that's minuscule. So essentially cars are computers on wheels. Now we have a car industry, because there we compete.</p><p>So an Israeli company, right next to my office in Jerusalem, has just been sold to Intel for $15 billion for autonomous vehicle technology. This technology is produced in Israel, but Israel is also not only an I.T. power; it's a water -- water power.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NETANYAHU: No, not only that; we -- we recycle almost 90 percent of our waste water. The runner-up is Spain with about 20 percent, just to understand. So if you're a country that needs water and you can recycle your waste water, you come to Israel. So this is -- this is a revolution. Israel, you know, we're working to build up the life of the Jewish state and afford us a future of prosperity and progress and peace.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA: Next week on \"GPS,\" don't miss my interview with King Abdullah II of Jordan, here in Davos. Mark your calendars. Next up, today on \"GPS,\" many years ago the political scientist Samuel Huntington coined the term \"Davos man\" to describe the average attendee at the World Economic Forum here in Davos. But in this era of further female empowerment, is \"Davos man\" making way for \"Davos woman?\" This year the seven co-chairs of the meeting were all women. Was it just window dressing? When we come back.</p><p>ZAKARIA: My book of the week is Christopher Hayes' \"Twilight of the Elites.\" I happened to bring Hayes' brilliant book along with me to read while milling around the World Economic Forum with Davos men and Davos women. It's a highly intelligent and even profound reflection on the problems with our current system of meritocracy that has so divided almost all our societies.</p><p>And now, the last look from here in Davos, where there is some history being made.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(UNKNOWN): It's fascinating to see...</p><p>ZAKARIA (voice over): All seven of the gathering's co-chairs this year are women. They're top leaders in business, finance, science and social entrepreneurship.</p><p>(UNKNOWN): You have to talk about prosperity.</p><p>ZAKARIA: All seven co-chairs gathered on stage at an opening session, and one of them, the IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, quipped that something was out of the ordinary.</p><p>CHRISTINE LAGARDE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, IMF: But it's a bit of a change from the \"manels\" panels...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>... that have been had on occasions.</p><p>ZAKARIA: But progress in gender at the top of Davos doesn't fully trickle down to the ranks of attendees. The World Economic Forum itself admits 21 percent of this year's 3,000 participants are women. While that's an improvement over past years, several female attendees voiced their frustration at the lopsided gender balance in these halls.</p><p>The WEF's gender gap report is an annual publication that charts the progress of more than 100 countries toward gender equality. The most recent report for 2017 notes that the global gender gap has overall widened for the first time since they started measuring more than a decade ago.</p><p>The report also suggests that, based on current data, it will be 100 years before most countries have closed their overall gender gaps and 217 years to close the economic gap, including workforce precipitation and salary between men and women.</p><p>Where did the United States fall on the 2017 gender gap? Well, it is in 49th place in the survey, its worst ranking in the history of the survey. Number one on the current rankings is Iceland, which recently passed legislation forcing companies to prove that any wage difference between employees is not due to gender. And on the survey's political empowerment subindex, which measures the gap between men and women at the highest levels of political decision-making, the U.S. was in the lower half of the pack, coming in at 96, between Pakistan and Vietnam.</p><p>Now, don't forget we have just launched the \"GPS\" challenge online. Every Sunday we'll post on our website 10 questions that will challenge your knowledge of the world. See how well you do.

Welcome to all of you in the United States and around the world.  I'm Fareed Zakaria, coming to you live from New York.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ZAKARIA (voice-over):  On today's show, Donald Trump meets Davos.  The America First president was in snowy Switzerland this week meeting the globalists he loves to deride.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  Why did he go?  </p><p>TRUMP:  I believe in America.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  What did he say?  </p><p>TRUMP:  America First does not mean America alone.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  What might he have learned?  We'll discuss it all with a terrific panel.  </p><p>And an exclusive interview with Benjamin Netanyahu on President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  Did that announcement dash any remaining hopes of a two-state solution or did it strengthen those hopes?  </p><p>Finally, move over Davos men, Davos woman is now running the show. The co-chairs of the World Economic Forum were all women.  </p><p>CHRISTINE LAGARDE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND: Even without testosterone we can actually produce positive constructive energy.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  But is there parody of the sexes?  I'll give you facts and figures.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZAKARIA:  But first, here is my take.  Ever since Donald Trump was elected president, I've said when he did something right, I'd say so. That's gotten me into trouble with some viewers but I'm going to do it again.  On Friday, at the World Economic Forum, Trump gave a good speech that was forthright, intelligence and conciliatory, embracing the world rather than condemning it.  If the speech represents a new approach for the president, it will be a huge step forward.  But of course, the problem with Trump is by tomorrow morning he might veer off in an entirely different direction.  </p><p>The Trump presidency so far is composed of three parts.  Trump One is the circus, the tweets, the outlandish claims, the reality TV-like show.  Trump Two is the dark populism and the demagogic assaults on minorities, the press, the judiciary and other institutions.  Trump Three is the conventional Republican president following a very standard GOP agenda, tax cuts, deregulation, the hawkish foreign policy guided by mainstream advisors, like Gary Cohn and Jim Mattis. We could be entertained by the circus, we should be appalled by the demagogue, but we have to be encouraged by Trump the Republican. That's not because I agree with the ideas he's put forth in the agenda.  I continue to think the tax cut is fiscally irresponsible, blowing a huge hole in the deficit that will starve public investment and effectively transfer government funds from the poor to the rich. On the other hand, his deregulatory push could be an important reform of an administrative state that has grown burdensome and overly complex.  </p><p>Trump's policies and his cheerleading rhetoric have, without question, boosted business confidence, which as Larry Summers has often noted is the cheapest form of economic stimulus.  </p><p>But whatever you think of the policies, the larger point is that Trump the conventional Republican is working within the American system, rather than trying to destroy it.  It's possible that the weight of the presidency and challenges of the job pushed Trump towards a more sobering responsible path.  It's also possible that Trump simply decided for now, for one day, decide with his moderate advisors.  </p><p>He often seems to be an unstable compound of Trump's one, two and three on a single day, tweeting out juvenile absurdities and lashing out, but also promoting some sensible policy.  Even at Davos, he couldn't stop himself from attacking the news media and repeatedly making false or misleading claims.  </p><p>The mood this year among the global elite at Davos was upbeat.  The world is experiencing synchronic global growth, something very rare. But underneath this good cheer, there's disquiet.  Partly because people remember their optimism just before the global recession hit. But there's also unease.  But also, while global economics looks reasonably stable, global politics is in turmoil.  The old-world order created and led by the United States is eroding and the new great powers that are entering this stage are mostly illiberal and narrow minded.  What will the world look like when China, Russia, Turkey and India, among others, have much more weight in global affairs?  </p><p>[10:05:00]  In that context, the role, capacity and intentions of the United States and its president become central.  If the American president in these times seems uncommitted to the international system, hostile to the world, indifferent to democratic values and mercurial in temper, that's especially dangerous today.  So when Trump behaves better, as he did on Friday, everyone breathes a sigh of relief.  </p><p>I don't seek to normalize Donald Trump, but I do believe that, given the stakes, America and the world are better off for these moments when he behaves more like a normal president.  </p><p>For more, go to CNN.com/Fareed and read my \"Washington Post\" column this week.</p><p>And let's get started.  </p><p>You just heard my take.  Let's see what my powerhouse panel thinks of Donald Trump's Davos debut.  In London, Zanny Minton Beddoes joins us, the editor-in-chief of \"The Economist.\"  The magazine's new edition is all about \"The Next War, The Growing Threat of Major Conflict in Today's World.\"  Rana Foroohar is in Rome today.  She's a global business columnist for the \"FT\" and CNN's global economic analyst. And with me here in New York is Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group.  </p><p>Zanny, let me ask you, you were at Davos.  I saw you there.  The mood was buoyant because of the growth.  Do the leaders deserve the credit for this synchronist global growth?  Are they right?  </p><p>ZANNY MINTON BEDDOES, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE ECONOMIST:  Well, collectively, they do deserve some credit.  I'm not sure Donald Trump deserves quite as much credit as he was taking.  But, yes, the global economy is absolutely buoyant and it's going to grow at a very strong level, very synchronized.  And I think as a result, there is in the short term quite a lot of sense of euphoria.  But underneath that, I think there are some deep concerns.  You highlighted some of them. But people breathed a sigh of relief that Donald Trump there was Trump on best behavior, Trump with the Teleprompter, and that reinforced the sense of relief and optimism and even euphoria that you had.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  Rana, the best line I know about Davos I think Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, who says, \"Davos is where billionaires tell millionaires how the middle class feels.\"  The billionaires and millionaires were very happy.  But will it translate?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST:  I can't think of a way to put it better.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  Will it translate to the middle class?  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, I think -- no, I have to agree with Jamie Dimon on this.  I think Davos is a counter indicator for how most of the population is feeling.  It's true, CEOs were buoyant.  And I spoke to many.  They are excited about the Trump tax cuts.  More than his speech, they were looking at what's been done so far.  The tax cuts and deregulation in the U.S.</p><p>My concern is really this is a short-term fix and a Band-Aid.  That tax cut didn't have a quid pro quo for the kind of real Main Street investment that we all want to see, infrastructure, long-term fixes to education, real CapEx spending.  The spending that I'm hearing that is going to be done by business is either happening in sectors not as labor intensive.  The technology sector will do a lot, but they don't employ a lot of people.  A lot of it will go into share buybacks. Again, that will bolster the wealth of the top 20 percent but that won't do a lot for the lower 80.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  Ian Bremmer, you tweeted that this is not just this speech but the last couple of speeches that Trump has given on foreign policy, he's been remarkably sensible, which means he's actually stuck to the script in the Teleprompter.  </p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP:  There's no question Teleprompter Trump is better and more acceptable international than Twitter Trump.  The problem is that Twitter Trump is who Trump really is.  When you get him off of reading other peoples' words, you then have a problem.  If he could get out of his own way -- Christine Lagarde opened Davos this year saying not only is the economy doing better than any point in the last 10 years, but Trump's tax bill is a piece of the reason for that.  If he could sit back and let the economy do its work and let his many competent advisors work, it would be fine.  The big news this week is Trump tried to fire Mueller and he was being retrained.  Continually Trump is his worst enemy.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  It's all very fascinating.</p><p>Zanny, very quickly, do you think when you listen to all this what was going on at Davos, do you think that they were giving Trump credit? In other words, particularly European CEOs, whom you know very well, they are not very -- they are hostile to Trump, openly hostile.  Did they change their minds?  </p><p>[10:09:55]  MINTON BEDDOES:  They are openly hostile to many of the things Trump does, but delighted the fact their share prices are soaring, and the American economy is booming.  And I was struck by the degree to which European CEOs were very happy to say the tax cut was great for them, too.  I think CEOs are as quick to turn their tune as anybody else.  And I thought there was a remarkably quick shift in opinion there.  I agree with Rana that much of it is not justified and, hopefully, we can get on to that.  The mood there was remarkably upbeat.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  Fascinating.  </p><p>We're going to come back and talk about something else, which is, other than Trump and geopolitics, there was a big story in Davos worth hearing about.  Rana Foroohar will explain when we come back, as will all the others.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[10:15:00]  ZAKARIA:  And we are back with \"The Economist's\" Zanny Minton Beddoes in London.  We have \"F.T.'s\" Rana Foroohar in Rome, and Ian Bremmer here in New York.  </p><p>Rana, you point out that if you look at the number of sessions, and much of the talk at Davos this year, it was about something else that people are actually very worried about.  Explain.  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  Absolutely.  A.I., big data, the digital revolution was the hot topic.  And what is interesting to me, it's been that way many years at Davos but this year you got the sense it was going way beyond the tech sector itself and going to every kind of business model.  I spoke to an insurance executive, for example, that told me sensors in cars and homes would enable his industry to write personalized policies.  That's also going to result in some kind of a digital underclass.  We've seen workers being left behind by technology.  We may see people that can't be insured or get health care policies.  </p><p>What is concerning is that the state will be, of course, left to pick up the pieces, but the state, as you've talked about in your column, and I'm talking about in my column in \"F.T.\" tomorrow, is it's very weak right now.  Politics are polarized.  Western liberal democratic states are being asked to do more than they can't.  What is interesting is more authoritarian states, like China, may actually be better positioned in the short term to manage this disruption.  But that also raises the specter of sort of an authoritarian technologically adept state that is wrecking privacy.  So lots of big political issues.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  Zanny, my sense is the tech companies at Davos, who are usually the stars of the show, are also aware that this new sense that technology is, first of all, causing a lot of job losses, might be creating these monopolies, is ushering in a new wave of feelings about how to handle technology and big tech.  </p><p>MINTON BEDDOES:  I think that's absolutely right.  Rana is completely right.  There were lots of sessions on A.I. and how it will change jobs and lose jobs.  That's been a subject for some years at Davos. For me, the two new elements of tech were that there was a really powerful sense of a tech-lash, a political backlash against the big tech companies.  The Googles, Facebooks are no longer the great shining lights of western capitalism.  They are too big, too concentrated.  And all kinds of people are worried about that.  </p><p>And the second element, also slightly more worrying, is the number of people that said to me China is ahead of us in A.I. and we have a real problem.  The sense of A.I. as something as part of a geopolitical rift between -- or struggle for supremacy between China and the U.S. </p><p>ZAKARIA:  Ian, so there's always that undercurrent at Davos, as well. Is China gaining ground?  Is the United States losing out in the key sectors?  Again, on the surface, the American boom makes that seem not true, but what's your sense?  </p><p>BREMMER:  Chinese growth is adding a hell of a lot more to the global economy than American growth is at this point, and that continues to be the case every year.  Also, Chinese technology, driven by the state, as opposed to the United States.  Trump is talking about manufacturing jobs.  He's talking about coal.  He's not talking about investing in A.I.  That's a sector the Chinese want to dominate.  I think both of those really worry the Davos group, especially because the two dominant forces in A.I. in the world today are ideologically opposed to the multilateral developmental approach of Davos.  You've got the Libertarians in Silicon Valley and you have the authoritarian state capitals of Beijing.  That unnerves the folks in a really big way.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  Rana, do you sense, as a result of all of this, you're going to have a Chinese-American clash?  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think you are.  I think you're going to have a splinter net really.  You already see China going in a different direction than not only the U.S. but Europe in terms of how they are thinking about the Internet and regulating the Internet.  Very tight ties between the state and tech firms there.  An unlimited ability to collect data.  I spoke to several western data scientists that were sort of envious about how easy it is to collect data, which is, of course, the basis of A.I., in China, even as they were worried about the authoritarian impact of all that data collection.  So it is a very disruptive time to say the least.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  And, Zanny, let me ask you, and this is television and we have a minute.  Quickly, tell me why you chose to highlight the danger of not just conflict but actually of war in \"The Economist\" this week? </p><p>MINTON BEDDOES:  Two reasons.  We think there's a growing risk of great power conflict.  One is an immediate risk, North Korea.  We have a terrific piece that shows the risk of a preventive attack by the United States is probably much greater than many people think.  And secondly, all the things we've been talking about, a rising China, taking its place in the world, plus technological changes in the nature of warfare, we think makes the risk much greater than many people realize.  </p><p>[10:20:06]  ZAKARIA:  It's a terrific cover story.  You should all read it.</p><p>Thank you all.  Fascinating panel.</p><p>When we come back, my exclusive interview from Davos with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  I'll ask him about the Iran deal, the U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem, and about his own corruption scandal.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA:  Welcome back to GPS.  I'm Fareed Zakaria, coming to you now from Davos, the small Swiss ski town that, for the last week, was home to the World Economic Forum.  Donald Trump's appearance here grabbed the biggest headlines by far.  But his fellow world leaders were out in full force.  </p><p>On Thursday, I interviewed Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu onstage at the forum.  </p><p>It was almost two months ago that President Trump announced he was recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capitol, and that he hoped to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv.  Shortly thereafter, the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to condemn America's decision. But this week, the administration doubled down.  Vice President Pence speaking at Israel's Knesset on Monday set a date saying the new embassy will open before 2019 is out.  What does it all mean for peace?  </p><p>Here is my interview with the prime minister.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[10:25:20]  ZAKARIA:  Prime Minister, pleasure to have you.  </p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRALI PRIME MINISTER:  It's good to be with you again.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  President Trump did something that I'm sure you've wanted an American president to do for a long time, which is announce that the United States will move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  And the Arab leaders whom I talked to, who are not unsympathetic to Israel at this point, say, look, the reason we're opposed to this, this should be part of a final deal.  The status of Jerusalem should not be decided arbitrarily and unilaterally.  We want this solved but in a way that helps produce some kind of a permanent settlement.  Do you understand that point that people make?  </p><p>NETANYAHU:  I understand that they say it, but I think they are wrong. Let me tell you why.  Where is my office, the prime minister's office? In Jerusalem?  Right next to us is the Knesset, our parliament.  Where is that?  In Jerusalem.  Right next to that is the Supreme Court, the only real only independent Supreme Court in a very large radius in our turbulent region.  Where is that?  In Jerusalem?  The seat of government is in Jerusalem.  This has been the case for the 70 years of Israel's existence that we're celebrating ow.  Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people since the time of King David.  That's only 3,000 years ago.  So President Trump made history by recognizing history, recognizing these indelible facts of the past and the present.  And under any peace agreement, you know that the capital of Israel will continue to Jerusalem.  And the seat of our government will continue to be in Jerusalem.  </p><p>I think, on the contrary, he did a great service for peace because peace can only be based on truth, on reality.  And denying the simple fact Israel's capital is Jerusalem is -- pushes peace backward by creating an illusion, fantasy.  You can't build peace on fantasy.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  But about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NETANYAHU:  It's a vision but it has to be grounded in reality.</p><p>ZAKARIA:  A number of Palestinians reacted to the Trump administration's decision by saying it appears that Benjamin Netanyahu is essentially signaling the end of the two-state solution, we should now move to a one-state solution.  What we now asked for, since we will never have our own state with our own capital, what we ask for is political rights since we live under Israeli sovereignty.  Mubarak (ph) said that.  Hamad Nashrali (ph) said that.  Is that a possible consequence of this, that the Palestinians will move to asking for a one-state solution?  </p><p>NETANYAHU:  I think it's a complete distortion.  I don't think they really mean it.  I think they want to govern themselves, which I don't have any problem with that.  </p><p>I'll tell you what my position is.  It's a simple one.  I haven't changed it, by the way.  From the day I gave the speech, the principles have always been the same.  The Palestinians should have all the powers to govern themselves, but none of the powers to threaten us, which means that, in any political arrangement, Israel must retain the overriding security control in the tiny area west of the Jordan, from the Jordan to the Mediterranean, because, otherwise, you'll have Daesh, ISIS come in, Hamas come in, which means Iran, and that's the end of peace.  That's the end of the Palestinian Authorities.  That's the end -- it could a perceptible, a powerful threat to the survival of Israel.  So I never mince words about that. Israel will retain the overriding security control.  But other than that, the Palestinians will be free to govern themselves.  I don't think there's a problem with that.  People say, yes, but if they don't have control over the military and security of things, that's not real sovereignty.  You can't have another country retain the military forces, you know, a former enemy.  How could that happen?  Well, how about American forces in Germany, almost 80 years after the fact, or in --  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  Japan.  </p><p>NETANYAHU:  -- Japan and so on.  </p><p>We live in a complex world.  We have a mosaic of failed states in the Middle East.  We don't want to create another failed state.  And the key fundament of stability and of success and of peace is security. Israel will maintain that security for our benefit but also for the benefit of the Palestinians.  </p><p>ZAKARIA:  You know there are a number of people that say the problem with no progress on this issue is that, over time, you will have a vast number of Palestinians who live under Israeli sovereignty and, in that circumstance, Israel will not be able to be Jewish and democratic, that in other words, it will lose its democratic character because it will be ruling over a large group of people without giving them rights, or it will lose its Jewish character because of the number of Palestinians will overwhelm the number of Israeli Jews. </p><p>ZAKARIA:  Do you -- do you buy that trade-off? </p><p>NETANYAHU:  I think there is a third option. I don't think we necessarily -- I don't want to annex the Palestinians as citizens of Israel, and I don't want to have them as our subjects. They can live in their own sphere, govern themselves with their own powers, their own parliament, their own flag, their -- embassies, what have you, the whole trappings, except the powers that are needed that we need to retain in order to protect ourselves. </p><p>And this is not a gimmick. It's not a spin. It's real. This is the kind of arrangement that we have to...</p><p>ZAKARIA:  But what country has ever done that? </p><p>You talk about Germany and Japan. Germany and Japan have -- have control over their military. They're not -- I mean, you're not -- if you were to give the Palestinians the deal the Germans got after World War II, the Palestinians would be happy. I mean, that's...</p><p>NETANYAHU:  No, actually, they say, \"We don't want any residual forces and residual military presence beyond, I don't know, two or three years.\" It's now going on 80 years that -- that the Americans are there. </p><p>ZAKARIA:  But Germany had -- you know, Germany has full sovereignty in its -- in military and defense. </p><p>NETANYAHU:  Well, I think that, when the Palestinians demonstrate that they can, you know, they can actually govern those territories and not have them taken over by Hamas or by ISIS, then come and ask me again.</p><p>ZAKARIA:  Is Jared Kushner going to make peace in the Middle East? </p><p>NETANYAHU:  If the Palestinians...</p><p>ZAKARIA:  President Trump says that he -- that he has a chance of doing it.</p><p>NETANYAHU:  Look, it's a very able team that the president has. They have many, many abilities. The thing that people don't realize is that these people have made their mark in the markets in real estate. Now, this is not only a real estate deal; it's fundamentally not a real estate deal but a problem of recognizing Israel's existence, the problem of not recognizing a Jewish state in any boundary. But it also has its real estate elements. And they're, I have to say, very creative, you know, and I wait to see what they'll put down, but I don't rule it out. Because I think we need peace. I think the Palestinians need peace. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA:  Next on \"GPS,\" Iran. President Trump has said he has waived sanctions against that nation for the last time unless European allies get tougher on Iran. Has Obama's nuclear deal reached the beginning of its end? I'll ask Prime Minister Netanyahu when we come back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA:  The president said something quite dramatic recently, that he was not going to renew the waiver of sanctions on Iran, which means that, at some point, it is quite possible that the United States will unilaterally withdraw from the Iran deal. Then Iran would have the option, presumably, of beginning to enrich uranium again, go down a path, a nuclear path, again. </p><p>Isn't that a bad outcome for Israel? </p><p>NETANYAHU:  No. I think that the present deal is so deeply flawed that it guarantees that Iran will have what it needs to make nuclear weapons, including enrichment of fissile material, on a vast scale. This is what is problematic with the deal. It just gives them a timeline and it says, within X years, eight years, whatever, from now... </p><p>ZAKARIA:  But wouldn't it be better for you to have heard it be 15 years from now than next month? </p><p>NETANYAHU:  No, because what they can do today is at best enrich uranium for one weapon. Under the deal, they will be able to enrich uranium for 100, 200 bombs, and that's...</p><p>ZAKARIA:  Fifteen years from now?</p><p>NETANYAHU:  Maybe eight or 10. And they could break out, \"let's rush create a nuclear -- an arsenal of nuclear weapons,\" unimpeded by any international agreement. In fact, the agreement lets them do it. </p><p>So this is why the deal is so bad, because it gives Iran, the preeminent terrorist state of our time, the wherewithal to produce nuclear weapons, nuclear bombs. They could give it to proxies, terrorists; they could use it themselves. That's where we don't want to get to. </p><p>So I don't particularly care if they fix the deal or if they cancel the deal, keep it or nix it. The important part for me is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear arsenal, because Iran not only spreads terror worldwide; Iran openly says that it's going to use those weapons and use every weapon they have to annihilate Israel. We're not going to let that happen. </p><p>ZAKARIA:  When you talk to European leaders, certainly when I've talked to European leaders, and certainly their public statements, they say they support the deal; they do not see any reason to amend it. They believe Iran is in compliance with the deal and they think it produces stability. </p><p>So when you talk to them and say \"Fix the deal,\" do they tell you, \"Yes, we're going to fix the deal,\" or do they say what they're saying publicly, which is, \"The deal is good; there's no -- there's nothing to -- no fixing needs to be done?\" </p><p>NETANYAHU:  Well, I'll tell you what I tell them, you know...</p><p>ZAKARIA:  What I'm hoping is you'll tell me what they tell you privately. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>NETANYAHU:  Well, I'm sure you do. But I can say that the fact that they signed a bad deal doesn't mean that they have to keep a bad deal. In history, when you've had instances of nations signing very bad deals and living, if they manage to live, to regret it -- there was such a deal, by the way, most recently with North Korea. They had a deal. Everybody said, \"That's it, you know, the North Koreans will keep the deal and it will prevent North Korea from having nuclear weapons; they will join the community of nations.\" So much for that. </p><p>ZAKARIA:  But wouldn't we all...</p><p>NETANYAHU:  They signed a deal. </p><p>ZAKARIA:  Wouldn't we wish for a deal, given that there are inspectors in Iran; given that it's much more difficult to -- are you comfortable with an Iran that -- where there's no deal and it can do whatever it wants to...</p><p>NETANYAHU:  I don't think -- I don't think it can do everything. First of all, the inspections are -- are deeply flawed because Iran says you cannot inspect military sites. So if you're the Iranian regime, where do you think you're going to do your weaponization? Where do you think you're going to do the other elements of a secret nuclear program? In military sites. But they say you can't inspect it. This is one example of how flawed this deal is. </p><p>Secondly, look, Iran doesn't rush forward to make nuclear weapons because they can suffer crippling sanctions. That brought them to --- to their senses last time, a number of times. Second, they also might think, correctly, that if they try to rush for a bomb, there will be countries that would prevent them. I don't want to speak in the name of another country, but I guarantee you I speak in my name; we will not let them acquire a nuclear weapon. </p><p>ZAKARIA:  When you look at the Middle East -- you and I have talked about this before -- it seems as though...</p><p>NETANYAHU:  And, by the way, the Arab states -- again, unnamed -- the Arab states, unnamed, agree with me. </p><p>ZAKARIA:  So we are just about to name them. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>It seems as though...</p><p>NETANYAHU:  You want to name the unnamed states? </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ZAKARIA:  Exactly.</p><p>NETANYAHU:  Go ahead, name the unnamed states. </p><p>ZAKARIA:  It seems as though Israel is today in a closer strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia and Egypt than at any point in its history, and that at this point, that is the defining feature of the Middle East, a kind of anti-Iran alliance in which Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Israel are the crucial players. Would you agree? </p><p>NETANYAHU:  I'd agree that there is an alignment of Israel and other countries in the Middle East that would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. And certainly, in my lifetime, I never saw anything like it, and I'm at the age of the state of Israel, more or less, so it's an extraordinary thing. </p><p>Yes, it starts with a common concern with a common enemy, which is radical Islam, either of the radical Sunnis, Daesh, before that Al Qaida, which Israel fights, and has prevented, by the way, dozens of terrorist, major terrorist attacks not only in the Middle East but throughout the world and saved the lives of many, many citizens, because our intel is second to none, and also our common stance against Iran. </p><p>That's one source. What is not recognized is that there is another source of this closeness and it's their desire to make use of the civilian technology that Israel has, in water or in agriculture, or in I.T. and other areas to better the lives -- health -- to better the lives of their citizens. I view that as a great promise for peace. I think it's changing attitudes not only on the level of the regimes. We poll the Arab world; we see the beginning of changes, significant change in the attitude towards Israel in the Arab publics -- not all of them, and not yet majorities, but significant minorities. That's hope. That's a future of peace. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA:  Up next, I'll ask Prime Minister Netanyahu about himself, specifically the criminal probes that are swirling around him and his associates. He has already been questioned numerous times by Israeli authorities. What happens next? </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ZAKARIA:  \"There will be nothing because there is nothing.\" That's a quote not from Donald Trump about the Russia investigation but from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It's become a mantra of sorts for him when he's asked to comment on the investigations swirling around him. </p><p>The Israeli police named Netanyahu a suspect in two cases involving bribery, fraud and breach of trust. He's been interviewed multiple times by authorities and his former chief of staff agreed last summer to testify against Prime Minister Netanyahu. </p><p>Here, again, Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA:  Mr. Prime Minister, you -- you will understand I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask this question. It's about your own political future. You face in Israel serious investigations. How should the world see this? Should the world look at this and say, \"This is Israeli democracy at work, where no one is above the law, above scrutiny, above investigation, or do you regard this as a political witch hunt?\"</p><p>NETANYAHU:  Well, no one is above the law in Israel, and that's the case in this case, too. But I'm also confident that nothing will come of it because there's nothing to come out. So I think that it's just a question of time. And next year -- yeah, invite me next year; we'll do it once a year...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>... and you'll see if I'm proven right. You'll see that I am.</p><p>ZAKARIA:  Finally, you just came back from a trip to India. </p><p>NETANYAHU:  Yeah. </p><p>ZAKARIA:  Tell us what is it that all these countries that you have now been going to that are deepening their ties with Israel -- what is it that they are trying to get from Israel?</p><p>NETANYAHU:  Two things: they want security, protection against terrorism. And Israel is second to none in providing this valuable intelligence that has also prevented, for example, planes from being blown out in the sky. That's not only a problem for the country that suffers that tragedy but for all international civil aviation. Israel has been the leading force to protect the lives and the -- the critical facilities of many, many states. That's the first thing. Everybody wants that. Because the firmaments of -- the sparks of radical Islam are flying into every continent and to every country.</p><p>The second thing that they want is the future. It's not only to push back the bad; it's to seize the good. We're in a world of tremendous change. I mean, you've been talking about it. It's basically the confluence of big data, artificial intelligence and connectivity that's changing industries. Israel has a car industry within a matter of years. We make -- 85 percent of the value of a car is soon going to be software. And all the other stuff, you know, the body, the chassis, the tires, the engine, that's minuscule. So essentially cars are computers on wheels. Now we have a car industry, because there we compete.</p><p>So an Israeli company, right next to my office in Jerusalem, has just been sold to Intel for $15 billion for autonomous vehicle technology. This technology is produced in Israel, but Israel is also not only an I.T. power; it's a water -- water power. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NETANYAHU:  No, not only that; we -- we recycle almost 90 percent of our waste water. The runner-up is Spain with about 20 percent, just to understand. So if you're a country that needs water and you can recycle your waste water, you come to Israel. So this is -- this is a revolution. Israel, you know, we're working to build up the life of the Jewish state and afford us a future of prosperity and progress and peace. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAKARIA:  Next week on \"GPS,\" don't miss my interview with King Abdullah II of Jordan, here in Davos. Mark your calendars.  Next up, today on \"GPS,\" many years ago the political scientist Samuel Huntington coined the term \"Davos man\" to describe the average attendee at the World Economic Forum here in Davos. But in this era of further female empowerment, is \"Davos man\" making way for \"Davos woman?\" This year the seven co-chairs of the meeting were all women. Was it just window dressing? When we come back.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ZAKARIA:  My book of the week is Christopher Hayes' \"Twilight of the Elites.\" I happened to bring Hayes' brilliant book along with me to read while milling around the World Economic Forum with Davos men and Davos women. It's a highly intelligent and even profound reflection on the problems with our current system of meritocracy that has so divided almost all our societies. </p><p>And now, the last look from here in Davos, where there is some history being made. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It's fascinating to see...</p><p>ZAKARIA (voice over):  All seven of the gathering's co-chairs this year are women. They're top leaders in business, finance, science and social entrepreneurship. </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  You have to talk about prosperity. </p><p>ZAKARIA:  All seven co-chairs gathered on stage at an opening session, and one of them, the IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, quipped that something was out of the ordinary. </p><p>CHRISTINE LAGARDE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, IMF:  But it's a bit of a change from the \"manels\" panels...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>... that have been had on occasions.</p><p>ZAKARIA:  But progress in gender at the top of Davos doesn't fully trickle down to the ranks of attendees. The World Economic Forum itself admits 21 percent of this year's 3,000 participants are women. While that's an improvement over past years, several female attendees voiced their frustration at the lopsided gender balance in these halls. </p><p>The WEF's gender gap report is an annual publication that charts the progress of more than 100 countries toward gender equality. The most recent report for 2017 notes that the global gender gap has overall widened for the first time since they started measuring more than a decade ago. </p><p>The report also suggests that, based on current data, it will be 100 years before most countries have closed their overall gender gaps and 217 years to close the economic gap, including workforce precipitation and salary between men and women. </p><p>Where did the United States fall on the 2017 gender gap? Well, it is in 49th place in the survey, its worst ranking in the history of the survey. Number one on the current rankings is Iceland, which recently passed legislation forcing companies to prove that any wage difference between employees is not due to gender. And on the survey's political empowerment subindex, which measures the gap between men and women at the highest levels of political decision-making, the U.S. was in the lower half of the pack, coming in at 96, between Pakistan and Vietnam. </p><p>Now, don't forget we have just launched the \"GPS\" challenge online. Every Sunday we'll post on our website 10 questions that will challenge your knowledge of the world. See how well you do.

Brendan Carr is an FCC Commissioner.  He just wrote his own op-ed responding to Mark Zuckerberg and he joins us tonight.  Brendan, thank you very much for coming on.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRENDAN CARR, FCC COMMISSIONER:  Thanks.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So the big tech companies would like free speech regulated by government.  What could go wrong?  </p><p>CARR:  It's pretty remarkable actually.  So if you think about it, Facebook has been under mounting scrutiny recently for a number of its practices -- how it protects your online data, how it shares that data, and most directly now, how it moderates online speech.  Lawmakers and the public have been asking a lot of serious questions about what they let you say on the platform, and the posts they let you see on the platform.  </p><p>In response to that pushback, Facebook has come up with a new idea that heads in a totally wrong direction.  It wants the government to step in and start policing your online speech for it and look, outsourcing government censorship -- outsourcing censorship to the government isn't just a bad idea, it's a violation of the First Amendment, so I'm a no on that.  </p><p>CARLSON:  So, and Amen.  And I'm glad that finally someone at the FCC -- I know there are others, but not enough -- is taking that very sensible constitutional position.  But what about the original deal with the internet where we give these companies an exemption?  They're not news companies.  They are platforms, Congress has said that.  And their job is just to let people say what they want as long as it's not illegal, they're not selling drugs, right?  Or guns or peddling kiddie porn?  Why don't we go back to that?  </p><p>CARR:  That's right.  We want an approach that's going to promote a robust exchange of views.  And what Facebook is talking about here is not targeting illegal content.  What it described was harmful content.  So this is content that is fully protected by the First Amendment.  It's invited regimes, not just the government here in the U.S., but abroad to step in and start shutting down ideas that it doesn't like under the rubric of it being harmful speech.  </p><p>One example that Mark Zuckerberg gave was speech on immigration.  He said that speech on a divisive political issue, and if you're online advocating an issue position on immigration, the government should start regulating that speech.  </p><p>And look, Mark Zuckerberg has a very loud platform, a big platform to express his own views on immigration and hot button issues.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Of course.  </p><p>CARR:  So then to step in and call for everyday Americans when they are advocating for those issues online, for the government to step in and police that, I think that's a bad idea.  </p><p>CARLSON:  But Mark Zuckerberg is one of the richest people in the world and he has paid to lobby for open borders, not just speak, but influence our lawmakers, but you aren't allowed to?  I just wonder, taking three steps back, how did we get here?  Zuckerberg grew up in the United States.  Most of these people did.  This is a constitutional republic.  Number one in the Bill of Rights is freedom of speech.  They seem totally unaware of that.  Why?  </p><p>CARR:  What's interesting, I've been a regular at the FCC for a number of years, and I can tell you, when large corporations come in and start calling for greater government control, they're not doing it as an act of charity.  </p><p>Facebook right now is a company that's worth a half a trillion dollars.  It's got a leading position in the market.  It didn't find religion and regulation until it established that dominant position.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Exactly.  </p><p>CARR:  They have 30,000 people right now.  They're doing content and security review.  So calling for this heavy-handed government regulatory regime is going to wreck an economic moat that only makes it harder for startups to compete in this space.  </p><p>CARLSON:  That's exactly right.  This is the real protectionism right there.  </p><p>CARR:  Yes.  </p><p>CARLSON:  Thank you so much for that.  Good to see you.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-584525</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW4-S761-JBSW-71D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"711\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal News Service, Inc.

If it weren't for double standards, I'm not sure Twitter would have much.</p><p>You know, when you look right now, it's not so much that they have sort of a COVID misinformation policy, which we saw this week when they took down tweets from Donald Trump Jr.</p><p>If you go on Twitter right now, you can see tweets up from Democratic Congressman Swalwell that says don't wear masks. You can go on Twitter right now, today, and see tweets from the WHO that says there's no real evidence of human-to-human transmission of COVID.</p><p>So it's less about a misinformation policy, it appears, than an orange man bad policy. And it's playing fast and loose in arbitrary ways. And so I think some of the concerns you heard at that hearing yesterday are pretty well founded.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm wondering what the solution is, though. A lot of people say, all right, if you're going to check conservatives on things that they're saying, you should check liberals on things that they're saying. Others say it's the Wild West, anyone can say whatever they want and, you know, reader, viewer beware.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>CARR: Yes, if you go back to the hearing yesterday, I think what was interesting there was bipartisan consensus, which is rare in this town, as you know --</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>CARR: -- that a lot of these big tech companies are abusing dominant positions in the market. Not just participating in the free market, but taking advantage of a level of a playing field that has been skewed by government regulation, including section 230.</p><p>The interesting debate is, what do you do about it. I think the Democrats have their path forward. They want to break up big tech. They want to block mergers and they want to see less speech on the Internet.</p><p>What's interesting is, I think on the Republican side, and for conservatives, which is really a -- a -- part of a broader debate about what we do. There's some that say we should just sit on our hands and do absolutely nothing in the face of this abuse of massive power.</p><p>I think that we should do more than nothing. I've laid out a path forward where we can work towards transparency, accountability, and user empowerment that will make a lot of progress on these issues.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you worry, though, Commissioner, because then Democrats have their own beefs, as you know, with a lot of these guys, that they do very little -- did very little to explain and report on foreign election interference in our country, on -- that they're doing it all over again. That's a lot of things these guys supposedly have to do to police themselves.</p><p>Should they do that? In other words, whether it's offensive on the left or the right, that these are great public forums, whatever you make of them, and that the government getting involved in policing them will only make matters worse.</p><p>CARR: Yes, I don't think that the government should step in, and we shouldn't step in at the FCC, and micro-manage these decisions. What we have is Congress passed this law, as you know, Section 230 in the 1990s. That gave a special set of protections to what's now big tech and all other websites.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>CARR: And the question is, how do we interpret that law today? Can we do it in a way that promotes more speech, not less speech?</p><p>Again, I don't want to be micro-managing these decisions. We shouldn't be trying to skew the speech right or left. But like every business in this country, there should be some transparency and accountability.</p><p>If you say voluntarily we are a neutral platform politically, for all the take-downs that we do, we don't do partisan political take-downs. And then if, in fact, you're doing that, you should be held accountable.</p><p>In fact, we do that with broadband Internet providers today. We make them be transparent about anything they do to mold traffic or discriminate against traffic. That should be the baseline at a minimum for big tech. Let's make them be transparent and hold them accountable to their representations.</p><p>CAVUTO: FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, thank you very much. Very good chatting with you.</p><p>CARR: Thanks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAVUTO-2020073001cb223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAVUTO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GB-19N1-JB20-G002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">347932</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CAVUTO</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It`s MEET THE PRESS.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: From NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history. This is MEET THE PRESS WITH CHUCK TODD.</p><p>TODD: Good Sunday morning.</p><p>Five and a half weeks after 17 people were murdered in that mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, hundreds of thousands of people led and inspired by students, marched in more than 800 cities and towns around the country and the world against gun violence. Now, we`ve seen marches for civil rights, for women, for the Tea Party.</p><p>But this is a first on the issue of guns. The largest of the gatherings was right here in Washington D.C., where students from Marjory Stoneman High School issued a challenge to members of Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DELANEY TARR, STUDENT, STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL: They know that if there is no assault weapons ban passed, then we will vote them out. They know that if there is no tightening of the background checks, we will vote them out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: We`re going to have much more on the debate over guns in America later, when we bring you my discussions with seven people in Madison, Wisconsin, gun owners and opponents, on how to prevent gun violence while still respecting and abiding by the Second Amendment. It`s all part of the NBC News series \"SOLUTIONS: GUN VIOLENCE\".</p><p>But we`re going to begin this show with a president who increasingly seems to embrace crisis, chaos, and confrontation as his White House management style.</p><p>In just the last two-plus weeks, President Trump has added or promoted four men to his team, all of whom the president considers to be fighters, replacing people who told him things he didn`t want to hear. And Mr. Trump is gearing up for many fights, against China on trade, against North Korea and its nuclear program, against Iran and the nuclear deal struck by President Obama and U.S. allies, against Robert Mueller and the Russia investigation, and against Stormy Daniels and her claim of a sexual affair.</p><p>To some Americans, President Trump`s staff changes and legal changes mean the world just got a lot more dangerous. To others, he just did what was necessary to get tough with his and the country`s adversaries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD: Mr. Trump is reveling in the chaos he creates and testing his limits.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You`re fired. Get the hell out of here. I made a lot of money with that phrase.</p><p>TODD: This week, the president continued to dismiss advisors who would put up guard rails on Iran and North Korea, on trade, and on his own legal defense, replacing them with a combative, cable-news-ready team eager to say yes to his first instincts.</p><p>On Thursday morning, the president`s chief lawyer handling the Mueller probe, John Dowd, resigned. After Mr. Trump made it clear he was bringing in a more aggressive attorney, a frequent commentator on Fox News, Joe DiGenova, who has pushed this conspiracy theory on television.</p><p>DIGENOVA: Make no mistake about it: a group of FBI and DOJ people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely-created crime.</p><p>STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: I think President Trump`s going to war. I think it`s very obvious he`s going to go to war on this.</p><p>TODD: The president suggested that at least for now, he plans to ignore Dowd`s advice against sitting down with the special counsel.</p><p>REPORTER: Would you still like to testify to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, sir?</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you.</p><p>REPORTER: You would?</p><p>TRUMP: I would like to.</p><p>TODD: By Thursday evening, National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster was out. Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton was in, hearing of the announcement appropriately enough while on TV.</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: I think I still am a Fox News contributor.</p><p>MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS HOST: No, you`re not, apparently.</p><p>BOLTON: I didn`t really expect that announcement.</p><p>TODD: Bolton is an advocate of regime change in Iran and North Korea, recently calling a preemptive strike in North Korea \"perfectly legitimate.\"</p><p>BOLTON: I think that their history over decades is that they, like Iran, like others, use negotiations to buy time to conceal their nuclear weapons and ballistic missile activities.</p><p>TODD: And he continues to defend his support of the Iraq War, which the president campaigned against.</p><p>TRUMP: The war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake, all right?</p><p>TODD: But the president has long been enamored with TV-friendly advisors.</p><p>Who do you talk to for military advice right now?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I watch the shows. I mean, I like Bolton. I think he`s, you know, a tough cookie, knows what he`s talking about.</p><p>TODD: Mr. Trump`s shifting moods and willingness to be guided by Fox News and other conservative commentators is creating confusion inside the White House.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Trump`s top aides declared victory on the congressional spending bill.</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT &amp; BUDGET: Is the President going to sign the bill? The answer is yes.</p><p>TODD: But on Friday morning, the president tweeted that his answer might be no, threatening a veto after many on Fox News tore the bill apart.</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: This is not what the president promised.</p><p>TODD: Then the president held an event to announce that actually, he was signing the bill anyway.</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO HOST: I`m feeling like I just saw Donald Trump get on the escalator and go back up.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD: Well, joining me now from Manchester, New Hampshire, is President Trump`s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. And you, of course, wrote -- co-authored a book that said, let Trump Be Trump.</p><p>So, we figured, why not talk to Mr. Lewandowski about this. Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS, sir.</p><p>COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Thank you, Chuck. Thanks for having me.</p><p>TODD: So, what does the reshuffling underway at the White House -- how -- you know this man very well, you spent over a year traveling the country with him. What`s he up to?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Well, what this is is the president again continuing to follow through on the promises that he made on the campaign trail which is putting America first. And when he brings in new individuals, he takes information from all of the people around him and then listens to those positions and then he makes the final decision.</p><p>But what you have to have inside the building are people who are on the president`s agenda. Whether that means this president is implementing steel and aluminum tariffs.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: if you`re not on that agenda, you might not want to be in the building. If this means that we`re going to ensure that there is no continuation of nuclear weapons in North Korea, then you`re going to have to make sure you`re in the building, and you`re listening and you`re part of the president`s team. So, he is bringing people in who are on his team to make sure that his agenda is moving forward.</p><p>TODD: So, your advice to anybody that disagrees with the president`s agenda, \"get out.\"</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: No, no, not at all. I completely disagree with that. You can have a disagreement with the president. He wants to have conversations on all sides. But when the decision is made, you have to be on the team because the president is the final arbiter.</p><p>TODD: So, if you disagree with the decision, don`t leak, get out, I guess is what you`re saying, though? You`re saying, you can disagree with him, but once he makes a decision, you better support it, and if you don`t, then you should leave?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Well, Chuck, what I`m saying here is it`s the president`s final call. And, you know, if you`re a staff member, you have to be on the president`s team, and you can disagree privately, but publicly, it`s very problematic.</p><p>And look, what we saw this week was a leak of a conversation between the president of the United States and Vladimir Putin from someone within the deep state and that is very, very concerning to the American people that that information is being made public.</p><p>TODD: Leaked from the deep state? So, an aide to the president might be part of the deep state? Is that what you believe?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: I absolutely believe that it came from someone within that building. There are very few people who are aware of the briefing document that the president was provided, and very few people were aware of the actual conversation that took place. And I think there should be accountability.</p><p>TODD: Let me ask you this. Where did Rex Tillerson go wrong?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Well, look, Rex had a fundamental different philosophy when it came to American relationships abroad, specifically as it relates to the nuclear deal. He thought it was a good deal. And the president has said many times it was a bad deal.</p><p>And the president has said, particularly as it came to North Korea, that he was going to continue to put pressure on North Korea and that finally, the president was willing to sit down with Kim Jong-un, and Rex didn`t think that that was the right decision.</p><p>TODD: Where did H.R. McMaster go wrong?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Well, I think where H.R. McMaster went wrong is, you know, you`ve got-- you had a number of generals in the building with H.R. McMaster and General Kelly. And I think H.R. McMaster was the individual in the building who was advocating for a larger presence in Afghanistan, which the president had talked about during the campaign that he wasn`t in favor of. And more intervention on behalf of the military, and that`s not where this president is.</p><p>TODD: Let me ask you about John Kelly, because here`s what you told me. You actually were on the show, I think, the week that it was announced that he was going to become the next chief of staff. Here`s what you told me at the time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: I think General Kelly is going to restore order to the staff. General Kelly is going to bring the type of discipline to the staff to ensure that the leaks are stopped and that the president`s agenda is foremost of what takes place in that building. So, there`ll be no more backbiting, there`ll be no more stabbing each other in the back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Well, that was July 30th of last year. How`s John Kelly done?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Well, I think, by and large, General Kelly has done a good job in trying to control those leaks. You know, what we`ve seen for an extended period of time --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: What about this week? I mean, you just railed against --</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Well, this week--</p><p>TODD: -- a major, problematic leak.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Oh, Chuck, I agree with you. And I`m telling you, I think General Kelly, he has publicly said how frustrated he has been. They`re getting to the bottom of it. And now what you`ve seen is you`ve seen the change at the National Security Council. You`ve seen a change at National Economic Council.</p><p>And what I hope both John Bolton and Larry Kudlow bring in is a team which is on the president`s agenda. And if they find individuals who are leaking information, I hope they terminate those people immediately. You cannot be in the building and be leaking information about this president and expect to be able to keep your job.</p><p>TODD: You ever counsel the president to fire John Kelly?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: No, I never have.</p><p>TODD: Do you think he`s doing a good job? There`s a lot of people that attribute the idea that you think John Kelly doesn`t have the president`s best interests at heart. Where, where are you on him?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: No, look, I, I think -- I`ve said this very, very publicly and I`ll repeat it again and say John Kelly is an American patriot and he has done a fantastic job serving his country. He has recognized how difficult a job it is to be the chief of staff to the president of the United States.</p><p>And, and I don`t believe it`s General Kelly`s job to manage the president. His job is to manage the staff. And that`s what he has been doing. And that`s what he continues to do.</p><p>We`ve seen additional staff changes this week with Chris Liddell being named the deputy chief of staff to bring more order. We`ve seen an increase in the portfolio of Johnny DeStefano inside the White House, an individual who has enormous respect to both the president and General Kelly. Those are very important changes.</p><p>TODD: Steve Bannon suggested this week that if there won`t -- if John Kelly leaves, there won`t be a replacement, that the president will essentially be his own chief of staff, a little bit -- more, more like he managed the Trump Organization. Do you concur with that view?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Look, I think that`s a, a scenario that could very well play out. You know, we know that John F. Kennedy didn`t have a chief of staff his entire presidency. He had it for a period of time.</p><p>Jimmy Carter to a lesser extent, the same thing.</p><p>But the difference with this president is, he is the decision maker and he loves to have all the information brought to him. I see him as the hub with a number of spokes coming out.</p><p>And candidly -- and I`m not advocating for General Kelly to leave, I think he should stay. But if he were to go, I don`t think there is one person who is the chosen one to step in and fill that role. So I could see a scenario where the president is giving instructions to a small, core group of individuals who are then implementing on his behalf.</p><p>TODD: And you think at the end of the day that`s what the president would prefer? That that`s a -- that`s a more comfortable way that he likes to run things?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: I do think the president likes to opportunity to get input from as many people as possible, and that small group, call it four, five, six people, who can come in and report directly to the president and then go implement his agenda, is something that he`s very comfortable with over his 40 years of business experience doing that.</p><p>TODD: Have you met with the special counsel Robert Mueller? I know you`ve testified before the Senate and the House Intel investigations. What about the special counsel?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Look, I have said very candidly, I`ll be happy to speak with the special counsel if they`d like to do that. I`ve been very open about - - I volunteered to testify for 12 hours in front of the House Committee. I`ve testified in front of the Senate Committee and I`ll make myself available, because I was there at the very beginning of the campaign. There was no collusion.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: Have they asked for you yet though? Have they asked for you?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Not yet. No. No, they haven`t yet, Chuck.</p><p>TODD: You`ve not been subpoenaed? Nothing? OK. LEWANDOWSKI: I have -- nope. I have not been subpoenaed. And, look, there`s no reason to subpoena me because I`m willing to volunteer if they want to ask me questions. I`ll be happy to answer their questions because I have nothing to hide and I was there from the beginning, so I know there was no collusion.</p><p>TODD: Yes, but you weren`t there at the end, at the end of the day. Are you confident--</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: No, that`s exactly right. I wasn`t there at the end.</p><p>TODD: Are you confident -- are you confident that between June 21st, 2016, after -- you left on June 20th -- that there is no collusion took place on that campaign? Can you definitively say that?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Look, I can say that during my tenure, Chuck, which is all I can speak to, I saw no Russians.</p><p>TODD: It`s your tenure. So you can`t speak to anything after June 20th, 2016?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Well, I wasn`t there. And, you know, what Paul Manafort did or others may or may not have done, I wouldn`t have any access to that information. But what I have said was, if anybody did collude with the Russians in any way, shape, or form to impact the election, they should go to jail for the rest of their lives.</p><p>TODD: Did you know when Cambridge Analytica was pitching you, and I know you -- it wasn`t until very late that you finally approved a contract, I believe, did you know that Steve Bannon --</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: No, no I never -- Chuck, I never approved, I never approved Cambridge Analytica`s contract. They did not work for the campaign when I was the manager. So we have to be clear about that.</p><p>They pitched me three times, three times I said no. They did not come to the campaign until after I left.</p><p>TODD: Were you aware if Steve Bannon was a founding executive of Cambridge Analytica when you met with them three times?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: I knew that Steve had a role in the organization. I didn`t know what his ultimate role was. But that didn`t impact my decision because I didn`t hire them. They came to me three times, looking to be a vendor, and I said no all three times.</p><p>TODD: But you didn`t know he was a founding executive? You didn`t know he owned a piece? You didn`t know any of those things at the time when he was chairman of \"Breitbart News\"?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Correct. I did not know that that was his role in Cambridge Analytica. Correct.</p><p>TODD: All right. Corey Lewandowski, I`m going to leave it there. Corey, thanks very much. Appreciate you coming on and sharing your views, sir.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Thank you.</p><p>TODD: Joining me now is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, it`s Mark Warner of Virginia.</p><p>Senator Warner, welcome back to the show, sir.</p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA), SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Thank you.</p><p>TODD: I want to start first with all of the changes that we`ve seen take place. And I want to put up a quote from Charlie Dent, a retiring Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania, more center-right than conservative-right, but he said this: The spontaneity and lack of impulse control are areas of concern for lots of members on both sides of the aisle. Disorder, chaos, instability, uncertainty, and tempered statements are not conservative virtues, in my opinion.</p><p>This was Charlie Dent reacting to all of the changes this week. What do you make of the changes?</p><p>WARNER: I think he`s right. This chaos is not the way you run an organization. I was a business executive for 20 years. I ran a state. It was called the best-managed state in the nation when I was governor of Virginia.</p><p>But with this president, I think he thrives on chaos. Maybe that`s the way to run a reality TV show. It`s not the way to run the greatest country in the world.</p><p>TODD: At the end of the day, should it-- there`s a lot of folks not happy with the instability. But he`s comfortable with it. Should that matter?</p><p>WARNER: Well, I think at the end of the day, when he took the oath of office, it was to protect and defend the Constitution and our country.</p><p>I think we are more vulnerable by having, you know, taking out and not consulting with our allies. I think we are more vulnerable when you`ve got a president that wakes up every morning and even his closest advisors don`t know what he`s going to say or do. I think we are more vulnerable when the president of the United States calls Vladimir Putin and, John McCain`s words, not mine, congratulates a dictator on a sham election.</p><p>I don`t think that makes our country safer. And frankly, when the president of the United States, who still refuses to acknowledge Russian intervention, on that call, doesn`t raise election security or doesn`t stand up for our closest allies in the U.K.--</p><p>TODD: Why do you think he`s doing that?</p><p>WARNER: You know, Chuck, I gave up --</p><p>TODD: You`ve looked at a lot of evidence.</p><p>WARNER: I gave up predicting this president a long time ago. I do know this, that when the president doesn`t act, others do have to act.</p><p>For example, election security. The Russians hacked into our elections, they scanned or broke into 21 states, every one of the president`s top security advisors have said they`ll be back. Yet, they received no direction from the White House to make election security a top priority.</p><p>TODD: So, do you believe --</p><p>WARNER: So, this week, this week bipartisan, our committee came out with, you know -- let`s make sure we`ve got paper trail on every election, let`s make sure we help states better information sharing.</p><p>So, if the president`s not going to act to protect the country, in this case, Congress is actually stepping up.</p><p>TODD: Do you believe the president`s somehow acting as if he`s compromised with Putin?</p><p>WARNER: It is more than bizarre that 14 months into this president`s administration, he has failed to ever call out Russia. He has failed to ever condemn Putin, even after Putin was accused of killing a British individual of a Russian-British individual in the U.K. There is something just strange about this. And I think it is one of the reasons why Mueller`s investigation has to continue and why our investigation has to continue.</p><p>TODD: Let me ask you about Facebook. Do you think they`ve been truthful and forthcoming?</p><p>WARNER: I don`t think Facebook has been fully forthcoming. I called out Facebook back in December of `16. In the spring of `17, I questioned micro-targeting and the use of this really sketchy firm Cambridge Analytica. Early on, for most of 2017, they blew that off. They then, during the summer, acknowledged that there was paid advertising. But more importantly, that there were a number of Russian accounts --</p><p>TODD: Right WARNER: -- that were fake accounts that spread information, that touched 150 million Americans.</p><p>TODD: Do you have concern that Cambridge Analytica, founding executive of Steve Bannon, their financial sort of rainmaker are the Mercer family. If you hire Cambridge Analytica, you`ve got Mercer money. And that somehow this -- and then you had Steve Bannon was also the chairman of a news organization, and they`re getting Facebook data.</p><p>WARNER: Hold, Chuck, that`s only part of it.</p><p>TODD: Yes, I mean, are you concerned --</p><p>WARNER: Their CEO, their CEO --</p><p>TODD: -- that all of this is -- was designed almost to create, I don`t know, to create something -- to weaponize something that we weren`t aware of? When you throw a media company with this political consulting firm?</p><p>WARNER: What we saw in 2016 was the broad weaponization of information by Russians and unfortunately using some other tools. This same firm --</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>WARNER: -- their recently disgraced CEO reached out to Julian Assange about leaked emails. This same firm reached out to a Russian oil company, Lukoil, about working on trying to get American election data. And this firm has a reputation -- it`s been in more than 30 countries where it`s been using disruptive tactics. Why would this firm be then used by the Trump campaign, $6 million contract? And I think there are still a whole host of questions.</p><p>TODD: Did you know that Steve Bannon was a founding executive until recently?</p><p>WARNER: I was aware --</p><p>TODD: Were you aware of this?</p><p>WARNER: I was aware that there was both from the Mercer family, from other individuals that were Cambridge Analytica had at best a colorful reputation.</p><p>TODD: No, I understand that. But did you know that here you had a chairman of a news organization who was, I guess, more of a principal on this?</p><p>WARNER: There were--</p><p>TODD: Was that obvious?</p><p>WARNER: There were reports around.</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>WARNER: And what bothers me is again, this is a firm that even I think the president`s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, bragged about their value.</p><p>TODD: Right</p><p>WARNER: Then after the election, you`ve seen nothing but the Trump campaign trying to distance themselves.</p><p>TODD: Right. I`ve got to ask you about this Facebook ad today. This is Mark Zuckerberg`s apology. And I hold it out because if you can find Facebook`s logo here, you`ve got better eyesight than I do.</p><p>It`s very-- this looks like a guy that is uncomfortable with taking responsibility. This is what he told Kara Swisher.</p><p>Things like, where is the line on hate speech? I mean, who chose me to be the person that did that? I guess I have to because we`re here now. But I`d rather not.</p><p>Does he sound like a CEO that wants to take responsibility for his company`s actions?</p><p>WARNER: Mark Zuckerberg created, in many ways, the whole notion of social media. It`s a great American success story, as is Twitter, Google, a series of other companies.</p><p>But I think the whole industry has been reluctant to accept the fact that we`re seeing the dark underbelly of social media. How it can be manipulated. We`re still dealing right now with kind of fake posts and fake accounts.</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>WARNER: Think about the next generation of technology, where they can put somebody else`s face on somebody`s body, or totally real time misrepresent words that come out of somebody`s mouth.</p><p>This is an area where we have to get our arms around it. And frankly, Mr. Zuckerberg needs to come and testify. He says he will do it if he`s the right person. Well listen, I`ve got experts on my staff --</p><p>TODD: Who`s the --</p><p>WARNER: Yes, I`ve got experts on my staff. But you don`t want my staff here. You want me here. He is the face of Facebook.</p><p>TODD: You wouldn`t go to a voter and say, no, no, no, let me --</p><p>WARNER: Yes, let me take my staff.</p><p>TODD: You wouldn`t do that?</p><p>WARNER: That`s not going to cut it. He needs to come out. He created this entity --</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>WARNER: -- he in fact created this industry, and he needs to come explain to the American public and to policy makers.</p><p>TODD: But if the FTC finds that they violated their consent decree. It`s a $2 trillion fine minimum if you take the $40,000 for each instance, for each day that they let each instance have around 50 million. And I do the quick math, $2 trillion. Should that be the level of fine they should potentially be subject to?</p><p>WARNER: The FTC has to determine whether they violated the 2011 consent decree. They`ll work through that. But --</p><p>TODD: And if they did, should you see maximum penalty?</p><p>WARNER: I think there will be appropriate penalties. But I think it raises the bigger question. All of these social media platform companies have said they have no responsibility for any of the content. I think we have to relook at that.</p><p>TODD: OK.</p><p>WARNER: I think in many ways, some media companies. I think we have to relook at the fact that if you move from one company to another, maybe you should be able to move all your data.</p><p>There are solutions and what I invite Mr. Zuckerberg and others is come help work with us. Congress is not always at the best in terms of cutting- edge technology. They need to work with us so we try to get it right. I don`t want to out-regulate these companies into oblivion.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>WARNER: But I do think people need to have the ability to know whether information they`re receiving is honest, truthful, or at least originates in this country.</p><p>TODD: Senator Warner, I have to leave it there, Democrat from Virginia. Thanks for coming on and sharing your views.</p><p>I think if you`re a social media company, you can drop the word social. You`re a media company.</p><p>Anyway, thank you sir.</p><p>When we come back, we`re going to break down the flurry of changes in the Trump administration and what they mean with the panel.</p><p>And later, as hundreds of thousands around the world joined the March for Our Lives, we talked to a group of voters, gun owners, and gun opponents about what they think can be done to stop gun violence.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back.</p><p>Panel is here.</p><p>Hugh Hewitt, host on the Salem Radio Network and of \"Hugh Hewitt\" on MSNBC, Heather McGee, president of the liberal group Demos, NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent, Kasie Hunt, host of \"Kasie DC\" on MSNBC, and Robert Costa, moderator of \"Washington Week\" on PBS.</p><p>Welcome all.</p><p>I`m going to give you two takes on John Bolton, both from conservatives. One`s David French and one`s George Will.</p><p>George Will writes this: Because John Bolton is five things President Trump is not -- intelligent, educated, principled, articulate and experienced -- and because of Bolton`s West Wing proximity to a president responsive to the most recent thought he has heard emanating from cable television or an employee, Bolton will soon be the second-most dangerous American.</p><p>Then, there`s David French: A nuclear-armed Iran is far more dangerous than John Bolton. A North Korea capable of incinerating American cities is far more dangerous than John Bolton. The foreign-policy debate is frequently between hawks and doves, and in the last administration, the doves repeatedly failed. It`s time to give a hawk a chance.</p><p>Kasie Hunt, John Bolton, everybody has an opinion.</p><p>KASIE HUNT, NBC NEWS CAPITOL HILL CORRESPONDENT: Everybody does have an opinion. And I think that this is -- you combine this choice. And what you may think about John Bolton the man and his history with this president`s chaotic management style, and you have a lot of people who maybe even might be willing to say, OK, let`s give John Bolton a chance, really worried about the impact that he might have inside the administration.</p><p>TODD: Bob, Bolton doesn`t see eye to eye on the president with so many other issues, including the Iraq War. But they do see eye to eye on one -- ripping up the Iran deal.</p><p>ROBERT COSTA, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST: Ripping up the Iran deal and talking to White House officials over the last few days, they say Bolton`s going to be an ally of Mike Pompeo, the nominee for secretary of state. That they`re going to be a partnership inside of this administration, trying to nudge the president forward.</p><p>It`s not so much an ideological case they`re making, it`s a personality mesh with the president. He never got along with General McMaster, he`s become -- General Kelly`s influence has faded a bit inside of the West Wing. Pompeo, Bolton, Kudlow, the TV personalities, the hard-charging types. They`re the ones now who the president wants at his side.</p><p>TODD: All right. I have a feeling the two of you are going to have two very different takes on Bolton. I know where Hugh is.</p><p>Heather, I`ll let you go first and go ahead.</p><p>HEATHER MCGHEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, there are three things that worry me about John Bolton. First is that he`s an unrepentant cheerleader and architect of the Iraq War who thinks that regime change is better than diplomacy, thinks that`s still the case about Iraq, which is pretty insane, given the facts on the ground, and thinks the same about North Korea and Iran.</p><p>Second, he`s untrustworthy. I mean, you-- you were talking to Mark Warner about Cambridge Analytica. He`s currently running a super PAC that is one of Cambridge Analytica`s biggest customers. He ran a think tank in the 1990s that funneled foreign money to Republicans. I just think there`s more to the story of the web of connection you were talking about that involves John Bolton.</p><p>And then third, I`m going to be honest here and maybe it`s the spirit of the young people from yesterday, but when I see men around their 70s who did everything they possibly could to avoid going into combat when it was their time, banging the war drum -- myself, many of my friends who have loved ones who actually had to fight in the Iraq War, it`s dangerous, it`s depressing, and it makes me feel like we don`t have people who take seriously.</p><p>I mean, Donald Trump loves war. He thinks it`s great theater, it`s great television. That is something he shares with John Bolton. And it`s something the American people have no appetite for.</p><p>TODD: Hugh?</p><p>HUGH HEWITT, HOST, SALEM RADIO NETWORK: As a Reagan-era conservative, I am very happy with the personnel choices made by the president this week. What Bob said about Iran and the alliance between Secretary of State- designate Pompeo and incoming National Security Advisor Bolton is correct. Add to that Jim Mattis, who understands Iran to be the central threat in the Middle East, and has been for the long, long time.</p><p>MCGHEE: But Mattis is worried about working with Bolton.</p><p>HEWITT: They might be, but I think with this talent -- Pompeo, Bolton, Kudlow, John Kelly, General Mattis, you have a foreign affairs team to rival Jim Baker, Howard Baker, Colin Powell and George Schultz at the end of the Reagan era.</p><p>I am overjoyed. John Bolton has prepared for this job his entire life.</p><p>TODD: I want to ask you, though, about Kelly and Mattis. Does anybody think both of them will be there in three months? Costa.</p><p>COSTA: Based on my reporting, Kelly has had a strained relationship with President Trump. Three months, some people in the White House say it could be a six months to a year. He sees it as duty, he`s not there for the politics. He`s not there because he has this kind of personal rapport with President Trump.</p><p>General Mattis, he does have concerns, I`m told, as well about John Bolton. At the same time, the former UN ambassador is someone he believes he can work with on a lot of different issues, even if they don`t have a close personal relationship.</p><p>TODD: I want to bring up the president`s tweet this morning because it seemed to be oddly defensive on, I guess, his legal team. And it`s sort of like this is what`s on his mind this morning. \"Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case,\" he says. \"Fame and fortune will never be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted.\"</p><p>Kasie Hunt, what he`s referring to on the conflicted is Joe diGenova, his wife, Victoria Tensing, both of whom apparently they want to have joined the team, have some conflict of interest issues that they`re trying to change.</p><p>And it`s interesting that I think the president I guess is trying to erase doubt that he`s having doubts on diGenova, I don`t know.</p><p>HUNT: It seems that way. I mean, it seems to be a situation where he wants people on his team who are saying things in public that he agrees with. The clip that you played in the beginning of the show from diGenova saying, look, the president is being set up by the FBI and the DOJ. That`s what the president wants to hear.</p><p>And John Dowd, the lawyer who was fired this week, who we haven`t even hardly touched on today, was somebody who was telling him something he didn`t want to hear, which was you should not go in and talk to the Special Counsel Robert Mueller. That would be a bad idea.</p><p>And, you know, we`re seeing kind of across the board all these personnel changes. That`s what`s happening if you disagree with the president.</p><p>COSTA: Real quick, Ted Olson, the white shoe attorney here, veteran Washington lawyer, he said no thanks to President Trump this week. That was the most revealing moment. We scooped it at The Washington Post that all these lawyers don`t want to come in. It`s not because of conflicts, it`s because of the political risk. They tell you privately it`s the political risk of working with this president.</p><p>TODD: It`s tough.</p><p>Heather, is something that Eric Erickson said that makes me think that he is embracing these battles. This is what he wrote, \"what Trump really cares about is making America great again through great compelling television in which one Donald J. Trump is the star, the hero, and the mythical demigod who overcomes impossible odds to achieve glorious victory.\"</p><p>And it gets at something that I know came up on Hugh`s show, it`s almost like the president is embracing the battle. Let`s go. And maybe he even isn`t afraid of impeachment.</p><p>MCGHEE: He says he loves conflict, and particularly because that makes good television. That worries me as someone who is thinking about the actual foreign policy conflicts of that particular sort of entertainment predilection of our president.</p><p>But, yeah, he wants -- he thinks conflict drives us to be talking about him, which it does. He think conflicts makes people have to choose sides and he thinks his base will always go to him if he`s seen as being under siege. He loves conflict. The American people are sick of it.</p><p>TODD: Hugh, you and I had this conversation earlier this week. And you`re of the mindset, you thought, he might actually embrace it.</p><p>HEWITT: He might love an impeachment process. It might be season three.</p><p>But I want to make one point about the changes this week. The three unhappiest people in the world about the arrival of Secretary of State Pompeo are new CIA director, 33 years a covert operator, Gina Haspel, the Bolton appointment, the Larry Kudlow appointment, are named Ayatollah Khomenei, Kim Jung-un and Vladimir Putin, our enemies are the enemies of those men and Gina Haspel.</p><p>TODD: We will see on Putin, that`s for sure there.</p><p>Anyway, panel, you guys are coming back in a few minutes. We`re going to talk about Stormy Daniels and the gun debate.</p><p>But when we come back, how our political parties are coming to represent a lot more than just our politics.</p><p>TODD: We are back. Data ownload time. We know the two parties are different and that they represent two different Americas. But data released by Pew this week shows us that those changes between the parties are actually accelerating and they`re growing even further apart.</p><p>In many ways Democrats are moving faster than the changes we`re seeing as a country while Republicans have overall been slower to keep pace. So there you go, more polarization.</p><p>Between 1997 and 2017, the country has become a lot more diverse with the white population now at 69 percent, that`s a 14-point drop.</p><p>Democrats are outpacing that national average. Only 59 percent of voters who identify with the Democratic Party are white, while Republicans still struggle on the diversity front. 83 percent of Republicans are white.</p><p>Now, on college education, in 2017 a full third of Americans have college degrees. That was up eight points from 1997. Democrats here, too, exceed the national average. 39 percent of Democrats are college educated while Republicans lag behind with just 28 percent of Republicans being college educated.</p><p>Now, the country is also a bit less religious overall with nearly a quarter of Americans saying they don`t affiliate with any religion, that`s a 16- point jump in sort of secularism in the last 20 years. For Democrats, a full third do not affiliate with a religion while that number is much smaller for Republicans, 13 percent.</p><p>Look, this country is also getting older with 50 percent of voters now over the age of 50. Nere, Democrats actually fall behind on this national trend. 42 percent of their voters are 50 or older. The GOP, however, has grown older as the country has aged and they have grown older faster. 57 percent of Republicans are over the age of 50.</p><p>In short, Democrats are mostly heading in the same direction as the country as a whole. That`s why Democrats are so bullish on the future, and Republicans are so nervous about their future, even as their hold on older voters keeps them competitive in the now.</p><p>And these differences aren`t just about bean counting, it makes finding common ground even harder. And it`s why compromise in Washington is so difficult and only growing more so.</p><p>We`ll be back in a moment with this question, six months from now, which story will matter more to our politics, Stormy Daniels or yesterday`s gun violence demonstrations? The panel is back to discuss.</p><p>TODD: Back again with the panel.</p><p>Here`s a question, in six months what will have more of an impact on Washington, the Stormy Daniels interview on 60 Minutes or the gun march? And I know that seems on one hand an absurd notion, but on the other hand it`s about what has more impact on this town in the next six months.</p><p>I grant you the gun march I think is a long-term movement. In the next six months, Kasie.</p><p>HUNT: That`s what I would say. I think that the gun march and the degree of engagement from so many people at such a young age and the emotion we saw on display yesterday, I do think that that that is a sea change that is going to catch up with this congress in the longer term.</p><p>TODD: I do agree.</p><p>HUNT: On the Stormy Daniels` front, I`m not sure we can answer the question yet on that, but clearly this is something that has gotten to the president. He is responding to what she is doing in a way that is completely different than how he was responding to everything else, in a way that suggests that there is something very serious and significant there. I think we`ll learn a lot tonight when we hear from her publicly for the first time.</p><p>But on the flip side, there`s a question about does any of it matter anymore?</p><p>TODD: I don`t know either. But Jonah Goldberg had an interesting thesis about this. And this is what he wrote, Bob.</p><p>No one during the Republican primaries, no one wanted to attack Trump because they knew he`d counterattack viciously and, again, shamelessly. It`s much like the old adage about not wrestling with pigs: you`ll get dirty and pig likes it. Trump uses the decency of others against them. Think Marco Rubio.</p><p>That`s what`s so fascinating about Stormy Daniels. What on earth can Donanld Trump say about the star of Breast Friends 2 and Finally Legal 7? How can he embarrass her? That this is what she has Kryptonite with Trump.</p><p>COSTA: I don`t know how he engages here. What`s been interesting, as a reporter is that he has not engaged in any kind of back and forth with Ms. Daniels in recent weeks. He has been relatively quiet for a president for whom relative quiet is not usually a tactic.</p><p>What we`re seeing, though, with this gun march, and I walked around with my notepad yesterday, it was regardless of your politics as a reporter, you`re there, it was powerful. And when I saw all these parents with strollers, young children, teenage students, and I asked them who are you going to vote for, it was not really a partisan event. But they were out there marching. I said are you going to vote this fall? They said certainly we will.</p><p>And it just -- you felt that something is in the air. Yes, the president is moving on gun regulations right now with bump stocks, but if the Democrats take over the house or it`s a narrow majority for the Republicans, there`s this mood out there in the country, and you saw it on the mall, for gun reform.</p><p>TODD: I want to play a little bit actually of some of these speeches were unbelievable. We`re not going to do them justice, but here`s a quick montage of some of the better ones.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMERON KASKY, STUDENT, STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL: Do you think any change is going to come from this? Look around. We are the change.</p><p>EMMA GONZALEZ, STUDENT, STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL: Fight for your lives before it`s someone else`s job.</p><p>NAOMI WADLER, STUDENT, GEORGE MASON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: For far too long these names, these black girls and women, have been just numbers. I`m here to say never again for those girls too.</p><p>SAM FUENTES, STUDENT, STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL: So when do we enough is enough?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: You know, Heather, I noted earlier this is really a handful of marches that you remember, that our town remembers -- the civil rights marches of the `60s, the abortion rights marches of the `80s and `90s, Tea Party, Million Man March, I think about those things. This is right up there.</p><p>MCGHEE: Absolutely. And I think it`s shocked many people how significant they were.</p><p>TODD: Count me as one.</p><p>MCGHEE: Count you as one. How worldwide they were in places like, you know, South Carolina and North Dakota. Again, something like the women`s march, you realize that there are these sort of moral questions that feel like they`re dividing lines and galvanizing points for particularly women, people of color and young people who are saying that there is a corruption at the heart of our politics right now.</p><p>The fact that money and politics and the way that the NRA is able to put their financial interests and their political interests ahead of the lives of children, for young people that is a very, very stark moral issue. And so what you`re seeing here is the moral high ground that I think people in Washington are not used to having debates at that level and that`s where the energy is and that`s why when they chant \"vote them out,\" if I were a Republican, I`d be very scared.</p><p>TODD: Hugh, first time where I feel like the gun control movement is prioritizing the issue for voters in ways that the NRA for years has prioritize gun rights.</p><p>HEWITT: Activism is addictive. And they undersold their achievements. The Florida law is a significant win that Governor Scott. I agree with Bob, it`s a purple issue.</p><p>Chris Coons and Pat Toomey have put together a very important law on closing some gaps in NICS. So, I think the activism is active and it will keep going.</p><p>But far more important than either of those is your Facebook conversation. Chris Coons has also suggested a new standing committee in the Senate. We`ve got bipartisan support on big tech and data. We have to get our hands on these media companies, it is the future survival of the country. And what Senator Warner said, I think these kids will figure out they are not in control of their lives with their social media platforms.</p><p>COSTA: You heard it in the Warner interview, he was hinting at what`s to come. There is talk among Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, make them like a utility company.</p><p>HEWITT: A utility.</p><p>COSTA: At that level of federal regulation.</p><p>HUNT: And Facebook I think is actually more afraid of Democrats even taking back the House or potentially the Senate even though -- they are. And there are many people that are running those companies, there`s a lot of assumptions that Silicon Valley is full of Democrats, but quite frankly they think they`re more likely to get regulated.</p><p>TODD: Oh, this is populist on the left hand, right.</p><p>Anyway, when we come back, our NBC series solutions, gun violence, a group of voters debate how to reduce gun violence while respecting the Second Amendment.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. NBC News is kicking off a new continuing series called Solutions. We`re trying to take a look at the ways communities across the country are tackling diverse policy challenges that our polarized climate can`t seem to solve.</p><p>This week, timed to yesterday`s worldwide demonstrations, we`re looking at gun violence. On Wednesday, I traveled to Madison, Wisconsin, where there`s a group called reach out Wisconsin. They have been bringing people together for a few years now to try to foster dialogue across the political divide. I spoke with three pro-gun Republicans, three Democrats, and one independent, who served in the military. And we began by discussing whether a ban on assault-style weapons would ever be possible under our constitution.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVI POST, DEMOCRATIC VOTER: The issue with the second amendment is what kind of weapons they were talking about. Military weapons? I know some people believe that it`s important for ordinary citizens to have whatever weapons the government has because the government may come to get us some day and we want to be able to defend ourselves.</p><p>So I can see a little bit of the logic to that, but I don`t really agree with it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Honestly, this is where I get stuck every single time. So, the Second Amendment, of course, the right to have a militia for the purpose of promoting a free society, but then it follows thereafter with the right to bear arms shall not be infringed. It`s not the government...</p><p>TODD: You have to argument over the comma.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s not saying that the government shall provide the right to bear arms, it`s a right that`s predating the constitution itself and saying that it shall not be infringed for these purposes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that ordinary citizens ought not have the right to have nuclear weapons or F-35s or M1A1 Abrams tanks and the like. And, you know, if someone is saying, well, citizens ought to be able to rise up against an oppressive government, an AR-15 isn`t going to cut the mustard, buddy. You need some serious firepower if you want to overthrow your government.</p><p>So we ended up drawing a line. What strikes me as kind of arbitrary.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See, I don`t have a problem. I`m very pro-Second Amendment, but I don`t have a problem banning the AR-15 because the bullet travels three times as fast, so it does a lot more damage to the organs, so I mean, it is a lot more dangerous because of that.</p><p>That being said, when you look at when we did have it banned from 1994 to 2004, yeah, people stopped killing as much with the AR-15, but they just switched to other guns. So I mean as a long-term solution removing AR-15s or stopping them from being sold might affect it, but short-term we need to look at other things.</p><p>TODD: Someone make the case for owning an AR-15.</p><p>SCOTT GRABINS, REPUBLICAN VOTER: Generally speaking, an AR-15 is a semiautomatic rifle. And mechanically, it`s no different than a hunting rifle. Pull the trigger, you get one bullet.</p><p>TODD: Do you think the AR-15 gets a bad name?</p><p>GRABINS: Yeah. I think we tend to lump in too many things under that one -- that heading as an assault weapon and it`s really -- it`s just a semiautomatic rifle.</p><p>BETSY ERICKSON, DEMOCRATIC VOTER: I don`t think that it`s just a semiautomatic rifle. I think that hunting rifles are designed differently. They`re designed to shut bullets actually at higher velocity over a farther distance with the goal of a single shot traveling a long distance to kill an animal. An AR-15 is designed to kill people. It`s designed to inflict maximum damage at a much closer range and to fire bullets in rapid succession.</p><p>And I do think that they are different in purpose and in construction.</p><p>TODD: If the whole goal is to find a solution, so what are some solutions.</p><p>ERICKSON: One thing that we don`t know a lot about are the underlying causes, you know, of these shootings. I think that there`s not a lot of research that`s been done looking at gun violence as a public health epidemic. And I think...</p><p>TODD: This new bill is supposed to open the door for more research.</p><p>ERICKSON: And I think that that`s absolutely critical.</p><p>CAIRE: We have enough research. I mean the problem is, and I`m going to cross the line of race here for a minute. When white kids are killing each other, it`s a problem. And all of a sudden it becomes a national epidemic and a national issue that we need to spend $100 million in Wisconsin on for safety and security in schools.</p><p>LONG: Honestly, I think we can all agree that there definitely needs to be more research as to the underlying reason as to why. Why this is happening in the first place, because we all can see that it is clearly a problem, whether it`s the school shooting or individuals. Maybe more research, maybe some restrictions, whether it be the bullet counts, that`s not necessarily regulating the gun itself.</p><p>TODD: Davi, what have you learned here that`s possible? And what do you see as impossible?</p><p>POST: I`ve got three things. The first is close the gun show loophole, you know. Make it a little harder for people to get these kinds of weapons. Crack down, better background checks, especially for semiautomatic weapons. And the third one I would say is in terms of mental health, I think we need to focus on reaching people who are isolated.</p><p>ZANTON: I agree that the biggest problem facing our country right now is apathy, that we will talk about it when it`s in the news and then we go about our lives. So we really have to have a change of heart and actually want to look for solutions.</p><p>TODD: Kaleem, what did you take away?</p><p>CAIRE: A few things. One, I think we`ll produce a lot of research that will sit on the shelves and take forever to implement. I think the greatest chance is probably a stronger background check. It`s also confirmed for me that our children are their best lobbyists, that adults aren`t good lobbyists for children today.</p><p>But I do think that the opportunity exists. I mean we`ve got to be bold. I would love to see a tax just like we tax cigarettes. I would love to see a special tax, a big surcharge put on weapons, and that those resources be used to invest in a healthy, productive and responsible society.</p><p>TODD: Look, Wisconsin is -- I always like being here because there`s something about the citizenry of Wisconsin that makes you guys not want to yell at each other, so I really appreciate that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD: So you can be a Democrat not for gun control and you can be a Republican for it. That`s the point here. Don`t let your party decide.</p><p>You can see a much longer version of this on our website, Meetthepress.com and on the NBC News app. And before we go, a quick programming note, it`s been 50 years since the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. And tonight on MSNBC, we`re going to be taking a look back at how Dr. King, the civil rights movement, and the media change the way we looked at freedom and ourselves. Please be sure to watch Hope and Fury: MLK, the Movement, and the Media tonight on MSBC at 9:00 eastern.</p><p>That`s all we have for today. Thanks for watching. We`ll be back because if it`s Sunday, it`s Meet the Press.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBCNEW-2018032501cb504</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBCNEW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYC-1RH1-DXH2-645C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157446</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8984\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018  ASC Services II Media, LLC<br/>All Rights Reserved<br/></copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 National Broadcasting Co.

Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining us straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": a crime at the epidemic sweeping the United States and cities across the country, amid calls to defund the police. The murder rate spikes in California, New Orleans, Los Angeles, with shootings in Chicago jumping 75 percent in June alone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coming up, America's mayor, Rudy Giuliani, with a message for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, shootings there up 130 percent, the violence unfolding against the backdrop of the 2020 election, now just 113 days away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What's President Trump's plan to get us out of this? White House trade adviser Peter Navarro is here to lay out POTUS' second-term agenda.</p><p>We will also hear from Donald Trump Jr. this morning on the one issue he thinks will determine the winner, all of this as John Durham continues his deep dive into the origins of the Russia probe. Will he finish his investigation before the election? Congressman Jim Jordan, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, will weigh in.</p><p>Also here this morning, Senator John Barrasso with breaking news on the next stimulus package and when to expect it.</p><p>All that and a lot more, as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>And we begin with Joe Biden unveiling his $700 billion buy America plan last week, with an emphasis on U.S. goods, jobs and manufacturing.</p><p>Biden's proposal may ring the bell for viewers of this program.</p><p>Here's White House trade adviser Peter Navarro just a few weeks ago on the president's first plan back on March 15.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: It's a three-pronged strategy consistent with what President Trump has done from the get-go in terms of onshoring jobs.</p><p>It's buy American, it's deregulate, and it's innovate technology. The buy American issue, Maria, is, we have HHS, the VA and DOD as large consumers of pharmaceuticals. We have got to get them to buy American over the long term, so we have a stable source of demand, so that that will attract investment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And joining me right now is Peter Navarro, back with us. He's assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing.</p><p>Peter, it is good to see you this morning.</p><p>NAVARRO: Hey, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, obviously, Joe Biden agrees...</p><p>NAVARRO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ... with your plan to buy America.</p><p>Your reaction to the former vice president's economic plan released this past week.</p><p>NAVARRO: A poll-driven, plagiarist, buy China Joe Biden.</p><p>I was astonished by that, given Joe Biden's history. I think everybody remembers back in 1988, when Biden ran for president, and did the trifecta of plagiarism, when he ripped off JFK, RFK and Neil Kinnock in speeches and had to withdraw from the race in shame and embarrassment.</p><p>And now he's just blatantly ripping off the president's buy American agenda, which goes back to the president going down the escalator with beautiful Melania. It started back then. Guess what?</p><p>I have personally been at the president's side when he has signed at least seven buy American orders. That's seven more than Biden signed or Obama signed during their term. And every one of those has worked to create American jobs.</p><p>We dramatically reduced the waivers, increased the amount of buy American in-government procurement. We upped the amount of iron and steel to close to 100 percent.</p><p>And so, listening to Joe Biden, I thought it was a really bad judgment. And whoever wrote that speech and put that in the puppet's head there, I think they might be looking for a new job soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Peter, he also said that he will take the corporate tax rate back up.</p><p>The president, of course, in his tax legislation of 2017 cut the corporate rate to 21 percent. Biden says it should be at 28 percent. Wall Street seems to think Elizabeth Warren is the key economic voice in Biden's plan. She wants to raise taxes on everyone and also institute a wealth tax for the wealthiest individuals.</p><p>And he's also talking about changing -- he said he wants to change shareholder capitalism.</p><p>NAVARRO: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you make of all of that?</p><p>NAVARRO: Well, I think that's a good way of talking about what President Trump is going to do in his second term, because what President Trump is going to do is finish what he started.</p><p>And the whole four points of the policy compass going back to the campaign was deregulation, cut taxes, dominate in energy, and have fair trade deals.</p><p>And everything that Biden wants to do and is running on is directly opposite that, directly opposite to the direction of growing the economy. So, that's what the president is going to do.</p><p>And we got to a point with this president, best jobs president in history, where he had the best economy in American history, in middle of January, we had the unemployment rate down for record lows for blacks, Hispanics, Asians, women.</p><p>And we were cruising along, until the Chinese Communist Party basically hit us with that deadly virus, that weaponized virus. And I don't think it's any coincidence that the first year that China had a down economy was the same year now that they're coming after us in all sorts of ways.</p><p>And Joe Biden is the candidate of the Chinese Communist Party. Trump, buy American, Joe Biden, buy China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>Let me ask you about China, because, of course, we saw now a pushback in terms of sanctions on individuals in China responsible for taking away Hong Kong freedoms. People are waiting for the president to sign that in terms of the sanctions on those individuals.</p><p>Why should the U.S. be acting aggressively on Hong Kong?</p><p>NAVARRO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you want to open borders for Hong Kong citizens to come to America? What's the plan?</p><p>NAVARRO: For decades, the Chinese Communist Party used Hong Kong as a weapon to attack the American manufacturing base and vacuum jobs and capital back to the Chinese mainland.</p><p>Do you know what, Maria? We put up with that, in support of a free and Democratic Hong Kong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO: But now that China has taken away their economy, they have effectively turned it just into another concentration camp, like Xinjiang, Tibet, and the rest of the Chinese mainland, now that that has happened, President Trump, going back to a speech in the Rose Garden at the end of May, said, we're going to strip them of all preferential treatment, so that they can't harm American workers anymore, and we're going to punish those responsible.</p><p>And so you can expect, early this week, the president to sign both the Hong Kong Autonomy Act and an executive order which will complete the process that the president started on May 29 in the Rose Garden. We cannot let Chinese Communist Party use Hong Kong anymore to attack the American economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO: So that's coming.</p><p>The other thing that's on the table that we need to talk about is this whole TikTok, WeChat social media thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO: Here is the thing, Maria.</p><p>What the American people have to understand is, all the data that goes into those mobile apps that kids have so much fun with and seem so convenient, it goes right to servers in China, right to the Chinese military, the Chinese Communist Party, and the agencies which want to steal our intellectual property.</p><p>Those apps can be used to steal personal and financial information for blackmail and extortion. They can be used to steal business intellectual property and proprietary secrets.</p><p>The worst thing they use them for, besides surveilling and tracking Americans, the worst thing they do is engage in information warfare against the American people, against this president. The Chinese Communist Party wants Joe Biden more than anything right now, and the American people should not be subject to information warfare.</p><p>The other thing about TikTok, for example, and WeChat...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO: ... even what -- this is really interesting. They're running the same playbook as Huawei, right? Put an American puppet in charge of Huawei as the CEO and say, hey, everything is going to be fine. We're going to be separate.</p><p>They're trying that game with TikTok. Not going to work. TikTok is the biggest -- TikTok and WeChat are the biggest forms of censorship on the Chinese mainland. And so expect strong action on that. Expect action, action, action from this president on buy American, on China, on jobs.</p><p>And this is the president that gets things done for the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>You know, you mentioned the person running TikTok. It is actually extraordinary. This is -- this was the number two guy at Disney, Kevin Mayer, who is now the CEO of TikTok...</p><p>NAVARRO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ... an American, but, obviously, the Chinese -- the Chinese individual...</p><p>NAVARRO: Running dog puppet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ... who is a Communist member is the chairman.</p><p>But this is what I thought was really interesting. This week, we had a headline that says Democratic National Committee is warning that campaign - - against campaigns on using TikTok.</p><p>NAVARRO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even the Democratic National Committee is voicing concern.</p><p>NAVARRO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Amazon, of course, we know already banned TikTok from employee phones.</p><p>NAVARRO: Actually, Maria, they didn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you say these are data collectors?</p><p>NAVARRO: Yes, Amazon actually...</p><p>BARTIROMO: He said he was going to, Jeff Bezos.</p><p>NAVARRO: Yes. Yes. They announced it, and then they backed away from it, which shows the power of the Chinese Communist Party on corporate America.</p><p>And that's the problem. This guy who is running TikTok now, a Disney executive, who is more compromised than the Disney kingdom over in China? Because they want to sell all their Disney World tickets over there. They want to sell all their Disney content.</p><p>And so what -- if TikTok, if it separates as an American company, that doesn't help us, because it's going to be worth -- we're going to have to give China billions of dollars for the privilege of having TikTok operate on U.S. soil.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well...</p><p>NAVARRO: So, TikTok, WeChat and -- India banned 70 of these things. So TikTok and WeChat, I suspect that the president is just getting started with those two.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's what I was just going to say, because India has banned TikTok. Is the president going to?</p><p>NAVARRO: I never get ahead of the president, but we are looking very closely at this problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>NAVARRO: And just run through the checklist.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>NAVARRO: The information warfare, surveillance and tracking, stealing your data.</p><p>No American -- the parents -- their kids are sitting there with TikTok. I mean, data right out of the household is going to the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO: What can go wrong there?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Peter...</p><p>NAVARRO: So, what we need to do -- jobs and China, that's what this campaign is about.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will be watching.</p><p>Great to talk with you, as always, Peter. Thank you so much, Peter Navarro from the White House this morning.</p><p>Coming up: Will John Durham complete his investigation into the origins of the Russia probe in time to impact the 2020 election?</p><p>The ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, will weigh in after this break.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, welcome back.</p><p>Attorney General Bill Barr told me that the Russian collusion narrative was the closest the U.S. has ever come to a coup since the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>Yet, according to a new Rasmussen poll, most voters do not know there's evidence that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were even involved in it.</p><p>A.G. Barr recently spoke to me about the status of John Durham's investigation on the FBI's probe into the Trump campaign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: He's pressing ahead as hard as he can. And I expect that we will have some developments hopefully before the end of this summer.</p><p>But, as I have said, his investigation will continue. It's not going to stop because of the election. What happens after the election may depend on who wins the election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Jim Jordan is the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): You bet. Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where are we on the John Durham investigation, sir? What do you know?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, we know what Bill Barr has told us.</p><p>Now, the attorney general will be in front of the Judiciary Committee in two weeks. I'm sure he will get asked about this and a number of other issues.</p><p>But the attorney general has said that he expects something this summer. We're obviously -- we're hitting the summer, so let's hope it happens. Let's hope it happens before the election.</p><p>I will tell you this, Maria. The number one question I get, whether I'm in the Fourth District of Ohio or traveling around our state or traveling around the country, the number one question I get from people is, they will walk up to me and says, when is somebody going to jail?</p><p>And the reason they say that is because they're sick of the double standard, this idea that there's one set of rules for the politically connected in D.C. and a different set for us regular folks.</p><p>So let's hope we have the investigation done before the election. Let's hope that someone is going to be held accountable for the major wrongdoing that took place when they targeted the president's campaign and spied on the president's campaign.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's pretty extraordinary.</p><p>And we know that there was always criminality done, whether it's leaking confidential information, or changing a document of evidence, which is -- one of the FBI agents already did that. They changed a document.</p><p>JORDAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Or maybe it was entrapment, lying to investigators.</p><p>So, how come we haven't seen any charges yet? I mean, there are, what, 14 referrals of criminal charges already from you and your colleagues?</p><p>JORDAN: Yes. I mean, who knows.</p><p>But here is how bad it was. Michael Flynn, 38 different people 49 different times unmasked Michael Flynn's name between Election Day 2016 and Inauguration Day in January 2017. So, in that short two-month time period, 49 separate times, they were unmasking his name, even though they already knew, all these people already knew that there was no basis for the investigation to begin with.</p><p>And how do we know that they knew there was no basis, there was no proper predicate? Because, when they testified, they told us that. Ric Grenell released the testimony of Comey and Clapper and Brennan and Rice and Samantha Power, released all of the testimony.</p><p>And they all said the same thing: We never saw any evidence of any type of coordination, collusion, conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. But they investigated it anyway, even up until the time when Bob Mueller was named special counsel.</p><p>Jim Comey, when we deposed him in the House last Congress, when we deposed him, he said: After 10 months, we didn't have anything.</p><p>But Comey does what? Leaks his memo, so we get two years of Bob Mueller, leaks his memos for the express purpose of getting a special counsel named. And then we had the 19 lawyers, 40 agents, 500 subpoenas, 2,800 or 500 witnesses, 2,800 subpoenas, and $30 million to tell us what we already knew, what they already knew, that there was nothing there.</p><p>So let's hope that, ultimately, someone is held accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think there will be indictments?</p><p>JORDAN: I hope so. I mean, I have said this all along.</p><p>I think Jim Comey is the biggest culprit here. It was the Comey cabal, this small handful of people at the top of the FBI. And then, remember, Bill Barr, the first time he testified, said there was a failure of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI</p><p>Comey, McCabe, Baker, Strzok, Page, they all left or had to be fired as the key people...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JORDAN: ... who ran the Clinton investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation.</p><p>Comey is the ringleader here. I hope they give him a second look. And I hope he's ultimately held accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you.</p><p>Let me switch gears, ask you about your committee, the Judiciary Committee's closed-door testimony of Geoffrey Berman. I have in front of me your takeaways from the committee's transcribed interview with Berman.</p><p>Nadler says that Barr dealings with Berman often came close to bribery. Your reaction? And tell us what you can about that closed-door hearing.</p><p>JORDAN: Well, first of all, Mr. Nadler's statement is ridiculous.</p><p>When we deposed Mr. Berman, he said very clearly -- we asked him about his meeting with Bill Barr on June 19 in New York. We said, did you talk about any cases? No. Did you talk about any suspects? No. Did you talk about any witnesses to any cases? No. Did you talk about the president? No,.</p><p>There was nothing there. The attorney general and the president of the United States are entitled to have the people they want as U.S. attorneys around the country. That's all this was.</p><p>The Democrats, because they don't like the fact that Bill Barr is trying to get to the bottom of what took place in the previous Justice Department, the Obama-Biden-Comey Justice Department, because they don't like the fact that he's trying to clean up the politics that existed in the previous administration, they continue to go after him, so much so that they filed articles of impeachment against the attorney general just a week-and-a-half ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JORDAN: That's how ridiculous the Democrats are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, I have got to ask you about tech tyranny and the upcoming hearings that you're going to have in Judiciary.</p><p>We will hear from people like Apple's CEO, Google's CEO, Facebook, Twitter in a hearing on July 25 or 28. Tell me about your letter to Jack Dorsey about the president's tweets and what you're expecting out of technology, big tech.</p><p>Are they going to try to sway the election in November?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, Maria, I always start with this simple question. Why is does always seem that it's just conservatives who get censored or shadowbanned by these big tech companies?</p><p>Why was it two years ago that there are 435 members of the House, there are 100 members of the Senate, 535, but only four were shadowbanned, Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan?</p><p>Interesting four. I always say -- when we send a letter to Jack Dorsey, when we brought this to his attention, he indicated that, oh, it was just a glitch in our algorithm, to which I responded, glitch in your algorithm? What did you put in the algorithm, the names Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes, Jordan?</p><p>I mean, it's always conservatives.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JORDAN: Why is it only the president -- why is it only the president who gets censored? You never see them going after Joe Biden.</p><p>Why is it just -- why was it The Federalist that Google tried to demonetize?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>JORDAN: You never see a liberal news outlet trying to be demonetized.</p><p>So, that, to me, is the fundamental question. And that has got to change, because, in America today, if only one side is allowed to talk, that's not the First Amendment. You got to have a real debate. And this cancel culture mob and the impact they have on these big tech companies is a scary road we're traveling down.</p><p>And it needs to stop. And that's what we're going to focus on as Republicans in these hearings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, it's great to have you this morning.</p><p>We will be watching, certainly, closely. It's so wonderful to get your take on all of this, Congressman Jim Jordan.</p><p>Coming up, Rudy Giuliani is here on the Supreme Court decision that President Trump should turn over his tax returns.</p><p>That's coming up next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Supreme Court making headlines on Thursday, ruling that President Trump's financial and tax records are fair game for New York prosecutors.</p><p>The president since calling decision not fair. But is it really the slam- dunk victory his critics were hoping for?</p><p>Joining me right now is former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who also served as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York for six years.</p><p>And, Rudy, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK: Always a pleasure, Maria, yes, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So...</p><p>GIULIANI: So, that case is really terribly decided.</p><p>But go ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, about the tax returns.</p><p>GIULIANI: Oh.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you going -- are you going to be responding in any way? Will the tax releases have any bearing on the election, in your view?</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, first of all, there's still room for opposition.</p><p>You could make the argument that they have no particularized need for it. You could also make the argument that they are not investigating any particularized crime.</p><p>They have no reason to believe that there's anything wrong with his tax returns. I mean, all these tax returns have been, by and large -- maybe not the last one -- but all of them have been audited. All of them have been either passed on or settled.</p><p>And there should be something in your tax returns. In other words, we get audited, we make a deal, we pay the government, you don't come after me forever for that.</p><p>And, also, this is the president of the United States. There are literally 400 -- 4,000 prosecutors who can now come after his records. I don't think the court ever thought of that.</p><p>So there may be a chance to revisit this. The burden this would place on the executive, like, if you had an opposition party -- and look at the DAs we have now. We have Soros-elected anarchist DAs. They're not there to prosecute the law. They are there to undermine the law.</p><p>He put them there. Why would Soros pay for DAs, other than to undermine our government?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>GIULIANI: He got people elected who release criminals, don't prosecute cases. In Philadelphia, they won't even bring a case to the DA, he's so anti-police, pro-criminal.</p><p>Five years, Soros has been funding these. And nobody paid attention to it. But he had a reason. It's to undermine our government. And I think we have a chance to revisit this.</p><p>Also, we can argue that they have no need for it. This is a fishing expedition. I mean, I think we fight them right down to the wire.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about what's happening to our cities, Rudy.</p><p>You oversaw New York City becoming the safest city on your leadership because of the moves you made. Look at New York City right now, shootings soaring to 205 percent. What will it take to get this city back with law and order? Shooting incidences up 130 percent, murder up 23 percent, burglary up 118 percent.</p><p>What is your reaction to Mayor de Blasio's new plan, he says, to take back the blocks, relying heavily on community members on the streets?</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, I mean, the reality is, he's already amended that plan, because it was -- I mean, it's stupid throughout, but he was going to have community leaders accompany the police, until, last night, he had another night of violence that was unreal.</p><p>So now the community leaders are not going to accompany the police. I think they got an idea, hey, Mayor, you go with them. Maybe we don't want to go, because they shoot at us. We had a terrible situation with a domestic violence thing last night.</p><p>I mean, it's a disaster, Maria. I have never seen it like this. I mean, there were more murders in the city under Dinkins, 2,400, 2,200, but we never had this total disrespect for the police. Even in those bad old days, nobody was going to spit at a police officer, nobody was going to punch a police officer.</p><p>And they took advantage of the no choke hold last night in an incident that I have a videotape of, where the police officer couldn't get ahold of him. The guy put a choke hold on the cop and almost killed him, and he couldn't defend himself.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GIULIANI: I mean, we're going to get a cop killed with that stupid no choke hold thing, the way it's interpreted.</p><p>We're getting cops killed. And the reaction -- the reality is, it's worse because this is a breakdown in general respect for the police, for our government, and hatred for our country.</p><p>And there's a purpose to it. These people are Marxists. They want to take over our government. When are we going to wake up and realize that? Just go read what they write.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well...</p><p>GIULIANI: Look at the fact that the woman who is taking in the money for the BLM is a convicted terrorist who should be in jail for 58 years, except crooked Clinton pardoned her, a terrorist who was involved in police killings.</p><p>She is handling the money for the Black Lives Matter. This is a woman dedicated to the overthrow of our government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, look, Mayor de Blasio obviously cut the budget for the NYPD by a billion dollars.</p><p>You said the last time you were with me that Governor Cuomo can replace Mayor de Blasio. How come he hasn't done it yet then? The New York A.G. is recommending de Blasio should no longer have the authority in New York enforcement matters. Is that enough?</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, you know, I will give him the citation.</p><p>It's Article 1, Section 9 of the New York City charter, which I pretty much have memorized. It says that the governor can remove the mayor. You don't even have to have cause. Now precedent would say it would have to be corruption, like they attempted to remove Jimmy Walker, but he resigned.</p><p>Or it could be gross incompetence. Or it could be putting the lives of New Yorkers in jeopardy. Bill de Blasio, through his incompetence, has killed New Yorkers. His negligence in dealing with COVID is outrageous, the things he didn't do and the things that he encouraged.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIULIANI: They criticize President Trump for being late. He was telling people to go to gyms two weeks into it, two weeks after the president made it clear, this is very dangerous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>It certainly feels like a different city today, I will tell you. You just don't feel safe in New York City.</p><p>I want to switch gears. You were the A.G. for the Southern District of New York from 1983 to 1989, where Ghislaine Maxwell is now being indicted. Reaction to the charges. Do you think she's going to name names? What's your reaction to this Jeffrey Epstein-Ghislaine Maxwell situation?</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, I don't know all the people there now, but the person in charge, Audrey Strauss, was a colleague of mine. And she's a very, very -- she's a very good lawyer and a very honest and down-the-middle-kind of prosecutor.</p><p>I can only guess what Maxwell has. And it sounds like she's got tapes, and it would not make sense if they didn't. I mean, they were pretty smart people. They have been protected for a long time. There must be a reason for that. They must have a lot of things on a lot of people. And it's going to be really interesting to see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIULIANI: You can't argue with a tape. You can't argue. There's got to be a lot of people very scared over the last couple of days.</p><p>And I'd like to keep her alive, guys. I mean, you know, she is in a prison.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIULIANI: You can keep somebody alive in a prison.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>GIULIANI: And if they need any help, if they need any help on how to keep somebody alive in a prison, I used to also run the Bureau of Prisons. I think I could show them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Rudy, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you.</p><p>GIULIANI: You know you're the best.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up next: Donald Trump Jr. is here with his reaction to the Black Lives Matter mural in New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio helped paint right outside of Trump Tower this week, where he works every day.</p><p>We are going to get his reaction when we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>New photographs this morning of President Trump wearing a mask publicly for the first time yesterday during his visit to Walter Reed Hospital.</p><p>The president, who met with wounded soldiers and medical workers, told reporters he loves masks in the appropriate locations, but still believes they have a time and place.</p><p>Joining us right now with reaction is the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, Donald Trump Jr.</p><p>And, Don, it is good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: It's my pleasure, Maria. How are you?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, great.</p><p>Interesting to see your dad donning a mask. Obviously, things are serious. You have got the potential of a second spike.</p><p>How is Kimberly doing? We know that Kimberly has contracted COVID, along with a top convention person. Is she OK?</p><p>TRUMP JR.: She's 100 percent fine.</p><p>She's -- zero symptoms, zero anything. We're in quarantine, obviously, and I am too because of proximity. But, other than that, you really wouldn't know that there's anything even going on.</p><p>So, it's been good. I -- under the circumstances, it's as good as it can get.</p><p>And I also saw my father looked pretty good in the mask the other day.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TRUMP JR.: And I think what people also have to realize, when he talks about there being a time and place, anyone who comes into proximity with him is literally tested that day, is literally tested moments before they allow access.</p><p>So he's obviously going to be much less susceptible to this than anyone else, because, literally, there is a daily screening process if you're going to even be within proximity to him.</p><p>So I think that's important for people to note. But when he's going to Walter Reed to visit our sick and our wounded soldiers, he's going to take that very seriously.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but people are taking seriously the idea that we are seeing a second wave potentially, and spikes in some hot spots across the country.</p><p>What does that mean for the convention, Don? And what about the idea that, look, the Democrats have already said they're going to do a virtual convention? There are polls that have Biden either tied with Trump or actually leading Donald Trump.</p><p>Your thoughts of all of these worries going into the convention and then, of course, the election?</p><p>TRUMP JR.: Well, I think, for the Democrats, of course they want to do a virtual convention, because there's no enthusiasm for Joe Biden. He can't get people to show up a rally, if he was able to do rallies.</p><p>So this whole scenario is really the ultimate best-case scenario for Joe Biden and his campaign. They don't want him on the stump. They don't want him speaking to reporters. They don't want him ad-libbed. Honestly, they don't even want him on a teleprompter, because he can't even get that right.</p><p>So, for them, it's sort of the ultimate. I think, with our convention, there's a lot of people that want to do it. They want to be enthusiastic. But we can do that and we can do it safely. We can take the necessary precautions. We can protect the people that are going to be there. We can implement things that you wouldn't necessarily normally implement at a convention to do so.</p><p>So, they're going to take it very seriously. We're going to do a great job with it, and it's going to be an awesome event.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What does the president need to get these numbers up? Are you buying these polls? It looks like one after the next. It is a real tight race. And, in many cases, Biden is leading the president.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: Well, listen, I think, when you have the media onslaught, where a media has just totally abdicated their position to objectively look at both sides, they're not looking into any of Biden's past.</p><p>They're not looking into any of his history. They're not looking into his family's graft. They're not looking into how insanely soft he's been on China throughout his entire career. And let's not forget, this is a 50-year career in Washington, D.C.</p><p>They're trying to run him like he's a moderate outsider. This guy is the epitome of the swamp. So they want to do whatever they can to keep the American people from actually seeing Biden.</p><p>He hasn't been defined. And the media is trying to make sure that no one gets to define Joe Biden, because, once he is, you will see how terrible this notion could be for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why you're out with a upcoming book, \"Liberal Privilege.\"</p><p>You're going to talk a lot about Biden in this book, right? You're self- publishing a book? When is it coming out, Don?</p><p>TRUMP JR.: A hundred percent.</p><p>I guess one of offshoots, one of the only positive things of quarantine for the last few months was, I had a lot of free time. And I was looking into it, and actually went on and hired a researcher just to do it myself, because I said, if the media is going to totally neglect this guy, this history, these terrible trade deals, especially now, in the post-COVID-19 world, where we are going to actually have to deal with China and deal tough with China, which is what Donald Trump's -- that's his wheelhouse.</p><p>That's his forte. He's the only guy to do it in the modern American history. That Joe Biden can sell this notion of, well, now we're going to be buy American, after 50 years of legislation that sent our jobs, that sent our American dream to China, it's asinine.</p><p>But I'm sitting there looking, whether it's Hunter Biden, whether it's Joe's brother, whether it's the sister -- the entire family has enriched themselves off of Joe Biden's publicly funded office.</p><p>He won't release his documents from 30-something years in the Senate that are sitting at the University of Delaware. These aren't like private notes that he had as a citizen. This is while he was a senator in the United States, paid for by the American taxpayer, and, somehow, that's magically off-limits?</p><p>Brett Kavanaugh's high school yearbook was not off-limits, according to Democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: His high school yearbook.</p><p>But Joe Biden's Senate papers, no, no, no, we can't touch this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: so, it's about hypocrisy. It's about the double standard.</p><p>And I called it \"Liberal Privilege,\" because we hear a lot about privilege these days, but liberal privilege is the ultimate...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: ... because they can say one thing, do the other, and never get called on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hmm.</p><p>Well, look, in the meantime, the critics of your father continue stepping it up. Just in the last two weeks, you had the mayor of New York actually painting a Black Lives Matter mural right outside of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York City.</p><p>This is where you work every day, right?</p><p>TRUMP JR.: I...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you pass this new mural here? Here is the shots of the mayor actually painting it right outside of Trump Tower.</p><p>Your reaction?</p><p>TRUMP JR.: Well, listen, it would be nice if the mayor actually did something to help the people of his city.</p><p>He's busy there playing arts and crafts, but what has he actually done, other than oversee the destruction of New York City? The guy is -- it's literally gross incompetence, but he will go there for a photo op.</p><p>What happened to the billion dollars, almost a billion dollars that were literally just lost on him and his wife's pet projects in New York City? Now he wants to defund the police, take $1 billion out of New York City's police department's budget.</p><p>What do you think is going to happen with that? You see police officers retiring in droves. You want to stop senseless killings, like George Floyd? Guess what. The answer is not driving experienced, dedicated, loyal police officers into early retirement, and filling those -- that void with inexperienced people who may not have qualified otherwise, but are only getting the job because you need someone there.</p><p>The guy doesn't know what he's doing. It's gross negligence. And, honestly, it's worse. It's just sheer incompetence. But, again, he can play arts and crafts for the photo-op, and it's as though all of the things and all of his failures are totally forgotten. But the media will give him that benefit of the doubt.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but it's going -- it's going to keep going.</p><p>And, in fact, de Blasio, Hillary Clinton, they all want mail-in voting. I want to talk to you about the, at because there was a city councilman among four people facing voter fraud charges in New Jersey.</p><p>We have got umpteen stories of this delusion, mail-in ballots forcing election officials in New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky to take two times as long to count votes in primary elections.</p><p>How much of this election is going to be mail-in voting, do you think, Don?</p><p>TRUMP JR.: Well, the Democrats would like it all to be mail-in voting. You have seen that.</p><p>How often have Republicans won after the fact when people show up? Oh, look, magically I found a bucket of ballots in my car, they're all Democrats, four days later.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: It's truly disgusting.</p><p>Over the weekend, we saw a cat, a cat that has been dead for 12 years, since the end of the Bush administration, got a voter regulation form in its home in Atlanta.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my goodness.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: This is what's going on.</p><p>A mail -- a mail clerk, someone who worked for the U.S. Postal Service...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: ... pleaded guilty over the weekend for altering ballots.</p><p>You think the Democrats aren't going to take full advantage of this? They are running around bragging that they were able to manipulate Trump rallies on TikTok.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is -- this is...</p><p>TRUMP JR.: But they are not going to take advantage of mail-in voting.</p><p>Democrats have even said it's terrible. But now, when it seems to...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP JR.: ... work against Trump, it's over.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. This is really serious stuff going into the election. You're right.</p><p>All right, real quick, final question here, Don. Will you run for the mayor of New York?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TRUMP JR.: No.</p><p>My only focus right now is making sure that my father wins in 2020. I see the policies that he's done. I see the economic results. We have seen it in the job numbers.</p><p>Donald Trump did the impossible. Donald Trump accomplished the Holy Grail of American politics, raising the job numbers for people, raising the minimum wages for the lowest-income earners, watching their wages go up for the first time in modern history.</p><p>Donald Trump did it all before. He's the guy that can do it again, clearly not swamp creature Joe Biden, who has an accomplishment record that is nonexistent in 50 years in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, maybe you will consider it after the president wins, then, Mayor of New York Donald Trump Jr.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: I don't know. That's not really my kind of job, but who knows.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, good to see you, Don.</p><p>Thanks very much for being here.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>On July 20, Congress will return to Washington, with just one objective, hammering out the next stimulus bill.</p><p>The bipartisan talks happening just as the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits is set to expire at the end of the month.</p><p>Joining me right now is Republican Conference Chairman Senator John Barrasso.</p><p>And, Senator, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me what the plans are in terms of the CARES Act or the next part of the CARES Act, another stimulus plan.</p><p>BARRASSO: Yes, there's a consensus we need to do another bill. That will be in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>And let me just tell you what I believe needs to be in it. And I think your viewers will agree.</p><p>Number one, it has to focus on getting people back to work and children back in school.</p><p>Number two, it has to focus on saving lives. And, to me, that means more testing, better treatment, and then, of course, a vaccine. And, finally, we need to provide the liability insurance for our health care workers, for our mom-and-pop small businesses, and for our schools, so they can all open in a good way.</p><p>Now, the Democrats have a proposal already. They passed it a month or so ago. And it's Nancy Pelosi living in handout heaven. It's direct checks to illegal immigrants. It's bailouts to big city and state pension plans that are run by Democrats.</p><p>We're not going to do that. The focus of this bill has to be getting people back to work and paychecks back into their pockets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you're back on July 20, but then there's another recess beginning on August 8, right?</p><p>Do you think, in that three-week period, you're going to get another stimulus plan passed and signed before you leave again August 8?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, there are a couple of deadlines, as you mentioned.</p><p>One is the enhanced uninsured -- unemployment insurance benefits that run out on July 31. The other is the Paycheck Protection Program, which has been so successful. That runs out on August 8. That's helped keep about 50 million people on their -- on a payroll. And, in Wyoming, we had 13,000 of those loans.</p><p>So, yes, there's an urgency to get this done, a lot of different things in the components of it. The question is, should it include additional relief checks for people who have still not been able to get back to work, certainly in hard-hit industries, whether it's the service industry, the hospitality industry?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>BARRASSO: You know, we did that once before, but that was at people up to $95,000. We're looking at a lower number there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>BARRASSO: And then the unemployment insurance, as you raised, these are enhanced benefits, where they have been paying people $600 a week above their own state unemployment benefits.</p><p>BARTIROMO: To make -- right.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And some of them are making more to stay home, rather than to go to work.</p><p>Stay with us, Senator. I want to ask you about masks and whether it should be a policy in that next act as well.</p><p>We're talking with Senator Barrasso. We will be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>And we are back with Senator John Barrasso.</p><p>And, Senator, I want to ask you about masks and whether or not that should be part of your CARES Act. There are some states that have made wearing a mask a policy. Should it be a national policy?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, let me just say, Maria, as a doctor, I want to congratulate President Trump for wearing his mask yesterday in public for the world to see. I think that sends a very strong message to everyone.</p><p>We know that masks lower the risk of infection. We know it lowers the risk of death. And in this recent uptick, I just think it's even more important than ever.</p><p>And when it comes to opening schools, these are going to be local decisions, state decisions. But I just think, in terms of good planning and good health, as people try to resume their normal lives, masks, personal hygiene, washing their hands, socially distancing, that's all part of this as we continue to fight this disease.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>And real quick, on the next CARES Act, when you get back on the 20th, it doesn't sound like you're going to leave on August 8 without anything getting done. Should I assume we will have another -- another stimulus package in that three week period?</p><p>BARRASSO: There is general agreement we need to work to that end, and we need to deal with the issues affecting our nation.</p><p>There are still people who can't go back to work, through no fault of their own, because of the disease, because of maybe medical conditions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BARRASSO: We need to make sure that they are cared for.</p><p>But we cannot continue to pay people more to sit at home than to go to work. And we have so many help wanted signs around Wyoming and the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BARRASSO: We need to do all we can to get people back to work and help them earn that paycheck</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator, real quick, before we go.</p><p>The Senate unanimously passed that bipartisan bill to sanction Chinese officials who threaten Hong Kong's authority, but the president hasn't signed it yet, right? What message does this send to the Communist Party? And will we see this get signed into law, do you think?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well the communist Chinese are not our friends. There is no question about it.</p><p>My message to the Chinese is, never again. Never again will we, as Americans, be dependent upon you, the communist Chinese, for medicines, for materials, for minerals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>BARRASSO: But what you're seeing here with what they're doing, Maria, with this group, with Hong Kong...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BARRASSO: ... with their -- the Chinese incursion into the South China Sea, it's all a part of their big plan to the -- to be the military, the economic and the technological superpower of the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know.</p><p>BARRASSO: We cannot allow it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks. Senator, thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But that did not stop either of these guys from making a \"Bachelorette\"-like pitch for her affection.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So far, no decision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.</p><p>And, as of this hour, we still do not know who will get the rose. What we do know is, Elizabeth Warren is very much playing hard to get, and won't make it easy.</p><p>To Molly Line in Boston on biz to win over Liz -- Molly.</p><p>MOLLY LINE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good afternoon, Neil.</p><p>As you mentioned, Elizabeth Warren stepping out here in the street this afternoon onto the concrete outside of her home here in Cambridge, Massachusetts, her voice filled with emotion, a little raspy after more than a year on the campaign trail here, making it official that she was ending her White House run.</p><p>Now, she stood up a bit for some of those principles that she ran on as she stood here, expressing thanks and gratitude to her team, to her supporters. She also promised to stay in the fight, touting some of those key issues, her wealth tax, the student loan forgiveness, affordable child care.</p><p>She was asked about the two white men that are now leading the field. Warren said she thought about all the -- quote -- \"little girls who were going to have to wait four more years.\"</p><p>What Warren didn't say is who she would endorse.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION: Will you be making an endorsement today? We know that you spoke with both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders yesterday.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): Not today. Not today. I need some space around this, and want to take a little time to think a little more.</p><p>I have been -- I have been spending a lot of time right now on the question of suspending and also making sure that this works as best we can for our staff, for our team, for our volunteers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LINE: Meanwhile, her former competitors offering praise.</p><p>Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeting: \"Senator E. Warren is the fiercest of fighters for middle-class families. Her work in Washington, in Massachusetts and on the campaign trail has made a real difference in people's lives. We needed her voice in this race and we need her continued work in the Senate.\"</p><p>Now, Senator Bernie Sanders also tweeting: \"Without her, the progressive movement wouldn't be nearly as strong as it is.\"</p><p>And to Warren's supporters, he had this to say:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would simply say to her supporters out there, of whom there are millions, we are opening the door to you. We would love you to come on board.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LINE: So, the courting of her backers is well under way -- Neil, back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Molly, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Well, Bernie might have a rose ready for Liz, but more like thorns for the other guy courting Liz. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: Right now, what you're seeing is Wall Street opening up its checkbook to Joe Biden.</p><p>You're seeing Mike Bloomberg, worth $60 billion, prepared to support Joe Biden. And that is what a corrupt political system is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, he and Joe Biden still trying to woo Elizabeth Warren, each in his own unique way.</p><p>Democratic strategist Robert Patillo. We have got GOP strategist Holly Turner, and McClatchy White House reporter Francesca Chambers.</p><p>Well, Francesca, end it with you, begin with you.</p><p>They're pulling out all the stops to win her over. How much of a difference would it make to either them if they succeed?</p><p>FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, MCCLATCHY D.C.: Well, coming up on the next Tuesday, that's a state where Elizabeth Warren, in Michigan, which has a large number of the delegates that are up for grabs that day, she was polling last at 7 percent there.</p><p>And in a race where both of them are both in the 20 percent area, a little bit higher than that, that could be the difference for one of them to pick up her supporters.</p><p>And it really is unclear at this point where her supporters would actually go. All these polls that talked about first and second choices, now that the race has been so jumbled, and so many people have dropped out recently, it's really tough to say without new polling who's in first, who's in second, and where the rest of those people will go.</p><p>CAVUTO: Robert, it's interesting that she carries -- that is, Elizabeth Warren -- more influence and heft out of the race than when she was in the race.</p><p>Do you think that, to entice her, a Joe Biden would offer the running mate position?</p><p>ROBERT PATILLO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think that's to be determined at the convention.</p><p>There's going to be a lot of competing interests, and there's going to be a real question of what exactly Elizabeth Warren could bring to a potential ticket, given her standing in the race going forward.</p><p>And also to address Bernie Sanders' comments that he made, saying that Joe Biden is simply being supported by Wall Street and corrupt billionaires, Bernie Sanders knew he had an issue with African-American voters, yet skipped the Selma march, did not go to Edmund Pettus Bridge, has not spoken out on Nathaniel Woods, who is set to be executed in Alabama in just a couple hours.</p><p>So the fact that he thinks that the corrupt establishment is the reason he keeps losing, and not the fact that he has failed to make connections with regular Democratic base voters, he's trying to start a revolution. Joe Biden is trying to win an election.</p><p>Then the question is, how can Elizabeth Warren assist in doing so?</p><p>CAVUTO: Holly Turner, I don't know how Republicans look at this.</p><p>But the consensus -- and you have reminded me, as well as your co-panelists here have reminded me -- you never jump on whatever the consensus is for the moment, but, for the moment, it is that Joe Biden has maybe a clearer path to this nomination certainly then he did, and maybe clearer than Bernie Sanders right now.</p><p>Is that a fear? Is that building as a fear at the White House? Should it?</p><p>HOLLY TURNER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: No, I don't think so.</p><p>It changes the tactics, for sure. But the campaign is prepared for that. Look, President Trump has done his job. He's delivered on his promises that he made during the campaign. Voters across all of the swing states have seen lowest unemployment, highest wages, lowest taxes, lower regulation.</p><p>So he's done his part. It's up to the campaign now to go and package those messages and deliver them to those states. And it will change the map a little bit. Florida is in play if Biden is the nominee. If Bernie is, not so much. We would focus on some of the other Rust Belt states a little bit more.</p><p>But it doesn't change the president's odds when we look at some of these polls where the president is down in some of these key swing states. It's no different than, in 2016, when he was down against Hillary Clinton, and he still won. So the campaign is confident.</p><p>We're just going to see which states we need to focus on.</p><p>CAVUTO: Francesca, along comes this coronavirus, and the fears that it's escalating. It whipsaws markets like crazy. How much of an impact, or is it too early to tell, is this all having?</p><p>CHAMBERS: Well, within the White House, the president has put a lot of focus on this, because of exactly that, that this is something where -- with the markets, and -- but also with the American people and how much concern there is with the American people about what will happen with coronavirus.</p><p>It's certainly something that, for any presidency, if this sort of thing isn't handled correctly, could be a problem long term for the president. And I think that is why you have seen stepped-up efforts within the White House to put in new staff, to put Mike Pence in charge of this, to do daily briefings at the White House, most of which have been on camera, to really get out the information to the public to try and stall some of this, again, as you said, with the markets.</p><p>CAVUTO: Robert, real quickly, it's interesting that the candidates who in the beginning were kind of critical of the approach on our reaction to all this, have been holding fire on it, maybe because they simply don't know how it will end or maybe they realize it looks tacky.</p><p>I don't know. How do you describe it?</p><p>PATILLO: Well, I think what we have to understand is that, when you are dealing with both national security or our health issues such as this, this is where politics used to stop at the border's edge.</p><p>This is where people simply say, we cannot politicize something that we do not understand. It's not as if this is a partisan issue, how to deal with coronavirus. And I think one of the first political missteps that the president has made with his judgment was when he put the word hoax and coronavirus in the same speech, and then to the very next day have people start dying in Washington state and in Seattle.</p><p>It does make it look like there's somebody asleep at the switch when it comes to dealing with this national -- this emergency. So, I think Democrats have made the proper calculation to say that we're going to let the medical experts deal with it and not try to politicize the issue.</p><p>CAVUTO: Really, really quickly, Holly, I mean, that hoax was built on the idea that a lot of Democrats were attacking him over no matter what amount of money he was asking to deal with it. I think that's where it started.</p><p>TURNER: Right. Yes, it's been totally misconstrued.</p><p>And, look, as Americans, we owe the president a debt of gratitude for his handling of this so far.</p><p>CAVUTO: We shall see. As you all say, it is still very early.</p><p>In the meantime, now to Washington going and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer trying to do damage control of his own, after saying two Supreme Court justices will -- his words -- pay the price if they rule against abortion advocates.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: I'm from Brooklyn. We speak in strong language.</p><p>I shouldn't have used the words I did, but in no way was I making a threat. I never, never would do such a thing. And Leader McConnell knows that.</p><p>And Republicans who, who are busy manufacturing outrage over these comments, know that too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, a Supreme Court justice was among those concerned about his language.</p><p>Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso on all of this.</p><p>What do you think, Senator?</p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Well, I think that Justice Roberts was right to call out Chuck Schumer for what, to me, seemed a direct threat to two members of the Supreme Court.</p><p>Neil, if someone stood outside your place of work or your home and called out your name, as Schumer did to these two chief justices -- to these two justices, and said, you will pay a price, you will not know what hit you, you would view it as a threat.</p><p>And I think that's why the chief justice did what he did, pointed out that -- where Schumer was absolutely wrong. And I think, if I were one of those justices, I would be concerned.</p><p>Look, that's the kind of thing that happened to ball players from the Republican Party before a congressional ball game, where, at their practice field, they were attacked. And it became a shooting field, with someone trying to kill them.</p><p>You have to be very concerned with your words. And I would expect much better from the minority leader, Democrat leader, Chuck Schumer. The chief justice of the Supreme Court was absolutely right to call him out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Should he be censured?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, censure is something that would happen on the floor of the Senate.</p><p>I think what's more important is that Chuck Schumer ought to personally apologize to both of these justices. He ought to do it in person or letter, but he needs to apologize for what he said and the direct threat he made on their health and their lives.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, if he doesn't do that, and the closest we got to a mea culpa were the remarks you just heard, that's not enough for you?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, it's not.</p><p>And Schumer needs to think about what he says before he speaks, that people listen to him. And he can incite violence. And he knows it. So, he needs to be better controlled in his own behavior.</p><p>But this is the way that Democrats tend to behave. Rather than working together, finding solutions, they want to attack. And that's exactly what Chuck Schumer did outside the Supreme Court. He went there. Look, he's been around this for a long time. He knew exactly what he's saying.</p><p>And I believe he intended to say it the way he did.</p><p>CAVUTO: But, I mean, it's not as if Democrats have the market cornered on inflammatory language, right?</p><p>BARRASSO: To me, this is about a physical attack.</p><p>When he calls people out by name, as he did for Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and said, you will not know what happened to you, we are coming for you, that tells me that there is a physical threat. They're going after the court in other ways.</p><p>The Democrats running for president want to stack the court, want to pack it in ways by adding more members of the court, which is what they're threatening if they win this election, which is why I'm focused so hard on making sure that President Trump gets reelected.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>BARRASSO: And he wants to take over the Senate and become majority leader. That is his goal.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. But we will all work on dialing the rhetoric down.</p><p>But, Senator, thank you very much for taking the time.</p><p>BARRASSO: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile, coronavirus cases are running up right now. Masks are running out right now. And, investors, well, they're just running away right now.</p><p>We connect. Let's just say you hide.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, cruise ship nightmare, take two, or is that three, or is it four?</p><p>Anyway, whatever. Another one stranded at sea, growing fears today more than 2,500 passengers aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship off the California coast may have been exposed to the coronavirus, this after a 71- year-old former passenger died from the illness.</p><p>FOX News' Claudia Cowan in San Francisco with the very latest -- Claudia.</p><p>CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil. That's right.</p><p>More than 3,000 passengers are essentially stranded at sea while health officials race to try to identify anyone who may have contracted COVID-19 and investigate an outbreak on a previous cruise.</p><p>At a press conference this morning, officials confirmed that a number of people who are on this ship now have gotten sick, but they say the news is not all bad. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY ELLEN CARROLL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SAN FRANCISCO EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT: A total of 35 have shown flu-like symptoms during the course of this 15-day cruise.</p><p>Many of those people have recovered and are no longer showing flu-like symptoms. Once we have results from the tests, the CDC and the state will determine the most appropriate location for the ship to berth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COWAN: A Coast Guard helicopter is airlifting hundreds of test kits to the ship. Samples will be collected today and tested at a Bay Area lab, with results expected as soon as tomorrow.</p><p>When this ship sailed to Mexico last month, at least two people contracted COVID-19, including an elderly man who died yesterday near Sacramento. When the ship returned to San Francisco on February 21, 62 people never got off. They continued on the subsequent cruise to Hawaii.</p><p>Since they have possibly been exposed, they are now under quarantine in their cabins. So, for now, no word on when this ship will be allowed to return or where it will dock. Neil, it was scheduled to come back here to San Francisco to this pier on Saturday. That is probably optimistic, and much will depend, as we heard, on the test results.</p><p>In the meantime, 55 confirmed cases of COVID-19 here in California, the most of any state -- back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow. All right, thank you, Claudia, very, very much.</p><p>Meanwhile, more wild swings on Wall Street, especially as these kind of news items come in, coronavirus cases that continue to climb, more and more companies continuing to warn, airlines likely looking at a more than $118 billion hit from battered bookings, and now reports some banks are preparing disaster plans, should the illness become more widespread in this country.</p><p>Charles Payne on the panic over what some health officials are already calling a pandemic.</p><p>But they -- it piles on, doesn't it?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, HOST, \"MAKING MONEY\": It piles on. It's the great unknown.</p><p>And the things that we do see, like on this with Claudia, she was able to connect the dots. And the last three days, in the midst of my show, we had breaking news, more deaths, particularly in Washington yesterday.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>PAYNE: Yesterday, it was the California -- the markets didn't crumble on that news, in the sense, because I think they were elderly folks, a lot in that particular nursing home, or, in that case in California, someone who had been in a cruise ship.</p><p>The unknown part of it, though, as it spreads, will younger adults take -- take a big physical hit?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But that hasn't happened. It hasn't happened.</p><p>PAYNE: It hasn't happened, which is...</p><p>CAVUTO: So, when you hear all these precautionary measures that companies are taking, event planners are taking, is it over -- overdone?</p><p>PAYNE: I really believe a large part of that has to do with the fact we're such a litigious society.</p><p>If you have an event, and you don't cancel it, and someone shows up, and they end up with the coronavirus, you're going to get sued. You probably don't even have coverage for something like that, probably -- because it didn't exist when you were in initial stages of planning this thing.</p><p>So the better part of valor is to give people back their money, if you can. And so those are the smaller things. The bigger things are obviously these planes. When you take off with an empty plane, you never get that money back.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>PAYNE: Or if you park a jet that was supposed to take off today, you never get that money back.</p><p>I mean, those industries -- a week ago, I read where the Diamond Princess wanted to go back into service in about a month. Who's going to get on it?</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>PAYNE: It's shocking to me. I mean, what are you going to charge? How much are they going to pay people to get on it? Really, it's like...</p><p>CAVUTO: And to think of the cruise industry itself, and people who are leery -- and we have heard this, that I don't even want to go on a jet these days. I don't care where it's going. I feel nervous.</p><p>And it feeds on itself.</p><p>PAYNE: It does.</p><p>What I will say was interesting is, I was in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. And so I went to La Guardia and Reagan. And of all the hundreds of people, only one person had on a mask.</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>So, but, again, we haven't had any reported cases in this whole area. But now, of course, New York is up to two. And I haven't heard anything in D.C. But it's -- but -- so we might be able to fight it off. We have been through a lot.</p><p>But the unknown is about. And fear feeds on itself.</p><p>CAVUTO: It does. I don't know which is more starling there, the one face mask, or the fact that you were flying commercial.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Something I didn't hear.</p><p>PAYNE: Something -- yes, every now and then, you have to do that, yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Charles Payne.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: He is the best, and I mean the best.</p><p>Well, forget about losing cash in the market. Top health officials don't even want you touching the cash in your wallet.</p><p>We will explain.</p><p>CAVUTO: Cash might be king, but that doesn't mean all those paper bills still can't make you sick.</p><p>The World Health Organization is now advising people to cool it on cash, because, while you might like it in your wallet, you don't know where it's been before it got there. That's pretty much what they're saying.</p><p>To family and emergency room doctor Janette Nesheiwat.</p><p>Doctor, that's it. Now, if they're saying get the cash out of that wallet, be careful with it, what the heck?</p><p>DR. JANETTE NESHEIWAT, FAMILY AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE: Well, we're literally talking dirty money here, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: And it makes sense. It's really not new.</p><p>So what happens is that the paper dollar, it's made out of like a linen type of fabric. So, virus, bacteria, E. coli, and staph, flu virus, even the COVID-19 virus, can contaminate the dollar bills. And they're handled so often.</p><p>So who knows what people have on their hands. So it goes from one person to another person. And you can potentially spread disease, virus, bacteria from one person to another. That's why they say wash your hands after you handle money.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you know what's going to happen?</p><p>You will go all out, a group of people. I wish -- I don't have any cash on me, because I'm afraid it's going to kill me. You know?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Then use an alternative, credit card. Write a check, that you can't really wash...</p><p>CAVUTO: So, there's a logic to this, and all this stuff.</p><p>But do you ever get a feeling -- and I was talking to Charles Payne about the money side of this -- but that we're really scaring ourselves here to death, I mean, the money in our wallet, the -- whether we go out in a public venue, whether we go to a movie theater, whether we go out to a restaurant?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Can't we make a bad situation worse?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Well, we shouldn't.</p><p>And these are just commonsense precautions. It's not new that...</p><p>CAVUTO: Have you emptied the cash out of your wallet?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: I don't have any cash right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, got it. You're a doctor. You have it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Everyone always takes it out of my bag.</p><p>But it's really commonsense precautions. This isn't new. A study came out in 2017 where they took a whole bunch of $1 bills here in New York, and they tested it. And they found over 397 different types of bacteria and viruses.</p><p>Just like -- what do they say? The remote controls are dirty. Cell phones are dirty. Dollars are dirty.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: So these are just areas, common surfaces in the subway, where there's so many people coming and going, that it's normal for it to carry lots of germs and bacteria.</p><p>So, basically, what we're saying is, continue commonsense precautions. If you handle something dirty, whether it's money or a remote control or something outdoors, wash your hands, don't touch your face, because this is how we can prevent the spread of infection.</p><p>CAVUTO: But I wonder whether we get people's panic attacks going here.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: I even heard one doctor recommend, avoid restaurants with buffets.</p><p>Well, there's my life.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Right?</p><p>I mean, what do you do?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Well, the problem with buffets is the risk of overeating. And so that's a bigger issue.</p><p>CAVUTO: That, I concede.</p><p>But I wonder whether this was just a dude waiting for it to empty out, so he could get all the food, but...</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Who knows. You never know.</p><p>But just moderation. Use commonsense precautions. There's no need to panic, no need to fear. We just have to live your life in a healthy manner. And if you're sick...</p><p>CAVUTO: But if someone else is not, then you're exposed, right?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: That's why it's important for us as doctors to educate.</p><p>If you're sick, stay home. Be considerate of your neighbor. Don't go out to public areas. Stay home until you're well.</p><p>And if your illness is getting worse, see your doctor, because we do have treatments for various infections, whether it's the flu infection. Even though there's actually no cure for COVID-19, there's treatment, there's supportive care that we can provide, so that you can get better quicker.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, you're a great doctor, so help me with this.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: This idea that there are getting to be mutating strains of this virus, I guess, in China.</p><p>I would imagine that makes it a little bit more complicated, because, if you're coming up with a vaccine to deal with the original version, and then it morphs into another or several versions, it's tougher.</p><p>But what do you make of that?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Good question.</p><p>No, it's not complicated. The vaccine that's under way right now is specific for COVID-19. We have seven strains of coronavirus, two alpha strains, two beta strains. So those four strains are -- cause the typical common colds, sniffles, runny nose.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: And then SARS and MERS, and now COVID-19, which, remember, Neil, about 80 percent of people will have very mild symptoms or no symptoms.</p><p>It's about 5 percent that will become critically ill. And, usually, those 5 percent are those with severe underlying medical disease, heart disease, lung disease, kidney failure. Maybe they're on dialysis, or they have diabetes or undergoing chemotherapy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: So those are the ones who are most at risk.</p><p>But, as far as the vaccine, no, it's specifically targeted to COVID-19.</p><p>CAVUTO: Got it.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Just like the flu. The flu shot is different every year.</p><p>So, yes, strains can mutate, but we're focused on the current strain right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: Got it.</p><p>Doctor, thank you. I feel a little bit better right now.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: My pleasure. Good.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm still going to go to the normal buffet, but very good seeing you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: In the meantime, the president on his way to Pennsylvania for a town hall tonight right here on FOX. Can he hang on to the keys of the Keystone State?</p><p>After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, did Chuck Schumer go simply too far with his Supreme Court remarks? You have heard from Republicans, Supreme Court justices.</p><p>Now a Democrat who says, you know what? Too far -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Trump bump, take two?</p><p>The president heading to Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for a FOX News town hall. Now, he won the state four years ago, when no one thought he had a chance. Can he do it again?</p><p>To Phil Wegmann at RealClearPolitics.</p><p>Phil, what do you think?</p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS: I think that the president knows that he won there by about 44,000 votes in 2016. And this time around, he's not taking any chances.</p><p>He's there tonight because he wants to make the argument that he's the best guy to put back in the White House. And if you think about it, he knows that if Joe Biden is going to be the nominee, Joe Biden's going to have a little bit of home field advantage.</p><p>CAVUTO: And that's the one state where he thinks he has a chance.</p><p>But, as you say, with the other industrial states that the president stunned the world by picking up, Pennsylvania was almost too easy. I'm wondering how that shapes up and whether Pennsylvania could telegraph how the rest of these so-called swing states go.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>WEGMANN: I think it's certainly possible.</p><p>And what I'm watching for tonight is for President Trump to go after Joe Biden on his promise to ban fracking.</p><p>CAVUTO: Sure.</p><p>WEGMANN: Remember, fracking and fossil fuels are a big part of the Pennsylvania economy, and he hasn't gotten too specific in his attacks thus far.</p><p>He's been able to address the field. But, as Joe Biden is emerging, I think he is becoming the foil to beat. And I don't think, whether it's in campaigning or perhaps later on the debate stage, that President Trump is going to let Biden get away with saying that he's going to get rid of that industry, which is worth millions of dollars in the state and employs a significant part of the population.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it's interesting, too, how much it hurt Bernie Sanders in like an Oklahoma, where, obviously, that has been a huge moneymaker.</p><p>And the difference that Biden confidants tell me is that he's not nearly as anti-this as is Bernie Sanders, but that might not cut it in a general election.</p><p>WEGMANN: Yes, we're getting ready for a big reveal right now, if Joe Biden becomes the nominee, because, for so long, we have heard again and again that he is a centrist, that he is a moderate, but that's only in comparison to the rest of the field.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>WEGMANN: What is very interesting is that Joe Biden argued that he was a moderate and the guy to beat Trump, and he adopted some of these farther left positions.</p><p>But if he is on the ticket come November, he's going to have to defend some of these things that he's adopted. And so this idea that he's a moderate is something that Trump is going to attack very heavily. And I expect to see that tonight.</p><p>CAVUTO: The Elizabeth Warren sort of wooing on the part of Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, who do you think ultimately gets the rose here?</p><p>WEGMANN: Oh, boy, that's a tough question.</p><p>I talked to a Bernie Sanders national surrogate today, and they talked about the possibility of a super progressive ticket. They said that there's no way that Joe Biden or even Donald Trump could beat Bernie plus Elizabeth. I don't know if that's true.</p><p>But think about this. Remember, Elizabeth Warren, she went to war with Bernie Sanders. She said that he told her she couldn't win the presidency because she was a woman. That's a very significant attack that a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters are going to remember and that Elizabeth Warren supporters are going to remember.</p><p>But I think that something to focus on here is that Elizabeth Warren has been progressive, but she's also been very friendly with the DNC in a way that Bernie Sanders has not.</p><p>So it could go either way. But I would hedge towards Sanders, not Biden.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. We will watch very, very closely.</p><p>She certainly has more influence now than she did when she was a candidate. So we will -- we will see how that sorts out.</p><p>Phil Wegmann, always good. Thank you, my friend.</p><p>WEGMANN: Thank you, sir.</p><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile, the Supreme smackdown of one Chuck Schumer, not from Republicans. Meet the Democrat who said, Chuck, you went too far.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER: I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that's what started it, Chuck Schumer sparking a firestorm with those remarks.</p><p>Even Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts slamming him for it, and the drama continued on the Senate floor today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): The minority leader of the United States Senate threatened two associated justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, period.</p><p>There's no other way to interpret that.</p><p>SCHUMER: I should not have used the words I used yesterday. They didn't come out the way I intended to.</p><p>My point was that there would be political consequences, political consequences, for President Trump and Senate Republicans, if the Supreme Court, with the newly confirmed justices, stripped away a woman's right to choose.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Did Senator Schumer say enough to tamp this down?</p><p>Former Democratic Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr. with me now.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>HAROLD FORD JR. (D), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: He did.</p><p>Look, we have a tradition now in politics where people won't never apologize for anything. And Senator Schumer certainly was not going to apologize, when he sees the president not doing that.</p><p>He was wrong to use the words he did. And I was glad to see him come back to the floor and say, this was not a direct at either...</p><p>CAVUTO: But he explained it, more than apologizing for it.</p><p>FORD: Well, yes, but he has every right to disagree with policy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Sure, absolutely.</p><p>FORD: And that's a long tradition there also.</p><p>Look, I listened to Senator McConnell, who I hold in high regard because he's the majority leader. I need a little less sanctimony, a little more honor and humility in the business.</p><p>He has to remember that, when Merrick Garland wanted a hearing, he denied a hearing. He then went on to say last year that if -- if there were opening on a Supreme Court, and President Trump would forward the nominee, he would give that nominee hearing even in an election year, which was his reason for not doing it for Merrick Garland.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right, the opposite of what...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORD: Now, we have gotten to a point where I think the American people are fed up with this kind of pettiness at the highest level of politics.</p><p>We expect it from an everyday member of the political class in America, but not the highest levels, the chief justice having to reprimand the minority leader of the Senate.</p><p>Remember, the chief justice, in his report, his annual report just a few months ago said that our democracy is a fragile thing, and we have to work to hold onto it.</p><p>I thought he was sending a message to both Democrats and Republicans. But the other day, he had to send wonder directly to Senator Schumer. I was pleased to see him go to the floor today. And, hopefully, we can move on beyond this.</p><p>CAVUTO: But you usually hear this type of language or in-your-face language during an election year, a little less so in off-election years. But now it's gotten to be pretty -- pretty common.</p><p>But I'm thinking, in an environment, a backdrop where we have this coronavirus, and a lot of people are afraid and wondering what's next, probably now's not the time.</p><p>FORD: Like I said, the American people didn't sign up for this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>FORD: This is not what they bargained for when they think about leadership in the Senate.</p><p>Listen, I watched Senator from -- the Wyoming senator, Senator Barrasso, on a little while ago.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>FORD: I thought he went overboard with it.</p><p>I mean, at the end of the day, I don't think Chuck Schumer is a violent man. I don't think Chuck Schumer was suggesting...</p><p>CAVUTO: But we have just our words carefully.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORD: Right.</p><p>But if he had a history of being a violent person, I get it. He made a mistake. He's accepted responsibility.</p><p>CAVUTO: I always think of it, when you galvanize a crowd on the left or the right, and, by leaving it out there, and leaving them in a fighting mood, you lay the groundwork for that kind of stuff.</p><p>FORD: And it happens on both sides.</p><p>But I give him credit.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>FORD: At least he came to the floor and said look, a mistake was made here. Let me tell you what I meant.</p><p>And, hopefully, he doesn't do it again.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, we will see.</p><p>But let me get your take on the Elizabeth warren situation while I have you here.</p><p>Does it make a difference who she supports, if she ends up supporting anyone?</p><p>FORD: I thought she would have endorsed someone today.</p><p>I thought, as we talked a little bit off-camera, I think she probably missed a moment to be really, really effective.</p><p>CAVUTO: I thought that too.</p><p>FORD: Even if she didn't pick, I thought she should have used the moment to lay out what she was looking for and where the country needed to go.</p><p>And she...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But I think her reference to another woman who fails to be an inspiration to little girls, maybe it was you, as a candidate, Senator, not -- regardless of your gender.</p><p>FORD: Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: But that comes up a lot.</p><p>FORD: I think -- I mean, the -- and we play a lot of identity politics.</p><p>CAVUTO: I know.</p><p>FORD: And it's been on a lot of sides.</p><p>But it helped Biden, because she -- everyone expected her to endorse Sanders. I listened to Sanders yesterday and today, and he continues to be critical of Biden's votes some 20 years ago.</p><p>CAVUTO: But he's still going to pick up the slack, because it's a clear field for him in these next primaries, right?</p><p>FORD: Right.</p><p>So, the country will now -- Democrats will have a chance. It's a clear choice, what Democrats -- the path they want to travel up until the summer, and then kind of message they want to go up against Trump with in the fall.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>FORD: Do you want the Sanders path? Do you want the Biden path?</p><p>And we're going to get these -- see these two guys go at each other.</p><p>The one piece of advice I'd give both of them, focus on the future. No one cares about how they voted 20 years ago, Sanders voted to shield gun manufacturers.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>FORD: He would be -- we would have different gun laws, but I'm not going to blame him for violence in black and brown communities across the country.</p><p>CAVUTO: And those votes were during the Civil War, which...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm kidding. I'm kidding, kidding.</p><p>All right.</p><p>FORD: So, look forward, is all...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I hear you.</p><p>Harold Ford Jr., a very calm voice in this craziness.</p><p>In the meantime, what if your favorite college team wins March Madness, right, but there's no one in the stands to see it? Did it happen? Will it happen?</p><p>Let's just say they are bouncing it around -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo confirming there are a lot of new coronavirus cases.</p><p>So, essentially, they doubled in a day to 22, just as New Jersey is seeing its first confirmed case.</p><p>So, how are folks dealing with all of this?</p><p>Alex Hogan in New York City with the very latest.</p><p>Hey, Alex.</p><p>ALEX HOGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil. That's right.</p><p>Again, all of these cases that we're seeing today doubling; 1,000 people are under quarantine just here in New York. Many of the new cases that we're seeing are not from people who've traveled abroad, but from it spreading in local communities.</p><p>Governor Andrew Cuomo announcing 11 new cases in New York, bringing up the total to 22 in the state. Eight of those are new cases tied to a 50-year- old Westchester County attorney.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): What is going to happen is, the number will continue to go up. It must, because we are continuing to test more and more.</p><p>The more you test, the higher number you will have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOGAN: Among some of those new cases in the city, there's a woman in her 80s and a man in his 40s. Both are hospitalized, isolated and undergoing testing.</p><p>New Jersey is also reporting its second case today, Cuomo telling the public not to panic, but to stay informed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm a little bit worried.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a lot with the media. It's hype right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am a little worried about taking the subway. I think that's my biggest hesitation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have come over from Belfast. And the people were talking about canceling trips and stuff. But we didn't have any second thoughts about it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I clean my hands better and I have a young daughter, so I take care of her a lot more.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The stock market, I'm worried about. I don't like seeing that go down like it has.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think, in the long run, it's going to be -- it's going to be OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hand sanitizer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hand sanitizer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Got to have it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's getting real now.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOGAN: More companies now are taking containment into their own hands by canceling work trips, some big tech giants in Seattle like, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, ordering employees to go home, some even suggesting that they should work there all month long -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All month. All right, holy Toledo.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Alex, thank you very, very much. Great report.</p><p>Meanwhile, two NCAA basketball teams have canceled games over this coronavirus concern, as both Italy and Japan, among others, announce that they will play their professional sports in empty stadiums for now, maybe for a while.</p><p>Think about it. Conventions, meetings, conferences, you name it, companies are nixing all of it.</p><p>How do businesses deal with this, when billions of dollars are on the line?</p><p>Let's ask for McDonald's USA President and CEO Ed Rensi.</p><p>Ed, I'm thinking of your old haunts, and I'm thinking about all the companies now, as we get into annual shareholder meeting time, that are looking and reexamining even having them. What do you think of that?</p><p>ED RENSI, FORMER CEO, MCDONALD'S: Well, the reality of it is, the number one objective of every CEO of every company in the United States or across the world should be employee and customer safety first and foremost.</p><p>We need to educate ourselves on what's going on from the public health service. We need to make sure that our employees practice hygiene, washing their hands, using sanitizing, restrict as much as possible international travel, until we know more about what the landscape look like.</p><p>It's going to be expensive, come to grips with it. I think stakeholders and shareholders will come to understand that we need to have precaution.</p><p>Public health is more important at any moment than shareholder wealth, in my opinion.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, touche to that.</p><p>Ed, I'm just wondering whether it compounds on its own. In other words, people then start thinking, all right, I'm not going to go to movie theaters, because a lot of people congregate there. I'm not going to basketball venues, a lot of people congregate there. And they extend it to restaurants. I'm not going to go a restaurant. I might even think twice about a drive-through.</p><p>Where does this end?</p><p>RENSI: Well, the reality of it is, I'm the chairman of a company called FAT Brands based in California.</p><p>And we are emphasizing in-store sanitation -- it's a restaurant group -- in-store sanitation, personal hygiene. And we're emphasizing delivery. We want our folks to enjoy our products. And we're putting an emphasis on delivery.</p><p>But the reality of it is, people are going to overreact in the short-term because of a lack of knowledge.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>RENSI: Once they know more, I think they will calm down.</p><p>I think one of the most ridiculous things I have seen is Corona beer sales being down...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>RENSI: ... because it's got a similar name. I mean, it's absurd.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's beyond absurd. And it's getting to the point of just being needlessly panicking to folks.</p><p>What do you tell them, then? I mean, obviously, this isn't yet anything approaching even a fraction of the magnitude of the common flu, but it is what it is. People are taking precautionary steps. Do you think this could drive us into a slowdown, or even worse?</p><p>RENSI: I don't think, long term, it will, because we have got a very robust employment situation. People are pretty happy with what's going on.</p><p>All the people I talked to and the places I haunt daily, whether it's the local public, wherever it may be, I see the normal folks are out and about. They're just being cautious.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>RENSI: They're watching what they do. They're watching where they go.</p><p>But to overreact and panic -- now, if you're 80 years old and in bad health, you really need to be cautious. If you have very, very young children that are immunosuppressed, you better be very, very cautious.</p><p>But the normal human being doesn't have much to worry about.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, knock on whatever.</p><p>Ed Rensi, some calming words. Appreciate it, my friend. Be well.</p><p>RENSI: Thank you. You too.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Ed Rensi.</p><p>Well, we all know the coronavirus started in China, but it exposed just how much companies here depend on China.</p><p>Doctors are still looking for a cure for the virus there. A lot of those companies, in the meantime, are desperately looking to make more of their stuff here.</p><p>CAVUTO: We still don't know much about this virus in China.</p><p>What a lot of U.S. companies do know is, it's way too much of their business that's depending on China, not just as a place to sell their stuff, but as a place to make their stuff.</p><p>Now tech giants like Apple and Microsoft are trying to spread the wealth. But if my next guest is right, it won't be easy, and it won't be cheap, and it might not come soon.</p><p>To the man who literally wrote the book about \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" Gordon Chang.</p><p>So, Gordon, a lot of them want to sort of hedge their bets, spread their wealth. Easier said than done, right?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Well, it is.</p><p>But, for some companies, it's pretty easy. So, if you have, let's say, low- tech manufacturing, you can move out six months, nine months. That occurred during the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, when companies left and then came back.</p><p>But if you're Apple, and you are fixed in China with Foxconn, the contract manufacturer, it's going to take some time.</p><p>But, Neil, they're going to have to do it, because manufacturing in China is becoming unsustainable.</p><p>CAVUTO: What about China right now? And do you feel comfortable in the information they are sharing with the world on the coronavirus?</p><p>CHANG: No, Neil, because the Communist Party is imposing extraordinary controls on information.</p><p>Xi Jinping is doing this because he wants workers to return to their job sites. So their infection numbers and their death numbers, I think, are being managed to do that. And the other thing, Neil, is that what you're seeing is, as people go back to work, because they're forced by the government to do that, they are prolonging the epidemic, because new workers are infecting each other at this very moment.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, they come back, they increase the number of cases. That just exponentially gets bigger, which means, I think, from what you're saying, that this thing doesn't go away anytime soon.</p><p>CHANG: It'll go away a lot longer than it should.</p><p>And, also, we don't know much about this virus. It's acting in ways that -- very different from other coronaviruses. It likes hot weather, for instance.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: It's mutating. All sorts of things are going wrong here.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so we say, usually, warmer weather negates the effect. This seems to be one -- or at least a strand of it that seems to thrive in that.</p><p>We just don't know. What we do know is, it's drawing economic activity, certainly, in China, to a halt. They might be in a recessionary quarter. And that will eventually spill over here.</p><p>Play it out. What do you think happens?</p><p>CHANG: Well, clearly, China right now is in contraction.</p><p>It is also exposing a lot of financially weak companies to the possibility of default. Beijing is now imposing, I think, essentially emergency measures to keep the economy going. They can do that for a little while, Neil. But if this virus continues longer than people expect, then it's going to really stress the financial system there.</p><p>And it's going to spread panic throughout the global financial system. We have seen that now for the last three or four days, with our Dow up and down and up and down.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>CHANG: This is really crazy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Indeed, it is.</p><p>Gordon, thank you very, very much. We're watching it all very, very closely.</p><p>For those of who just tuned in, a peek at the Dow today, down about 969 points, so essentially giving back kind of what we gained yesterday.</p><p>But I always like to leave you with some good news. If you are looking to refinance a mortgage or get a new one, we are at all-time lows in interest rates. That could translate to a good backstop to have. That, along with declining gas prices, mean more money in your pocket, more cash, if you're not afraid of touching it.</p><p>Here's \"THE FIVE.\"</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

We know that you spoke with both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders yesterday.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): Not today. Not today. I need some space around this, and want to take a little time to think a little more.</p><p>I have been -- I have been spending a lot of time right now on the question of suspending and also making sure that this works as best we can for our staff, for our team, for our volunteers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LINE: Meanwhile, her former competitors offering praise.</p><p>Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeting: \"Senator E. Warren is the fiercest of fighters for middle-class families. Her work in Washington, in Massachusetts and on the campaign trail has made a real difference in people's lives. We needed her voice in this race and we need her continued work in the Senate.\"</p><p>Now, Senator Bernie Sanders also tweeting: \"Without her, the progressive movement wouldn't be nearly as strong as it is.\"</p><p>And to Warren's supporters, he had this to say:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would simply say to her supporters out there, of whom there are millions, we are opening the door to you. We would love you to come on board.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LINE: So, the courting of her backers is well under way -- Neil, back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Molly, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Well, Bernie might have a rose ready for Liz, but more like thorns for the other guy courting Liz. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: Right now, what you're seeing is Wall Street opening up its checkbook to Joe Biden.</p><p>You're seeing Mike Bloomberg, worth $60 billion, prepared to support Joe Biden. And that is what a corrupt political system is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, he and Joe Biden still trying to woo Elizabeth Warren, each in his own unique way.</p><p>Democratic strategist Robert Patillo. We have got GOP strategist Holly Turner, and McClatchy White House reporter Francesca Chambers.</p><p>Well, Francesca, end it with you, begin with you.</p><p>They're pulling out all the stops to win her over. How much of a difference would it make to either them if they succeed?</p><p>FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, MCCLATCHY D.C.: Well, coming up on the next Tuesday, that's a state where Elizabeth Warren, in Michigan, which has a large number of the delegates that are up for grabs that day, she was polling last at 7 percent there.</p><p>And in a race where both of them are both in the 20 percent area, a little bit higher than that, that could be the difference for one of them to pick up her supporters.</p><p>And it really is unclear at this point where her supporters would actually go. All these polls that talked about first and second choices, now that the race has been so jumbled, and so many people have dropped out recently, it's really tough to say without new polling who's in first, who's in second, and where the rest of those people will go.</p><p>CAVUTO: Robert, it's interesting that she carries -- that is, Elizabeth Warren -- more influence and heft out of the race than when she was in the race.</p><p>Do you think that, to entice her, a Joe Biden would offer the running mate position?</p><p>ROBERT PATILLO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think that's to be determined at the convention.</p><p>There's going to be a lot of competing interests, and there's going to be a real question of what exactly Elizabeth Warren could bring to a potential ticket, given her standing in the race going forward.</p><p>And also to address Bernie Sanders' comments that he made, saying that Joe Biden is simply being supported by Wall Street and corrupt billionaires, Bernie Sanders knew he had an issue with African-American voters, yet skipped the Selma march, did not go to Edmund Pettus Bridge, has not spoken out on Nathaniel Woods, who is set to be executed in Alabama in just a couple hours.</p><p>So the fact that he thinks that the corrupt establishment is the reason he keeps losing, and not the fact that he has failed to make connections with regular Democratic base voters, he's trying to start a revolution. Joe Biden is trying to win an election.</p><p>Then the question is, how can Elizabeth Warren assist in doing so?</p><p>CAVUTO: Holly Turner, I don't know how Republicans look at this.</p><p>But the consensus -- and you have reminded me, as well as your co-panelists here have reminded me -- you never jump on whatever the consensus is for the moment, but, for the moment, it is that Joe Biden has maybe a clearer path to this nomination certainly then he did, and maybe clearer than Bernie Sanders right now.</p><p>Is that a fear? Is that building as a fear at the White House? Should it?</p><p>HOLLY TURNER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: No, I don't think so.</p><p>It changes the tactics, for sure. But the campaign is prepared for that. Look, President Trump has done his job. He's delivered on his promises that he made during the campaign. Voters across all of the swing states have seen lowest unemployment, highest wages, lowest taxes, lower regulation.</p><p>So he's done his part. It's up to the campaign now to go and package those messages and deliver them to those states. And it will change the map a little bit. Florida is in play if Biden is the nominee. If Bernie is, not so much. We would focus on some of the other Rust Belt states a little bit more.</p><p>But it doesn't change the president's odds when we look at some of these polls where the president is down in some of these key swing states. It's no different than, in 2016, when he was down against Hillary Clinton, and he still won. So the campaign is confident.</p><p>We're just going to see which states we need to focus on.</p><p>CAVUTO: Francesca, along comes this coronavirus, and the fears that it's escalating. It whipsaws markets like crazy. How much of an impact, or is it too early to tell, is this all having?</p><p>CHAMBERS: Well, within the White House, the president has put a lot of focus on this, because of exactly that, that this is something where -- with the markets, and -- but also with the American people and how much concern there is with the American people about what will happen with coronavirus.</p><p>It's certainly something that, for any presidency, if this sort of thing isn't handled correctly, could be a problem long term for the president. And I think that is why you have seen stepped-up efforts within the White House to put in new staff, to put Mike Pence in charge of this, to do daily briefings at the White House, most of which have been on camera, to really get out the information to the public to try and stall some of this, again, as you said, with the markets.</p><p>CAVUTO: Robert, real quickly, it's interesting that the candidates who in the beginning were kind of critical of the approach on our reaction to all this, have been holding fire on it, maybe because they simply don't know how it will end or maybe they realize it looks tacky.</p><p>I don't know. How do you describe it?</p><p>PATILLO: Well, I think what we have to understand is that, when you are dealing with both national security or our health issues such as this, this is where politics used to stop at the border's edge.</p><p>This is where people simply say, we cannot politicize something that we do not understand. It's not as if this is a partisan issue, how to deal with coronavirus. And I think one of the first political missteps that the president has made with his judgment was when he put the word hoax and coronavirus in the same speech, and then to the very next day have people start dying in Washington state and in Seattle.</p><p>It does make it look like there's somebody asleep at the switch when it comes to dealing with this national -- this emergency. So, I think Democrats have made the proper calculation to say that we're going to let the medical experts deal with it and not try to politicize the issue.</p><p>CAVUTO: Really, really quickly, Holly, I mean, that hoax was built on the idea that a lot of Democrats were attacking him over no matter what amount of money he was asking to deal with it. I think that's where it started.</p><p>TURNER: Right. Yes, it's been totally misconstrued.</p><p>And, look, as Americans, we owe the president a debt of gratitude for his handling of this so far.</p><p>CAVUTO: We shall see. As you all say, it is still very early.</p><p>In the meantime, now to Washington going and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer trying to do damage control of his own, after saying two Supreme Court justices will -- his words -- pay the price if they rule against abortion advocates.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: I'm from Brooklyn. We speak in strong language.</p><p>I shouldn't have used the words I did, but in no way was I making a threat. I never, never would do such a thing. And Leader McConnell knows that.</p><p>And Republicans who, who are busy manufacturing outrage over these comments, know that too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, a Supreme Court justice was among those concerned about his language.</p><p>Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso on all of this.</p><p>What do you think, Senator?</p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Well, I think that Justice Roberts was right to call out Chuck Schumer for what, to me, seemed a direct threat to two members of the Supreme Court.</p><p>Neil, if someone stood outside your place of work or your home and called out your name, as Schumer did to these two chief justices -- to these two justices, and said, you will pay a price, you will not know what hit you, you would view it as a threat.</p><p>And I think that's why the chief justice did what he did, pointed out that -- where Schumer was absolutely wrong. And I think, if I were one of those justices, I would be concerned.</p><p>Look, that's the kind of thing that happened to ball players from the Republican Party before a congressional ball game, where, at their practice field, they were attacked. And it became a shooting field, with someone trying to kill them.</p><p>You have to be very concerned with your words. And I would expect much better from the minority leader, Democrat leader, Chuck Schumer. The chief justice of the Supreme Court was absolutely right to call him out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Should he be censured?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, censure is something that would happen on the floor of the Senate.</p><p>I think what's more important is that Chuck Schumer ought to personally apologize to both of these justices. He ought to do it in person or letter, but he needs to apologize for what he said and the direct threat he made on their health and their lives.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, if he doesn't do that, and the closest we got to a mea culpa were the remarks you just heard, that's not enough for you?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, it's not.</p><p>And Schumer needs to think about what he says before he speaks, that people listen to him. And he can incite violence. And he knows it. So, he needs to be better controlled in his own behavior.</p><p>But this is the way that Democrats tend to behave. Rather than working together, finding solutions, they want to attack. And that's exactly what Chuck Schumer did outside the Supreme Court. He went there. Look, he's been around this for a long time. He knew exactly what he's saying.</p><p>And I believe he intended to say it the way he did.</p><p>CAVUTO: But, I mean, it's not as if Democrats have the market cornered on inflammatory language, right?</p><p>BARRASSO: To me, this is about a physical attack.</p><p>When he calls people out by name, as he did for Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and said, you will not know what happened to you, we are coming for you, that tells me that there is a physical threat. They're going after the court in other ways.</p><p>The Democrats running for president want to stack the court, want to pack it in ways by adding more members of the court, which is what they're threatening if they win this election, which is why I'm focused so hard on making sure that President Trump gets reelected.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>BARRASSO: And he wants to take over the Senate and become majority leader. That is his goal.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. But we will all work on dialing the rhetoric down.</p><p>But, Senator, thank you very much for taking the time.</p><p>BARRASSO: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile, coronavirus cases are running up right now. Masks are running out right now. And, investors, well, they're just running away right now.</p><p>We connect. Let's just say you hide.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, cruise ship nightmare, take two, or is that three, or is it four?</p><p>Anyway, whatever. Another one stranded at sea, growing fears today more than 2,500 passengers aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship off the California coast may have been exposed to the coronavirus, this after a 71- year-old former passenger died from the illness.</p><p>FOX News' Claudia Cowan in San Francisco with the very latest -- Claudia.</p><p>CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil. That's right.</p><p>More than 3,000 passengers are essentially stranded at sea while health officials race to try to identify anyone who may have contracted COVID-19 and investigate an outbreak on a previous cruise.</p><p>At a press conference this morning, officials confirmed that a number of people who are on this ship now have gotten sick, but they say the news is not all bad. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY ELLEN CARROLL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SAN FRANCISCO EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT: A total of 35 have shown flu-like symptoms during the course of this 15-day cruise.</p><p>Many of those people have recovered and are no longer showing flu-like symptoms. Once we have results from the tests, the CDC and the state will determine the most appropriate location for the ship to berth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COWAN: A Coast Guard helicopter is airlifting hundreds of test kits to the ship. Samples will be collected today and tested at a Bay Area lab, with results expected as soon as tomorrow.</p><p>When this ship sailed to Mexico last month, at least two people contracted COVID-19, including an elderly man who died yesterday near Sacramento. When the ship returned to San Francisco on February 21, 62 people never got off. They continued on the subsequent cruise to Hawaii.</p><p>Since they have possibly been exposed, they are now under quarantine in their cabins. So, for now, no word on when this ship will be allowed to return or where it will dock. Neil, it was scheduled to come back here to San Francisco to this pier on Saturday. That is probably optimistic, and much will depend, as we heard, on the test results.</p><p>In the meantime, 55 confirmed cases of COVID-19 here in California, the most of any state -- back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow. All right, thank you, Claudia, very, very much.</p><p>Meanwhile, more wild swings on Wall Street, especially as these kind of news items come in, coronavirus cases that continue to climb, more and more companies continuing to warn, airlines likely looking at a more than $118 billion hit from battered bookings, and now reports some banks are preparing disaster plans, should the illness become more widespread in this country.</p><p>Charles Payne on the panic over what some health officials are already calling a pandemic.</p><p>But they -- it piles on, doesn't it?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, HOST, \"MAKING MONEY\": It piles on. It's the great unknown.</p><p>And the things that we do see, like on this with Claudia, she was able to connect the dots. And the last three days, in the midst of my show, we had breaking news, more deaths, particularly in Washington yesterday.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>PAYNE: Yesterday, it was the California -- the markets didn't crumble on that news, in the sense, because I think they were elderly folks, a lot in that particular nursing home, or, in that case in California, someone who had been in a cruise ship.</p><p>The unknown part of it, though, as it spreads, will younger adults take -- take a big physical hit?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But that hasn't happened. It hasn't happened.</p><p>PAYNE: It hasn't happened, which is...</p><p>CAVUTO: So, when you hear all these precautionary measures that companies are taking, event planners are taking, is it over -- overdone?</p><p>PAYNE: I really believe a large part of that has to do with the fact we're such a litigious society.</p><p>If you have an event, and you don't cancel it, and someone shows up, and they end up with the coronavirus, you're going to get sued. You probably don't even have coverage for something like that, probably -- because it didn't exist when you were in initial stages of planning this thing.</p><p>So the better part of valor is to give people back their money, if you can. And so those are the smaller things. The bigger things are obviously these planes. When you take off with an empty plane, you never get that money back.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>PAYNE: Or if you park a jet that was supposed to take off today, you never get that money back.</p><p>I mean, those industries -- a week ago, I read where the Diamond Princess wanted to go back into service in about a month. Who's going to get on it?</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>PAYNE: It's shocking to me. I mean, what are you going to charge? How much are they going to pay people to get on it? Really, it's like...</p><p>CAVUTO: And to think of the cruise industry itself, and people who are leery -- and we have heard this, that I don't even want to go on a jet these days. I don't care where it's going. I feel nervous.</p><p>And it feeds on itself.</p><p>PAYNE: It does.</p><p>What I will say was interesting is, I was in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. And so I went to La Guardia and Reagan. And of all the hundreds of people, only one person had on a mask.</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>So, but, again, we haven't had any reported cases in this whole area. But now, of course, New York is up to two. And I haven't heard anything in D.C. But it's -- but -- so we might be able to fight it off. We have been through a lot.</p><p>But the unknown is about. And fear feeds on itself.</p><p>CAVUTO: It does. I don't know which is more starling there, the one face mask, or the fact that you were flying commercial.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Something I didn't hear.</p><p>PAYNE: Something -- yes, every now and then, you have to do that, yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Charles Payne.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: He is the best, and I mean the best.</p><p>Well, forget about losing cash in the market. Top health officials don't even want you touching the cash in your wallet.</p><p>We will explain.</p><p>CAVUTO: Cash might be king, but that doesn't mean all those paper bills still can't make you sick.</p><p>The World Health Organization is now advising people to cool it on cash, because, while you might like it in your wallet, you don't know where it's been before it got there. That's pretty much what they're saying.</p><p>To family and emergency room doctor Janette Nesheiwat.</p><p>Doctor, that's it. Now, if they're saying get the cash out of that wallet, be careful with it, what the heck?</p><p>DR. JANETTE NESHEIWAT, FAMILY AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE: Well, we're literally talking dirty money here, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: And it makes sense. It's really not new.</p><p>So what happens is that the paper dollar, it's made out of like a linen type of fabric. So, virus, bacteria, E. coli, and staph, flu virus, even the COVID-19 virus, can contaminate the dollar bills. And they're handled so often.</p><p>So who knows what people have on their hands. So it goes from one person to another person. And you can potentially spread disease, virus, bacteria from one person to another. That's why they say wash your hands after you handle money.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you know what's going to happen?</p><p>You will go all out, a group of people. I wish -- I don't have any cash on me, because I'm afraid it's going to kill me. You know?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Then use an alternative, credit card. Write a check, that you can't really wash...</p><p>CAVUTO: So, there's a logic to this, and all this stuff.</p><p>But do you ever get a feeling -- and I was talking to Charles Payne about the money side of this -- but that we're really scaring ourselves here to death, I mean, the money in our wallet, the -- whether we go out in a public venue, whether we go to a movie theater, whether we go out to a restaurant?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Can't we make a bad situation worse?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Well, we shouldn't.</p><p>And these are just commonsense precautions. It's not new that...</p><p>CAVUTO: Have you emptied the cash out of your wallet?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: I don't have any cash right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, got it. You're a doctor. You have it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Everyone always takes it out of my bag.</p><p>But it's really commonsense precautions. This isn't new. A study came out in 2017 where they took a whole bunch of $1 bills here in New York, and they tested it. And they found over 397 different types of bacteria and viruses.</p><p>Just like -- what do they say? The remote controls are dirty. Cell phones are dirty. Dollars are dirty.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: So these are just areas, common surfaces in the subway, where there's so many people coming and going, that it's normal for it to carry lots of germs and bacteria.</p><p>So, basically, what we're saying is, continue commonsense precautions. If you handle something dirty, whether it's money or a remote control or something outdoors, wash your hands, don't touch your face, because this is how we can prevent the spread of infection.</p><p>CAVUTO: But I wonder whether we get people's panic attacks going here.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: I even heard one doctor recommend, avoid restaurants with buffets.</p><p>Well, there's my life.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Right?</p><p>I mean, what do you do?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Well, the problem with buffets is the risk of overeating. And so that's a bigger issue.</p><p>CAVUTO: That, I concede.</p><p>But I wonder whether this was just a dude waiting for it to empty out, so he could get all the food, but...</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Who knows. You never know.</p><p>But just moderation. Use commonsense precautions. There's no need to panic, no need to fear. We just have to live your life in a healthy manner. And if you're sick...</p><p>CAVUTO: But if someone else is not, then you're exposed, right?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: That's why it's important for us as doctors to educate.</p><p>If you're sick, stay home. Be considerate of your neighbor. Don't go out to public areas. Stay home until you're well.</p><p>And if your illness is getting worse, see your doctor, because we do have treatments for various infections, whether it's the flu infection. Even though there's actually no cure for COVID-19, there's treatment, there's supportive care that we can provide, so that you can get better quicker.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, you're a great doctor, so help me with this.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: This idea that there are getting to be mutating strains of this virus, I guess, in China.</p><p>I would imagine that makes it a little bit more complicated, because, if you're coming up with a vaccine to deal with the original version, and then it morphs into another or several versions, it's tougher.</p><p>But what do you make of that?</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Good question.</p><p>No, it's not complicated. The vaccine that's under way right now is specific for COVID-19. We have seven strains of coronavirus, two alpha strains, two beta strains. So those four strains are -- cause the typical common colds, sniffles, runny nose.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: And then SARS and MERS, and now COVID-19, which, remember, Neil, about 80 percent of people will have very mild symptoms or no symptoms.</p><p>It's about 5 percent that will become critically ill. And, usually, those 5 percent are those with severe underlying medical disease, heart disease, lung disease, kidney failure. Maybe they're on dialysis, or they have diabetes or undergoing chemotherapy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: So those are the ones who are most at risk.</p><p>But, as far as the vaccine, no, it's specifically targeted to COVID-19.</p><p>CAVUTO: Got it.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: Just like the flu. The flu shot is different every year.</p><p>So, yes, strains can mutate, but we're focused on the current strain right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: Got it.</p><p>Doctor, thank you. I feel a little bit better right now.</p><p>NESHEIWAT: My pleasure. Good.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm still going to go to the normal buffet, but very good seeing you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: In the meantime, the president on his way to Pennsylvania for a town hall tonight right here on FOX. Can he hang on to the keys of the Keystone State?</p><p>After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, did Chuck Schumer go simply too far with his Supreme Court remarks? You have heard from Republicans, Supreme Court justices.</p><p>Now a Democrat who says, you know what? Too far -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Trump bump, take two?</p><p>The president heading to Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for a FOX News town hall. Now, he won the state four years ago, when no one thought he had a chance. Can he do it again?</p><p>To Phil Wegmann at RealClearPolitics.</p><p>Phil, what do you think?</p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS: I think that the president knows that he won there by about 44,000 votes in 2016. And this time around, he's not taking any chances.</p><p>He's there tonight because he wants to make the argument that he's the best guy to put back in the White House. And if you think about it, he knows that if Joe Biden is going to be the nominee, Joe Biden's going to have a little bit of home field advantage.</p><p>CAVUTO: And that's the one state where he thinks he has a chance.</p><p>But, as you say, with the other industrial states that the president stunned the world by picking up, Pennsylvania was almost too easy. I'm wondering how that shapes up and whether Pennsylvania could telegraph how the rest of these so-called swing states go.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>WEGMANN: I think it's certainly possible.</p><p>And what I'm watching for tonight is for President Trump to go after Joe Biden on his promise to ban fracking.</p><p>CAVUTO: Sure.</p><p>WEGMANN: Remember, fracking and fossil fuels are a big part of the Pennsylvania economy, and he hasn't gotten too specific in his attacks thus far.</p><p>He's been able to address the field. But, as Joe Biden is emerging, I think he is becoming the foil to beat. And I don't think, whether it's in campaigning or perhaps later on the debate stage, that President Trump is going to let Biden get away with saying that he's going to get rid of that industry, which is worth millions of dollars in the state and employs a significant part of the population.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it's interesting, too, how much it hurt Bernie Sanders in like an Oklahoma, where, obviously, that has been a huge moneymaker.</p><p>And the difference that Biden confidants tell me is that he's not nearly as anti-this as is Bernie Sanders, but that might not cut it in a general election.</p><p>WEGMANN: Yes, we're getting ready for a big reveal right now, if Joe Biden becomes the nominee, because, for so long, we have heard again and again that he is a centrist, that he is a moderate, but that's only in comparison to the rest of the field.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>WEGMANN: What is very interesting is that Joe Biden argued that he was a moderate and the guy to beat Trump, and he adopted some of these farther left positions.</p><p>But if he is on the ticket come November, he's going to have to defend some of these things that he's adopted. And so this idea that he's a moderate is something that Trump is going to attack very heavily. And I expect to see that tonight.</p><p>CAVUTO: The Elizabeth Warren sort of wooing on the part of Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, who do you think ultimately gets the rose here?</p><p>WEGMANN: Oh, boy, that's a tough question.</p><p>I talked to a Bernie Sanders national surrogate today, and they talked about the possibility of a super progressive ticket. They said that there's no way that Joe Biden or even Donald Trump could beat Bernie plus Elizabeth. I don't know if that's true.</p><p>But think about this. Remember, Elizabeth Warren, she went to war with Bernie Sanders. She said that he told her she couldn't win the presidency because she was a woman. That's a very significant attack that a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters are going to remember and that Elizabeth Warren supporters are going to remember.</p><p>But I think that something to focus on here is that Elizabeth Warren has been progressive, but she's also been very friendly with the DNC in a way that Bernie Sanders has not.</p><p>So it could go either way. But I would hedge towards Sanders, not Biden.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. We will watch very, very closely.</p><p>She certainly has more influence now than she did when she was a candidate. So we will -- we will see how that sorts out.</p><p>Phil Wegmann, always good. Thank you, my friend.</p><p>WEGMANN: Thank you, sir.</p><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile, the Supreme smackdown of one Chuck Schumer, not from Republicans. Meet the Democrat who said, Chuck, you went too far.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER: I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that's what started it, Chuck Schumer sparking a firestorm with those remarks.</p><p>Even Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts slamming him for it, and the drama continued on the Senate floor today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): The minority leader of the United States Senate threatened two associated justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, period.</p><p>There's no other way to interpret that.</p><p>SCHUMER: I should not have used the words I used yesterday. They didn't come out the way I intended to.</p><p>My point was that there would be political consequences, political consequences, for President Trump and Senate Republicans, if the Supreme Court, with the newly confirmed justices, stripped away a woman's right to choose.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Did Senator Schumer say enough to tamp this down?</p><p>Former Democratic Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr. with me now.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>HAROLD FORD JR. (D), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: He did.</p><p>Look, we have a tradition now in politics where people won't never apologize for anything. And Senator Schumer certainly was not going to apologize, when he sees the president not doing that.</p><p>He was wrong to use the words he did. And I was glad to see him come back to the floor and say, this was not a direct at either...</p><p>CAVUTO: But he explained it, more than apologizing for it.</p><p>FORD: Well, yes, but he has every right to disagree with policy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Sure, absolutely.</p><p>FORD: And that's a long tradition there also.</p><p>Look, I listened to Senator McConnell, who I hold in high regard because he's the majority leader. I need a little less sanctimony, a little more honor and humility in the business.</p><p>He has to remember that, when Merrick Garland wanted a hearing, he denied a hearing. He then went on to say last year that if -- if there were opening on a Supreme Court, and President Trump would forward the nominee, he would give that nominee hearing even in an election year, which was his reason for not doing it for Merrick Garland.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right, the opposite of what...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORD: Now, we have gotten to a point where I think the American people are fed up with this kind of pettiness at the highest level of politics.</p><p>We expect it from an everyday member of the political class in America, but not the highest levels, the chief justice having to reprimand the minority leader of the Senate.</p><p>Remember, the chief justice, in his report, his annual report just a few months ago said that our democracy is a fragile thing, and we have to work to hold onto it.</p><p>I thought he was sending a message to both Democrats and Republicans. But the other day, he had to send wonder directly to Senator Schumer. I was pleased to see him go to the floor today. And, hopefully, we can move on beyond this.</p><p>CAVUTO: But you usually hear this type of language or in-your-face language during an election year, a little less so in off-election years. But now it's gotten to be pretty -- pretty common.</p><p>But I'm thinking, in an environment, a backdrop where we have this coronavirus, and a lot of people are afraid and wondering what's next, probably now's not the time.</p><p>FORD: Like I said, the American people didn't sign up for this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>FORD: This is not what they bargained for when they think about leadership in the Senate.</p><p>Listen, I watched Senator from -- the Wyoming senator, Senator Barrasso, on a little while ago.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>FORD: I thought he went overboard with it.</p><p>I mean, at the end of the day, I don't think Chuck Schumer is a violent man. I don't think Chuck Schumer was suggesting...</p><p>CAVUTO: But we have just our words carefully.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORD: Right.</p><p>But if he had a history of being a violent person, I get it. He made a mistake. He's accepted responsibility.</p><p>CAVUTO: I always think of it, when you galvanize a crowd on the left or the right, and, by leaving it out there, and leaving them in a fighting mood, you lay the groundwork for that kind of stuff.</p><p>FORD: And it happens on both sides.</p><p>But I give him credit.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>FORD: At least he came to the floor and said look, a mistake was made here. Let me tell you what I meant.</p><p>And, hopefully, he doesn't do it again.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, we will see.</p><p>But let me get your take on the Elizabeth warren situation while I have you here.</p><p>Does it make a difference who she supports, if she ends up supporting anyone?</p><p>FORD: I thought she would have endorsed someone today.</p><p>I thought, as we talked a little bit off-camera, I think she probably missed a moment to be really, really effective.</p><p>CAVUTO: I thought that too.</p><p>FORD: Even if she didn't pick, I thought she should have used the moment to lay out what she was looking for and where the country needed to go.</p><p>And she...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But I think her reference to another woman who fails to be an inspiration to little girls, maybe it was you, as a candidate, Senator, not -- regardless of your gender.</p><p>FORD: Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: But that comes up a lot.</p><p>FORD: I think -- I mean, the -- and we play a lot of identity politics.</p><p>CAVUTO: I know.</p><p>FORD: And it's been on a lot of sides.</p><p>But it helped Biden, because she -- everyone expected her to endorse Sanders. I listened to Sanders yesterday and today, and he continues to be critical of Biden's votes some 20 years ago.</p><p>CAVUTO: But he's still going to pick up the slack, because it's a clear field for him in these next primaries, right?</p><p>FORD: Right.</p><p>So, the country will now -- Democrats will have a chance. It's a clear choice, what Democrats -- the path they want to travel up until the summer, and then kind of message they want to go up against Trump with in the fall.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>FORD: Do you want the Sanders path? Do you want the Biden path?</p><p>And we're going to get these -- see these two guys go at each other.</p><p>The one piece of advice I'd give both of them, focus on the future. No one cares about how they voted 20 years ago, Sanders voted to shield gun manufacturers.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>FORD: He would be -- we would have different gun laws, but I'm not going to blame him for violence in black and brown communities across the country.</p><p>CAVUTO: And those votes were during the Civil War, which...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm kidding. I'm kidding, kidding.</p><p>All right.</p><p>FORD: So, look forward, is all...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I hear you.</p><p>Harold Ford Jr., a very calm voice in this craziness.</p><p>In the meantime, what if your favorite college team wins March Madness, right, but there's no one in the stands to see it? Did it happen? Will it happen?</p><p>Let's just say they are bouncing it around -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo confirming there are a lot of new coronavirus cases.</p><p>So, essentially, they doubled in a day to 22, just as New Jersey is seeing its first confirmed case.</p><p>So, how are folks dealing with all of this?</p><p>Alex Hogan in New York City with the very latest.</p><p>Hey, Alex.</p><p>ALEX HOGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil. That's right.</p><p>Again, all of these cases that we're seeing today doubling; 1,000 people are under quarantine just here in New York. Many of the new cases that we're seeing are not from people who've traveled abroad, but from it spreading in local communities.</p><p>Governor Andrew Cuomo announcing 11 new cases in New York, bringing up the total to 22 in the state. Eight of those are new cases tied to a 50-year- old Westchester County attorney.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): What is going to happen is, the number will continue to go up. It must, because we are continuing to test more and more.</p><p>The more you test, the higher number you will have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOGAN: Among some of those new cases in the city, there's a woman in her 80s and a man in his 40s. Both are hospitalized, isolated and undergoing testing.</p><p>New Jersey is also reporting its second case today, Cuomo telling the public not to panic, but to stay informed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm a little bit worried.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a lot with the media. It's hype right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am a little worried about taking the subway. I think that's my biggest hesitation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have come over from Belfast. And the people were talking about canceling trips and stuff. But we didn't have any second thoughts about it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I clean my hands better and I have a young daughter, so I take care of her a lot more.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The stock market, I'm worried about. I don't like seeing that go down like it has.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think, in the long run, it's going to be -- it's going to be OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hand sanitizer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hand sanitizer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Got to have it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's getting real now.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOGAN: More companies now are taking containment into their own hands by canceling work trips, some big tech giants in Seattle like, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, ordering employees to go home, some even suggesting that they should work there all month long -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All month. All right, holy Toledo.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Alex, thank you very, very much. Great report.</p><p>Meanwhile, two NCAA basketball teams have canceled games over this coronavirus concern, as both Italy and Japan, among others, announce that they will play their professional sports in empty stadiums for now, maybe for a while.</p><p>Think about it. Conventions, meetings, conferences, you name it, companies are nixing all of it.</p><p>How do businesses deal with this, when billions of dollars are on the line?</p><p>Let's ask for McDonald's USA President and CEO Ed Rensi.</p><p>Ed, I'm thinking of your old haunts, and I'm thinking about all the companies now, as we get into annual shareholder meeting time, that are looking and reexamining even having them. What do you think of that?</p><p>ED RENSI, FORMER CEO, MCDONALD'S: Well, the reality of it is, the number one objective of every CEO of every company in the United States or across the world should be employee and customer safety first and foremost.</p><p>We need to educate ourselves on what's going on from the public health service. We need to make sure that our employees practice hygiene, washing their hands, using sanitizing, restrict as much as possible international travel, until we know more about what the landscape look like.</p><p>It's going to be expensive, come to grips with it. I think stakeholders and shareholders will come to understand that we need to have precaution.</p><p>Public health is more important at any moment than shareholder wealth, in my opinion.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, touche to that.</p><p>Ed, I'm just wondering whether it compounds on its own. In other words, people then start thinking, all right, I'm not going to go to movie theaters, because a lot of people congregate there. I'm not going to basketball venues, a lot of people congregate there. And they extend it to restaurants. I'm not going to go a restaurant. I might even think twice about a drive-through.</p><p>Where does this end?</p><p>RENSI: Well, the reality of it is, I'm the chairman of a company called FAT Brands based in California.</p><p>And we are emphasizing in-store sanitation -- it's a restaurant group -- in-store sanitation, personal hygiene. And we're emphasizing delivery. We want our folks to enjoy our products. And we're putting an emphasis on delivery.</p><p>But the reality of it is, people are going to overreact in the short-term because of a lack of knowledge.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>RENSI: Once they know more, I think they will calm down.</p><p>I think one of the most ridiculous things I have seen is Corona beer sales being down...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>RENSI: ... because it's got a similar name. I mean, it's absurd.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's beyond absurd. And it's getting to the point of just being needlessly panicking to folks.</p><p>What do you tell them, then? I mean, obviously, this isn't yet anything approaching even a fraction of the magnitude of the common flu, but it is what it is. People are taking precautionary steps. Do you think this could drive us into a slowdown, or even worse?</p><p>RENSI: I don't think, long term, it will, because we have got a very robust employment situation. People are pretty happy with what's going on.</p><p>All the people I talked to and the places I haunt daily, whether it's the local public, wherever it may be, I see the normal folks are out and about. They're just being cautious.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>RENSI: They're watching what they do. They're watching where they go.</p><p>But to overreact and panic -- now, if you're 80 years old and in bad health, you really need to be cautious. If you have very, very young children that are immunosuppressed, you better be very, very cautious.</p><p>But the normal human being doesn't have much to worry about.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, knock on whatever.</p><p>Ed Rensi, some calming words. Appreciate it, my friend. Be well.</p><p>RENSI: Thank you. You too.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Ed Rensi.</p><p>Well, we all know the coronavirus started in China, but it exposed just how much companies here depend on China.</p><p>Doctors are still looking for a cure for the virus there. A lot of those companies, in the meantime, are desperately looking to make more of their stuff here.</p><p>CAVUTO: We still don't know much about this virus in China.</p><p>What a lot of U.S. companies do know is, it's way too much of their business that's depending on China, not just as a place to sell their stuff, but as a place to make their stuff.</p><p>Now tech giants like Apple and Microsoft are trying to spread the wealth. But if my next guest is right, it won't be easy, and it won't be cheap, and it might not come soon.</p><p>To the man who literally wrote the book about \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" Gordon Chang.</p><p>So, Gordon, a lot of them want to sort of hedge their bets, spread their wealth. Easier said than done, right?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Well, it is.</p><p>But, for some companies, it's pretty easy. So, if you have, let's say, low- tech manufacturing, you can move out six months, nine months. That occurred during the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, when companies left and then came back.</p><p>But if you're Apple, and you are fixed in China with Foxconn, the contract manufacturer, it's going to take some time.</p><p>But, Neil, they're going to have to do it, because manufacturing in China is becoming unsustainable.</p><p>CAVUTO: What about China right now? And do you feel comfortable in the information they are sharing with the world on the coronavirus?</p><p>CHANG: No, Neil, because the Communist Party is imposing extraordinary controls on information.</p><p>Xi Jinping is doing this because he wants workers to return to their job sites. So their infection numbers and their death numbers, I think, are being managed to do that. And the other thing, Neil, is that what you're seeing is, as people go back to work, because they're forced by the government to do that, they are prolonging the epidemic, because new workers are infecting each other at this very moment.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, they come back, they increase the number of cases. That just exponentially gets bigger, which means, I think, from what you're saying, that this thing doesn't go away anytime soon.</p><p>CHANG: It'll go away a lot longer than it should.</p><p>And, also, we don't know much about this virus. It's acting in ways that -- very different from other coronaviruses. It likes hot weather, for instance.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>CHANG: It's mutating. All sorts of things are going wrong here.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so we say, usually, warmer weather negates the effect. This seems to be one -- or at least a strand of it that seems to thrive in that.</p><p>We just don't know. What we do know is, it's drawing economic activity, certainly, in China, to a halt. They might be in a recessionary quarter. And that will eventually spill over here.</p><p>Play it out. What do you think happens?</p><p>CHANG: Well, clearly, China right now is in contraction.</p><p>It is also exposing a lot of financially weak companies to the possibility of default. Beijing is now imposing, I think, essentially emergency measures to keep the economy going. They can do that for a little while, Neil. But if this virus continues longer than people expect, then it's going to really stress the financial system there.</p><p>And it's going to spread panic throughout the global financial system. We have seen that now for the last three or four days, with our Dow up and down and up and down.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>CHANG: This is really crazy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Indeed, it is.</p><p>Gordon, thank you very, very much. We're watching it all very, very closely.</p><p>For those of who just tuned in, a peek at the Dow today, down about 969 points, so essentially giving back kind of what we gained yesterday.</p><p>But I always like to leave you with some good news. If you are looking to refinance a mortgage or get a new one, we are at all-time lows in interest rates. That could translate to a good backstop to have. That, along with declining gas prices, mean more money in your pocket, more cash, if you're not afraid of touching it.</p><p>Here's \"THE FIVE.\"</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Who's taking them?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we are all over this country with AFL-CIO's Richard Trumka in Washington how big labor could be voting, legendary football coach Lou Holtz in Indiana on why Donald Trump has him rallying.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis on what today says about 2020 and where that is heading.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And our own market pros on whether this election will have investors buying or selling.</p><p>We begin with Mike Tobin in Greenwood, Indiana, a state that is already seeing very heavy turnout -- Mike.</p><p>MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Very heavy turnout.</p><p>They joined to jump in here in Johnson County, massive turnout. They did have a computer problem earlier in the day. But Ron Goins, the inspector, the elections inspector here at Johnson County, says it does slow down the process of intaking people and getting them a ballot. It didn't impact the integrity of the vote.</p><p>We have heard some people complain about the long lines and that's just because of the massive turnout. Goins tells us it has been this way all through early voting. He anticipates that the numbers this time will just absolutely eclipse the turnout numbers from the 2016 general election.</p><p>The candidates have largely been laying low today. Mike Braun was on social media, encouraging Republicans to text their friends and get out the vote. Senator Joe Donnelly, the incumbent, has also been on social media. He posted a phone number for people to call if they need a ride to get out to the polls.</p><p>But the people here in Johnson County say that politics, this Senate race have been the primary topics of conversation in just about every social setting, but they say it's not about Braun or Donnelly, this is a referendum on Donald Trump -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Mike, thank you very, very much.</p><p>To Florida right now. A couple of hotly contested races going on there, one in the Senate, of course, incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson, Republican Governor Rick Scott in the battle of their lives.</p><p>Peter Doocy in Naples, Florida, with the very latest.</p><p>Hey, Peter.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, I just walked -- I just watched as a young man walked by. He was on the phone telling somebody on the other end that he showed up here and was told he was ineligible to vote, which was very frustrating to him because he was telling this person on the phone he did six tours of combat and wasn't able to vote here in Naples today.</p><p>There's just a ton of interest and attention this race. The Senate contest pits three-term Democratic incumbent Senator Bill Nelson against a two-term Republican Governor Rick Scott. Nelson's campaign about protecting the environment and protecting Obamacare. Scott's campaign more about the economy and having a direct line to Donald Trump.</p><p>They have both won statewide before, but they both might have their fates sealed by candidates who have not, and that is the gubernatorial candidates. Ron DeSantis, the Republican, came from behind and won the primary with President Trump's endorsement. Andrew Gillum, the Democrat, won the primary with Bernie Sanders' endorsement.</p><p>The question is, will either have them be a boost or a drag to the Senate candidate from their party, Neil?</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Peter, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Well, this could be a tale of two evenings here. In the Senate, things could be wrapped up relatively early, or at least we will have an idea relatively early. The House, well, that's a whole 'nother matter.</p><p>To FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on why that could be the case.</p><p>Hey, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil.</p><p>This is going to be our evening ahead. We're just going to do the follow- the-sun programming, but less than three hours away until the first polls close. So we want to take you through some of the key races.</p><p>Most of the ones we will show you will be Senate races. But the first post closing 6:00 p.m. in Kentucky, parts of Indiana. Of course, as we know from Indiana, the only state with two time zones. Health care a huge issue in that state. Democrat Joe Donnelly, the incumbent, trying to hold off GOP challenger businessman Mike Braun, a close race and some say could really start to shift some of the weight in the Senate.</p><p>So, 7:00 p.m., we're going to be more focused on Indiana, as we mentioned, of course, Georgia as well, that gubernatorial race a little bit more interesting than any others. We know Secretary of State Brian Kemp really facing off against the progressive former State Rep. Stacey Abrams.</p><p>And 8:00 p.m. Eastern time, you're going to see all where the polls start closing there. Basically, this is the largest batch of states that are going to begin to be closing, including eight states with super competitive Senate races.</p><p>So you can see, obviously, all of the ones lit up here. We're going to be most focused on a Florida and also Missouri. So you have in Florida, of course, incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson trying to hold off the term-limit GOP Governor Rick Scott.</p><p>And then in Missouri, you have the state A.G., Josh Hawley, vs. the Democrat incumbent, Claire McCaskill.</p><p>Now, 9:00 p.m., as we sort of go along again, all of these are in Eastern time, really going to be most focused on Texas, Arizona and North Dakota as well. So in Arizona, Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema against Congresswoman Martha McSally. This is airtight, from everybody that we have been speaking to.</p><p>North Dakota, you have, of course, the incumbent, Heidi Heitkamp, trying to fend off Congressman Kevin Cramer. And then in Texas, the most expensive Senate race ever, $100 million, not even counting super PACs, incumbent, of course, you have Senator Ted Cruz, Beto O'Rourke.</p><p>I want to mention as well, for Mr. O'Rourke, a lot of his money is coming from Silicon Valley employees, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple. By 11:00 p.m., not surprisingly, Neil, we will find ourselves on the West Coast.</p><p>And out there, I just want to highlight actually two House races. So we will pull those contests up. You're going to see here for the Golden State two of these areas which are really not only tight. CA-10, we will pull that first one up.</p><p>But one of the other reasons that we're following the Harder vs. Denham contest is because this area actually had voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Same can be said for Rouda vs. Rohrabacher.</p><p>And we know from this area even geographically not a huge surprise there, Neil, that immigration is going to be a huge issue in both of those areas.</p><p>Neil, we will be here. Long night. That's -- those results back in a few hours for us -- back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: You had to rub that in, didn't you?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Deirdre, thank you very, very much, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p>All right, I want to take a look at the corner of Wall and Broad today. We were up a lot on the Dow today. Now, there is a sort of a consensus building -- always dangerous, I hasten to add -- that we're going to see slip government after this midterm election, that is the House under one party's control, Democrats, and then the Senate under the continued Republican control. Of course, the White House would remain under Republican control.</p><p>And markets like that. Now, the consensus could be very, very wrong and it doesn't pan out that way. There are other variables here.</p><p>Let's get the read on how all of that would sort out for the investment community with my buddy David Asman, the host of \"Bulls &amp; Bears\" on FOX Business Network, and market watcher Alan Knuckman.</p><p>By the way, David, looking at this and these crosscurrents here, the first thing you have to ask is, that consensus for split government, markets like that, don't they?</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Markets generally prefer split government.</p><p>Gridlock is a dirty word in the world of politics. But markets find it to be enlightening because it means that they can't get stuff done. They can't spend more government money. That tends to leave a lot of Wall Street and private sector off the hook.</p><p>I should just say, but no matter what happens tomorrow, there have been 18 midterm elections since 1946, 18, and in every single one, 18 out of 18, the 12 months following that midterm election, the markets are generally up.</p><p>So I think we might have some pretty good times coming in the next 12 months. Lord knows what's going to happen beyond that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, I can't even go to the next 12 minutes.</p><p>But, Alan, I'm curious. When you look at this, you always have to brace yourself for surprises and whether there's an unexpected development.</p><p>ALAN KNUCKMAN, BULLS EYE OPTION: Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: Let's say the Republicans were to hang on to the House, and then they continue to run the table with all the levers of government under their control. What do you think?</p><p>KNUCKMAN: Well, I'm of the opinion that optimism wins. And you have got to be very optimistic.</p><p>Obviously, David just went through that fantastic number that every single time a year after the midterm, the market was higher. So you have got to put this in perspective. We're on a very strong upward path. We bounced 25 percent since the Trump election, but you can total up. It's 311 percent since that 2009 low.</p><p>I don't think this changes anything. Again, corporations are going to do well in any political environment.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, David, one of the things that comes up a lot is the idea that there's a possibility that the Democrats have a surge, and in that surge, they might just take the Senate. It's one of the less likely variables here, but then what?</p><p>ASMAN: Well, if they do, or if it's just the House -- but certainly if it's both -- President Trump is going to have to be a consummate deal maker.</p><p>And there are certain deals that he wants to make with Democrats, infrastructure. Remember, there's $1.5 million in infrastructure spending that the president and Democrats want to do together. There's also the question of regulation.</p><p>And the president fancies himself as a deregulator. He's done a terrific job in deregulating the private sector. However, he wants to put more regulations on things like pharmaceuticals, like drug prices. He wants to have price controls. Democrats wants price controls.</p><p>That could worry Wall Street quite a bit. And there's also concern about the banks and big tech. Remember, he's talked about breaking up some of the biggest high-tech companies.</p><p>CAVUTO: Alan, I know you're looking at the half-full glass here.</p><p>Regardless of how the midterms turn out, I'm wondering whether all the other items that are backing up like planes at La Guardia are an issue. That is the upcoming G20 meeting between our president and the leader of China. We might have a Mueller report before this month is out.</p><p>The Federal Reserve busy with another meeting, and while that isn't the one that it's expected to raise rates, it could telegraph that. What do you think?</p><p>KNUCKMAN: It's going to be December.</p><p>Well, there's always got to be concerns and worries. Otherwise, this wouldn't be any fun.</p><p>So, we have gotten through every one of those. But I'm a big believer that global growth -- growth is driving it. It's not just us. If you look at unemployment wrong world, Canada is at 40-year lows, Japan's at 2.3 percent, Germany's at the lowest unemployment level ever.</p><p>So around the world, everybody's doing well. And I think that's very much a positive. We have been able to get through all these -- these woes and worries in the past. I look for that to happen once again.</p><p>Let me point out. Let's go back in the way-back machine, when we had a split government. If you go back to Reagan, we had a split government and everybody can probably agree that we did pretty well economically at that time.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, we forgot, in '82, when the Republicans lost a lot of seats - - I think 27 -- of course, the market a year later was up another 19 percent, right?</p><p>ASMAN: Can I bring it back home, though, just for a second?</p><p>Because beyond the congressional races and Senate races, there a lot of initiatives on the ballot and a lot of them have to do with taxes. They're 18 states that have initiatives involved in taxes. Colorado, which has a flat tax for income tax, they want to change it into a five-bracket tax, almost double -- double the high end of that.</p><p>State of Washington has a carbon tax. There is a whole bunch of taxes. And those should be looked at, because they could affect business, certainly on a local level, to a great extent, and on a personal level. You could be paying thousands of dollars more or less, depending on how you vote.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, and where you live.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you, David, final word on that.</p><p>Alan Knuckman, I want to thank you.</p><p>KNUCKMAN: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, and when we come back here, besides looking at some of the money issues at stake here, I want you to picture this, the AFL-CIO chief, Richard Trumka, and the legendary football coach and Notre Dame sensation Lou Holtz. What do they have in common?</p><p>We will explain after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you're looking to live right now at a polling place saying in Greenwood, Indiana, the president campaigning in the Hoosier State just yesterday.</p><p>He was joined by college football Hall of Fame sensation the coach Lou Holtz.</p><p>Lou Holtz joins us right now on the phone.</p><p>Coach, very good have you.</p><p>LOU HOLTZ, HALL OF FAME FOOTBALL COACH: Well, thank you, Neil. Pleasure to be with you. I watch your show all the time.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm very honored by that, coach.</p><p>I mean, obviously, you have been a close friend of the president's long, long before he was president. And then you carry considerable clout in your state and elsewhere. That was a very early and welcome endorsement.</p><p>And I'm wondering whether you -- the crowd you saw and the enthusiasm you saw is going to translate in that state to a Democratic senator maybe losing?</p><p>HOLTZ: Well, that's very possible, because Joe Donnelly's a very popular individually.</p><p>He is also a Notre Dame alum, which put me in an awkward position. However, the main point I made to the people and enthusiasm of the crowd, there were 12,000 people there. They were jammed in, enthusiasm. And there were an awful lot of young people there and thousands outside.</p><p>But the point I made is, President Trump needs some help. Everybody is ganging up on him. You got the media, you got the Democrats, you got the academicians. We have to send people there.</p><p>Joe Donnelly is a wonderful individual, I'm sure. But we need people there that are going to support the Supreme Court justices, going to support his thing. And Notre Dame is undefeated this year.</p><p>And, as I said to the crowd, you want to go back to a couple years ago, we won four games and lost eight? No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOLTZ: Then why would we want to move -- why would we want to go back?</p><p>Every time I turned around a winning situation -- or a losing situation, nobody ever said, coach, we like it better when we are losing.</p><p>But this is the mentality of the media. So, I believe in what he's doing. And I supported him, endorsed him before he got the nomination.</p><p>And I spoke at a Tampa bay rally the day and the Saturday before the election in 2016. The enthusiasm was great. Nobody gave him a chance, but I thought, good lord, everywhere I go, it is this way. And maybe it is going to translate into the midterms, but history goes against it. We will have to wait and see.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, it's early on. I like how you can relate football and Notre Dame and to the state of the economy. That is pretty clever.</p><p>But, Coach, I'm curious about what you make of Senator Donnelly, who is very popular in the state. The president has made multiple visits to Indiana. He was still doing quite well, that is Senator Donnelly.</p><p>Would you be disappointed or worried for Indiana, then, given your bias and preference that he go, if he were to stay in there? Because he has very shrewdly incorporated a lot of views of the president and speaks obviously very highly of you, so he walks a tight line and a rope in a state that requires him to.</p><p>HOLTZ: This isn't a case of having good vs. bad.</p><p>I think they are both very good candidates. I just know that Braun will support the president. I can't say that about any Democrat. The Democrats will say one thing, but when they get in, there were 40-something people that were up for the House on the Democratic side who said, we will not vote for Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>But I happen to know that you take a vow, that when you go in there and you are elected, you are going to vote for Nancy Pelosi. And he will back Schumer. Joe Manchin voted for Kavanaugh, but he only did it after the nomination was secured with Collins' vote.</p><p>And that is like jumping on. But I just think that President Trump needs help there. We have a lot of Republicans that are never-Trumpers, but look to what has happened to the economy. Look what has happened to this country. Look what has happened. He's caring about the people.</p><p>We're worried about the caravan people coming in. What is going to end up -- how about the homeless people on the street? Go into San Francisco. Go into Denver. Go look at the poverty we have there. Let's take care of our people first.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, coach, it's always good having you. You are doing well coming out of your shell, by the way, so keep working on that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOLTZ: Well, Neil, you can mark me down as undecided.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, coach, thank you. A real honor talking to you. I appreciate it.</p><p>HOLTZ: Always a pleasure, Neil. Bye.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>In the meantime, we have another tight race in Missouri, right? This is a pickup that Republicans are salivating over, but you got get behind those numbers, which we plan to do after this.</p><p>Then the AFL-CIO president, Richard Trumka, on why this president might be helping unions a little bit more than some of his Republican predecessors, but apparently not enough for Richard -- after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI: This race is just way too close to call. So we don't know what's going to happen, but we feel great about the effort.</p><p>JOSH HAWLEY (R), MISSOURI SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: We're excited. Just voted, and on to victory tonight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Missouri, that's a key Senate battle Republicans are hoping for a pickup, defeating, they hope, incumbent Senator Claire McCaskill.</p><p>Republican challenger Josh Hawley, both of them voting today. Both very confident things will work out their way.</p><p>This is a state that Donald Trump, by the way, won by about 18 points.</p><p>Kristin Fisher is there with the latest on how it's all going down in Saint Louis.</p><p>Hey, Kristin.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>Well, we have seen a steady stream of voters at this polling place just outside Saint Louis all day today. And when the Democratic incumbent, Senator Claire McCaskill, voted here just a few hours ago, she said that she thought this race was still too close to call.</p><p>She's been trying to make the case that she's not too liberal to represent a state that President Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016. But her opponent, the state's Republican attorney general, Josh Hawley, says she's still too liberal for Missouri.</p><p>And President Trump helped him make that case at a rally last night in Cape Girardeau. Now, blue-collar Missourians, they overwhelmingly voted for President Trump in 2016 by nearly 20 points. But they also drove the defeat of the state's right-to-work Proposition A just this past August.</p><p>So one of the big questions, Neil, is, how are these union members in the state going to vote today? That could be a big driver in who wins this race now, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you very much, Kristin.</p><p>And I'm going to raise that point with the AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, who joins us right now.</p><p>Richard, I'm looking at some of these union numbers that have picked up, including unemployment levels among union families that are about the lowest they have been in 20 years. And I'm wondering why you would be against the president of the United States, if he's helping you provide those numbers.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AFL-CIO: Well, Neil, this president of the United States isn't on the election ballot today.</p><p>There's a number of people that support workers and those that don't. We're supporting people like Claire McCaskill, who stands up for us, Josh Hawley, who supports right-to-work.</p><p>So we're supporting those candidates that support working people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: And, by the way, we have about 1,500...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But I just want to be clear.</p><p>The working families and all of that, if that's happening under Republican leadership, you're -- you're not buying that this is sustainable beyond the president? Is that what you're saying?</p><p>TRUMKA: I don't think that the president's on the ballot today.</p><p>Claire McCaskill is on the ballot, and Josh Hawley's on the ballot in Missouri. And they're going to say, who's the best for us? It's clearly Claire McCaskill.</p><p>Josh Hawley is out of step. He supports right-to-work that that state rejected by better than two to one. And so it's an election about them. And she will win tonight.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so if we fast-forward to 2020, the president's up for reelection, and you do and have in prior interviews credited the president with helping unions doing more, certainly than other Republicans have, would you endorse him?</p><p>TRUMKA: Look, I'm not going to get there until 2020.</p><p>We have an election tonight to take care of, Neil. Look, we will see what he did. We will judge what he did to help workers and what he did to hurt workers. And if he did more to help workers and he didn't -- then, of course, like every one other candidate, he will be considered, but I'm not making that decision.</p><p>My executive council, all my members in each one of the states help us make that decision. So it's not Richard's decision. It's the membership's decision.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, but you're also the big cheese. I mean, this doesn't happen without you weighing in, right?</p><p>TRUMKA: No, they make that decision. They actually do.</p><p>I didn't endorse any of the candidates running today.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>So let me step back from this and understand. Do you think things are looking very good for the economy right now?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, it depends on where you sit.</p><p>If you're a worker, things are still not good for the economy. We have had three decades of flat wages. You have had your health care go up. You have had your pensions attacked. And you're about to, in many cases, even lose health care and lose your pensions.</p><p>So it's not a very secure place for us to be. If you're at the very top of the heap, yes, this is a good economy for you, you're doing great. Hopefully, we can see wages increase. But, Neil, there's only one way that's going to happen. And that's to give workers a voice on the job, so that they can negotiate with their employers and get a bigger share of the wealth that they help produce.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. But it just seems odd that you're going for Claire McCaskill in this case and other prominent Democrats who were there and through that period of time, long before this president came to power.</p><p>Republicans had the run of the table in Washington. And they might be listening this and saying, I can't figure Trumka out here. He's taking it out on at least trends that in the last couple of years have looked good for his members, looked good for union workers, record low unemployment among young workers, Latino workers, African-American workers, union workers, average manufacturing workers.</p><p>TRUMKA: It's real simple.</p><p>I speak for my members. And I have a fidelity to one group only, and that's to the American worker. When their wages are flat, their health care is under attack, and they're paying more and more and more for health care every year, when their pensions are under attack, I'm going to stand with them and fight whoever it is, no matter what party, that's attacking them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But their wages have been running at a clip.</p><p>In the latest employment report, their wages are running at a 3.1 percent clip, the strongest it's been now in decades, and certainly over a decade. And I'm wondering how that jibes with workers who might be disadvantaged.</p><p>TRUMKA: I'm sorry. I didn't understand your question.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, if things are so bad and wage growth is running at a 10- year-high clip, what's so bad for workers who have not been seeing that?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: By the way, that's for one month. That doesn't erase the two decades of flat wages.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, wait a minute.</p><p>Did you complain about that when it was Barack Obama as president?</p><p>TRUMKA: I did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: You remember when he tried to do TPP?</p><p>CAVUTO: But you supported Barack Obama. You supported Barack Obama.</p><p>TRUMKA: I was against him. Whenever he didn't do things that I agreed with, I'm against him.</p><p>I treat Barack Obama exactly like I treat Donald Trump. If they do something good for workers, I support them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Who was the last Republican you supported, Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA: We're supporting Republicans right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: Who?</p><p>TRUMKA: We're supporting Brian Fitzgerald in Pennsylvania.</p><p>We're supporting Republicans in New Jersey. We're supporting Republicans in Ohio. Here's the problem, Neil. There are precious few Republicans that support workers.</p><p>When they support workers, we support them. When they don't support workers, we are not foolish. We don't support them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I understand.</p><p>But if unemployment goes down among your workers, if their prospects dramatically improved over the last couple of years, whether you want to pin that to Donald Trump or not -- and I know you draw a distinction between the president and many and his party.</p><p>But, I mean, that's progress you were not seeing under the last president or the president before him or the president before him, right?</p><p>TRUMKA: Look, Neil -- look, Neil, this is a nice conversation. It has nothing to do with today's election.</p><p>But if Donald Trump is the candidate who has helped workers the most when it's time to endorse, our members will tell us that. If he is not, they will tell us that as well.</p><p>He isn't on the ballot today. People like Claire McCaskill are on the ballot. People like Bill Nelson are on the ballot.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I understand that.</p><p>But who is the last Republican presidential candidate you have supported?</p><p>TRUMKA: I don't know.</p><p>You ask us about Republicans. We support Republicans in every race. If they support workers, we support them.</p><p>The last Republican -- Mitt Romney didn't support workers. He had a bad record with workers. And I can go back through the list all the way back.</p><p>Probably the last one that actually supported workers would have been Eisenhower. Eisenhower actually did support workers.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: And I wish we had more time. And you have been a great guest, as always.</p><p>But I know, when we last had it, you said my -- I don't see a political persuasion here. I look at how they help unions, how they help union workers, how they help average folks.</p><p>If things are now in this economy going the way they're going, with one of the strongest recoveries we have seen, you find precious few Republicans to support in this environment, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: For whom? Wait, wait, wait, Neil. Wait, wait, wait.</p><p>Strongest recovery for whom? Workers haven't seen that recovery yet. Workers are seeing their health care go up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Richard, do you look at the same data I look at?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: I do. I do, Neil.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, if you would give me a chance to explain, I will explain.</p><p>CAVUTO: But I'm not an apologist for any side, Richard.</p><p>But do you look at the same data I do?</p><p>TRUMKA: I do.</p><p>CAVUTO: Record low unemployment across every major demographic group?</p><p>TRUMKA: I do.</p><p>CAVUTO: And you still say not good enough?</p><p>TRUMKA: I do.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: You had one month of wage increase, one, one quarter. Three decades, that doesn't wipe out.</p><p>CAVUTO: You have had two years of improving numbers, Richard.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: In addition to that, health care -- our health care out-of-pocket costs went up 5.9 percent last year. They're scheduled to go up for an individual $1,500 next year, Neil.</p><p>That's a lot of money for individuals. So you can't pull out one statistic and say, this is great, or one group of people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm not pulling out one statistic or another.</p><p>I'm just trying to be very, very clear. What would it take for you to sort of say, all right, things are better than they have been? I mean, yes, wages could go at a stronger clip in real inflation-adjusted terms. They most certainly good. You're absolutely right about that.</p><p>But the arc, the trend is your friend right now for union members, for those who -- who -- many of whom attend these rallies where Donald Trump speaks. So, what do they see that apparently you do not?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, look, they will tell me if that's the case.</p><p>If they want to endorse him, they will. But we went to our members in Ohio, we have had a conversation with them; 50 percent of those that voted for Donald Trump have told us they're voting for Richard Cordray and for Sherrod Brown. That's 50 percent of the people that voted for Donald Trump.</p><p>So, apparently, his argument hasn't persuaded them. They know that Richard Cordray is better than DeWine. And they know that Sherrod Brown is their friend that will stick up for them. So they're voting for them.</p><p>That's what we see in this election.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I understand.</p><p>But when they -- when they look at what's happening around them...</p><p>TRUMKA: Do you really?</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I'm taking your word for it.</p><p>So, when they look around at what's happening, and they see some of these improvements, are you telling me that they're simply not good enough, or that the progress on trade deals that they had argued, you had argued to me -- now, don't -- just be careful -- and you had told me were not really good for union members, what do they see now? Do they like them or dislike them?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: Neil, I know -- I know you want to make this an issue about me and you and us and them.</p><p>But, look, that's a nonissue right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't know what you're saying.</p><p>It's not about you or me or us and them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: Here's what I'm saying. Here's what I'm saying.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm just curious, do you like the trade deals of this president?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You did not like a lot of those trade deals. Now, I don't know if these newer deals he's designed are in your favor or not. Do you like them, or you liked the old deals better, the old trade deals better?</p><p>TRUMKA: NAFTA, it is quite -- it's too early for us to decide whether yes or no.</p><p>There's some improvements.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK.</p><p>TRUMKA: There's some places where he's digressed.</p><p>When we know all the facts, we will make a decision. And all the pundits who are going crazy right now, being either gushing for it or gushing against it, are simply wrong, because they don't have the facts yet.</p><p>We will judge it on its merit. There are improvements in it and there are areas where it's going backwards. If we can enforce this agreement, if the enforcement mechanism is there, if we can get the Mexican government to allow wages to rise, so that there's less downward pressure on the wages in the United States, then, yes, we will endorse that.</p><p>If it doesn't do that, then we won't. But it's too early for us to be able to tell.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: Am I encouraged? Wait. Am I encouraged that we're talking about it?</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>TRUMKA: Yes, I am encouraged.</p><p>I'm also encouraged and proud of union members and workers across the country, because the debate right now isn't whether we're going to have a new NAFTA. The debate right now is how we fix a broken one.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, the idea and the guarantees that are supposedly in there -- and you know this far better than I -- to hire more union workers, to hire them at wages that were not in the prior deal, do you find that promising, or do you find it accurate, or what?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, first of all, we don't know.</p><p>We don't know how it will be enforced or what will be enforced.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>TRUMKA: We don't know how the labor chapter will be enforced, how the rules of origin will be enforced, or several other things.</p><p>So we need to find out that language. If it's good, then, yes, it'll be encouraging. If it isn't, and we can't enforce the agreement, it doesn't matter what the agreement says. It's unenforceable.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, so, finally, real quick final question.</p><p>The number -- you said you support a of number Republican candidates, but do you have a breakdown of the percentage of Democrats you are supporting vs. Republicans? I would just be curious.</p><p>TRUMKA: No, I don't. I don't, because we are up and down the ballot this time far more than we have ever been. There's a lot of local races, state house members, state senates.</p><p>And so I don't have that. I will be able to get you that tomorrow.</p><p>There's about 1,500 union members that are running for office on the ballot this time. And we're working hard to get them elected, so that they can stand up.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>TRUMKA: Some are Republicans. Most are Democrats. But some are Republicans.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Richard, very good chatting with you. I appreciate it.</p><p>TRUMKA: Thanks for having me, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Richard Trumka of the AFL-CIO.</p><p>Meanwhile, to New Jersey and voters there going to the polls, closing out what's been a very contentious and expensive Senate race between incumbent Bob Menendez, the Republican challenger, Bob Hugin.</p><p>Let's go first to David Lee Miller in Mountainside, New Jersey, with the latest on finally the end of what has been a very nasty race, huh?</p><p>DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Indeed, it has been, Neil.</p><p>This has been a very hard-ought battle and, as you said, a very nasty one at times. Democratic senator Bob Menendez is vying now for a third term as New Jersey senator. Although he has been considered the front-runner all along, some analysts say that in a blue state like New Jersey, it should have been a lock for Menendez, that he should be certain to win.</p><p>However, victory is not certain here. Menendez is considered vulnerable following a corruption trial last year that although resulted in a hung jury did tarnish his reputation. Republican challenger Bob Hugin, meanwhile, who has been endorsed by President Trump and who has donated to the president's 2016 campaign and also was the chairman of his finance committee here in New Jersey, is trying to distance himself from President Trump, saying that he is a different kind of candidate, that he is independent.</p><p>Meanwhile, as voters do go to the polls, there have been many reports, multiple reports today, Neil, of problems at polling stations, ranging from long lines and machines that have been malfunctioning.</p><p>We expect the polls here will close in just a little under three-and-a- half-hours. That is 8:00 local time -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: David Lee, thank you very, very much.</p><p>It's not that New Jersey has not elected its share of Republican officials. Of course, Chris Christie is a former governor, two-term governor. There's a Democratic governor now.</p><p>And, of course, before him, of course, it was Christie Todd Whitman, who joins us right now.</p><p>Governor, good to have you.</p><p>CHRISTIE TODD WHITMAN (R), FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: Good to be with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: It is tough for Republicans to get elected in New Jersey.</p><p>WHITMAN: It is. It's a challenge.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>WHITMAN: We're a little bit outnumbered in the number of registered voters.</p><p>The only thing I will say, though, the part that's growing is the independents. Democrats are losing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>Now, the Hugin-Menendez battle has been pretty sharp and very expensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WHITMAN: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you think of it and the kind of coverage it's been getting?</p><p>WHITMAN: It's been getting a lot of coverage. And it's exciting to see that Bob Hugin is doing as well as he's doing.</p><p>And I think it's within the realm of possibility that he could knock off Menendez, because Menendez has such a bad reputation, and being censured the way was by both Republicans and Democrats, more importantly.</p><p>That's come to people's attention, even with the disparity in registration and more Democrats. There are still people that don't like the fact that they have someone in office who has been censured that way and found to be lacking ethically.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's happened on the governor's side, not so much on the Senate side, in New Jersey to get a Republican in power there. Why is that, you think?</p><p>WHITMAN: I don't know. It's hard to say.</p><p>It's ideological. It's because the senators go where -- they think the big thoughts. The governors have to deliver. And so they're looking for slightly different things in those two offices.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>WHITMAN: They want someone in a governorship who they think can really deliver on their promises, not just come up with new ideas as to how to approach things.</p><p>So, it's more ideological, I think, when you look at the senatorial races than it is at the gubernatorial level.</p><p>CAVUTO: Bob Hugin, of course, is a very rich pharmaceutical executive. He's forked over more than $35 million of his own money presumably into this race.</p><p>Does he have the future if for some reason it doesn't turn out, he doesn't win tonight?</p><p>I think, if he wants to have one, he can, absolutely, because he's been a very credible candidate. He's well-spoken. He's a bright guy. He had a good reputation as a CEO.</p><p>Menendez has tried to attack that. But Bob has had some very good and, I think, forceful responses to those attacks. So, it's been an ugly race, unfortunately. And we're seeing that across the country. And that's just not in our best interests, I don't think, in the long run.</p><p>But I do think, if he wants to have a future, he certainly could. I don't know, when you have spent this much of your own money, and done this, put as much heart into it as you have...</p><p>CAVUTO: That's a lot of money, yes.</p><p>WHITMAN: ... whether you're going to want to come back and try to do something else again.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Governor, thank you very, very much, Governor Christie Todd Whitman.</p><p>We will be following that very, very closely.</p><p>In the meantime, Georgia voting is already under way. They're looking at governor. Health care is a very, very big issue there. And that health care keeps playing out again and again, in race after race.</p><p>The read from the former Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis on why that is -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, it's not just Congress up for grabs; 36 gubernatorial seats are on the line, including a very tight race going on in the Peach State of Georgia between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp.</p><p>Health care a very, very big issue there, as it is across the country.</p><p>Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta with more.</p><p>Hey, Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>When it comes to health care, the candidates running for governor in Georgia could not be any more different. You have Republican Brian Kemp, who cast his ballot earlier today, saying that he will fight what he calls a socialist takeover of health care. This plays well with his conservative base in rural parts of the state.</p><p>Democrat Stacey Abrams, on the other hand, says she wants to protect Obamacare. This appeals to her base in large cities. But she's also making the case to rural Georgians that expanding Medicare would reverse the trend of hospital closures in less populated areas.</p><p>Voter turnout is setting new records. Before Election Day, more than two million Georgians had already cast ballots, more than doubling the previous record for early voting in a midterm election in this state.</p><p>And then, Neil, coming back to our live shot, you can see voter turnout today, on the Election Day, is very heavy. The secretary of state's office telling us voter turnout is heavy in all parts of the state -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you, Jonathan, very, very much.</p><p>The read on that enthusiasm now from former Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, also the former Massachusetts governor.</p><p>Governor, very good to have you.</p><p>MICHAEL DUKAKIS (D), FORMER MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR: Neil, great to be back with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Same here.</p><p>What do you make of these high turnout numbers across a broad swathe of groups here?</p><p>DUKAKIS: Well, I think Donald Trump has got people pretty excited.</p><p>In many cases, they're very angry with him. In some cases, they like him. But I have seen it in my teaching. As you know, I have been teaching at Northeastern University here in Boston for the past 28 years.</p><p>And I have never seen, Neil, the kind of interest in public service that I'm seeing on the part of my students these days. Most of them, at least up here, don't like Trump.</p><p>But the important thing is that this is finally got them out seriously thinking about serving in public life. And I think that's great, and I hope it continues and we can encourage it.</p><p>But I do think this turnout tells you something.</p><p>CAVUTO: Governor, normally, when the last ballots are counted in the midterms, within hours, they're working on the next campaign.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: And we're expecting quite a few prominent Democrats to throw their hat in the ring for president.</p><p>And there has been a concern among some in your party that Democrats are driving a hard left, and it's going to hurt them. What do you think of that?</p><p>DUKAKIS: That's always been a concern.</p><p>And I don't see anything unusual about it. We're going to have an active primary. We're going to have a lot of candidates. But in the last analysis, whoever wins that nomination is going to be somebody who, in my opinion -- don't know who it's going to be, I don't have any particular preference -- is somebody who will work his or her way through the primary and come out as a strong and effective nominee.</p><p>And it'll be somebody who can appeal to a very broad cross-section of Americans. And we always have this discussion.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>DUKAKIS: But in the last analysis, we end up with folks that are making a lot of sense, and I think in this case will.</p><p>And I think we're going to get rid of the guy that's in there and get ourselves a president who really reflects what America is all about.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. People can bicker over that, Governor.</p><p>But I am curious what you make of what could be a crowded field.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren and this whole DNA, Native American testing and everything else, what did you think of all that?</p><p>DUKAKIS: Well, I think the whole thing is kind of silly.</p><p>I don't like -- I'm not a fan of Trump's, needless to say. He's an insulting guy and he's somebody who I think is pretty disagreeable all the time.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, that shocks me. I thought you liked him, but go ahead.</p><p>DUKAKIS: Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DUKAKIS: But this Pocahontas stuff, what's the matter with this guy? He's the president of the United States.</p><p>We have serious issues, both here and abroad. And this kind of stuff, I think, well, it reflects basically the kind of racism that this guy seems to stand for.</p><p>I mean, is there any group, any minority that he likes? We're all immigrants. My parents came over here.</p><p>CAVUTO: But do you think it was dumb of her to do it, though, Governor?</p><p>Do you think for her to go ahead and do that and try to satisfy that issue or resolve it, that she just created a bigger one, and might have doomed her chances to be your party's nominee?</p><p>DUKAKIS: I don't think so.</p><p>But, look, she's -- I know her well. I admire her greatly. I worked hard to help her get elected to the Senate. And I'm proud of that. And she's got to make judgments. We all have to in a campaign like this, or in a situation like this.</p><p>And I thought it was a reasonable thing to do. But it's -- really, isn't this so silly? I mean, the question is, what kind of country do we want? What kind of future do we want?</p><p>And let's knock off this insulting stuff. I mean, I just can't stand it. And I don't think the American people can stand it, which is one reason why I think the results tonight are going to be pretty good.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, we don't know. And you could be right on that.</p><p>But are you surprised, Governor, the economy is doing as well as it is? Now, Barack Obama claims credit for that, that it started with him. And he might or might not be right. But it's certainly picked up momentum under President Trump.</p><p>And I'm just curious how you reconcile that with your personal opinions of the president.</p><p>DUKAKIS: Well, first look, we were in terrible shape under the last Republican administration, in terrible shape. The country was floundering around badly when Obama got elected.</p><p>And it's pretty obvious what happened here, Neil. I mean, he and the work he did and the first Democratic Congress had everything to do with the fact that we came out of that terrible, terrible situation.</p><p>And by the time he left office, the economy was in pretty good shape. In fact, it was growing faster than it has been growing at least in one of the periods that Trump has been governing.</p><p>So the notion that Trump somehow came into this terrible situation and turned it around is nonsense. This economy was in damn good shape when Barack Obama left it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: To your point, it was certainly in a lot better shape than the...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DUKAKIS: Wait a second. Look...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think that that job growth, the complexion of those jobs, Governor, is better than they were, that pay is going up, unemployment levels among all sorts of groups is at record lows?</p><p>Does that surprise you?</p><p>DUKAKIS: Neil, let me tell you what bothers me.</p><p>We're now heading for a $1 trillion annual budget deficit. Now, I'm supposed to be a liberal, but I used to describe myself, as you will recall, as a liberal who could count.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DUKAKIS: And I was a governor who had to balance budgets.</p><p>Where are we going with all this? A trillion dollars worth or red ink on an annual basis at a time when we're at full employment? I mean, this is preposterous. And it's very serious.</p><p>CAVUTO: But we had $10 trillion added to our debt right in the last president, right?</p><p>DUKAKIS: Well, that's true, because he inherited an economy, it was in a shambles, and had to revive it.</p><p>CAVUTO: But it's a bipartisan problem, right? It's a bipartisan mess, right?</p><p>DUKAKIS: No, this is not a bipartisan problem.</p><p>When you cut taxes mostly for the wealthy by billions and billions of dollars at a time you're in full employment, that's terrible economic policy, in my judgment. Terrible.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we shall see.</p><p>DUKAKIS: This is a time when we should be getting ourselves back in shape and getting the economy in shape and getting the budget in shape. And we're not doing it.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. All right. I will put you down as a maybe on Donald Trump, Governor.</p><p>It's always good having you. Continued good luck with your teachings. Good seeing you again.</p><p>DUKAKIS: Great to chat with you, Neil. Thanks.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>DUKAKIS: Really appreciate it.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, the read from former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, you just heard the read from a former Democratic governor on what hurts our country and who gets credit for the improvement in the economy in our country.</p><p>Fair and balanced now, the read from a former Republican governor of Louisiana, of course, former presidential candidate as well Bobby Jindal.</p><p>Governor, good to have thank you.</p><p>BOBBY JINDAL (R), FORMER LOUISIANA GOVERNOR: Neil, thank you for having me back.</p><p>CAVUTO: Michael Dukakis made an interesting comment about, the debt is growing. Of course, it grows under, it seems, Democratic and Republican presidents alike. And it does seem to be choking us now.</p><p>What do you make of that? And do you worry about it?</p><p>JINDAL: You know, Neil, I actually do. That was one of the few, maybe the only times, I have actually agreed with Governor Dukakis.</p><p>I do think we have got to get control of the debt. Look, I think President Trump has done many good things. He said he was going to cut taxes. He did that. He said he was an appoint conservative judges. He did that.</p><p>He said he was going to rip up the Iran nuclear deal. He did that. He said he was going to stand with Israel. He did that.</p><p>One of the things that hasn't been done yet, though, the Republicans in D.C. have yet to really get spending under control. They haven't cut spending. They haven't balanced the budget. So I think that's a valid concern.</p><p>But, overall, it -- and it's an important concern. I'm not trivializing that. And it's funny to see Democrats all of a sudden get religion on deficits, after eight years of record-setting debt under President Obama.</p><p>And so certainly that's a valid criticism. But going into this election, I think overall the Republicans have done a great job, and they deserve to be reelected.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are you troubled, though, that neither party seems to be addressing this spiraling debt, and the fact that, with interest rates rising, it's only spiraling more?</p><p>JINDAL: Absolutely.</p><p>Look, I understand why it's good politics for President Trump -- and he said this as a candidate -- he said he wasn't going to look at or touch the entitlement programs. I don't think that's sustainable.</p><p>I think they have to be reformed going forward. I'm a strong supporter of premium support within the Medicare program. I do think getting the economy growing is a strong part of balancing the budget.</p><p>And he's doing that. President Obama had defined a new normal, where 2 percent growth was seemed to be the best we could do. We didn't have real wage growth. And President Trump campaigned and said, we could get back closer to 4 percent.</p><p>And we're on the way to doing that. So I think stronger economic growth is a big part of balancing the budget. But we have got to cut spending. Part of that is entitlement spending.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think Republicans should embrace that more forcefully, though?</p><p>Do you think, just like Democrats look the other way at some of their pet programs and all, that everyone should get on board with curtailing at least the growth in entitlements, and maybe grandfather in benefits for those closer to retirement age, but change them, raise them in other areas, either for Social Security, Medicare, but that that's got to be done?</p><p>JINDAL: Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO: And there's some political risk to that, but there's greater risk to the country if you don't do it.</p><p>JINDAL: Absolutely.</p><p>And look, to his credit, Paul Ryan championed that. And there are Republicans in Congress that have championed that. And, again, I understand politically why Republicans don't want to do that. It's always -- it's not very popular in the short-term.</p><p>We have got to do it. If we don't do it, in the longer run, you're going to have Democrats trying to...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, Donald Trump doesn't want to do it. He did not want to touch Social Security.</p><p>Now, that might change in the future. Do you think he should consider it?</p><p>JINDAL: Well, look, I think it'd be better for the country.</p><p>I get the political cost. But the reality is, I think, the earlier we act, the easier it is to do modest reforms. I think you're right. We need to grandfather people that are near retirement</p><p>I think you can do it. If you do it now, we're not talking about cutting these programs.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>JINDAL: We're talking about slowing down their growth rates.</p><p>And you can do it with competition. And, for example, in Medicare, give seniors more choices and more efficient private health care plans.</p><p>CAVUTO: Governor, we have a lot of races, the governorships, up for grabs, 36 of them. Republicans are thought to be in danger of maybe losing 10 10 of those races. So, it could be more even.</p><p>That obviously says a lot about the Census Bureau and how it goes about its business, what rewards are handed out in the next election.</p><p>Are you worried for your party?</p><p>JINDAL: Well, look, I think governor's races are incredibly important.</p><p>Part of this is, we had an incredible run four years ago. We had a record number of Republicans in office in the state capitals. But you're right. Not only are they important for political reasons, like the census and the presidential race.</p><p>From a policy perspective, when you think about health care policy, whether the states expand Medicaid, whether they put work requirements in Medicaid, whether they reform welfare, whether they cut taxes, whether they -- all these decisions get made at the state level, whether it's -- you enforce and implement state level religious liberty laws.</p><p>And so these are important elections. I think, oftentimes, they get overlooked. Everybody is focused on the Senate and the congressional races.</p><p>So, I do think these are important races. I know you were looking at Georgia recently. Look, those -- you have got two stark contrasts. You have got a far left liberal Democrat running against a pretty conservative Republican.</p><p>So, these aren't just differences in personalities. These are fundamentally different approaches.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we will see how they settle it all out.</p><p>Governor, it's always a pleasure. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>JINDAL: Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>For Main Street and Wall Street, it all comes together, which is why FOX Business Network is all night together on this.</p><p>Our biggest stars, reporters, anchors looking at the financial and the political fallout of all of this, a one-stop shop where you can gauge later on foreign market reaction to whatever happens, our own futures market reaction to whatever happens, from all angles, on FOX Business.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Who's taking them?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil Cavuto.  And this is \"Your World.\"  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we are all over this country with AFL-CIO's Richard Trumka in  Washington how big labor could be voting, legendary football coach Lou  Holtz in Indiana on why Donald Trump has him rallying.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis on what today says  about 2020 and where that is heading.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And our own market pros on whether this election will have investors buying  or selling.  </p><p>We begin with Mike Tobin in Greenwood, Indiana, a state that is already  seeing very heavy turnout -- Mike.</p><p>MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Very heavy turnout.</p><p>They joined to jump in here in Johnson County, massive turnout.  They did  have a computer problem earlier in the day.  But Ron Goins, the inspector,  the elections inspector here at Johnson County, says it does slow down the  process of intaking people and getting them a ballot.  It didn't impact the  integrity of the vote.  </p><p>We have heard some people complain about the long lines and that's just  because of the massive turnout.  Goins tells us it has been this way all  through early voting.  He anticipates that the numbers this time will just  absolutely eclipse the turnout numbers from the 2016 general election.  </p><p>The candidates have largely been laying low today.  Mike Braun was on  social media, encouraging Republicans to text their friends and get out the  vote.  Senator Joe Donnelly, the incumbent, has also been on social media.   He posted a phone number for people to call if they need a ride to get out  to the polls.  </p><p>But the people here in Johnson County say that politics, this Senate race  have been the primary topics of conversation in just about every social  setting, but they say it's not about Braun or Donnelly, this is a  referendum on Donald Trump -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Mike, thank you very, very much. </p><p>To Florida right now.  A couple of hotly contested races going on there,  one in the Senate, of course, incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson, Republican  Governor Rick Scott in the battle of their lives.</p><p>Peter Doocy in Naples, Florida, with the very latest.</p><p>Hey, Peter.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, I just walked -- I just watched  as a young man walked by.  He was on the phone telling somebody on the  other end that he showed up here and was told he was ineligible to vote,  which was very frustrating to him because he was telling this person on the  phone he did six tours of combat and wasn't able to vote here in Naples  today.</p><p>There's just a ton of interest and attention this race.  The Senate contest  pits three-term Democratic incumbent Senator Bill Nelson against a two-term  Republican Governor Rick Scott.  Nelson's campaign about protecting the  environment and protecting Obamacare.  Scott's campaign more about the  economy and having a direct line to Donald Trump.  </p><p>They have both won statewide before, but they both might have their fates  sealed by candidates who have not, and that is the gubernatorial  candidates.  Ron DeSantis, the Republican, came from behind and won the  primary with President Trump's endorsement.  Andrew Gillum, the Democrat,  won the primary with Bernie Sanders' endorsement.</p><p>The question is, will either have them be a boost or a drag to the Senate  candidate from their party, Neil?</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Peter, thank you very, very much. </p><p>Well, this could be a tale of two evenings here.  In the Senate, things  could be wrapped up relatively early, or at least we will have an idea  relatively early.  The House, well, that's a whole 'nother matter.</p><p>To FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on why that could be the case.</p><p>Hey, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p>This is going to be our evening ahead.  We're just going to do the follow- the-sun programming, but less than three hours away until the first polls  close.  So we want to take you through some of the key races.  </p><p>Most of the ones we will show you will be Senate races.  But the first post  closing 6:00 p.m. in Kentucky, parts of Indiana.  Of course, as we know  from Indiana, the only state with two time zones.  Health care a huge issue  in that state.  Democrat Joe Donnelly, the incumbent, trying to hold off  GOP challenger businessman Mike Braun, a close race and some say could  really start to shift some of the weight in the Senate.  </p><p>So, 7:00 p.m., we're going to be more focused on Indiana, as we mentioned,  of course, Georgia as well, that gubernatorial race a little bit more  interesting than any others.  We know Secretary of State Brian Kemp really  facing off against the progressive former State Rep. Stacey Abrams.</p><p>And 8:00 p.m. Eastern time, you're going to see all where the polls start  closing there.  Basically, this is the largest batch of states that are  going to begin to be closing, including eight states with super competitive  Senate races.  </p><p>So you can see, obviously, all of the ones lit up here.  We're going to be  most focused on a Florida and also Missouri.  So you have in Florida, of  course, incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson trying to hold off the term-limit  GOP Governor Rick Scott.</p><p>And then in Missouri, you have the state A.G., Josh Hawley, vs. the  Democrat incumbent, Claire McCaskill.</p><p>Now, 9:00 p.m., as we sort of go along again, all of these are in Eastern  time, really going to be most focused on Texas, Arizona and North Dakota as  well.  So in Arizona, Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema against Congresswoman  Martha McSally.  This is airtight, from everybody that we have been  speaking to.</p><p>North Dakota, you have, of course, the incumbent, Heidi Heitkamp, trying to  fend off Congressman Kevin Cramer.  And then in Texas, the most expensive  Senate race ever, $100 million, not even counting super PACs, incumbent, of  course, you have Senator Ted Cruz, Beto O'Rourke.</p><p>I want to mention as well, for Mr. O'Rourke, a lot of his money is coming  from Silicon Valley employees, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple.  By  11:00 p.m., not surprisingly, Neil, we will find ourselves on the West  Coast.</p><p>And out there, I just want to highlight actually two House races.  So we  will pull those contests up.  You're going to see here for the Golden State  two of these areas which are really not only tight.  CA-10, we will pull  that first one up.  </p><p>But one of the other reasons that we're following the Harder vs. Denham  contest is because this area actually had voted for Hillary Clinton in the  2016 presidential election.  Same can be said for Rouda vs. Rohrabacher.</p><p>And we know from this area even geographically not a huge surprise there,  Neil, that immigration is going to be a huge issue in both of those areas.</p><p>Neil, we will be here.  Long night.  That's -- those results back in a few  hours for us -- back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You had to rub that in, didn't you?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Deirdre, thank you very, very much, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p>All right, I want to take a look at the corner of Wall and Broad today.  We  were up a lot on the Dow today.  Now, there is a sort of a consensus  building -- always dangerous, I hasten to add -- that we're going to see  slip government after this midterm election, that is the House under one  party's control, Democrats, and then the Senate under the continued  Republican control.  Of course, the White House would remain under  Republican control.</p><p>And markets like that.  Now, the consensus could be very, very wrong and it  doesn't pan out that way.  There are other variables here.  </p><p>Let's get the read on how all of that would sort out for the investment  community with my buddy David Asman, the host of \"Bulls &amp; Bears\" on FOX  Business Network, and market watcher Alan Knuckman.</p><p>By the way, David, looking at this and these crosscurrents here, the first  thing you have to ask is, that consensus for split government, markets like  that, don't they?</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Markets generally prefer split government.</p><p>Gridlock is a dirty word in the world of politics.  But markets find it to  be enlightening because it means that they can't get stuff done.  They  can't spend more government money.  That tends to leave a lot of Wall  Street and private sector off the hook.  </p><p>I should just say, but no matter what happens tomorrow, there have been 18  midterm elections since 1946, 18, and in every single one, 18 out of 18,  the 12 months following that midterm election, the markets are generally  up.</p><p>So I think we might have some pretty good times coming in the next 12  months.  Lord knows what's going to happen beyond that.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, I can't even go to the next 12 minutes.</p><p>But, Alan, I'm curious.  When you look at this, you always have to brace  yourself for surprises and whether there's an unexpected development.  </p><p>ALAN KNUCKMAN, BULLS EYE OPTION:  Right.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Let's say the Republicans were to hang on to the House, and then  they continue to run the table with all the levers of government under  their control.  What do you think?  </p><p>KNUCKMAN:  Well, I'm of the opinion that optimism wins.  And you have got  to be very optimistic.  </p><p>Obviously, David just went through that fantastic number that every single  time a year after the midterm, the market was higher.  So you have got to  put this in perspective.  We're on a very strong upward path.  We bounced  25 percent since the Trump election, but you can total up.  It's 311  percent since that 2009 low.</p><p>I don't think this changes anything.  Again, corporations are going to do  well in any political environment.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, David, one of the things that comes up a lot is the idea  that there's a possibility that the Democrats have a surge, and in that  surge, they might just take the Senate.  It's one of the less likely  variables here, but then what?</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, if they do, or if it's just the House -- but certainly if  it's both -- President Trump is going to have to be a consummate deal  maker.</p><p>And there are certain deals that he wants to make with Democrats,  infrastructure.  Remember, there's $1.5 million in infrastructure spending  that the president and Democrats want to do together.  There's also the  question of regulation.</p><p>And the president fancies himself as a deregulator.  He's done a terrific  job in deregulating the private sector.  However, he wants to put more  regulations on things like pharmaceuticals, like drug prices.  He wants to  have price controls.  Democrats wants price controls.</p><p>That could worry Wall Street quite a bit.  And there's also concern about  the banks and big tech.  Remember, he's talked about breaking up some of  the biggest high-tech companies.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Alan, I know you're looking at the half-full glass here.</p><p>Regardless of how the midterms turn out, I'm wondering whether all the  other items that are backing up like planes at La Guardia are an issue.   That is the upcoming G20 meeting between our president and the leader of  China.  We might have a Mueller report before this month is out.  </p><p>The Federal Reserve busy with another meeting, and while that isn't the one  that it's expected to raise rates, it could telegraph that.  What do you  think?</p><p>KNUCKMAN:  It's going to be December.</p><p>Well, there's always got to be concerns and worries.  Otherwise, this  wouldn't be any fun.  </p><p>So, we have gotten through every one of those.  But I'm a big believer that  global growth -- growth is driving it.  It's not just us.  If you look at  unemployment wrong world, Canada is at 40-year lows, Japan's at 2.3  percent, Germany's at the lowest unemployment level ever.</p><p>So around the world, everybody's doing well.  And I think that's very much  a positive.  We have been able to get through all these -- these woes and  worries in the past.  I look for that to happen once again.  </p><p>Let me point out.  Let's go back in the way-back machine, when we had a  split government.  If you go back to Reagan, we had a split government and  everybody can probably agree that we did pretty well economically at that  time.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, we forgot, in '82, when the Republicans lost a lot of seats - - I think 27 -- of course, the market a year later was up another 19  percent, right?</p><p>ASMAN:  Can I bring it back home, though, just for a second?</p><p>Because beyond the congressional races and Senate races, there a lot of  initiatives on the ballot and a lot of them have to do with taxes.  They're  18 states that have initiatives involved in taxes.  Colorado, which has a  flat tax for income tax, they want to change it into a five-bracket tax,  almost double -- double the high end of that.</p><p>State of Washington has a carbon tax.  There is a whole bunch of taxes.   And those should be looked at, because they could affect business,  certainly on a local level, to a great extent, and on a personal level.   You could be paying thousands of dollars more or less, depending on how you  vote.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, and where you live.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you, David, final word on that.  </p><p>Alan Knuckman, I want to thank you.  </p><p>KNUCKMAN:  Thank you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, and when we come back here, besides looking at some of  the money issues at stake here, I want you to picture this, the AFL-CIO  chief, Richard Trumka, and the legendary football coach and Notre Dame  sensation Lou Holtz.  What do they have in common?</p><p>We will explain after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, you're looking to live right now at a polling place saying  in Greenwood, Indiana, the president campaigning in the Hoosier State just  yesterday.</p><p>He was joined by college football Hall of Fame sensation the coach Lou  Holtz.</p><p>Lou Holtz joins us right now on the phone.</p><p>Coach, very good have you.</p><p>LOU HOLTZ, HALL OF FAME FOOTBALL COACH:  Well, thank you, Neil.  Pleasure  to be with you.  I watch your show all the time.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm very honored by that, coach.</p><p>I mean, obviously, you have been a close friend of the president's long,  long before he was president.  And then you carry considerable clout in  your state and elsewhere.  That was a very early and welcome endorsement.  </p><p>And I'm wondering whether you -- the crowd you saw and the enthusiasm you  saw is going to translate in that state to a Democratic senator maybe  losing?  </p><p>HOLTZ:  Well, that's very possible, because Joe Donnelly's a very popular  individually.</p><p>He is also a Notre Dame alum, which put me in an awkward position.   However, the main point I made to the people and enthusiasm of the crowd,  there were 12,000 people there.  They were jammed in, enthusiasm.  And  there were an awful lot of young people there and thousands outside.  </p><p>But the point I made is, President Trump needs some help.  Everybody is  ganging up on him.  You got the media, you got the Democrats, you got the  academicians.  We have to send people there.  </p><p>Joe Donnelly is a wonderful individual, I'm sure.  But we need people there  that are going to support the Supreme Court justices, going to support his  thing.  And Notre Dame is undefeated this year.</p><p>And, as I said to the crowd, you want to go back to a couple years ago, we  won four games and lost eight?  No.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOLTZ:  Then why would we want to move -- why would we want to go back?  </p><p>Every time I turned around a winning situation -- or a losing situation,  nobody ever said, coach, we like it better when we are losing.</p><p>But this is the mentality of the media.  So, I believe in what he's doing.   And I supported him, endorsed him before he got the nomination.</p><p>And I spoke at a Tampa bay rally the day and the Saturday before the  election in 2016.  The enthusiasm was great.  Nobody gave him a chance, but  I thought, good lord, everywhere I go, it is this way.  And maybe it is  going to translate into the midterms, but history goes against it.  We will  have to wait and see.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, it's early on.  I like how you can relate football and Notre  Dame and to the state of the economy.  That is pretty clever.  </p><p>But, Coach, I'm curious about what you make of Senator Donnelly, who is  very popular in the state.  The president has made multiple visits to  Indiana.  He was still doing quite well, that is Senator Donnelly.  </p><p>Would you be disappointed or worried for Indiana, then, given your bias and  preference that he go, if he were to stay in there?  Because he has very  shrewdly incorporated a lot of views of the president and speaks obviously  very highly of you, so he walks a tight line and a rope in a state that  requires him to.  </p><p>HOLTZ:  This isn't a case of having good vs. bad.  </p><p>I think they are both very good candidates.  I just know that Braun will  support the president.  I can't say that about any Democrat.  The Democrats  will say one thing, but when they get in, there were 40-something people  that were up for the House on the Democratic side who said, we will not  vote for Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p>But I happen to know that you take a vow, that when you go in there and you  are elected, you are going to vote for Nancy Pelosi.  And he will back  Schumer.  Joe Manchin voted for Kavanaugh, but he only did it after the  nomination was secured with Collins' vote.</p><p>And that is like jumping on.  But I just think that President Trump needs  help there.  We have a lot of Republicans that are never-Trumpers, but look  to what has happened to the economy.  Look what has happened to this  country.  Look what has happened. He's caring about the people.  </p><p>We're worried about the caravan people coming in.  What is going to end up  -- how about the homeless people on the street?  Go into San Francisco.  Go  into Denver.  Go look at the poverty we have there.  Let's take care of our  people first.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, coach, it's always good having you.  You are doing well  coming out of your shell, by the way, so keep working on that.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOLTZ:  Well, Neil, you can mark me down as undecided.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, coach, thank you.  A real honor talking to you.  I  appreciate it.  </p><p>HOLTZ:  Always a pleasure, Neil.  Bye.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right. </p><p>In the meantime, we have another tight race in Missouri, right?  This is a  pickup that Republicans are salivating over, but you got get behind those  numbers, which we plan to do after this.</p><p>Then the AFL-CIO president, Richard Trumka, on why this president might be  helping unions a little bit more than some of his Republican predecessors,  but apparently not enough for Richard -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI:  This race is just way too close to  call.  So we don't know what's going to happen, but we feel great about the  effort.  </p><p>JOSH HAWLEY (R), MISSOURI SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  We're excited.  Just  voted, and on to victory tonight.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Missouri, that's a key Senate battle Republicans are  hoping for a pickup, defeating, they hope, incumbent Senator Claire  McCaskill.</p><p>Republican challenger Josh Hawley, both of them voting today.  Both very  confident things will work out their way.  </p><p>This is a state that Donald Trump, by the way, won by about 18 points.  </p><p>Kristin Fisher is there with the latest on how it's all going down in Saint  Louis. </p><p>Hey, Kristin.  </p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.  </p><p>Well, we have seen a steady stream of voters at this polling place just  outside Saint Louis all day today.  And when the Democratic incumbent,  Senator Claire McCaskill, voted here just a few hours ago, she said that  she thought this race was still too close to call.  </p><p>She's been trying to make the case that she's not too liberal to represent  a state that President Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016.  But her  opponent, the state's Republican attorney general, Josh Hawley, says she's  still too liberal for Missouri.</p><p>And President Trump helped him make that case at a rally last night in Cape  Girardeau.  Now, blue-collar Missourians, they overwhelmingly voted for  President Trump in 2016 by nearly 20 points.  But they also drove the  defeat of the state's right-to-work Proposition A just this past August.  </p><p>So one of the big questions, Neil, is, how are these union members in the  state going to vote today?  That could be a big driver in who wins this  race now, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you very much, Kristin.  </p><p>And I'm going to raise that point with the AFL-CIO president Richard  Trumka, who joins us right now.</p><p>Richard, I'm looking at some of these union numbers that have picked up,  including unemployment levels among union families that are about the  lowest they have been in 20 years.  And I'm wondering why you would be  against the president of the United States, if he's helping you provide  those numbers.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AFL-CIO:  Well, Neil, this president of the  United States isn't on the election ballot today.  </p><p>There's a number of people that support workers and those that don't.   We're supporting people like Claire McCaskill, who stands up for us, Josh  Hawley, who supports right-to-work.</p><p>So we're supporting those candidates that support working people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMKA:  And, by the way, we have about 1,500...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  But I just want to be clear.</p><p>The working families and all of that, if that's happening under Republican  leadership, you're -- you're not buying that this is sustainable beyond the  president?  Is that what you're saying?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I don't think that the president's on the ballot today.  </p><p>Claire McCaskill is on the ballot, and Josh Hawley's on the ballot in  Missouri.  And they're going to say, who's the best for us?  It's clearly  Claire McCaskill.</p><p>Josh Hawley is out of step.  He supports right-to-work that that state  rejected by better than two to one.  And so it's an election about them.   And she will win tonight.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, so if we fast-forward to 2020, the president's up for  reelection, and you do and have in prior interviews credited the president  with helping unions doing more, certainly than other Republicans have,  would you endorse him?  </p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, I'm not going to get there until 2020.  </p><p>We have an election tonight to take care of, Neil.  Look, we will see what  he did.  We will judge what he did to help workers and what he did to hurt  workers.  And if he did more to help workers and he didn't -- then, of  course, like every one other candidate, he will be considered, but I'm not  making that decision.  </p><p>My executive council, all my members in each one of the states help us make  that decision.  So it's not Richard's decision.  It's the membership's  decision.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, but you're also the big cheese.  I mean, this doesn't happen  without you weighing in, right?  </p><p>TRUMKA:  No, they make that decision.  They actually do.</p><p>I didn't endorse any of the candidates running today.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>So let me step back from this and understand.  Do you think things are  looking very good for the economy right now?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, it depends on where you sit.</p><p>If you're a worker, things are still not good for the economy.  We have had  three decades of flat wages.  You have had your health care go up.  You  have had your pensions attacked.  And you're about to, in many cases, even  lose health care and lose your pensions.</p><p>So it's not a very secure place for us to be.  If you're at the very top of  the heap, yes, this is a good economy for you, you're doing great.   Hopefully, we can see wages increase.  But, Neil, there's only one way  that's going to happen.  And that's to give workers a voice on the job, so  that they can negotiate with their employers and get a bigger share of the  wealth that they help produce.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  But it just seems odd that you're going for Claire  McCaskill in this case and other prominent Democrats who were there and  through that period of time, long before this president came to power.</p><p>Republicans had the run of the table in Washington.  And they might be  listening this and saying, I can't figure Trumka out here.  He's taking it  out on at least trends that in the last couple of years have looked good  for his members, looked good for union workers, record low unemployment  among young workers, Latino workers, African-American workers, union  workers, average manufacturing workers.</p><p>TRUMKA:  It's real simple.  </p><p>I speak for my members.  And I have a fidelity to one group only, and  that's to the American worker.  When their wages are flat, their health  care is under attack, and they're paying more and more and more for health  care every year, when their pensions are under attack, I'm going to stand  with them and fight whoever it is, no matter what party, that's attacking  them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  But their wages have been running at a clip.</p><p>In the latest employment report, their wages are running at a 3.1 percent  clip, the strongest it's been now in decades, and certainly over a decade.   And I'm wondering how that jibes with workers who might be disadvantaged.</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry.  I didn't understand your question.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, if things are so bad and wage growth is running at a 10- year-high clip, what's so bad for workers who have not been seeing that?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  By the way, that's for one month.  That doesn't erase the two  decades of flat wages.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, wait a minute.</p><p>Did you complain about that when it was Barack Obama as president?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  You remember when he tried to do TPP?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But you supported Barack Obama.  You supported Barack Obama. </p><p>TRUMKA:  I was against him.  Whenever he didn't do things that I agreed  with, I'm against him.  </p><p>I treat Barack Obama exactly like I treat Donald Trump.  If they do  something good for workers, I support them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Who was the last Republican you supported, Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  We're supporting Republicans right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Who?</p><p>TRUMKA:  We're supporting Brian Fitzgerald in Pennsylvania.  </p><p>We're supporting Republicans in New Jersey.  We're supporting Republicans  in Ohio.  Here's the problem, Neil.  There are precious few Republicans  that support workers.</p><p>When they support workers, we support them.  When they don't support  workers, we are not foolish.  We don't support them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I understand.</p><p>But if unemployment goes down among your workers, if their prospects  dramatically improved over the last couple of years, whether you want to  pin that to Donald Trump or not -- and I know you draw a distinction  between the president and many and his party.  </p><p>But, I mean, that's progress you were not seeing under the last president  or the president before him or the president before him, right?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, Neil -- look, Neil, this is a nice conversation.  It has  nothing to do with today's election.  </p><p>But if Donald Trump is the candidate who has helped workers the most when  it's time to endorse, our members will tell us that.  If he is not, they  will tell us that as well.  </p><p>He isn't on the ballot today.  People like Claire McCaskill are on the  ballot.  People like Bill Nelson are on the ballot.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I understand that.</p><p>But who is the last Republican presidential candidate you have supported?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I don't know.</p><p>You ask us about Republicans.  We support Republicans in every race.  If  they support workers, we support them.</p><p>The last Republican -- Mitt Romney didn't support workers.  He had a bad  record with workers.  And I can go back through the list all the way back.</p><p>Probably the last one that actually supported workers would have been  Eisenhower.  Eisenhower actually did support workers.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  And I wish we had more time.  And you have been a great guest, as  always.</p><p>But I know, when we last had it, you said my -- I don't see a political  persuasion here.  I look at how they help unions, how they help union  workers, how they help average folks.</p><p>If things are now in this economy going the way they're going, with one of  the strongest recoveries we have seen, you find precious few Republicans to  support in this environment, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  For whom?  Wait, wait, wait, Neil.  Wait, wait, wait.</p><p>Strongest recovery for whom?  Workers haven't seen that recovery yet.   Workers are seeing their health care go up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Richard, do you look at the same data I look at?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMKA:  I do.  I do, Neil.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, if you would give me a chance to explain, I will explain.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But I'm not an apologist for any side, Richard.</p><p>But do you look at the same data I do?  </p><p>TRUMKA:  I do.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Record low unemployment across every major demographic group?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I do.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And you still say not good enough?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I do.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  You had one month of wage increase, one, one quarter.  Three  decades, that doesn't wipe out.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You have had two years of improving numbers, Richard. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  In addition to that, health care -- our health care out-of-pocket  costs went up 5.9 percent last year.  They're scheduled to go up for an  individual $1,500 next year, Neil.</p><p>That's a lot of money for individuals.  So you can't pull out one statistic  and say, this is great, or one group of people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm not pulling out one statistic or another.</p><p>I'm just trying to be very, very clear.  What would it take for you to sort  of say, all right, things are better than they have been?  I mean, yes,  wages could go at a stronger clip in real inflation-adjusted terms.  They  most certainly good.  You're absolutely right about that.  </p><p>But the arc, the trend is your friend right now for union members, for  those who -- who -- many of whom attend these rallies where Donald Trump  speaks.  So, what do they see that apparently you do not?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, look, they will tell me if that's the case.  </p><p>If they want to endorse him, they will.  But we went to our members in  Ohio, we have had a conversation with them; 50 percent of those that voted  for Donald Trump have told us they're voting for Richard Cordray and for  Sherrod Brown.  That's 50 percent of the people that voted for Donald  Trump.  </p><p>So, apparently, his argument hasn't persuaded them.  They know that Richard  Cordray is better than DeWine.  And they know that Sherrod Brown is their  friend that will stick up for them.  So they're voting for them.</p><p>That's what we see in this election.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I understand.</p><p>But when they -- when they look at what's happening around them...</p><p>TRUMKA:  Do you really?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I'm taking your word for it.</p><p>So, when they look around at what's happening, and they see some of these  improvements, are you telling me that they're simply not good enough, or  that the progress on trade deals that they had argued, you had argued to me  -- now, don't -- just be careful -- and you had told me were not really  good for union members, what do they see now?  Do they like them or dislike  them?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  Neil, I know -- I know you want to make this an issue about me and  you and us and them.</p><p>But, look, that's a nonissue right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know what you're saying.</p><p>It's not about you or me or us and them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  Here's what I'm saying.  Here's what I'm saying.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm just curious, do you like the trade deals of this president?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  You did not like a lot of those trade deals.  Now, I don't know if  these newer deals he's designed are in your favor or not.  Do you like  them, or you liked the old deals better, the old trade deals better?</p><p>TRUMKA:  NAFTA, it is quite -- it's too early for us to decide whether yes  or no.</p><p>There's some improvements.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.  </p><p>TRUMKA:  There's some places where he's digressed.  </p><p>When we know all the facts, we will make a decision.  And all the pundits  who are going crazy right now, being either gushing for it or gushing  against it, are simply wrong, because they don't have the facts yet.</p><p>We will judge it on its merit.  There are improvements in it and there are  areas where it's going backwards.  If we can enforce this agreement, if the  enforcement mechanism is there, if we can get the Mexican government to  allow wages to rise, so that there's less downward pressure on the wages in  the United States, then, yes, we will endorse that.  </p><p>If it doesn't do that, then we won't.  But it's too early for us to be able  to tell.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  Am I encouraged?  Wait.  Am I encouraged that we're talking about  it?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>TRUMKA:  Yes, I am encouraged.  </p><p>I'm also encouraged and proud of union members and workers across the  country, because the debate right now isn't whether we're going to have a  new NAFTA.  The debate right now is how we fix a broken one.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So, the idea and the guarantees that are supposedly in there --  and you know this far better than I -- to hire more union workers, to hire  them at wages that were not in the prior deal, do you find that promising,  or do you find it accurate, or what?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, first of all, we don't know.</p><p>We don't know how it will be enforced or what will be enforced.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>TRUMKA:  We don't know how the labor chapter will be enforced, how the  rules of origin will be enforced, or several other things.</p><p>So we need to find out that language.  If it's good, then, yes, it'll be  encouraging.  If it isn't, and we can't enforce the agreement, it doesn't  matter what the agreement says.  It's unenforceable.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK, so, finally, real quick final question.</p><p>The number -- you said you support a of number Republican candidates, but  do you have a breakdown of the percentage of Democrats you are supporting  vs. Republicans?  I would just be curious.  </p><p>TRUMKA:  No, I don't.  I don't, because we are up and down the ballot this  time far more than we have ever been.  There's a lot of local races, state  house members, state senates.</p><p>And so I don't have that.  I will be able to get you that tomorrow.</p><p>There's about 1,500 union members that are running for office on the ballot  this time.  And we're working hard to get them elected, so that they can  stand up.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>TRUMKA:  Some are Republicans.  Most are Democrats.  But some are  Republicans.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Richard, very good chatting with you.  I appreciate it.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Thanks for having me, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Richard Trumka of the AFL-CIO.</p><p>Meanwhile, to New Jersey and voters there going to the polls, closing out  what's been a very contentious and expensive Senate race between incumbent  Bob Menendez, the Republican challenger, Bob Hugin.</p><p>Let's go first to David Lee Miller in Mountainside, New Jersey, with the  latest on finally the end of what has been a very nasty race, huh?</p><p>DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Indeed, it has been, Neil.</p><p>This has been a very hard-ought battle and, as you said, a very nasty one  at times.  Democratic senator Bob Menendez is vying now for a third term as  New Jersey senator.  Although he has been considered the front-runner all  along, some analysts say that in a blue state like New Jersey, it should  have been a lock for Menendez, that he should be certain to win.  </p><p>However, victory is not certain here.  Menendez is considered vulnerable  following a corruption trial last year that although resulted in a hung  jury did tarnish his reputation.  Republican challenger Bob Hugin,  meanwhile, who has been endorsed by President Trump and who has donated to  the president's 2016 campaign and also was the chairman of his finance  committee here in New Jersey, is trying to distance himself from President  Trump, saying that he is a different kind of candidate, that he is  independent.  </p><p>Meanwhile, as voters do go to the polls, there have been many reports,  multiple reports today, Neil, of problems at polling stations, ranging from  long lines and machines that have been malfunctioning.</p><p>We expect the polls here will close in just a little under three-and-a- half-hours.  That is 8:00 local time -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  David Lee, thank you very, very much. </p><p>It's not that New Jersey has not elected its share of Republican officials.   Of course, Chris Christie is a former governor, two-term governor.  There's  a Democratic governor now.  </p><p>And, of course, before him, of course, it was Christie Todd Whitman, who  joins us right now.  </p><p>Governor, good to have you.  </p><p>CHRISTIE TODD WHITMAN (R), FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR:  Good to be with  you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  It is tough for Republicans to get elected in New Jersey.</p><p>WHITMAN:  It is.  It's a challenge.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p>WHITMAN:  We're a little bit outnumbered in the number of registered  voters.  </p><p>The only thing I will say, though, the part that's growing is the  independents.  Democrats are losing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p>Now, the Hugin-Menendez battle has been pretty sharp and very expensive.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WHITMAN:  Yes.      </p><p>CAVUTO:  What do you think of it and the kind of coverage it's been  getting?  </p><p>WHITMAN:  It's been getting a lot of coverage.  And it's exciting to see  that Bob Hugin is doing as well as he's doing.</p><p>And I think it's within the realm of possibility that he could knock off  Menendez, because Menendez has such a bad reputation, and being censured  the way was by both Republicans and Democrats, more importantly.</p><p>That's come to people's attention, even with the disparity in registration  and more Democrats.  There are still people that don't like the fact that  they have someone in office who has been censured that way and found to be  lacking ethically.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's happened on the governor's side, not so much on the Senate  side, in New Jersey to get a Republican in power there.  Why is that, you  think?</p><p>WHITMAN:  I don't know.  It's hard to say.</p><p>It's ideological.  It's because the senators go where -- they think the big  thoughts.  The governors have to deliver.  And so they're looking for  slightly different things in those two offices.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>WHITMAN:  They want someone in a governorship who they think can really  deliver on their promises, not just come up with new ideas as to how to  approach things.  </p><p>So, it's more ideological, I think, when you look at the senatorial races  than it is at the gubernatorial level.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Bob Hugin, of course, is a very rich pharmaceutical executive.   He's forked over more than $35 million of his own money presumably into  this race.  </p><p>Does he have the future if for some reason it doesn't turn out, he doesn't  win tonight?</p><p>I think, if he wants to have one, he can, absolutely, because he's been a  very credible candidate.  He's well-spoken.  He's a bright guy.  He had a  good reputation as a CEO.</p><p>Menendez has tried to attack that.  But Bob has had some very good and, I  think, forceful responses to those attacks.  So, it's been an ugly race,  unfortunately.  And we're seeing that across the country.  And that's just  not in our best interests, I don't think, in the long run.</p><p>But I do think, if he wants to have a future, he certainly could.  I don't  know, when you have spent this much of your own money, and done this, put  as much heart into it as you have...</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's a lot of money, yes.</p><p>WHITMAN:  ... whether you're going to want to come back and try to do  something else again.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Governor, thank you very, very much, Governor Christie  Todd Whitman.</p><p>We will be following that very, very closely.  </p><p>In the meantime, Georgia voting is already under way.  They're looking at  governor.  Health care is a very, very big issue there.  And that health  care keeps playing out again and again, in race after race.</p><p>The read from the former Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis  on why that is -- after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, it's not just Congress up for grabs; 36 gubernatorial  seats are on the line, including a very tight race going on in the Peach  State of Georgia between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp.</p><p>Health care a very, very big issue there, as it is across the country.  </p><p>Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta with more.  </p><p>Hey, Jonathan.  </p><p>JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.</p><p>When it comes to health care, the candidates running for governor in  Georgia could not be any more different.  You have Republican Brian Kemp,  who cast his ballot earlier today, saying that he will fight what he calls  a socialist takeover of health care.  This plays well with his conservative  base in rural parts of the state.</p><p>Democrat Stacey Abrams, on the other hand, says she wants to protect  Obamacare.  This appeals to her base in large cities.  But she's also  making the case to rural Georgians that expanding Medicare would reverse  the trend of hospital closures in less populated areas.  </p><p>Voter turnout is setting new records.  Before Election Day, more than two  million Georgians had already cast ballots, more than doubling the previous  record for early voting in a midterm election in this state.  </p><p>And then, Neil, coming back to our live shot, you can see voter turnout  today, on the Election Day, is very heavy.  The secretary of state's office  telling us voter turnout is heavy in all parts of the state -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Thank you, Jonathan, very, very much.  </p><p>The read on that enthusiasm now from former Democratic presidential  candidate Michael Dukakis, also the former Massachusetts governor.  </p><p>Governor, very good to have you.</p><p>MICHAEL DUKAKIS (D), FORMER MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR:  Neil, great to be back  with you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Same here.  </p><p>What do you make of these high turnout numbers across a broad swathe of  groups here?  </p><p>DUKAKIS:  Well, I think Donald Trump has got people pretty excited.</p><p>In many cases, they're very angry with him.  In some cases, they like him.   But I have seen it in my teaching.  As you know, I have been teaching at  Northeastern University here in Boston for the past 28 years.</p><p>And I have never seen, Neil, the kind of interest in public service that  I'm seeing on the part of my students these days.  Most of them, at least  up here, don't like Trump.  </p><p>But the important thing is that this is finally got them out seriously  thinking about serving in public life.  And I think that's great, and I  hope it continues and we can encourage it.  </p><p>But I do think this turnout tells you something.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Governor, normally, when the last ballots are counted in the  midterms, within hours, they're working on the next campaign.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  And we're expecting quite a few prominent Democrats to throw their  hat in the ring for president.</p><p>And there has been a concern among some in your party that Democrats are  driving a hard left, and it's going to hurt them.  What do you think of  that?</p><p>DUKAKIS:  That's always been a concern.</p><p>And I don't see anything unusual about it.  We're going to have an active  primary.  We're going to have a lot of candidates.  But in the last  analysis, whoever wins that nomination is going to be somebody who, in my  opinion -- don't know who it's going to be, I don't have any particular  preference -- is somebody who will work his or her way through the primary  and come out as a strong and effective nominee.  </p><p>And it'll be somebody who can appeal to a very broad cross-section of  Americans.  And we always have this discussion.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>DUKAKIS:  But in the last analysis, we end up with folks that are making a  lot of sense, and I think in this case will.</p><p>And I think we're going to get rid of the guy that's in there and get  ourselves a president who really reflects what America is all about.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  People can bicker over that, Governor.</p><p>But I am curious what you make of what could be a crowded field.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren and this whole DNA, Native American testing and everything  else, what did you think of all that?  </p><p>DUKAKIS:  Well, I think the whole thing is kind of silly.  </p><p>I don't like -- I'm not a fan of Trump's, needless to say.  He's an  insulting guy and he's somebody who I think is pretty disagreeable all the  time.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, that shocks me.  I thought you liked him, but go ahead.</p><p>DUKAKIS:  Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DUKAKIS:  But this Pocahontas stuff, what's the matter with this guy?  He's  the president of the United States.</p><p>We have serious issues, both here and abroad.  And this kind of stuff, I  think, well, it reflects basically the kind of racism that this guy seems  to stand for.</p><p>I mean, is there any group, any minority that he likes?  We're all  immigrants.  My parents came over here.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But do you think it was dumb of her to do it, though, Governor?</p><p>Do you think for her to go ahead and do that and try to satisfy that issue  or resolve it, that she just created a bigger one, and might have doomed  her chances to be your party's nominee?</p><p>DUKAKIS:  I don't think so.</p><p>But, look, she's -- I know her well.  I admire her greatly.  I worked hard  to help her get elected to the Senate.  And I'm proud of that.  And she's  got to make judgments.  We all have to in a campaign like this, or in a  situation like this.</p><p>And I thought it was a reasonable thing to do.  But it's -- really, isn't  this so silly?  I mean, the question is, what kind of country do we want?   What kind of future do we want?  </p><p>And let's knock off this insulting stuff.  I mean, I just can't stand it.   And I don't think the American people can stand it, which is one reason why  I think the results tonight are going to be pretty good.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, we don't know.  And you could be right on that.  </p><p>But are you surprised, Governor, the economy is doing as well as it is?   Now, Barack Obama claims credit for that, that it started with him.  And he  might or might not be right.  But it's certainly picked up momentum under  President Trump.  </p><p>And I'm just curious how you reconcile that with your personal opinions of  the president.  </p><p>DUKAKIS:  Well, first look, we were in terrible shape under the last  Republican administration, in terrible shape.  The country was floundering  around badly when Obama got elected.</p><p>And it's pretty obvious what happened here, Neil.  I mean, he and the work  he did and the first Democratic Congress had everything to do with the fact  that we came out of that terrible, terrible situation.</p><p>And by the time he left office, the economy was in pretty good shape.  In  fact, it was growing faster than it has been growing at least in one of the  periods that Trump has been governing.</p><p>So the notion that Trump somehow came into this terrible situation and  turned it around is nonsense.  This economy was in damn good shape when  Barack Obama left it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  To your point, it was certainly in a lot better shape than the...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DUKAKIS:  Wait a second.  Look...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think that that job growth, the complexion of those jobs,  Governor, is better than they were, that pay is going up, unemployment  levels among all sorts of groups is at record lows?</p><p>Does that surprise you?  </p><p>DUKAKIS:  Neil, let me tell you what bothers me.</p><p>We're now heading for a $1 trillion annual budget deficit.  Now, I'm  supposed to be a liberal, but I used to describe myself, as you will  recall, as a liberal who could count.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DUKAKIS:  And I was a governor who had to balance budgets.</p><p>Where are we going with all this?  A trillion dollars worth or red ink on  an annual basis at a time when we're at full employment?  I mean, this is  preposterous.  And it's very serious.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But we had $10 trillion added to our debt right in the last  president, right?</p><p>DUKAKIS:  Well, that's true, because he inherited an economy, it was in a  shambles, and had to revive it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But it's a bipartisan problem, right?  It's a bipartisan mess,  right?</p><p>DUKAKIS:  No, this is not a bipartisan problem.</p><p>When you cut taxes mostly for the wealthy by billions and billions of  dollars at a time you're in full employment, that's terrible economic  policy, in my judgment.  Terrible.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we shall see.</p><p>DUKAKIS:  This is a time when we should be getting ourselves back in shape  and getting the economy in shape and getting the budget in shape.  And  we're not doing it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  All right.  I will put you down as a maybe on Donald  Trump, Governor.</p><p>It's always good having you.  Continued good luck with your teachings.   Good seeing you again.</p><p>DUKAKIS:  Great to chat with you, Neil.  Thanks.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>DUKAKIS:  Really appreciate it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, the read from former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal  after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, you just heard the read from a former Democratic  governor on what hurts our country and who gets credit for the improvement  in the economy in our country.</p><p>Fair and balanced now, the read from a former Republican governor of  Louisiana, of course, former presidential candidate as well Bobby Jindal.</p><p>Governor, good to have thank you.</p><p>BOBBY JINDAL (R), FORMER LOUISIANA GOVERNOR:  Neil, thank you for having me  back.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Michael Dukakis made an interesting comment about, the debt is  growing.  Of course, it grows under, it seems, Democratic and Republican  presidents alike.  And it does seem to be choking us now.</p><p>What do you make of that?  And do you worry about it?</p><p>JINDAL:  You know, Neil, I actually do.  That was one of the few, maybe the  only times, I have actually agreed with Governor Dukakis.</p><p>I do think we have got to get control of the debt.  Look, I think President  Trump has done many good things.  He said he was going to cut taxes.  He  did that.  He said he was an appoint conservative judges.  He did that.</p><p>He said he was going to rip up the Iran nuclear deal.  He did that.  He  said he was going to stand with Israel.  He did that.</p><p>One of the things that hasn't been done yet, though, the Republicans in  D.C. have yet to really get spending under control.  They haven't cut  spending.  They haven't balanced the budget.  So I think that's a valid  concern.</p><p>But, overall, it -- and it's an important concern.  I'm not trivializing  that.  And it's funny to see Democrats all of a sudden get religion on  deficits, after eight years of record-setting debt under President Obama.</p><p>And so certainly that's a valid criticism.  But going into this election, I  think overall the Republicans have done a great job, and they deserve to be  reelected.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Are you troubled, though, that neither party seems to be  addressing this spiraling debt, and the fact that, with interest rates  rising, it's only spiraling more?</p><p>JINDAL:  Absolutely.</p><p>Look, I understand why it's good politics for President Trump -- and he  said this as a candidate -- he said he wasn't going to look at or touch the  entitlement programs.  I don't think that's sustainable.</p><p>I think they have to be reformed going forward.  I'm a strong supporter of  premium support within the Medicare program.  I do think getting the  economy growing is a strong part of balancing the budget.</p><p>And he's doing that.  President Obama had defined a new normal, where 2  percent growth was seemed to be the best we could do.  We didn't have real  wage growth.  And President Trump campaigned and said, we could get back  closer to 4 percent.</p><p>And we're on the way to doing that.  So I think stronger economic growth is  a big part of balancing the budget.  But we have got to cut spending.  Part  of that is entitlement spending.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think Republicans should embrace that more forcefully,  though?</p><p>Do you think, just like Democrats look the other way at some of their pet  programs and all, that everyone should get on board with curtailing at  least the growth in entitlements, and maybe grandfather in benefits for  those closer to retirement age, but change them, raise them in other areas,  either for Social Security, Medicare, but that that's got to be done?</p><p>JINDAL:  Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And there's some political risk to that, but there's greater risk  to the country if you don't do it.</p><p>JINDAL:  Absolutely.</p><p>And look, to his credit, Paul Ryan championed that.  And there are  Republicans in Congress that have championed that.  And, again, I  understand politically why Republicans don't want to do that.  It's always  -- it's not very popular in the short-term.</p><p>We have got to do it.  If we don't do it, in the longer run, you're going  to have Democrats trying to...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, Donald Trump doesn't want to do it.  He did not want to  touch Social Security.</p><p>Now, that might change in the future.  Do you think he should consider it?  </p><p>JINDAL:  Well, look, I think it'd be better for the country.  </p><p>I get the political cost.  But the reality is, I think, the earlier we act,  the easier it is to do modest reforms.  I think you're right.  We need to  grandfather people that are near retirement</p><p>I think you can do it.  If you do it now, we're not talking about cutting  these programs.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p>JINDAL:  We're talking about slowing down their growth rates.</p><p>And you can do it with competition.  And, for example, in Medicare, give  seniors more choices and more efficient private health care plans.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Governor, we have a lot of races, the governorships, up for grabs,  36 of them.  Republicans are thought to be in danger of maybe losing 10 10  of those races.  So, it could be more even. </p><p>That obviously says a lot about the Census Bureau and how it goes about its  business, what rewards are handed out in the next election.  </p><p>Are you worried for your party?  </p><p>JINDAL:  Well, look, I think governor's races are incredibly important.  </p><p>Part of this is, we had an incredible run four years ago.  We had a record  number of Republicans in office in the state capitals.  But you're right.   Not only are they important for political reasons, like the census and the  presidential race.  </p><p>From a policy perspective, when you think about health care policy, whether  the states expand Medicaid, whether they put work requirements in Medicaid,  whether they reform welfare, whether they cut taxes, whether they -- all  these decisions get made at the state level, whether it's -- you enforce  and implement state level religious liberty laws.  </p><p>And so these are important elections.  I think, oftentimes, they get  overlooked.  Everybody is focused on the Senate and the congressional  races.</p><p>So, I do think these are important races.  I know you were looking at  Georgia recently.  Look, those -- you have got two stark contrasts.  You  have got a far left liberal Democrat running against a pretty conservative  Republican.</p><p>So, these aren't just differences in personalities.  These are  fundamentally different approaches.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we will see how they settle it all out.  </p><p>Governor, it's always a pleasure.  Thank you very, very much. </p><p>JINDAL:  Thank you, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.</p><p>For Main Street and Wall Street, it all comes together, which is why FOX  Business Network is all night together on this.</p><p>Our biggest stars, reporters, anchors looking at the financial and the  political fallout of all of this, a one-stop shop where you can gauge later  on foreign market reaction to whatever happens, our own futures market  reaction to whatever happens, from all angles, on FOX Business.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Who's taking them?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil Cavuto.  And this is \"Your World.\"  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we are all over this country with AFL-CIO's Richard Trumka in  Washington how big labor could be voting, legendary football coach Lou  Holtz in Indiana on why Donald Trump has him rallying.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis on what today says  about 2020 and where that is heading.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And our own market pros on whether this election will have investors buying  or selling.  </p><p>We begin with Mike Tobin in Greenwood, Indiana, a state that is already  seeing very heavy turnout -- Mike.</p><p>MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Very heavy turnout.</p><p>They joined to jump in here in Johnson County, massive turnout.  They did  have a computer problem earlier in the day.  But Ron Goins, the inspector,  the elections inspector here at Johnson County, says it does slow down the  process of intaking people and getting them a ballot.  It didn't impact the  integrity of the vote.  </p><p>We have heard some people complain about the long lines and that's just  because of the massive turnout.  Goins tells us it has been this way all  through early voting.  He anticipates that the numbers this time will just  absolutely eclipse the turnout numbers from the 2016 general election.  </p><p>The candidates have largely been laying low today.  Mike Braun was on  social media, encouraging Republicans to text their friends and get out the  vote.  Senator Joe Donnelly, the incumbent, has also been on social media.   He posted a phone number for people to call if they need a ride to get out  to the polls.  </p><p>But the people here in Johnson County say that politics, this Senate race  have been the primary topics of conversation in just about every social  setting, but they say it's not about Braun or Donnelly, this is a  referendum on Donald Trump -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Mike, thank you very, very much. </p><p>To Florida right now.  A couple of hotly contested races going on there,  one in the Senate, of course, incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson, Republican  Governor Rick Scott in the battle of their lives.</p><p>Peter Doocy in Naples, Florida, with the very latest.</p><p>Hey, Peter.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, I just walked -- I just watched  as a young man walked by.  He was on the phone telling somebody on the  other end that he showed up here and was told he was ineligible to vote,  which was very frustrating to him because he was telling this person on the  phone he did six tours of combat and wasn't able to vote here in Naples  today.</p><p>There's just a ton of interest and attention this race.  The Senate contest  pits three-term Democratic incumbent Senator Bill Nelson against a two-term  Republican Governor Rick Scott.  Nelson's campaign about protecting the  environment and protecting Obamacare.  Scott's campaign more about the  economy and having a direct line to Donald Trump.  </p><p>They have both won statewide before, but they both might have their fates  sealed by candidates who have not, and that is the gubernatorial  candidates.  Ron DeSantis, the Republican, came from behind and won the  primary with President Trump's endorsement.  Andrew Gillum, the Democrat,  won the primary with Bernie Sanders' endorsement.</p><p>The question is, will either have them be a boost or a drag to the Senate  candidate from their party, Neil?</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Peter, thank you very, very much. </p><p>Well, this could be a tale of two evenings here.  In the Senate, things  could be wrapped up relatively early, or at least we will have an idea  relatively early.  The House, well, that's a whole 'nother matter.</p><p>To FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on why that could be the case.</p><p>Hey, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p>This is going to be our evening ahead.  We're just going to do the follow- the-sun programming, but less than three hours away until the first polls  close.  So we want to take you through some of the key races.  </p><p>Most of the ones we will show you will be Senate races.  But the first post  closing 6:00 p.m. in Kentucky, parts of Indiana.  Of course, as we know  from Indiana, the only state with two time zones.  Health care a huge issue  in that state.  Democrat Joe Donnelly, the incumbent, trying to hold off  GOP challenger businessman Mike Braun, a close race and some say could  really start to shift some of the weight in the Senate.  </p><p>So, 7:00 p.m., we're going to be more focused on Indiana, as we mentioned,  of course, Georgia as well, that gubernatorial race a little bit more  interesting than any others.  We know Secretary of State Brian Kemp really  facing off against the progressive former State Rep. Stacey Abrams.</p><p>And 8:00 p.m. Eastern time, you're going to see all where the polls start  closing there.  Basically, this is the largest batch of states that are  going to begin to be closing, including eight states with super competitive  Senate races.  </p><p>So you can see, obviously, all of the ones lit up here.  We're going to be  most focused on a Florida and also Missouri.  So you have in Florida, of  course, incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson trying to hold off the term-limit  GOP Governor Rick Scott.</p><p>And then in Missouri, you have the state A.G., Josh Hawley, vs. the  Democrat incumbent, Claire McCaskill.</p><p>Now, 9:00 p.m., as we sort of go along again, all of these are in Eastern  time, really going to be most focused on Texas, Arizona and North Dakota as  well.  So in Arizona, Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema against Congresswoman  Martha McSally.  This is airtight, from everybody that we have been  speaking to.</p><p>North Dakota, you have, of course, the incumbent, Heidi Heitkamp, trying to  fend off Congressman Kevin Cramer.  And then in Texas, the most expensive  Senate race ever, $100 million, not even counting super PACs, incumbent, of  course, you have Senator Ted Cruz, Beto O'Rourke.</p><p>I want to mention as well, for Mr. O'Rourke, a lot of his money is coming  from Silicon Valley employees, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple.  By  11:00 p.m., not surprisingly, Neil, we will find ourselves on the West  Coast.</p><p>And out there, I just want to highlight actually two House races.  So we  will pull those contests up.  You're going to see here for the Golden State  two of these areas which are really not only tight.  CA-10, we will pull  that first one up.  </p><p>But one of the other reasons that we're following the Harder vs. Denham  contest is because this area actually had voted for Hillary Clinton in the  2016 presidential election.  Same can be said for Rouda vs. Rohrabacher.</p><p>And we know from this area even geographically not a huge surprise there,  Neil, that immigration is going to be a huge issue in both of those areas.</p><p>Neil, we will be here.  Long night.  That's -- those results back in a few  hours for us -- back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You had to rub that in, didn't you?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Deirdre, thank you very, very much, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p>All right, I want to take a look at the corner of Wall and Broad today.  We  were up a lot on the Dow today.  Now, there is a sort of a consensus  building -- always dangerous, I hasten to add -- that we're going to see  slip government after this midterm election, that is the House under one  party's control, Democrats, and then the Senate under the continued  Republican control.  Of course, the White House would remain under  Republican control.</p><p>And markets like that.  Now, the consensus could be very, very wrong and it  doesn't pan out that way.  There are other variables here.  </p><p>Let's get the read on how all of that would sort out for the investment  community with my buddy David Asman, the host of \"Bulls &amp; Bears\" on FOX  Business Network, and market watcher Alan Knuckman.</p><p>By the way, David, looking at this and these crosscurrents here, the first  thing you have to ask is, that consensus for split government, markets like  that, don't they?</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Markets generally prefer split government.</p><p>Gridlock is a dirty word in the world of politics.  But markets find it to  be enlightening because it means that they can't get stuff done.  They  can't spend more government money.  That tends to leave a lot of Wall  Street and private sector off the hook.  </p><p>I should just say, but no matter what happens tomorrow, there have been 18  midterm elections since 1946, 18, and in every single one, 18 out of 18,  the 12 months following that midterm election, the markets are generally  up.</p><p>So I think we might have some pretty good times coming in the next 12  months.  Lord knows what's going to happen beyond that.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, I can't even go to the next 12 minutes.</p><p>But, Alan, I'm curious.  When you look at this, you always have to brace  yourself for surprises and whether there's an unexpected development.  </p><p>ALAN KNUCKMAN, BULLS EYE OPTION:  Right.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Let's say the Republicans were to hang on to the House, and then  they continue to run the table with all the levers of government under  their control.  What do you think?  </p><p>KNUCKMAN:  Well, I'm of the opinion that optimism wins.  And you have got  to be very optimistic.  </p><p>Obviously, David just went through that fantastic number that every single  time a year after the midterm, the market was higher.  So you have got to  put this in perspective.  We're on a very strong upward path.  We bounced  25 percent since the Trump election, but you can total up.  It's 311  percent since that 2009 low.</p><p>I don't think this changes anything.  Again, corporations are going to do  well in any political environment.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, David, one of the things that comes up a lot is the idea  that there's a possibility that the Democrats have a surge, and in that  surge, they might just take the Senate.  It's one of the less likely  variables here, but then what?</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, if they do, or if it's just the House -- but certainly if  it's both -- President Trump is going to have to be a consummate deal  maker.</p><p>And there are certain deals that he wants to make with Democrats,  infrastructure.  Remember, there's $1.5 million in infrastructure spending  that the president and Democrats want to do together.  There's also the  question of regulation.</p><p>And the president fancies himself as a deregulator.  He's done a terrific  job in deregulating the private sector.  However, he wants to put more  regulations on things like pharmaceuticals, like drug prices.  He wants to  have price controls.  Democrats wants price controls.</p><p>That could worry Wall Street quite a bit.  And there's also concern about  the banks and big tech.  Remember, he's talked about breaking up some of  the biggest high-tech companies.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Alan, I know you're looking at the half-full glass here.</p><p>Regardless of how the midterms turn out, I'm wondering whether all the  other items that are backing up like planes at La Guardia are an issue.   That is the upcoming G20 meeting between our president and the leader of  China.  We might have a Mueller report before this month is out.  </p><p>The Federal Reserve busy with another meeting, and while that isn't the one  that it's expected to raise rates, it could telegraph that.  What do you  think?</p><p>KNUCKMAN:  It's going to be December.</p><p>Well, there's always got to be concerns and worries.  Otherwise, this  wouldn't be any fun.  </p><p>So, we have gotten through every one of those.  But I'm a big believer that  global growth -- growth is driving it.  It's not just us.  If you look at  unemployment wrong world, Canada is at 40-year lows, Japan's at 2.3  percent, Germany's at the lowest unemployment level ever.</p><p>So around the world, everybody's doing well.  And I think that's very much  a positive.  We have been able to get through all these -- these woes and  worries in the past.  I look for that to happen once again.  </p><p>Let me point out.  Let's go back in the way-back machine, when we had a  split government.  If you go back to Reagan, we had a split government and  everybody can probably agree that we did pretty well economically at that  time.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, we forgot, in '82, when the Republicans lost a lot of seats - - I think 27 -- of course, the market a year later was up another 19  percent, right?</p><p>ASMAN:  Can I bring it back home, though, just for a second?</p><p>Because beyond the congressional races and Senate races, there a lot of  initiatives on the ballot and a lot of them have to do with taxes.  They're  18 states that have initiatives involved in taxes.  Colorado, which has a  flat tax for income tax, they want to change it into a five-bracket tax,  almost double -- double the high end of that.</p><p>State of Washington has a carbon tax.  There is a whole bunch of taxes.   And those should be looked at, because they could affect business,  certainly on a local level, to a great extent, and on a personal level.   You could be paying thousands of dollars more or less, depending on how you  vote.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, and where you live.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you, David, final word on that.  </p><p>Alan Knuckman, I want to thank you.  </p><p>KNUCKMAN:  Thank you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, and when we come back here, besides looking at some of  the money issues at stake here, I want you to picture this, the AFL-CIO  chief, Richard Trumka, and the legendary football coach and Notre Dame  sensation Lou Holtz.  What do they have in common?</p><p>We will explain after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, you're looking to live right now at a polling place saying  in Greenwood, Indiana, the president campaigning in the Hoosier State just  yesterday.</p><p>He was joined by college football Hall of Fame sensation the coach Lou  Holtz.</p><p>Lou Holtz joins us right now on the phone.</p><p>Coach, very good have you.</p><p>LOU HOLTZ, HALL OF FAME FOOTBALL COACH:  Well, thank you, Neil.  Pleasure  to be with you.  I watch your show all the time.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm very honored by that, coach.</p><p>I mean, obviously, you have been a close friend of the president's long,  long before he was president.  And then you carry considerable clout in  your state and elsewhere.  That was a very early and welcome endorsement.  </p><p>And I'm wondering whether you -- the crowd you saw and the enthusiasm you  saw is going to translate in that state to a Democratic senator maybe  losing?  </p><p>HOLTZ:  Well, that's very possible, because Joe Donnelly's a very popular  individually.</p><p>He is also a Notre Dame alum, which put me in an awkward position.   However, the main point I made to the people and enthusiasm of the crowd,  there were 12,000 people there.  They were jammed in, enthusiasm.  And  there were an awful lot of young people there and thousands outside.  </p><p>But the point I made is, President Trump needs some help.  Everybody is  ganging up on him.  You got the media, you got the Democrats, you got the  academicians.  We have to send people there.  </p><p>Joe Donnelly is a wonderful individual, I'm sure.  But we need people there  that are going to support the Supreme Court justices, going to support his  thing.  And Notre Dame is undefeated this year.</p><p>And, as I said to the crowd, you want to go back to a couple years ago, we  won four games and lost eight?  No.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOLTZ:  Then why would we want to move -- why would we want to go back?  </p><p>Every time I turned around a winning situation -- or a losing situation,  nobody ever said, coach, we like it better when we are losing.</p><p>But this is the mentality of the media.  So, I believe in what he's doing.   And I supported him, endorsed him before he got the nomination.</p><p>And I spoke at a Tampa bay rally the day and the Saturday before the  election in 2016.  The enthusiasm was great.  Nobody gave him a chance, but  I thought, good lord, everywhere I go, it is this way.  And maybe it is  going to translate into the midterms, but history goes against it.  We will  have to wait and see.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, it's early on.  I like how you can relate football and Notre  Dame and to the state of the economy.  That is pretty clever.  </p><p>But, Coach, I'm curious about what you make of Senator Donnelly, who is  very popular in the state.  The president has made multiple visits to  Indiana.  He was still doing quite well, that is Senator Donnelly.  </p><p>Would you be disappointed or worried for Indiana, then, given your bias and  preference that he go, if he were to stay in there?  Because he has very  shrewdly incorporated a lot of views of the president and speaks obviously  very highly of you, so he walks a tight line and a rope in a state that  requires him to.  </p><p>HOLTZ:  This isn't a case of having good vs. bad.  </p><p>I think they are both very good candidates.  I just know that Braun will  support the president.  I can't say that about any Democrat.  The Democrats  will say one thing, but when they get in, there were 40-something people  that were up for the House on the Democratic side who said, we will not  vote for Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p>But I happen to know that you take a vow, that when you go in there and you  are elected, you are going to vote for Nancy Pelosi.  And he will back  Schumer.  Joe Manchin voted for Kavanaugh, but he only did it after the  nomination was secured with Collins' vote.</p><p>And that is like jumping on.  But I just think that President Trump needs  help there.  We have a lot of Republicans that are never-Trumpers, but look  to what has happened to the economy.  Look what has happened to this  country.  Look what has happened. He's caring about the people.  </p><p>We're worried about the caravan people coming in.  What is going to end up  -- how about the homeless people on the street?  Go into San Francisco.  Go  into Denver.  Go look at the poverty we have there.  Let's take care of our  people first.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, coach, it's always good having you.  You are doing well  coming out of your shell, by the way, so keep working on that.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOLTZ:  Well, Neil, you can mark me down as undecided.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, coach, thank you.  A real honor talking to you.  I  appreciate it.  </p><p>HOLTZ:  Always a pleasure, Neil.  Bye.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right. </p><p>In the meantime, we have another tight race in Missouri, right?  This is a  pickup that Republicans are salivating over, but you got get behind those  numbers, which we plan to do after this.</p><p>Then the AFL-CIO president, Richard Trumka, on why this president might be  helping unions a little bit more than some of his Republican predecessors,  but apparently not enough for Richard -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI:  This race is just way too close to  call.  So we don't know what's going to happen, but we feel great about the  effort.  </p><p>JOSH HAWLEY (R), MISSOURI SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  We're excited.  Just  voted, and on to victory tonight.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Missouri, that's a key Senate battle Republicans are  hoping for a pickup, defeating, they hope, incumbent Senator Claire  McCaskill.</p><p>Republican challenger Josh Hawley, both of them voting today.  Both very  confident things will work out their way.  </p><p>This is a state that Donald Trump, by the way, won by about 18 points.  </p><p>Kristin Fisher is there with the latest on how it's all going down in Saint  Louis. </p><p>Hey, Kristin.  </p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.  </p><p>Well, we have seen a steady stream of voters at this polling place just  outside Saint Louis all day today.  And when the Democratic incumbent,  Senator Claire McCaskill, voted here just a few hours ago, she said that  she thought this race was still too close to call.  </p><p>She's been trying to make the case that she's not too liberal to represent  a state that President Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016.  But her  opponent, the state's Republican attorney general, Josh Hawley, says she's  still too liberal for Missouri.</p><p>And President Trump helped him make that case at a rally last night in Cape  Girardeau.  Now, blue-collar Missourians, they overwhelmingly voted for  President Trump in 2016 by nearly 20 points.  But they also drove the  defeat of the state's right-to-work Proposition A just this past August.  </p><p>So one of the big questions, Neil, is, how are these union members in the  state going to vote today?  That could be a big driver in who wins this  race now, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you very much, Kristin.  </p><p>And I'm going to raise that point with the AFL-CIO president Richard  Trumka, who joins us right now.</p><p>Richard, I'm looking at some of these union numbers that have picked up,  including unemployment levels among union families that are about the  lowest they have been in 20 years.  And I'm wondering why you would be  against the president of the United States, if he's helping you provide  those numbers.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AFL-CIO:  Well, Neil, this president of the  United States isn't on the election ballot today.  </p><p>There's a number of people that support workers and those that don't.   We're supporting people like Claire McCaskill, who stands up for us, Josh  Hawley, who supports right-to-work.</p><p>So we're supporting those candidates that support working people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMKA:  And, by the way, we have about 1,500...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  But I just want to be clear.</p><p>The working families and all of that, if that's happening under Republican  leadership, you're -- you're not buying that this is sustainable beyond the  president?  Is that what you're saying?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I don't think that the president's on the ballot today.  </p><p>Claire McCaskill is on the ballot, and Josh Hawley's on the ballot in  Missouri.  And they're going to say, who's the best for us?  It's clearly  Claire McCaskill.</p><p>Josh Hawley is out of step.  He supports right-to-work that that state  rejected by better than two to one.  And so it's an election about them.   And she will win tonight.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, so if we fast-forward to 2020, the president's up for  reelection, and you do and have in prior interviews credited the president  with helping unions doing more, certainly than other Republicans have,  would you endorse him?  </p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, I'm not going to get there until 2020.  </p><p>We have an election tonight to take care of, Neil.  Look, we will see what  he did.  We will judge what he did to help workers and what he did to hurt  workers.  And if he did more to help workers and he didn't -- then, of  course, like every one other candidate, he will be considered, but I'm not  making that decision.  </p><p>My executive council, all my members in each one of the states help us make  that decision.  So it's not Richard's decision.  It's the membership's  decision.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, but you're also the big cheese.  I mean, this doesn't happen  without you weighing in, right?  </p><p>TRUMKA:  No, they make that decision.  They actually do.</p><p>I didn't endorse any of the candidates running today.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>So let me step back from this and understand.  Do you think things are  looking very good for the economy right now?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, it depends on where you sit.</p><p>If you're a worker, things are still not good for the economy.  We have had  three decades of flat wages.  You have had your health care go up.  You  have had your pensions attacked.  And you're about to, in many cases, even  lose health care and lose your pensions.</p><p>So it's not a very secure place for us to be.  If you're at the very top of  the heap, yes, this is a good economy for you, you're doing great.   Hopefully, we can see wages increase.  But, Neil, there's only one way  that's going to happen.  And that's to give workers a voice on the job, so  that they can negotiate with their employers and get a bigger share of the  wealth that they help produce.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  But it just seems odd that you're going for Claire  McCaskill in this case and other prominent Democrats who were there and  through that period of time, long before this president came to power.</p><p>Republicans had the run of the table in Washington.  And they might be  listening this and saying, I can't figure Trumka out here.  He's taking it  out on at least trends that in the last couple of years have looked good  for his members, looked good for union workers, record low unemployment  among young workers, Latino workers, African-American workers, union  workers, average manufacturing workers.</p><p>TRUMKA:  It's real simple.  </p><p>I speak for my members.  And I have a fidelity to one group only, and  that's to the American worker.  When their wages are flat, their health  care is under attack, and they're paying more and more and more for health  care every year, when their pensions are under attack, I'm going to stand  with them and fight whoever it is, no matter what party, that's attacking  them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  But their wages have been running at a clip.</p><p>In the latest employment report, their wages are running at a 3.1 percent  clip, the strongest it's been now in decades, and certainly over a decade.   And I'm wondering how that jibes with workers who might be disadvantaged.</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry.  I didn't understand your question.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, if things are so bad and wage growth is running at a 10- year-high clip, what's so bad for workers who have not been seeing that?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  By the way, that's for one month.  That doesn't erase the two  decades of flat wages.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, wait a minute.</p><p>Did you complain about that when it was Barack Obama as president?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  You remember when he tried to do TPP?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But you supported Barack Obama.  You supported Barack Obama. </p><p>TRUMKA:  I was against him.  Whenever he didn't do things that I agreed  with, I'm against him.  </p><p>I treat Barack Obama exactly like I treat Donald Trump.  If they do  something good for workers, I support them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Who was the last Republican you supported, Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  We're supporting Republicans right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Who?</p><p>TRUMKA:  We're supporting Brian Fitzgerald in Pennsylvania.  </p><p>We're supporting Republicans in New Jersey.  We're supporting Republicans  in Ohio.  Here's the problem, Neil.  There are precious few Republicans  that support workers.</p><p>When they support workers, we support them.  When they don't support  workers, we are not foolish.  We don't support them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I understand.</p><p>But if unemployment goes down among your workers, if their prospects  dramatically improved over the last couple of years, whether you want to  pin that to Donald Trump or not -- and I know you draw a distinction  between the president and many and his party.  </p><p>But, I mean, that's progress you were not seeing under the last president  or the president before him or the president before him, right?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, Neil -- look, Neil, this is a nice conversation.  It has  nothing to do with today's election.  </p><p>But if Donald Trump is the candidate who has helped workers the most when  it's time to endorse, our members will tell us that.  If he is not, they  will tell us that as well.  </p><p>He isn't on the ballot today.  People like Claire McCaskill are on the  ballot.  People like Bill Nelson are on the ballot.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I understand that.</p><p>But who is the last Republican presidential candidate you have supported?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I don't know.</p><p>You ask us about Republicans.  We support Republicans in every race.  If  they support workers, we support them.</p><p>The last Republican -- Mitt Romney didn't support workers.  He had a bad  record with workers.  And I can go back through the list all the way back.</p><p>Probably the last one that actually supported workers would have been  Eisenhower.  Eisenhower actually did support workers.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  And I wish we had more time.  And you have been a great guest, as  always.</p><p>But I know, when we last had it, you said my -- I don't see a political  persuasion here.  I look at how they help unions, how they help union  workers, how they help average folks.</p><p>If things are now in this economy going the way they're going, with one of  the strongest recoveries we have seen, you find precious few Republicans to  support in this environment, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  For whom?  Wait, wait, wait, Neil.  Wait, wait, wait.</p><p>Strongest recovery for whom?  Workers haven't seen that recovery yet.   Workers are seeing their health care go up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Richard, do you look at the same data I look at?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMKA:  I do.  I do, Neil.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, if you would give me a chance to explain, I will explain.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But I'm not an apologist for any side, Richard.</p><p>But do you look at the same data I do?  </p><p>TRUMKA:  I do.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Record low unemployment across every major demographic group?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I do.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And you still say not good enough?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I do.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  You had one month of wage increase, one, one quarter.  Three  decades, that doesn't wipe out.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You have had two years of improving numbers, Richard. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  In addition to that, health care -- our health care out-of-pocket  costs went up 5.9 percent last year.  They're scheduled to go up for an  individual $1,500 next year, Neil.</p><p>That's a lot of money for individuals.  So you can't pull out one statistic  and say, this is great, or one group of people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm not pulling out one statistic or another.</p><p>I'm just trying to be very, very clear.  What would it take for you to sort  of say, all right, things are better than they have been?  I mean, yes,  wages could go at a stronger clip in real inflation-adjusted terms.  They  most certainly good.  You're absolutely right about that.  </p><p>But the arc, the trend is your friend right now for union members, for  those who -- who -- many of whom attend these rallies where Donald Trump  speaks.  So, what do they see that apparently you do not?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, look, they will tell me if that's the case.  </p><p>If they want to endorse him, they will.  But we went to our members in  Ohio, we have had a conversation with them; 50 percent of those that voted  for Donald Trump have told us they're voting for Richard Cordray and for  Sherrod Brown.  That's 50 percent of the people that voted for Donald  Trump.  </p><p>So, apparently, his argument hasn't persuaded them.  They know that Richard  Cordray is better than DeWine.  And they know that Sherrod Brown is their  friend that will stick up for them.  So they're voting for them.</p><p>That's what we see in this election.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I understand.</p><p>But when they -- when they look at what's happening around them...</p><p>TRUMKA:  Do you really?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I'm taking your word for it.</p><p>So, when they look around at what's happening, and they see some of these  improvements, are you telling me that they're simply not good enough, or  that the progress on trade deals that they had argued, you had argued to me  -- now, don't -- just be careful -- and you had told me were not really  good for union members, what do they see now?  Do they like them or dislike  them?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  Neil, I know -- I know you want to make this an issue about me and  you and us and them.</p><p>But, look, that's a nonissue right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know what you're saying.</p><p>It's not about you or me or us and them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  Here's what I'm saying.  Here's what I'm saying.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm just curious, do you like the trade deals of this president?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  You did not like a lot of those trade deals.  Now, I don't know if  these newer deals he's designed are in your favor or not.  Do you like  them, or you liked the old deals better, the old trade deals better?</p><p>TRUMKA:  NAFTA, it is quite -- it's too early for us to decide whether yes  or no.</p><p>There's some improvements.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK.  </p><p>TRUMKA:  There's some places where he's digressed.  </p><p>When we know all the facts, we will make a decision.  And all the pundits  who are going crazy right now, being either gushing for it or gushing  against it, are simply wrong, because they don't have the facts yet.</p><p>We will judge it on its merit.  There are improvements in it and there are  areas where it's going backwards.  If we can enforce this agreement, if the  enforcement mechanism is there, if we can get the Mexican government to  allow wages to rise, so that there's less downward pressure on the wages in  the United States, then, yes, we will endorse that.  </p><p>If it doesn't do that, then we won't.  But it's too early for us to be able  to tell.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA:  Am I encouraged?  Wait.  Am I encouraged that we're talking about  it?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>TRUMKA:  Yes, I am encouraged.  </p><p>I'm also encouraged and proud of union members and workers across the  country, because the debate right now isn't whether we're going to have a  new NAFTA.  The debate right now is how we fix a broken one.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So, the idea and the guarantees that are supposedly in there --  and you know this far better than I -- to hire more union workers, to hire  them at wages that were not in the prior deal, do you find that promising,  or do you find it accurate, or what?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, first of all, we don't know.</p><p>We don't know how it will be enforced or what will be enforced.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>TRUMKA:  We don't know how the labor chapter will be enforced, how the  rules of origin will be enforced, or several other things.</p><p>So we need to find out that language.  If it's good, then, yes, it'll be  encouraging.  If it isn't, and we can't enforce the agreement, it doesn't  matter what the agreement says.  It's unenforceable.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK, so, finally, real quick final question.</p><p>The number -- you said you support a of number Republican candidates, but  do you have a breakdown of the percentage of Democrats you are supporting  vs. Republicans?  I would just be curious.  </p><p>TRUMKA:  No, I don't.  I don't, because we are up and down the ballot this  time far more than we have ever been.  There's a lot of local races, state  house members, state senates.</p><p>And so I don't have that.  I will be able to get you that tomorrow.</p><p>There's about 1,500 union members that are running for office on the ballot  this time.  And we're working hard to get them elected, so that they can  stand up.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>TRUMKA:  Some are Republicans.  Most are Democrats.  But some are  Republicans.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Richard, very good chatting with you.  I appreciate it.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Thanks for having me, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Richard Trumka of the AFL-CIO.</p><p>Meanwhile, to New Jersey and voters there going to the polls, closing out  what's been a very contentious and expensive Senate race between incumbent  Bob Menendez, the Republican challenger, Bob Hugin.</p><p>Let's go first to David Lee Miller in Mountainside, New Jersey, with the  latest on finally the end of what has been a very nasty race, huh?</p><p>DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Indeed, it has been, Neil.</p><p>This has been a very hard-ought battle and, as you said, a very nasty one  at times.  Democratic senator Bob Menendez is vying now for a third term as  New Jersey senator.  Although he has been considered the front-runner all  along, some analysts say that in a blue state like New Jersey, it should  have been a lock for Menendez, that he should be certain to win.  </p><p>However, victory is not certain here.  Menendez is considered vulnerable  following a corruption trial last year that although resulted in a hung  jury did tarnish his reputation.  Republican challenger Bob Hugin,  meanwhile, who has been endorsed by President Trump and who has donated to  the president's 2016 campaign and also was the chairman of his finance  committee here in New Jersey, is trying to distance himself from President  Trump, saying that he is a different kind of candidate, that he is  independent.  </p><p>Meanwhile, as voters do go to the polls, there have been many reports,  multiple reports today, Neil, of problems at polling stations, ranging from  long lines and machines that have been malfunctioning.</p><p>We expect the polls here will close in just a little under three-and-a- half-hours.  That is 8:00 local time -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  David Lee, thank you very, very much. </p><p>It's not that New Jersey has not elected its share of Republican officials.   Of course, Chris Christie is a former governor, two-term governor.  There's  a Democratic governor now.  </p><p>And, of course, before him, of course, it was Christie Todd Whitman, who  joins us right now.  </p><p>Governor, good to have you.  </p><p>CHRISTIE TODD WHITMAN (R), FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR:  Good to be with  you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  It is tough for Republicans to get elected in New Jersey.</p><p>WHITMAN:  It is.  It's a challenge.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.</p><p>WHITMAN:  We're a little bit outnumbered in the number of registered  voters.  </p><p>The only thing I will say, though, the part that's growing is the  independents.  Democrats are losing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p>Now, the Hugin-Menendez battle has been pretty sharp and very expensive.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WHITMAN:  Yes.      </p><p>CAVUTO:  What do you think of it and the kind of coverage it's been  getting?  </p><p>WHITMAN:  It's been getting a lot of coverage.  And it's exciting to see  that Bob Hugin is doing as well as he's doing.</p><p>And I think it's within the realm of possibility that he could knock off  Menendez, because Menendez has such a bad reputation, and being censured  the way was by both Republicans and Democrats, more importantly.</p><p>That's come to people's attention, even with the disparity in registration  and more Democrats.  There are still people that don't like the fact that  they have someone in office who has been censured that way and found to be  lacking ethically.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's happened on the governor's side, not so much on the Senate  side, in New Jersey to get a Republican in power there.  Why is that, you  think?</p><p>WHITMAN:  I don't know.  It's hard to say.</p><p>It's ideological.  It's because the senators go where -- they think the big  thoughts.  The governors have to deliver.  And so they're looking for  slightly different things in those two offices.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>WHITMAN:  They want someone in a governorship who they think can really  deliver on their promises, not just come up with new ideas as to how to  approach things.  </p><p>So, it's more ideological, I think, when you look at the senatorial races  than it is at the gubernatorial level.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Bob Hugin, of course, is a very rich pharmaceutical executive.   He's forked over more than $35 million of his own money presumably into  this race.  </p><p>Does he have the future if for some reason it doesn't turn out, he doesn't  win tonight?</p><p>I think, if he wants to have one, he can, absolutely, because he's been a  very credible candidate.  He's well-spoken.  He's a bright guy.  He had a  good reputation as a CEO.</p><p>Menendez has tried to attack that.  But Bob has had some very good and, I  think, forceful responses to those attacks.  So, it's been an ugly race,  unfortunately.  And we're seeing that across the country.  And that's just  not in our best interests, I don't think, in the long run.</p><p>But I do think, if he wants to have a future, he certainly could.  I don't  know, when you have spent this much of your own money, and done this, put  as much heart into it as you have...</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's a lot of money, yes.</p><p>WHITMAN:  ... whether you're going to want to come back and try to do  something else again.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Governor, thank you very, very much, Governor Christie  Todd Whitman.</p><p>We will be following that very, very closely.  </p><p>In the meantime, Georgia voting is already under way.  They're looking at  governor.  Health care is a very, very big issue there.  And that health  care keeps playing out again and again, in race after race.</p><p>The read from the former Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis  on why that is -- after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, it's not just Congress up for grabs; 36 gubernatorial  seats are on the line, including a very tight race going on in the Peach  State of Georgia between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp.</p><p>Health care a very, very big issue there, as it is across the country.  </p><p>Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta with more.  </p><p>Hey, Jonathan.  </p><p>JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.</p><p>When it comes to health care, the candidates running for governor in  Georgia could not be any more different.  You have Republican Brian Kemp,  who cast his ballot earlier today, saying that he will fight what he calls  a socialist takeover of health care.  This plays well with his conservative  base in rural parts of the state.</p><p>Democrat Stacey Abrams, on the other hand, says she wants to protect  Obamacare.  This appeals to her base in large cities.  But she's also  making the case to rural Georgians that expanding Medicare would reverse  the trend of hospital closures in less populated areas.  </p><p>Voter turnout is setting new records.  Before Election Day, more than two  million Georgians had already cast ballots, more than doubling the previous  record for early voting in a midterm election in this state.  </p><p>And then, Neil, coming back to our live shot, you can see voter turnout  today, on the Election Day, is very heavy.  The secretary of state's office  telling us voter turnout is heavy in all parts of the state -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Thank you, Jonathan, very, very much.  </p><p>The read on that enthusiasm now from former Democratic presidential  candidate Michael Dukakis, also the former Massachusetts governor.  </p><p>Governor, very good to have you.</p><p>MICHAEL DUKAKIS (D), FORMER MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR:  Neil, great to be back  with you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Same here.  </p><p>What do you make of these high turnout numbers across a broad swathe of  groups here?  </p><p>DUKAKIS:  Well, I think Donald Trump has got people pretty excited.</p><p>In many cases, they're very angry with him.  In some cases, they like him.   But I have seen it in my teaching.  As you know, I have been teaching at  Northeastern University here in Boston for the past 28 years.</p><p>And I have never seen, Neil, the kind of interest in public service that  I'm seeing on the part of my students these days.  Most of them, at least  up here, don't like Trump.  </p><p>But the important thing is that this is finally got them out seriously  thinking about serving in public life.  And I think that's great, and I  hope it continues and we can encourage it.  </p><p>But I do think this turnout tells you something.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Governor, normally, when the last ballots are counted in the  midterms, within hours, they're working on the next campaign.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  And we're expecting quite a few prominent Democrats to throw their  hat in the ring for president.</p><p>And there has been a concern among some in your party that Democrats are  driving a hard left, and it's going to hurt them.  What do you think of  that?</p><p>DUKAKIS:  That's always been a concern.</p><p>And I don't see anything unusual about it.  We're going to have an active  primary.  We're going to have a lot of candidates.  But in the last  analysis, whoever wins that nomination is going to be somebody who, in my  opinion -- don't know who it's going to be, I don't have any particular  preference -- is somebody who will work his or her way through the primary  and come out as a strong and effective nominee.  </p><p>And it'll be somebody who can appeal to a very broad cross-section of  Americans.  And we always have this discussion.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>DUKAKIS:  But in the last analysis, we end up with folks that are making a  lot of sense, and I think in this case will.</p><p>And I think we're going to get rid of the guy that's in there and get  ourselves a president who really reflects what America is all about.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  People can bicker over that, Governor.</p><p>But I am curious what you make of what could be a crowded field.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren and this whole DNA, Native American testing and everything  else, what did you think of all that?  </p><p>DUKAKIS:  Well, I think the whole thing is kind of silly.  </p><p>I don't like -- I'm not a fan of Trump's, needless to say.  He's an  insulting guy and he's somebody who I think is pretty disagreeable all the  time.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, that shocks me.  I thought you liked him, but go ahead.</p><p>DUKAKIS:  Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DUKAKIS:  But this Pocahontas stuff, what's the matter with this guy?  He's  the president of the United States.</p><p>We have serious issues, both here and abroad.  And this kind of stuff, I  think, well, it reflects basically the kind of racism that this guy seems  to stand for.</p><p>I mean, is there any group, any minority that he likes?  We're all  immigrants.  My parents came over here.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But do you think it was dumb of her to do it, though, Governor?</p><p>Do you think for her to go ahead and do that and try to satisfy that issue  or resolve it, that she just created a bigger one, and might have doomed  her chances to be your party's nominee?</p><p>DUKAKIS:  I don't think so.</p><p>But, look, she's -- I know her well.  I admire her greatly.  I worked hard  to help her get elected to the Senate.  And I'm proud of that.  And she's  got to make judgments.  We all have to in a campaign like this, or in a  situation like this.</p><p>And I thought it was a reasonable thing to do.  But it's -- really, isn't  this so silly?  I mean, the question is, what kind of country do we want?   What kind of future do we want?  </p><p>And let's knock off this insulting stuff.  I mean, I just can't stand it.   And I don't think the American people can stand it, which is one reason why  I think the results tonight are going to be pretty good.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, we don't know.  And you could be right on that.  </p><p>But are you surprised, Governor, the economy is doing as well as it is?   Now, Barack Obama claims credit for that, that it started with him.  And he  might or might not be right.  But it's certainly picked up momentum under  President Trump.  </p><p>And I'm just curious how you reconcile that with your personal opinions of  the president.  </p><p>DUKAKIS:  Well, first look, we were in terrible shape under the last  Republican administration, in terrible shape.  The country was floundering  around badly when Obama got elected.</p><p>And it's pretty obvious what happened here, Neil.  I mean, he and the work  he did and the first Democratic Congress had everything to do with the fact  that we came out of that terrible, terrible situation.</p><p>And by the time he left office, the economy was in pretty good shape.  In  fact, it was growing faster than it has been growing at least in one of the  periods that Trump has been governing.</p><p>So the notion that Trump somehow came into this terrible situation and  turned it around is nonsense.  This economy was in damn good shape when  Barack Obama left it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  To your point, it was certainly in a lot better shape than the...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DUKAKIS:  Wait a second.  Look...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think that that job growth, the complexion of those jobs,  Governor, is better than they were, that pay is going up, unemployment  levels among all sorts of groups is at record lows?</p><p>Does that surprise you?  </p><p>DUKAKIS:  Neil, let me tell you what bothers me.</p><p>We're now heading for a $1 trillion annual budget deficit.  Now, I'm  supposed to be a liberal, but I used to describe myself, as you will  recall, as a liberal who could count.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DUKAKIS:  And I was a governor who had to balance budgets.</p><p>Where are we going with all this?  A trillion dollars worth or red ink on  an annual basis at a time when we're at full employment?  I mean, this is  preposterous.  And it's very serious.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But we had $10 trillion added to our debt right in the last  president, right?</p><p>DUKAKIS:  Well, that's true, because he inherited an economy, it was in a  shambles, and had to revive it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But it's a bipartisan problem, right?  It's a bipartisan mess,  right?</p><p>DUKAKIS:  No, this is not a bipartisan problem.</p><p>When you cut taxes mostly for the wealthy by billions and billions of  dollars at a time you're in full employment, that's terrible economic  policy, in my judgment.  Terrible.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we shall see.</p><p>DUKAKIS:  This is a time when we should be getting ourselves back in shape  and getting the economy in shape and getting the budget in shape.  And  we're not doing it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  All right.  I will put you down as a maybe on Donald  Trump, Governor.</p><p>It's always good having you.  Continued good luck with your teachings.   Good seeing you again.</p><p>DUKAKIS:  Great to chat with you, Neil.  Thanks.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>DUKAKIS:  Really appreciate it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, the read from former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal  after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, you just heard the read from a former Democratic  governor on what hurts our country and who gets credit for the improvement  in the economy in our country.</p><p>Fair and balanced now, the read from a former Republican governor of  Louisiana, of course, former presidential candidate as well Bobby Jindal.</p><p>Governor, good to have thank you.</p><p>BOBBY JINDAL (R), FORMER LOUISIANA GOVERNOR:  Neil, thank you for having me  back.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Michael Dukakis made an interesting comment about, the debt is  growing.  Of course, it grows under, it seems, Democratic and Republican  presidents alike.  And it does seem to be choking us now.</p><p>What do you make of that?  And do you worry about it?</p><p>JINDAL:  You know, Neil, I actually do.  That was one of the few, maybe the  only times, I have actually agreed with Governor Dukakis.</p><p>I do think we have got to get control of the debt.  Look, I think President  Trump has done many good things.  He said he was going to cut taxes.  He  did that.  He said he was an appoint conservative judges.  He did that.</p><p>He said he was going to rip up the Iran nuclear deal.  He did that.  He  said he was going to stand with Israel.  He did that.</p><p>One of the things that hasn't been done yet, though, the Republicans in  D.C. have yet to really get spending under control.  They haven't cut  spending.  They haven't balanced the budget.  So I think that's a valid  concern.</p><p>But, overall, it -- and it's an important concern.  I'm not trivializing  that.  And it's funny to see Democrats all of a sudden get religion on  deficits, after eight years of record-setting debt under President Obama.</p><p>And so certainly that's a valid criticism.  But going into this election, I  think overall the Republicans have done a great job, and they deserve to be  reelected.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Are you troubled, though, that neither party seems to be  addressing this spiraling debt, and the fact that, with interest rates  rising, it's only spiraling more?</p><p>JINDAL:  Absolutely.</p><p>Look, I understand why it's good politics for President Trump -- and he  said this as a candidate -- he said he wasn't going to look at or touch the  entitlement programs.  I don't think that's sustainable.</p><p>I think they have to be reformed going forward.  I'm a strong supporter of  premium support within the Medicare program.  I do think getting the  economy growing is a strong part of balancing the budget.</p><p>And he's doing that.  President Obama had defined a new normal, where 2  percent growth was seemed to be the best we could do.  We didn't have real  wage growth.  And President Trump campaigned and said, we could get back  closer to 4 percent.</p><p>And we're on the way to doing that.  So I think stronger economic growth is  a big part of balancing the budget.  But we have got to cut spending.  Part  of that is entitlement spending.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think Republicans should embrace that more forcefully,  though?</p><p>Do you think, just like Democrats look the other way at some of their pet  programs and all, that everyone should get on board with curtailing at  least the growth in entitlements, and maybe grandfather in benefits for  those closer to retirement age, but change them, raise them in other areas,  either for Social Security, Medicare, but that that's got to be done?</p><p>JINDAL:  Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And there's some political risk to that, but there's greater risk  to the country if you don't do it.</p><p>JINDAL:  Absolutely.</p><p>And look, to his credit, Paul Ryan championed that.  And there are  Republicans in Congress that have championed that.  And, again, I  understand politically why Republicans don't want to do that.  It's always  -- it's not very popular in the short-term.</p><p>We have got to do it.  If we don't do it, in the longer run, you're going  to have Democrats trying to...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, Donald Trump doesn't want to do it.  He did not want to  touch Social Security.</p><p>Now, that might change in the future.  Do you think he should consider it?  </p><p>JINDAL:  Well, look, I think it'd be better for the country.  </p><p>I get the political cost.  But the reality is, I think, the earlier we act,  the easier it is to do modest reforms.  I think you're right.  We need to  grandfather people that are near retirement</p><p>I think you can do it.  If you do it now, we're not talking about cutting  these programs.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p>JINDAL:  We're talking about slowing down their growth rates.</p><p>And you can do it with competition.  And, for example, in Medicare, give  seniors more choices and more efficient private health care plans.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Governor, we have a lot of races, the governorships, up for grabs,  36 of them.  Republicans are thought to be in danger of maybe losing 10 10  of those races.  So, it could be more even. </p><p>That obviously says a lot about the Census Bureau and how it goes about its  business, what rewards are handed out in the next election.  </p><p>Are you worried for your party?  </p><p>JINDAL:  Well, look, I think governor's races are incredibly important.  </p><p>Part of this is, we had an incredible run four years ago.  We had a record  number of Republicans in office in the state capitals.  But you're right.   Not only are they important for political reasons, like the census and the  presidential race.  </p><p>From a policy perspective, when you think about health care policy, whether  the states expand Medicaid, whether they put work requirements in Medicaid,  whether they reform welfare, whether they cut taxes, whether they -- all  these decisions get made at the state level, whether it's -- you enforce  and implement state level religious liberty laws.  </p><p>And so these are important elections.  I think, oftentimes, they get  overlooked.  Everybody is focused on the Senate and the congressional  races.</p><p>So, I do think these are important races.  I know you were looking at  Georgia recently.  Look, those -- you have got two stark contrasts.  You  have got a far left liberal Democrat running against a pretty conservative  Republican.</p><p>So, these aren't just differences in personalities.  These are  fundamentally different approaches.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we will see how they settle it all out.  </p><p>Governor, it's always a pleasure.  Thank you very, very much. </p><p>JINDAL:  Thank you, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.</p><p>For Main Street and Wall Street, it all comes together, which is why FOX  Business Network is all night together on this.</p><p>Our biggest stars, reporters, anchors looking at the financial and the  political fallout of all of this, a one-stop shop where you can gauge later  on foreign market reaction to whatever happens, our own futures market  reaction to whatever happens, from all angles, on FOX Business.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Who's taking them?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we are all over this country with AFL-CIO's Richard Trumka in Washington how big labor could be voting, legendary football coach Lou Holtz in Indiana on why Donald Trump has him rallying.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis on what today says about 2020 and where that is heading.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And our own market pros on whether this election will have investors buying or selling.</p><p>We begin with Mike Tobin in Greenwood, Indiana, a state that is already seeing very heavy turnout -- Mike.</p><p>MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Very heavy turnout.</p><p>They joined to jump in here in Johnson County, massive turnout. They did have a computer problem earlier in the day. But Ron Goins, the inspector, the elections inspector here at Johnson County, says it does slow down the process of intaking people and getting them a ballot. It didn't impact the integrity of the vote.</p><p>We have heard some people complain about the long lines and that's just because of the massive turnout. Goins tells us it has been this way all through early voting. He anticipates that the numbers this time will just absolutely eclipse the turnout numbers from the 2016 general election.</p><p>The candidates have largely been laying low today. Mike Braun was on social media, encouraging Republicans to text their friends and get out the vote. Senator Joe Donnelly, the incumbent, has also been on social media. He posted a phone number for people to call if they need a ride to get out to the polls.</p><p>But the people here in Johnson County say that politics, this Senate race have been the primary topics of conversation in just about every social setting, but they say it's not about Braun or Donnelly, this is a referendum on Donald Trump -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Mike, thank you very, very much.</p><p>To Florida right now. A couple of hotly contested races going on there, one in the Senate, of course, incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson, Republican Governor Rick Scott in the battle of their lives.</p><p>Peter Doocy in Naples, Florida, with the very latest.</p><p>Hey, Peter.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, I just walked -- I just watched as a young man walked by. He was on the phone telling somebody on the other end that he showed up here and was told he was ineligible to vote, which was very frustrating to him because he was telling this person on the phone he did six tours of combat and wasn't able to vote here in Naples today.</p><p>There's just a ton of interest and attention this race. The Senate contest pits three-term Democratic incumbent Senator Bill Nelson against a two-term Republican Governor Rick Scott. Nelson's campaign about protecting the environment and protecting Obamacare. Scott's campaign more about the economy and having a direct line to Donald Trump.</p><p>They have both won statewide before, but they both might have their fates sealed by candidates who have not, and that is the gubernatorial candidates. Ron DeSantis, the Republican, came from behind and won the primary with President Trump's endorsement. Andrew Gillum, the Democrat, won the primary with Bernie Sanders' endorsement.</p><p>The question is, will either have them be a boost or a drag to the Senate candidate from their party, Neil?</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Peter, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Well, this could be a tale of two evenings here. In the Senate, things could be wrapped up relatively early, or at least we will have an idea relatively early. The House, well, that's a whole 'nother matter.</p><p>To FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on why that could be the case.</p><p>Hey, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil.</p><p>This is going to be our evening ahead. We're just going to do the follow- the-sun programming, but less than three hours away until the first polls close. So we want to take you through some of the key races.</p><p>Most of the ones we will show you will be Senate races. But the first post closing 6:00 p.m. in Kentucky, parts of Indiana. Of course, as we know from Indiana, the only state with two time zones. Health care a huge issue in that state. Democrat Joe Donnelly, the incumbent, trying to hold off GOP challenger businessman Mike Braun, a close race and some say could really start to shift some of the weight in the Senate.</p><p>So, 7:00 p.m., we're going to be more focused on Indiana, as we mentioned, of course, Georgia as well, that gubernatorial race a little bit more interesting than any others. We know Secretary of State Brian Kemp really facing off against the progressive former State Rep. Stacey Abrams.</p><p>And 8:00 p.m. Eastern time, you're going to see all where the polls start closing there. Basically, this is the largest batch of states that are going to begin to be closing, including eight states with super competitive Senate races.</p><p>So you can see, obviously, all of the ones lit up here. We're going to be most focused on a Florida and also Missouri. So you have in Florida, of course, incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson trying to hold off the term-limit GOP Governor Rick Scott.</p><p>And then in Missouri, you have the state A.G., Josh Hawley, vs. the Democrat incumbent, Claire McCaskill.</p><p>Now, 9:00 p.m., as we sort of go along again, all of these are in Eastern time, really going to be most focused on Texas, Arizona and North Dakota as well. So in Arizona, Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema against Congresswoman Martha McSally. This is airtight, from everybody that we have been speaking to.</p><p>North Dakota, you have, of course, the incumbent, Heidi Heitkamp, trying to fend off Congressman Kevin Cramer. And then in Texas, the most expensive Senate race ever, $100 million, not even counting super PACs, incumbent, of course, you have Senator Ted Cruz, Beto O'Rourke.</p><p>I want to mention as well, for Mr. O'Rourke, a lot of his money is coming from Silicon Valley employees, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple. By 11:00 p.m., not surprisingly, Neil, we will find ourselves on the West Coast.</p><p>And out there, I just want to highlight actually two House races. So we will pull those contests up. You're going to see here for the Golden State two of these areas which are really not only tight. CA-10, we will pull that first one up.</p><p>But one of the other reasons that we're following the Harder vs. Denham contest is because this area actually had voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Same can be said for Rouda vs. Rohrabacher.</p><p>And we know from this area even geographically not a huge surprise there, Neil, that immigration is going to be a huge issue in both of those areas.</p><p>Neil, we will be here. Long night. That's -- those results back in a few hours for us -- back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: You had to rub that in, didn't you?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Deirdre, thank you very, very much, Deirdre Bolton.</p><p>All right, I want to take a look at the corner of Wall and Broad today. We were up a lot on the Dow today. Now, there is a sort of a consensus building -- always dangerous, I hasten to add -- that we're going to see slip government after this midterm election, that is the House under one party's control, Democrats, and then the Senate under the continued Republican control. Of course, the White House would remain under Republican control.</p><p>And markets like that. Now, the consensus could be very, very wrong and it doesn't pan out that way. There are other variables here.</p><p>Let's get the read on how all of that would sort out for the investment community with my buddy David Asman, the host of \"Bulls &amp; Bears\" on FOX Business Network, and market watcher Alan Knuckman.</p><p>By the way, David, looking at this and these crosscurrents here, the first thing you have to ask is, that consensus for split government, markets like that, don't they?</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Markets generally prefer split government.</p><p>Gridlock is a dirty word in the world of politics. But markets find it to be enlightening because it means that they can't get stuff done. They can't spend more government money. That tends to leave a lot of Wall Street and private sector off the hook.</p><p>I should just say, but no matter what happens tomorrow, there have been 18 midterm elections since 1946, 18, and in every single one, 18 out of 18, the 12 months following that midterm election, the markets are generally up.</p><p>So I think we might have some pretty good times coming in the next 12 months. Lord knows what's going to happen beyond that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, I can't even go to the next 12 minutes.</p><p>But, Alan, I'm curious. When you look at this, you always have to brace yourself for surprises and whether there's an unexpected development.</p><p>ALAN KNUCKMAN, BULLS EYE OPTION: Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: Let's say the Republicans were to hang on to the House, and then they continue to run the table with all the levers of government under their control. What do you think?</p><p>KNUCKMAN: Well, I'm of the opinion that optimism wins. And you have got to be very optimistic.</p><p>Obviously, David just went through that fantastic number that every single time a year after the midterm, the market was higher. So you have got to put this in perspective. We're on a very strong upward path. We bounced 25 percent since the Trump election, but you can total up. It's 311 percent since that 2009 low.</p><p>I don't think this changes anything. Again, corporations are going to do well in any political environment.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, David, one of the things that comes up a lot is the idea that there's a possibility that the Democrats have a surge, and in that surge, they might just take the Senate. It's one of the less likely variables here, but then what?</p><p>ASMAN: Well, if they do, or if it's just the House -- but certainly if it's both -- President Trump is going to have to be a consummate deal maker.</p><p>And there are certain deals that he wants to make with Democrats, infrastructure. Remember, there's $1.5 million in infrastructure spending that the president and Democrats want to do together. There's also the question of regulation.</p><p>And the president fancies himself as a deregulator. He's done a terrific job in deregulating the private sector. However, he wants to put more regulations on things like pharmaceuticals, like drug prices. He wants to have price controls. Democrats wants price controls.</p><p>That could worry Wall Street quite a bit. And there's also concern about the banks and big tech. Remember, he's talked about breaking up some of the biggest high-tech companies.</p><p>CAVUTO: Alan, I know you're looking at the half-full glass here.</p><p>Regardless of how the midterms turn out, I'm wondering whether all the other items that are backing up like planes at La Guardia are an issue. That is the upcoming G20 meeting between our president and the leader of China. We might have a Mueller report before this month is out.</p><p>The Federal Reserve busy with another meeting, and while that isn't the one that it's expected to raise rates, it could telegraph that. What do you think?</p><p>KNUCKMAN: It's going to be December.</p><p>Well, there's always got to be concerns and worries. Otherwise, this wouldn't be any fun.</p><p>So, we have gotten through every one of those. But I'm a big believer that global growth -- growth is driving it. It's not just us. If you look at unemployment wrong world, Canada is at 40-year lows, Japan's at 2.3 percent, Germany's at the lowest unemployment level ever.</p><p>So around the world, everybody's doing well. And I think that's very much a positive. We have been able to get through all these -- these woes and worries in the past. I look for that to happen once again.</p><p>Let me point out. Let's go back in the way-back machine, when we had a split government. If you go back to Reagan, we had a split government and everybody can probably agree that we did pretty well economically at that time.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, we forgot, in '82, when the Republicans lost a lot of seats - - I think 27 -- of course, the market a year later was up another 19 percent, right?</p><p>ASMAN: Can I bring it back home, though, just for a second?</p><p>Because beyond the congressional races and Senate races, there a lot of initiatives on the ballot and a lot of them have to do with taxes. They're 18 states that have initiatives involved in taxes. Colorado, which has a flat tax for income tax, they want to change it into a five-bracket tax, almost double -- double the high end of that.</p><p>State of Washington has a carbon tax. There is a whole bunch of taxes. And those should be looked at, because they could affect business, certainly on a local level, to a great extent, and on a personal level. You could be paying thousands of dollars more or less, depending on how you vote.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, and where you live.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you, David, final word on that.</p><p>Alan Knuckman, I want to thank you.</p><p>KNUCKMAN: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, and when we come back here, besides looking at some of the money issues at stake here, I want you to picture this, the AFL-CIO chief, Richard Trumka, and the legendary football coach and Notre Dame sensation Lou Holtz. What do they have in common?</p><p>We will explain after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you're looking to live right now at a polling place saying in Greenwood, Indiana, the president campaigning in the Hoosier State just yesterday.</p><p>He was joined by college football Hall of Fame sensation the coach Lou Holtz.</p><p>Lou Holtz joins us right now on the phone.</p><p>Coach, very good have you.</p><p>LOU HOLTZ, HALL OF FAME FOOTBALL COACH: Well, thank you, Neil. Pleasure to be with you. I watch your show all the time.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm very honored by that, coach.</p><p>I mean, obviously, you have been a close friend of the president's long, long before he was president. And then you carry considerable clout in your state and elsewhere. That was a very early and welcome endorsement.</p><p>And I'm wondering whether you -- the crowd you saw and the enthusiasm you saw is going to translate in that state to a Democratic senator maybe losing?</p><p>HOLTZ: Well, that's very possible, because Joe Donnelly's a very popular individually.</p><p>He is also a Notre Dame alum, which put me in an awkward position. However, the main point I made to the people and enthusiasm of the crowd, there were 12,000 people there. They were jammed in, enthusiasm. And there were an awful lot of young people there and thousands outside.</p><p>But the point I made is, President Trump needs some help. Everybody is ganging up on him. You got the media, you got the Democrats, you got the academicians. We have to send people there.</p><p>Joe Donnelly is a wonderful individual, I'm sure. But we need people there that are going to support the Supreme Court justices, going to support his thing. And Notre Dame is undefeated this year.</p><p>And, as I said to the crowd, you want to go back to a couple years ago, we won four games and lost eight? No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOLTZ: Then why would we want to move -- why would we want to go back?</p><p>Every time I turned around a winning situation -- or a losing situation, nobody ever said, coach, we like it better when we are losing.</p><p>But this is the mentality of the media. So, I believe in what he's doing. And I supported him, endorsed him before he got the nomination.</p><p>And I spoke at a Tampa bay rally the day and the Saturday before the election in 2016. The enthusiasm was great. Nobody gave him a chance, but I thought, good lord, everywhere I go, it is this way. And maybe it is going to translate into the midterms, but history goes against it. We will have to wait and see.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, it's early on. I like how you can relate football and Notre Dame and to the state of the economy. That is pretty clever.</p><p>But, Coach, I'm curious about what you make of Senator Donnelly, who is very popular in the state. The president has made multiple visits to Indiana. He was still doing quite well, that is Senator Donnelly.</p><p>Would you be disappointed or worried for Indiana, then, given your bias and preference that he go, if he were to stay in there? Because he has very shrewdly incorporated a lot of views of the president and speaks obviously very highly of you, so he walks a tight line and a rope in a state that requires him to.</p><p>HOLTZ: This isn't a case of having good vs. bad.</p><p>I think they are both very good candidates. I just know that Braun will support the president. I can't say that about any Democrat. The Democrats will say one thing, but when they get in, there were 40-something people that were up for the House on the Democratic side who said, we will not vote for Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>But I happen to know that you take a vow, that when you go in there and you are elected, you are going to vote for Nancy Pelosi. And he will back Schumer. Joe Manchin voted for Kavanaugh, but he only did it after the nomination was secured with Collins' vote.</p><p>And that is like jumping on. But I just think that President Trump needs help there. We have a lot of Republicans that are never-Trumpers, but look to what has happened to the economy. Look what has happened to this country. Look what has happened. He's caring about the people.</p><p>We're worried about the caravan people coming in. What is going to end up -- how about the homeless people on the street? Go into San Francisco. Go into Denver. Go look at the poverty we have there. Let's take care of our people first.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, coach, it's always good having you. You are doing well coming out of your shell, by the way, so keep working on that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOLTZ: Well, Neil, you can mark me down as undecided.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, coach, thank you. A real honor talking to you. I appreciate it.</p><p>HOLTZ: Always a pleasure, Neil. Bye.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>In the meantime, we have another tight race in Missouri, right? This is a pickup that Republicans are salivating over, but you got get behind those numbers, which we plan to do after this.</p><p>Then the AFL-CIO president, Richard Trumka, on why this president might be helping unions a little bit more than some of his Republican predecessors, but apparently not enough for Richard -- after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI: This race is just way too close to call. So we don't know what's going to happen, but we feel great about the effort.</p><p>JOSH HAWLEY (R), MISSOURI SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: We're excited. Just voted, and on to victory tonight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Missouri, that's a key Senate battle Republicans are hoping for a pickup, defeating, they hope, incumbent Senator Claire McCaskill.</p><p>Republican challenger Josh Hawley, both of them voting today. Both very confident things will work out their way.</p><p>This is a state that Donald Trump, by the way, won by about 18 points.</p><p>Kristin Fisher is there with the latest on how it's all going down in Saint Louis.</p><p>Hey, Kristin.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>Well, we have seen a steady stream of voters at this polling place just outside Saint Louis all day today. And when the Democratic incumbent, Senator Claire McCaskill, voted here just a few hours ago, she said that she thought this race was still too close to call.</p><p>She's been trying to make the case that she's not too liberal to represent a state that President Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016. But her opponent, the state's Republican attorney general, Josh Hawley, says she's still too liberal for Missouri.</p><p>And President Trump helped him make that case at a rally last night in Cape Girardeau. Now, blue-collar Missourians, they overwhelmingly voted for President Trump in 2016 by nearly 20 points. But they also drove the defeat of the state's right-to-work Proposition A just this past August.</p><p>So one of the big questions, Neil, is, how are these union members in the state going to vote today? That could be a big driver in who wins this race now, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you very much, Kristin.</p><p>And I'm going to raise that point with the AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, who joins us right now.</p><p>Richard, I'm looking at some of these union numbers that have picked up, including unemployment levels among union families that are about the lowest they have been in 20 years. And I'm wondering why you would be against the president of the United States, if he's helping you provide those numbers.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AFL-CIO: Well, Neil, this president of the United States isn't on the election ballot today.</p><p>There's a number of people that support workers and those that don't. We're supporting people like Claire McCaskill, who stands up for us, Josh Hawley, who supports right-to-work.</p><p>So we're supporting those candidates that support working people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: And, by the way, we have about 1,500...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But I just want to be clear.</p><p>The working families and all of that, if that's happening under Republican leadership, you're -- you're not buying that this is sustainable beyond the president? Is that what you're saying?</p><p>TRUMKA: I don't think that the president's on the ballot today.</p><p>Claire McCaskill is on the ballot, and Josh Hawley's on the ballot in Missouri. And they're going to say, who's the best for us? It's clearly Claire McCaskill.</p><p>Josh Hawley is out of step. He supports right-to-work that that state rejected by better than two to one. And so it's an election about them. And she will win tonight.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so if we fast-forward to 2020, the president's up for reelection, and you do and have in prior interviews credited the president with helping unions doing more, certainly than other Republicans have, would you endorse him?</p><p>TRUMKA: Look, I'm not going to get there until 2020.</p><p>We have an election tonight to take care of, Neil. Look, we will see what he did. We will judge what he did to help workers and what he did to hurt workers. And if he did more to help workers and he didn't -- then, of course, like every one other candidate, he will be considered, but I'm not making that decision.</p><p>My executive council, all my members in each one of the states help us make that decision. So it's not Richard's decision. It's the membership's decision.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, but you're also the big cheese. I mean, this doesn't happen without you weighing in, right?</p><p>TRUMKA: No, they make that decision. They actually do.</p><p>I didn't endorse any of the candidates running today.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>So let me step back from this and understand. Do you think things are looking very good for the economy right now?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, it depends on where you sit.</p><p>If you're a worker, things are still not good for the economy. We have had three decades of flat wages. You have had your health care go up. You have had your pensions attacked. And you're about to, in many cases, even lose health care and lose your pensions.</p><p>So it's not a very secure place for us to be. If you're at the very top of the heap, yes, this is a good economy for you, you're doing great. Hopefully, we can see wages increase. But, Neil, there's only one way that's going to happen. And that's to give workers a voice on the job, so that they can negotiate with their employers and get a bigger share of the wealth that they help produce.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. But it just seems odd that you're going for Claire McCaskill in this case and other prominent Democrats who were there and through that period of time, long before this president came to power.</p><p>Republicans had the run of the table in Washington. And they might be listening this and saying, I can't figure Trumka out here. He's taking it out on at least trends that in the last couple of years have looked good for his members, looked good for union workers, record low unemployment among young workers, Latino workers, African-American workers, union workers, average manufacturing workers.</p><p>TRUMKA: It's real simple.</p><p>I speak for my members. And I have a fidelity to one group only, and that's to the American worker. When their wages are flat, their health care is under attack, and they're paying more and more and more for health care every year, when their pensions are under attack, I'm going to stand with them and fight whoever it is, no matter what party, that's attacking them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But their wages have been running at a clip.</p><p>In the latest employment report, their wages are running at a 3.1 percent clip, the strongest it's been now in decades, and certainly over a decade. And I'm wondering how that jibes with workers who might be disadvantaged.</p><p>TRUMKA: I'm sorry. I didn't understand your question.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, if things are so bad and wage growth is running at a 10- year-high clip, what's so bad for workers who have not been seeing that?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: By the way, that's for one month. That doesn't erase the two decades of flat wages.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, wait a minute.</p><p>Did you complain about that when it was Barack Obama as president?</p><p>TRUMKA: I did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: You remember when he tried to do TPP?</p><p>CAVUTO: But you supported Barack Obama. You supported Barack Obama.</p><p>TRUMKA: I was against him. Whenever he didn't do things that I agreed with, I'm against him.</p><p>I treat Barack Obama exactly like I treat Donald Trump. If they do something good for workers, I support them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Who was the last Republican you supported, Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA: We're supporting Republicans right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: Who?</p><p>TRUMKA: We're supporting Brian Fitzgerald in Pennsylvania.</p><p>We're supporting Republicans in New Jersey. We're supporting Republicans in Ohio. Here's the problem, Neil. There are precious few Republicans that support workers.</p><p>When they support workers, we support them. When they don't support workers, we are not foolish. We don't support them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I understand.</p><p>But if unemployment goes down among your workers, if their prospects dramatically improved over the last couple of years, whether you want to pin that to Donald Trump or not -- and I know you draw a distinction between the president and many and his party.</p><p>But, I mean, that's progress you were not seeing under the last president or the president before him or the president before him, right?</p><p>TRUMKA: Look, Neil -- look, Neil, this is a nice conversation. It has nothing to do with today's election.</p><p>But if Donald Trump is the candidate who has helped workers the most when it's time to endorse, our members will tell us that. If he is not, they will tell us that as well.</p><p>He isn't on the ballot today. People like Claire McCaskill are on the ballot. People like Bill Nelson are on the ballot.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I understand that.</p><p>But who is the last Republican presidential candidate you have supported?</p><p>TRUMKA: I don't know.</p><p>You ask us about Republicans. We support Republicans in every race. If they support workers, we support them.</p><p>The last Republican -- Mitt Romney didn't support workers. He had a bad record with workers. And I can go back through the list all the way back.</p><p>Probably the last one that actually supported workers would have been Eisenhower. Eisenhower actually did support workers.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: And I wish we had more time. And you have been a great guest, as always.</p><p>But I know, when we last had it, you said my -- I don't see a political persuasion here. I look at how they help unions, how they help union workers, how they help average folks.</p><p>If things are now in this economy going the way they're going, with one of the strongest recoveries we have seen, you find precious few Republicans to support in this environment, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: For whom? Wait, wait, wait, Neil. Wait, wait, wait.</p><p>Strongest recovery for whom? Workers haven't seen that recovery yet. Workers are seeing their health care go up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Richard, do you look at the same data I look at?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: I do. I do, Neil.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, if you would give me a chance to explain, I will explain.</p><p>CAVUTO: But I'm not an apologist for any side, Richard.</p><p>But do you look at the same data I do?</p><p>TRUMKA: I do.</p><p>CAVUTO: Record low unemployment across every major demographic group?</p><p>TRUMKA: I do.</p><p>CAVUTO: And you still say not good enough?</p><p>TRUMKA: I do.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: You had one month of wage increase, one, one quarter. Three decades, that doesn't wipe out.</p><p>CAVUTO: You have had two years of improving numbers, Richard.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: In addition to that, health care -- our health care out-of-pocket costs went up 5.9 percent last year. They're scheduled to go up for an individual $1,500 next year, Neil.</p><p>That's a lot of money for individuals. So you can't pull out one statistic and say, this is great, or one group of people.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm not pulling out one statistic or another.</p><p>I'm just trying to be very, very clear. What would it take for you to sort of say, all right, things are better than they have been? I mean, yes, wages could go at a stronger clip in real inflation-adjusted terms. They most certainly good. You're absolutely right about that.</p><p>But the arc, the trend is your friend right now for union members, for those who -- who -- many of whom attend these rallies where Donald Trump speaks. So, what do they see that apparently you do not?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, look, they will tell me if that's the case.</p><p>If they want to endorse him, they will. But we went to our members in Ohio, we have had a conversation with them; 50 percent of those that voted for Donald Trump have told us they're voting for Richard Cordray and for Sherrod Brown. That's 50 percent of the people that voted for Donald Trump.</p><p>So, apparently, his argument hasn't persuaded them. They know that Richard Cordray is better than DeWine. And they know that Sherrod Brown is their friend that will stick up for them. So they're voting for them.</p><p>That's what we see in this election.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I understand.</p><p>But when they -- when they look at what's happening around them...</p><p>TRUMKA: Do you really?</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I'm taking your word for it.</p><p>So, when they look around at what's happening, and they see some of these improvements, are you telling me that they're simply not good enough, or that the progress on trade deals that they had argued, you had argued to me -- now, don't -- just be careful -- and you had told me were not really good for union members, what do they see now? Do they like them or dislike them?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: Neil, I know -- I know you want to make this an issue about me and you and us and them.</p><p>But, look, that's a nonissue right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't know what you're saying.</p><p>It's not about you or me or us and them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: Here's what I'm saying. Here's what I'm saying.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm just curious, do you like the trade deals of this president?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You did not like a lot of those trade deals. Now, I don't know if these newer deals he's designed are in your favor or not. Do you like them, or you liked the old deals better, the old trade deals better?</p><p>TRUMKA: NAFTA, it is quite -- it's too early for us to decide whether yes or no.</p><p>There's some improvements.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK.</p><p>TRUMKA: There's some places where he's digressed.</p><p>When we know all the facts, we will make a decision. And all the pundits who are going crazy right now, being either gushing for it or gushing against it, are simply wrong, because they don't have the facts yet.</p><p>We will judge it on its merit. There are improvements in it and there are areas where it's going backwards. If we can enforce this agreement, if the enforcement mechanism is there, if we can get the Mexican government to allow wages to rise, so that there's less downward pressure on the wages in the United States, then, yes, we will endorse that.</p><p>If it doesn't do that, then we won't. But it's too early for us to be able to tell.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMKA: Am I encouraged? Wait. Am I encouraged that we're talking about it?</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>TRUMKA: Yes, I am encouraged.</p><p>I'm also encouraged and proud of union members and workers across the country, because the debate right now isn't whether we're going to have a new NAFTA. The debate right now is how we fix a broken one.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, the idea and the guarantees that are supposedly in there -- and you know this far better than I -- to hire more union workers, to hire them at wages that were not in the prior deal, do you find that promising, or do you find it accurate, or what?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, first of all, we don't know.</p><p>We don't know how it will be enforced or what will be enforced.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>TRUMKA: We don't know how the labor chapter will be enforced, how the rules of origin will be enforced, or several other things.</p><p>So we need to find out that language. If it's good, then, yes, it'll be encouraging. If it isn't, and we can't enforce the agreement, it doesn't matter what the agreement says. It's unenforceable.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, so, finally, real quick final question.</p><p>The number -- you said you support a of number Republican candidates, but do you have a breakdown of the percentage of Democrats you are supporting vs. Republicans? I would just be curious.</p><p>TRUMKA: No, I don't. I don't, because we are up and down the ballot this time far more than we have ever been. There's a lot of local races, state house members, state senates.</p><p>And so I don't have that. I will be able to get you that tomorrow.</p><p>There's about 1,500 union members that are running for office on the ballot this time. And we're working hard to get them elected, so that they can stand up.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>TRUMKA: Some are Republicans. Most are Democrats. But some are Republicans.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Richard, very good chatting with you. I appreciate it.</p><p>TRUMKA: Thanks for having me, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Richard Trumka of the AFL-CIO.</p><p>Meanwhile, to New Jersey and voters there going to the polls, closing out what's been a very contentious and expensive Senate race between incumbent Bob Menendez, the Republican challenger, Bob Hugin.</p><p>Let's go first to David Lee Miller in Mountainside, New Jersey, with the latest on finally the end of what has been a very nasty race, huh?</p><p>DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Indeed, it has been, Neil.</p><p>This has been a very hard-ought battle and, as you said, a very nasty one at times. Democratic senator Bob Menendez is vying now for a third term as New Jersey senator. Although he has been considered the front-runner all along, some analysts say that in a blue state like New Jersey, it should have been a lock for Menendez, that he should be certain to win.</p><p>However, victory is not certain here. Menendez is considered vulnerable following a corruption trial last year that although resulted in a hung jury did tarnish his reputation. Republican challenger Bob Hugin, meanwhile, who has been endorsed by President Trump and who has donated to the president's 2016 campaign and also was the chairman of his finance committee here in New Jersey, is trying to distance himself from President Trump, saying that he is a different kind of candidate, that he is independent.</p><p>Meanwhile, as voters do go to the polls, there have been many reports, multiple reports today, Neil, of problems at polling stations, ranging from long lines and machines that have been malfunctioning.</p><p>We expect the polls here will close in just a little under three-and-a- half-hours. That is 8:00 local time -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: David Lee, thank you very, very much.</p><p>It's not that New Jersey has not elected its share of Republican officials. Of course, Chris Christie is a former governor, two-term governor. There's a Democratic governor now.</p><p>And, of course, before him, of course, it was Christie Todd Whitman, who joins us right now.</p><p>Governor, good to have you.</p><p>CHRISTIE TODD WHITMAN (R), FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: Good to be with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: It is tough for Republicans to get elected in New Jersey.</p><p>WHITMAN: It is. It's a challenge.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>WHITMAN: We're a little bit outnumbered in the number of registered voters.</p><p>The only thing I will say, though, the part that's growing is the independents. Democrats are losing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>Now, the Hugin-Menendez battle has been pretty sharp and very expensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WHITMAN: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you think of it and the kind of coverage it's been getting?</p><p>WHITMAN: It's been getting a lot of coverage. And it's exciting to see that Bob Hugin is doing as well as he's doing.</p><p>And I think it's within the realm of possibility that he could knock off Menendez, because Menendez has such a bad reputation, and being censured the way was by both Republicans and Democrats, more importantly.</p><p>That's come to people's attention, even with the disparity in registration and more Democrats. There are still people that don't like the fact that they have someone in office who has been censured that way and found to be lacking ethically.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's happened on the governor's side, not so much on the Senate side, in New Jersey to get a Republican in power there. Why is that, you think?</p><p>WHITMAN: I don't know. It's hard to say.</p><p>It's ideological. It's because the senators go where -- they think the big thoughts. The governors have to deliver. And so they're looking for slightly different things in those two offices.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>WHITMAN: They want someone in a governorship who they think can really deliver on their promises, not just come up with new ideas as to how to approach things.</p><p>So, it's more ideological, I think, when you look at the senatorial races than it is at the gubernatorial level.</p><p>CAVUTO: Bob Hugin, of course, is a very rich pharmaceutical executive. He's forked over more than $35 million of his own money presumably into this race.</p><p>Does he have the future if for some reason it doesn't turn out, he doesn't win tonight?</p><p>I think, if he wants to have one, he can, absolutely, because he's been a very credible candidate. He's well-spoken. He's a bright guy. He had a good reputation as a CEO.</p><p>Menendez has tried to attack that. But Bob has had some very good and, I think, forceful responses to those attacks. So, it's been an ugly race, unfortunately. And we're seeing that across the country. And that's just not in our best interests, I don't think, in the long run.</p><p>But I do think, if he wants to have a future, he certainly could. I don't know, when you have spent this much of your own money, and done this, put as much heart into it as you have...</p><p>CAVUTO: That's a lot of money, yes.</p><p>WHITMAN: ... whether you're going to want to come back and try to do something else again.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Governor, thank you very, very much, Governor Christie Todd Whitman.</p><p>We will be following that very, very closely.</p><p>In the meantime, Georgia voting is already under way. They're looking at governor. Health care is a very, very big issue there. And that health care keeps playing out again and again, in race after race.</p><p>The read from the former Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis on why that is -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, it's not just Congress up for grabs; 36 gubernatorial seats are on the line, including a very tight race going on in the Peach State of Georgia between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp.</p><p>Health care a very, very big issue there, as it is across the country.</p><p>Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta with more.</p><p>Hey, Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>When it comes to health care, the candidates running for governor in Georgia could not be any more different. You have Republican Brian Kemp, who cast his ballot earlier today, saying that he will fight what he calls a socialist takeover of health care. This plays well with his conservative base in rural parts of the state.</p><p>Democrat Stacey Abrams, on the other hand, says she wants to protect Obamacare. This appeals to her base in large cities. But she's also making the case to rural Georgians that expanding Medicare would reverse the trend of hospital closures in less populated areas.</p><p>Voter turnout is setting new records. Before Election Day, more than two million Georgians had already cast ballots, more than doubling the previous record for early voting in a midterm election in this state.</p><p>And then, Neil, coming back to our live shot, you can see voter turnout today, on the Election Day, is very heavy. The secretary of state's office telling us voter turnout is heavy in all parts of the state -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you, Jonathan, very, very much.</p><p>The read on that enthusiasm now from former Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, also the former Massachusetts governor.</p><p>Governor, very good to have you.</p><p>MICHAEL DUKAKIS (D), FORMER MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR: Neil, great to be back with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Same here.</p><p>What do you make of these high turnout numbers across a broad swathe of groups here?</p><p>DUKAKIS: Well, I think Donald Trump has got people pretty excited.</p><p>In many cases, they're very angry with him. In some cases, they like him. But I have seen it in my teaching. As you know, I have been teaching at Northeastern University here in Boston for the past 28 years.</p><p>And I have never seen, Neil, the kind of interest in public service that I'm seeing on the part of my students these days. Most of them, at least up here, don't like Trump.</p><p>But the important thing is that this is finally got them out seriously thinking about serving in public life. And I think that's great, and I hope it continues and we can encourage it.</p><p>But I do think this turnout tells you something.</p><p>CAVUTO: Governor, normally, when the last ballots are counted in the midterms, within hours, they're working on the next campaign.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: And we're expecting quite a few prominent Democrats to throw their hat in the ring for president.</p><p>And there has been a concern among some in your party that Democrats are driving a hard left, and it's going to hurt them. What do you think of that?</p><p>DUKAKIS: That's always been a concern.</p><p>And I don't see anything unusual about it. We're going to have an active primary. We're going to have a lot of candidates. But in the last analysis, whoever wins that nomination is going to be somebody who, in my opinion -- don't know who it's going to be, I don't have any particular preference -- is somebody who will work his or her way through the primary and come out as a strong and effective nominee.</p><p>And it'll be somebody who can appeal to a very broad cross-section of Americans. And we always have this discussion.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>DUKAKIS: But in the last analysis, we end up with folks that are making a lot of sense, and I think in this case will.</p><p>And I think we're going to get rid of the guy that's in there and get ourselves a president who really reflects what America is all about.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. People can bicker over that, Governor.</p><p>But I am curious what you make of what could be a crowded field.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren and this whole DNA, Native American testing and everything else, what did you think of all that?</p><p>DUKAKIS: Well, I think the whole thing is kind of silly.</p><p>I don't like -- I'm not a fan of Trump's, needless to say. He's an insulting guy and he's somebody who I think is pretty disagreeable all the time.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, that shocks me. I thought you liked him, but go ahead.</p><p>DUKAKIS: Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DUKAKIS: But this Pocahontas stuff, what's the matter with this guy? He's the president of the United States.</p><p>We have serious issues, both here and abroad. And this kind of stuff, I think, well, it reflects basically the kind of racism that this guy seems to stand for.</p><p>I mean, is there any group, any minority that he likes? We're all immigrants. My parents came over here.</p><p>CAVUTO: But do you think it was dumb of her to do it, though, Governor?</p><p>Do you think for her to go ahead and do that and try to satisfy that issue or resolve it, that she just created a bigger one, and might have doomed her chances to be your party's nominee?</p><p>DUKAKIS: I don't think so.</p><p>But, look, she's -- I know her well. I admire her greatly. I worked hard to help her get elected to the Senate. And I'm proud of that. And she's got to make judgments. We all have to in a campaign like this, or in a situation like this.</p><p>And I thought it was a reasonable thing to do. But it's -- really, isn't this so silly? I mean, the question is, what kind of country do we want? What kind of future do we want?</p><p>And let's knock off this insulting stuff. I mean, I just can't stand it. And I don't think the American people can stand it, which is one reason why I think the results tonight are going to be pretty good.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, we don't know. And you could be right on that.</p><p>But are you surprised, Governor, the economy is doing as well as it is? Now, Barack Obama claims credit for that, that it started with him. And he might or might not be right. But it's certainly picked up momentum under President Trump.</p><p>And I'm just curious how you reconcile that with your personal opinions of the president.</p><p>DUKAKIS: Well, first look, we were in terrible shape under the last Republican administration, in terrible shape. The country was floundering around badly when Obama got elected.</p><p>And it's pretty obvious what happened here, Neil. I mean, he and the work he did and the first Democratic Congress had everything to do with the fact that we came out of that terrible, terrible situation.</p><p>And by the time he left office, the economy was in pretty good shape. In fact, it was growing faster than it has been growing at least in one of the periods that Trump has been governing.</p><p>So the notion that Trump somehow came into this terrible situation and turned it around is nonsense. This economy was in damn good shape when Barack Obama left it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: To your point, it was certainly in a lot better shape than the...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DUKAKIS: Wait a second. Look...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think that that job growth, the complexion of those jobs, Governor, is better than they were, that pay is going up, unemployment levels among all sorts of groups is at record lows?</p><p>Does that surprise you?</p><p>DUKAKIS: Neil, let me tell you what bothers me.</p><p>We're now heading for a $1 trillion annual budget deficit. Now, I'm supposed to be a liberal, but I used to describe myself, as you will recall, as a liberal who could count.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DUKAKIS: And I was a governor who had to balance budgets.</p><p>Where are we going with all this? A trillion dollars worth or red ink on an annual basis at a time when we're at full employment? I mean, this is preposterous. And it's very serious.</p><p>CAVUTO: But we had $10 trillion added to our debt right in the last president, right?</p><p>DUKAKIS: Well, that's true, because he inherited an economy, it was in a shambles, and had to revive it.</p><p>CAVUTO: But it's a bipartisan problem, right? It's a bipartisan mess, right?</p><p>DUKAKIS: No, this is not a bipartisan problem.</p><p>When you cut taxes mostly for the wealthy by billions and billions of dollars at a time you're in full employment, that's terrible economic policy, in my judgment. Terrible.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we shall see.</p><p>DUKAKIS: This is a time when we should be getting ourselves back in shape and getting the economy in shape and getting the budget in shape. And we're not doing it.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. All right. I will put you down as a maybe on Donald Trump, Governor.</p><p>It's always good having you. Continued good luck with your teachings. Good seeing you again.</p><p>DUKAKIS: Great to chat with you, Neil. Thanks.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>DUKAKIS: Really appreciate it.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, the read from former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, you just heard the read from a former Democratic governor on what hurts our country and who gets credit for the improvement in the economy in our country.</p><p>Fair and balanced now, the read from a former Republican governor of Louisiana, of course, former presidential candidate as well Bobby Jindal.</p><p>Governor, good to have thank you.</p><p>BOBBY JINDAL (R), FORMER LOUISIANA GOVERNOR: Neil, thank you for having me back.</p><p>CAVUTO: Michael Dukakis made an interesting comment about, the debt is growing. Of course, it grows under, it seems, Democratic and Republican presidents alike. And it does seem to be choking us now.</p><p>What do you make of that? And do you worry about it?</p><p>JINDAL: You know, Neil, I actually do. That was one of the few, maybe the only times, I have actually agreed with Governor Dukakis.</p><p>I do think we have got to get control of the debt. Look, I think President Trump has done many good things. He said he was going to cut taxes. He did that. He said he was an appoint conservative judges. He did that.</p><p>He said he was going to rip up the Iran nuclear deal. He did that. He said he was going to stand with Israel. He did that.</p><p>One of the things that hasn't been done yet, though, the Republicans in D.C. have yet to really get spending under control. They haven't cut spending. They haven't balanced the budget. So I think that's a valid concern.</p><p>But, overall, it -- and it's an important concern. I'm not trivializing that. And it's funny to see Democrats all of a sudden get religion on deficits, after eight years of record-setting debt under President Obama.</p><p>And so certainly that's a valid criticism. But going into this election, I think overall the Republicans have done a great job, and they deserve to be reelected.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are you troubled, though, that neither party seems to be addressing this spiraling debt, and the fact that, with interest rates rising, it's only spiraling more?</p><p>JINDAL: Absolutely.</p><p>Look, I understand why it's good politics for President Trump -- and he said this as a candidate -- he said he wasn't going to look at or touch the entitlement programs. I don't think that's sustainable.</p><p>I think they have to be reformed going forward. I'm a strong supporter of premium support within the Medicare program. I do think getting the economy growing is a strong part of balancing the budget.</p><p>And he's doing that. President Obama had defined a new normal, where 2 percent growth was seemed to be the best we could do. We didn't have real wage growth. And President Trump campaigned and said, we could get back closer to 4 percent.</p><p>And we're on the way to doing that. So I think stronger economic growth is a big part of balancing the budget. But we have got to cut spending. Part of that is entitlement spending.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think Republicans should embrace that more forcefully, though?</p><p>Do you think, just like Democrats look the other way at some of their pet programs and all, that everyone should get on board with curtailing at least the growth in entitlements, and maybe grandfather in benefits for those closer to retirement age, but change them, raise them in other areas, either for Social Security, Medicare, but that that's got to be done?</p><p>JINDAL: Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO: And there's some political risk to that, but there's greater risk to the country if you don't do it.</p><p>JINDAL: Absolutely.</p><p>And look, to his credit, Paul Ryan championed that. And there are Republicans in Congress that have championed that. And, again, I understand politically why Republicans don't want to do that. It's always -- it's not very popular in the short-term.</p><p>We have got to do it. If we don't do it, in the longer run, you're going to have Democrats trying to...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, Donald Trump doesn't want to do it. He did not want to touch Social Security.</p><p>Now, that might change in the future. Do you think he should consider it?</p><p>JINDAL: Well, look, I think it'd be better for the country.</p><p>I get the political cost. But the reality is, I think, the earlier we act, the easier it is to do modest reforms. I think you're right. We need to grandfather people that are near retirement</p><p>I think you can do it. If you do it now, we're not talking about cutting these programs.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>JINDAL: We're talking about slowing down their growth rates.</p><p>And you can do it with competition. And, for example, in Medicare, give seniors more choices and more efficient private health care plans.</p><p>CAVUTO: Governor, we have a lot of races, the governorships, up for grabs, 36 of them. Republicans are thought to be in danger of maybe losing 10 10 of those races. So, it could be more even.</p><p>That obviously says a lot about the Census Bureau and how it goes about its business, what rewards are handed out in the next election.</p><p>Are you worried for your party?</p><p>JINDAL: Well, look, I think governor's races are incredibly important.</p><p>Part of this is, we had an incredible run four years ago. We had a record number of Republicans in office in the state capitals. But you're right. Not only are they important for political reasons, like the census and the presidential race.</p><p>From a policy perspective, when you think about health care policy, whether the states expand Medicaid, whether they put work requirements in Medicaid, whether they reform welfare, whether they cut taxes, whether they -- all these decisions get made at the state level, whether it's -- you enforce and implement state level religious liberty laws.</p><p>And so these are important elections. I think, oftentimes, they get overlooked. Everybody is focused on the Senate and the congressional races.</p><p>So, I do think these are important races. I know you were looking at Georgia recently. Look, those -- you have got two stark contrasts. You have got a far left liberal Democrat running against a pretty conservative Republican.</p><p>So, these aren't just differences in personalities.

Happy St. Patrick`s day.</p><p>We begin with acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.</p><p>And happy St. Patrick`s day to you.</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  And to you, Ms.  Brennan.</p><p>BRENNAN:  I want to get right to it, in the wake of this horrific terror attack in New Zealand.</p><p>You know, there`s a lot of parsing of the president`s own language in referring to what happened here.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the number of attacks and support for white supremacy is up, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.  And even a Trump-appointed attorney in the state of Virginia, Thomas Cullen, was recently quoted as saying: \"White supremacy and far right extremism are among the greatest domestic security threats facing the United States.\"</p><p>Has the president been briefed on this?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Well, I don`t know who that gentleman is.  Certainly, the president`s briefed on all of...</p><p>BRENNAN:  You know who the Southern Poverty Law Center is.</p><p>MULVANEY:  I do.  I do.</p><p>The president`s absolutely briefed on all of the threats, both domestic and international.  But I want to push back against this idea that every time something bad happens everywhere around the world, folks who don`t like Donald Trump seem to blame it on Donald Trump.</p><p>I`m hoping we can get...</p><p>BRENNAN:  I`m not blaming it on the president.  I was asking about...</p><p>MULVANEY:  I didn`t say -- didn`t say...</p><p>BRENNAN:  ... his characterization.</p><p>MULVANEY:  I didn`t say you.  I`m saying that that`s clearly what some folks want -- want to do.  I have heard other members of -- of the Democrat Party trying to do it, folks at the Southern Poverty Law Center here trying to do it.</p><p>This is a tragic thing that happened in New Zealand.</p><p>BRENNAN:  They`re just saying the number of white nationalist groups has surged by 50 percent.</p><p>MULVANEY:  Since Trump has become -- office, right?</p><p>BRENNAN:  Well, in the past year.</p><p>MULVANEY:  There you go.  So, he -- here`s the point.  Why can`t we...</p><p>BRENNAN:  So, do you disagree that it`s a rising threat?</p><p>MULVANEY:  I -- I -- I -- I disagree that there`s a causal link between Donald Trump being president and something like this happening in New Zealand.</p><p>BRENNAN:  But that`s not the argument or the suggestion there...</p><p>MULVANEY:  OK, good.</p><p>BRENNAN:  ... by the judge or by that statistic.  Is the president aware that this is a rising threat?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Again, a rising threat.</p><p>I think the president you saw -- you saw him asked the other day, does he think it`s a rising threat?  And he says no.  I think there`s information that would back that up.</p><p>The issue is, how do you stop these crazy people?  Whether or not there`s one of them or four of them doesn`t make a difference, if they`re willing to go on live TV and stream the murder of people.  So I think that`s where the time is better spent.</p><p>Instead of worrying about, well, who`s to -- who`s to blame, how do we stop from doing this?  Donald Trump is no more to blame for what happened in New Zealand than Mark Zuckerberg is because he invented Facebook.  There are some terrible people in the world.  We need to work with our partners, of which New Zealand is one of, and to try and figure a way to find them, expose them and bring them to justice.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Well, President Trump, and certainly during the campaign talked quite a lot about the need to be specific, to name a threat in order to counter it.</p><p>So why minimize it?  Why not directly address white supremacy, and specifically Islamophobia?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Yes, I get a lot of questions about...</p><p>BRENNAN:  Because a number of world leaders did.  And the president didn`t.</p><p>MULVANEY:  I get a lot of questions from people saying, why -- you need to tell the president to do X, you need to tell the president to go and give it an Oval Office address on this or on that.</p><p>That`s not how the system works.  The president communicates in his way.  Different presidents have communicated in their way.  I don`t think anybody can -- can claim that Donald Trump hasn`t done exactly what we would want him to do in this circumstance.</p><p>We`ve immediately reached out to our allies.  We`ve expressed the absolute disgust at the tragic -- at the tragic events.  We`re doing what presidents are supposed to do.</p><p>That doesn`t mean it`s going to make everybody happy because of the hyper partisan times we live in.  But, again, I really -- it frustrates me, just as a citizen, that everything -- something -- every time something goes wrong around the world now, not just in our country, somehow, the president of the United States must be responsible.</p><p>And that`s just -- that`s absurd, and it doesn`t help contribute to the dialogue that`s necessary to fix these problems.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Point taken, but the president of the United States carries a megaphone louder than anyone in the world, and arguably this president likes to use his.</p><p>So, because you`re frustrated, why not remove any shadow of a doubt?  I mean during the campaign, as you know, as a candidate, the president called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States.  He said Islam hates us.</p><p>This kind of language in the past leads to these questions of, why isn`t the president now directly using that megaphone to condemn it?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Well then -- take -- take -- take -- take the words and put them in one category, and take the actions and put them in another.</p><p>Something the president doesn`t get hardly any credit for or any attention to is the work he`s done in defense of religious minorities all around the world, up to and including Muslims in the Middle East.  Some of the religious minorities that are the worst oppressed to the Middle East are some of the ones that this administration has been doing -- going to great lengths to protect.</p><p>So I hear what folks says, oh, Donald Trump said this during the campaign. Look at what we`ve done while we`ve been here.  I don`t think anybody could say that the president is anti-Muslim.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Well, the president`s tweeting now about a TV host who was suspended for anti-Muslim rhetoric.</p><p>So, it`s -- it`s, I think, a fair question to ask you about this.</p><p>But I want to move on to one of the fights that is going on in Congress and questions from a number of senators about exactly what programs are going to lose funding...</p><p>MULVANEY:  Sure.</p><p>BRENNAN:  ... in order to put together funding for the border wall.</p><p>When will the White House give this detailed list, specifically on military projects, to Congress?</p><p>MULVANEY:  It could be a while, and here`s why.  Here`s -- here`s what`s happening, is that we`ve already told Congress this, which is that none of the programs that were scheduled to be started or what we call obligated in 2019, so between now and the end of September, will be impacted at all.</p><p>BRENNAN:  The service chiefs have told Congress they have that list, but the White House is not...</p><p>MULVANEY:  No.</p><p>BRENNAN:  ... handing that list over.</p><p>MULVANEY:  No, no, that that`s absolutely -- I know of no list.  And if anybody should know, it would be me.</p><p>There`s no list of projects that are absolutely going to not be funded so that the wall can be.  What it is, is a list of programs that fit the criteria that I have just laid out for you, which is that they are meant to be funded beyond the end of this fiscal year.</p><p>Why is that important?  Because if we -- if it`s going to be a project that would have been funded, say, in 2021, OK, it gives us another couple of years to what we call backfill.  Congress will pass another appropriation this year, next year, so that ultimately none of the programs would be impacted.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Senator Tim Kaine, who sits on Armed Services, is going to be on the show later in the program.</p><p>But when we spoke with him, he specifically said that he thinks the White House is withholding these details until after this upcoming vote on the veto override occurs.  In other words, you`re trying to keep Republicans on board, and if you fully inform them about what you`re going to do to their district, then you might lose their vote.</p><p>MULVANEY:  I -- I don`t -- I will watch the show.  And, in fact, if I catch Tim in the green room, I will ask him what the basis is for that.</p><p>Does he just think it because he wants it to be true or someone told him there was actually a list?  Because, again, I`m chief of staff.  I`m also still technically over at the Office of Management and Budget.</p><p>BRENNAN:  And you still don`t know what`s getting cut?</p><p>MULVANEY:  And I know of no list that specifically...</p><p>BRENNAN:  And you don`t know what`s getting cut?</p><p>MULVANEY:  That`s correct.</p><p>I know of the universe of things that might be delayed or reduced or cut in a very extreme circumstance that could be funded -- used to fund the wall, but a list of a decision that`s already been made, saying, this money is going to be cut and spent over there, that`s not been made yet.</p><p>BRENNAN:  So, remove any doubt.  You say, no matter what these details are, you still have the votes to override...</p><p>MULVANEY:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BRENNAN:  ... this veto?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BRENNAN:  To block any kind of override?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Yes, no, we fully expect the veto override to fail in the House.</p><p>BRENNAN:  All right, thank you, Mick Mulvaney, for joining us.</p><p>MULVANEY:  Thanks, Margaret.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Just to clarify, that host is FOX News` Jeanine Pirro.</p><p>The network has condemned her commentary, and her broadcast did not air last night.</p><p>We spoke yesterday with Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.  He had just returned from a visit to the Venezuelan border and spoke to us from Bogota, Colombia.</p><p>We asked Senator Kaine about President Trump saying that he did not think white nationalism was a rising threat around the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA:  Margaret, it is on the rise.  And the president should call it out.</p><p>But, sadly, he`s not doing that.  We saw in the aftermath of the horrible attack in Charlottesville that he tried to say that the white supremacists, neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates there were just, you know, good people.</p><p>But when you see church shootings in Charleston, a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, you see this hate-filled manifesto of the shooter in New Zealand who is murdering Muslims, we have to confront the fact that there is a rise in white supremacy, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim attitudes.</p><p>The president uses language often that`s very similar to the language used by these bigots and racists.  And if he`s not going to call it out, then other leaders have to do more to call it out.  And I certainly will.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Well, the president did say it was a horrible thing that happened,but he said that the white nationalism issue is just a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.</p><p>What do you attribute the rise to?</p><p>KAINE:  Well, they have problems, but I think the president is using language that emboldens them.</p><p>He`s not creating them.  They`re out there.  But at the same time as he was tweeting out yesterday his support for the family members in New Zealand -- and that was appropriate -- he was vetoing the Senate`s rejection of his emergency declaration from Thursday.</p><p>And he used the word invaders to characterize people coming to the nation`s southern borders, which was exactly the same phrase that the shooter in New Zealand used to characterize the Muslims that he was attacking.  That kind of language from the person who probably has the loudest microphone on the planet Earth is hurtful and dangerous, and it tends to incite violence.</p><p>BRENNAN:  I want to ask you about an exchange you had this week that seemed quite tense.  You were very clearly frustrated with the acting secretary of defense, Shanahan, because you were asking why a list of military projects had not been provided to Congress that would be directly impacted by funding cuts due to reallocation for the president`s border wall.</p><p>KAINE:  I`m on the Armed Services Committee.  I represent Virginia.</p><p>I have a child in the military.  So I sent a letter on February 15 to the secretary of defense and said, if you`re going to ransack the Pentagon`s budget, tell me what projects you`re going to cut or delay or eliminate.  They wouldn`t provide an answer.</p><p>At the hearing on Thursday, we`re now going to vote that day on whether we support or reject the emergency declaration.  And they still hadn`t answered our question:  What projects are at stake?</p><p>At the hearing, he said, oh, I will send you the list later this afternoon.</p><p>And you`re right.  I kind of blew up at him.  You`re going to give us the list after we vote?  This is highly relevant to the vote about the president`s emergency declaration.  What projects are you going to ransack out of the Pentagon budget?  Is it going to be military housing?  Is it going to be trying to make our bases safer from terrorism with construction projects?</p><p>Is it going to be rebuilding Tyndall Air Force Base that got blitzed in the hurricanes last fall?  And they said they would give us the list after.</p><p>But, Margaret, to add insult to injury, they had to walk that back.  They don`t even want to give us the list now at all, because we`re going to have to have an override vote.  I don`t think the White House wants us to see the list before the override vote.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Why do you think the White House is withholding this information you say is so relevant because of an upcoming vote?</p><p>KAINE:  I think there`s one reason.</p><p>BRENNAN:  You`re -- you`re connecting.  You think they`re trying to influence the outcome of it?</p><p>KAINE:  Absolutely.  This is not the secretary of defense, in my view.  This is the White House wanting to hold the list back because they worry that, if senators and House members saw the potential projects that were going to be ransacked to pay for the president`s wall, they would lose votes.</p><p>And I think they`re going to try to hide the list until that veto override vote occurs in the House and then in the Senate.</p><p>BRENNAN:  You are, of course, in Colombia nearby what is a country that is really crippled in many ways economically right now, Venezuela.</p><p>There are about three million refugees who have fled.  The energy and oil industry is collapsing, as is the economy there.  What is it that you were going to the border to see?  What did you learn?</p><p>KAINE:  Well, Margaret, I wanted to see a couple of things, one, to support the Colombian government because their effort to provide assistance to these millions of Venezolanos has been really momentous, but, secondly, learn what more the United States can do.</p><p>We have worked together actually in an accord between the administration and Congress to provide significant amounts of humanitarian aid, to work together, to pull together a coalition of nations.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Nicolas Maduro still is in charge of that country, whether we like it or not.  And these sanctions have not seemingly changed his calculus.</p><p>The visas, the diplomatic isolation, what is this actually accomplishing at this point?</p><p>KAINE:  Well, it`s -- it`s giving hope to Venezuelans that there may finally be some change.  The question isn`t whether Maduro likes it or not.  The question is what the Venezuelan people want.</p><p>And the National Assembly has determined that the election of President Maduro was illegitimate.  There needs to be a new government.</p><p>So, what more can we do more?</p><p>BRENNAN:  Yes.</p><p>KAINE:  More humanitarian aid, more work together to pull more nations into our coalition.  The sanctions are important.  They`re having an effect.</p><p>Sanctions are economic, but there are also visa restrictions on Maduro and his cronies as they try to travel abroad.  We need to give hope to the Venezuelan people that we stand with them and support them.  It`s a massive humanitarian crisis driven by one person, Nicolas Maduro, and the Venezuelan people are speaking out, and they want something better.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Has the Trump administration, whose policy you seem to support right now, have they underestimated how strong he is?</p><p>KAINE:  No, I don`t know that they`ve underestimated it.</p><p>Look, this is -- this is not easy.  It`s a difficult situation.  And I do generally support what the Trump administration has done, with one exception.  I think loose talk about U.S. military action is a big mistake, one, because that`s not for the president.  It`s for Congress.</p><p>But second, the right strategy here -- there`s only one person using the military against Venezuelans.  And it`s Maduro.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Senator Kaine, thank you for joining us.  Safe travels.</p><p>KAINE:  Thank you, Margaret.  Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN:  We will be back in one minute with a lot more FACE THE NATION.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN:  We`re back now with former federal prosecutor Preet Bharara.</p><p>He was, of course, fired by President Trump after he refused to sign as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.</p><p>And he has a new book out, \"Doing Justice: A Prosecutor`s Thoughts on Crime, Punishment, and the Rule of Law.\"</p><p>Preet, good to have you here.</p><p>PREET BHARARA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BRENNAN:  I read the book.</p><p>I want to get to some of the news of the week, but first ask you actually how you ended this book, because I think it resonates this week, in the wake of the terror attack in New Zealand.</p><p>You recount a story and a case of a hate crime against someone who wanted to go out and kill Arabs after 9/11 and ended up killing some -- or -- and then injuring some South Asian individuals instead.</p><p>Is this just a continuation of Islamophobia, of white nationalism?  Is there something here?  Or, is -- as the president says, it`s not really a broader issue at all?</p><p>BHARARA:  Yes.  Well, thanks for asking about the end of the book.</p><p>I think a lot of the world is mourning the loss of innocent lives, up to 50 now, in New Zealand.  And, you know, from my old vantage point as a law enforcement officer, the chief law enforcement officer federally in Manhattan, law enforcement has certain tools, right?</p><p>You can do surveillance.  You can infiltrate organizations that propound hate and try to engage in terrorist acts.  You can also hold people accountable after the fact.</p><p>But one of the points I make in the book, \"Doing Justice,\" over and over again is, laws are not enough.  Law can do some things, but, at the end of the day, if you want to quell people`s hatred, you want to make people get along better, you want to have harmony, you have to have good people who are willing to step up to the plate and do, among other things, call out bad things when they happen.</p><p>And in the case that I was referring to that you mentioned in the -- in the end part of the book, it was a Bangladeshi immigrant after 9/11 who was shot in the face by someone, Mark Anthony Stroman, who decided that he wanted to take revenge on behalf of, I guess, his race for people who had perpetrated the act of 9/11, obviously, going and randomly shooting people where they worked.</p><p>And Rais Bhuiyan was not killed and decided in a way that I think is extraordinary to forgive the person who tried to kill him and tried to get him off death row and -- and spare him the death penalty.  He wasn`t ultimately successful.</p><p>But, to my mind, it`s an -- it`s an inspiring story of how some people go beyond what the law even requires, beyond what the law allows, to try to have forgiveness and -- and harmony go forward in the world.  And I think we need a little bit more of that and a little bit less of the nasty rhetoric and a little bit less of, you know, people like the president not stepping up to the plate and calling out bad things when they`re happening.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Important note there in this week.</p><p>But I want to turn to some of the other news that we`ve seen on the political and legal front.  You know, we saw on Friday the special counsel again asked for the fifth time a delay in the sentencing of Rick Gates, who was a -- a Trump campaign deputy, because, it was said, he`s cooperating.</p><p>How should people understand this?  What does this mean?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BHARARA:  Well, not just cooperating, but cooperating in -- quote, unquote -- \"several investigations.\"</p><p>And so, you know, I`m an outsider now, and I don`t still run the Southern District of New York, and I`m not aware of what`s going with various investigations that sometimes, you know, intersect with the special counsel`s investigation.</p><p>But I think people should view with some skepticism the notion that gets breathlessly reported every week that the Mueller investigation is coming to an end.  It may be, because Andrew Weissmann, who is one of the top deputies -- in fact, the top deputy -- with Robert Mueller, announced that he was stepping down, which indicates maybe it`s wrapping up.</p><p>But then, as you point out, you have this letter about Rick Gates, who`s cooperating in multiple investigations, and they delay the sentencing, which seems to indicate that he is substantially cooperating and engaging in some success for the prosecuting team.</p><p>So, you might expect other indictments, other work going forward.  So it doesn`t seem to me, based on that, although I don`t know, that the work of the special counsel is ending any time soon, unless it`s the case -- the one caveat I have is, unless it`s the case that the cases on which Rick Gates is cooperating are being parceled out -- parceled out to other U.S. attorney`s office -- offices like the Southern District of New York or D.C. or somewhere else, so the special counsel team can step back and have its work be done.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Steve Bannon and a few other individuals have said that actually the biggest risk to the president is not from the special counsel, but actually the Southern District of New York, which you know well.</p><p>Do you agree with that?</p><p>BHARARA:  Well, I don`t know if I -- I would frame it that way.  It`s a sort of a polemical way to frame it, but, yes, in the sense that the SDNY, which I led for 7.5 years, doesn`t have the circumscription on its ambit in the same way the special counsel does.</p><p>The special counsel was appointed, you know, under a particular regulation, and was supposed to look at only things relating to interference in the election and potentially collusion -- quote, unquote -- \"collusion\" with -- with Russians in connection with the election, and anything arising from it.</p><p>And one of those things that -- that arose from it was obstruction.  The Southern District of New York has a lot of people in it whose mission is only to find crime, be able to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, if it`s in the interests of justice to do it.  And they`re very aggressive and they`re very fearless and they`re very independent.</p><p>They don`t care about politics.  When I was there, we prosecuted Democrats and Republicans, and it didn`t matter who they were, you know, affiliated with.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Yes.</p><p>BHARARA:  And -- and so when one of -- one of the things I try to say in the book is to explain the philosophy and the culture of the men and women of the Southern District of New York.</p><p>BRENNAN:  And, of course, state and federal charges and how a president`s pardon could affect them are -- are different too.</p><p>I want to ask you as well about Paul Manafort.  He was sentenced in D.C. this week.  The sentence was added to, before that in Virginia, what some would characterize as a light sentence.</p><p>Do you think justice is done?</p><p>BHARARA:  It`s hard to say.  You know, punishment is a very difficult thing to calibrate.</p><p>You know, whether a few months more, a few months less...</p><p>BRENNAN:  Yes.</p><p>BHARARA:  ... is in the interest of justice is hard to measure like -- like mathematics.</p><p>I agree with the people who said that the first sentence of Paul Manafort of 47 months was a bit low, given the guidelines and given the nature and seriousness of the crime and how long it went on.  I think that, overall, the addition of 3.5 years from Judge Amy Berman Jackson makes it overall a 7.5-year sentence, which is closer to right.</p><p>I still think it`s overall low, but it`s hard to determine.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Preet Bharara, thank you for joining us.</p><p>BHARARA:  Thanks, Margaret.</p><p>BRENNAN:  The book is \"Doing Justice.\"</p><p>We`ll be back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN:  There are two more candidates in the presidential race, but it`s one who is not in the race, at least yet, who raised eyebrows when he accidentally made a slip in his speech last night.</p><p>Our Ed O`Keefe reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ED O`KEEFE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The man many Democrats are waiting for sure sounded like a presidential candidate Saturday night.</p><p>BIDEN:  I have the most progressive record of anybody running for the -- if -- anybody who would run.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>O`KEEFE:  Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected the make it official next month.</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  That`s why I`m running for president.  And it`s why I`m asking you for your support.</p><p>O`KEEFE:  New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today became the 14th Democrat to officially launch a presidential bid, even though she`s been officially campaigning for the job for eight weeks.  Gillibrand plans to formally kick off her campaign next Sunday outside Trump Tower in New York.</p><p>Other candidates traveled to early primary states this weekend, hoping to build support.</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We have common pain all over this country, but we have lost our sense of common purpose.</p><p>O`KEEFE:  And Beto O`Rourke wrapped up a three-day tour in Iowa that launched his campaign.</p><p>BETO O`ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This is my first time to ever visit Iowa.</p><p>O`KEEFE:  O`Rourke narrowly lost the U.S. Senate bid in Texas last year, and presidential buzz has been building ever since.</p><p>His rollout was treated like a major media event.  He told \"Vanity Fair\" magazine for a cover story, \"I`m just born to be in it.\"</p><p>And he sat for his first in-depth interview as a candidate with \"CBS THIS MORNING\" co-host Gayle King.</p><p>GAYLE KING, CO-HOST, \"CBS THIS MORNING\":  Do you consider yourself more moderate or more progressive?</p><p>O`ROURKE:  Yes.  You know, if I think about a term like progressive, I want to make sure everybody has a chance, that our democracy fully reflects the genius of this country, that we make the investments in one another, and that`s universal guaranteed high-quality health care.  It`s a living wage for everyone who works.</p><p>It`s supporting those who are looking for jobs.  So, if that is progressive, I`m a progressive.</p><p>KING:  You`re a progressive?</p><p>O`ROURKE:  Yes.</p><p>KING:  All right.  All right.  So I don`t even need to go into moderate then?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>O`KEEFE:  Meanwhile, former Florida Governor and 2016 candidate Jeb Bush said this weekend that Republicans ought to be given a choice, suggesting someone needs to launch a primary challenge to President Trump.</p><p>He named Maryland Governor Larry Hogan as a possible option.  Hogan told us a few weeks ago he isn`t ruling it out -- Margaret.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Ed, thank you.</p><p>More on 2020 when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN:  We will be back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.</p><p>Joining us for some more 2020 analysis are Jamal Simmons, Democratic strategist and host on Hill TV, Amy Walter of \"The Cook Political Report,\" and, of course, our own Ed O`Keefe.</p><p>Ed, you just laid out the crowded field. I was speaking to a Democratic strategist this week, or fundraiser I should say, who said this is like waiting for Gadot.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: When we`re waiting for Biden here?</p><p>BRENNAN: When we`re waiting for Biden.</p><p>O`KEEFE: Absolutely.</p><p>BRENNAN: And still not sure. Gadot never shows up.</p><p>O`KEEFE: Right.</p><p>BRENNAN: Is Biden going to show up?</p><p>O`KEEFE: I mean, if you believe the verbal slip-up last night at the Dover Downs, yes, he certainly made it seem like he is.</p><p>You know, I asked him earlier this week when he was at this firefighter`s union even here in D.C., along the rope line, what`s the hold-up? He says, there`s no hold-up. He just looks at history, which suggests that people who have waited a little longer than this current crop that got in, you know, at the stroke of midnight essentially as the year began, and thinks that he has some time to -- to, you know, to spend because he`s got the name --</p><p>BRENNAN: Right.</p><p>O`KEEFE: Clearly has some money ready and -- and ready to come, has locked up some staff. We don`t know to what extent their -- the size of his operation will be. But all signs still point to early April sometime before Tax Day, April 15th.</p><p>JAMAL SIMMONS, HILL.TV: You know, Ed mentions history. And with the vice president, it`s -- it`s -- I don`t -- history is actually a pretty tough marker for him.</p><p>BRENNAN: What do you mean?</p><p>SIMMONS: Democrats, you know, he is very popular. People all over the country are hungering for him to get into the race. But Democrats have never elected a sitting or former vice president to the White House before. Democrats also, if you look at -- if you go back and look at some of the FiveThirtyEight polling, the person who was ahead in the national polls at this period a year out from election day did not ultimately win the White House. And there`s only three times that person won the nomination, it was Walter Mondale in 1984, Al Gore in 2000, and Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p><p>O`KEEFE: We know that (ph).</p><p>SIMMONS: Hillary is a tough marker. So the vice president really has to, I think, take on the fact that this -- that he`s going up against these trends, and that means he has to do things differently. He needs a more diverse staff than he has had in the past, he`s got to be willing to talk about progressive issues in a way that`s more compelling than he has in the past. And I hope that`s what they`re planning.</p><p>BRENNAN: Amy, do we need new blood, as former President Obama suggested? I mean he`s not necessarily going to endorse --</p><p>AMY WALTER, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": He`s not the newest person in the -- in the mix for his years there on the Senate side.</p><p>It`s really interesting watching Democrats grappling with their choices this time. They have all kinds of opportunities here, generationally, on race, and on -- and on gender.</p><p>BRENNAN: It seems --</p><p>WALTER: And on gender. And it seems that the issue really comes down to this. How safe of a choice do Democrats want to make? And by safe we have to -- we all are going to determine that. The Democrats are going to determine that, too, in very different ways. And the safe being really, who`s the one who we know can beat Donald Trump. That`s the -- that`s the question a lot of Democrats are asking themselves, what does that mean? And -- versus the, who`s the most disruptive in this field.</p><p>Waiting for Godot`s a good description. I also think primaries are a lot like trying to figure out who you`re going to marry. And do you go with the person who really races your heart or do you go with the person you want to bring home to your parents, right? And Democrats -- it -- it -- recently --</p><p>BRENNAN: And you don`t think the two can be the same thing?</p><p>WALTER: Sometimes -- (INAUDIBLE) -- sometimes they can be both. I think Barack Obama was both. I think in 2004, remember there was that infamous bumper stick their said, dated Dean, married Kerry, right?</p><p>SIMMONS: How did that work out?</p><p>WALTER: Dean was a lot of fun. And that`s what the -- and if you`re Democrats -- a lot of Democrats will say, exactly, when we made the safe choice, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, we lost. We`ve got to go with somebody who`s going to be engaging in a very different way.</p><p>The other -- just one more quick thing about engaging and broadening, going away from safe. It`s also about broadening the electoral map outside of the presidential race.</p><p>BRENNAN: Right.</p><p>WALTER: Which is the Senate. There are a bunch of Democrats I talked to who say, we could win the White House, but if we don`t win the Senate, then, guess what, not a lot of this is going to matter. We`ve got to go into places like Texas, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia. Those are the races that are going to determine control of the senate.</p><p>SIMMONS: Arizona.</p><p>WALTER: And Arizona.</p><p>BRENNAN: It was such a rollout for Beto O`Rourke.</p><p>O`KEEFE: Right.</p><p>BRENNAN: I mean he -- people are asking like he is anointed? Is this going to backfire on him?</p><p>O`KEEFE: Well -- and I think, to the -- to the charge that the media may have overdone it, we have to remember something. I made this point repeatedly in our reporting this past week. You talk to every other campaign that`s involved in this right now, the one name that kept coming up in private conversations was always him. Is he going to do it? Do you think he can raise $80 million again? So this was them essentially goading us into saying, you know, they`re scared of him. Very scared of him.</p><p>And this coffee shop counter-top campaign that he launched this week by jumping up on countertops repeatedly -- was it you that said, I hope he brought the Windex along.</p><p>WALTER: Yes, you need some -- you need some -- well, Clorox wipes. People are eating on those things.</p><p>O`KEEFE: You know, it seems to have gone well for him. And he started very strategically in southeastern Iowa, a part of the state where Democrats used to dominate and have struggled in recent years, and repeatedly people said to me, you know, they don`t usually come to this parted of the state until later in the primary, so we give him a lot of credit for doing it. And, we`ll see.</p><p>BRENNAN: Amy, there`s been some attention to perhaps a double standard here, that Beto delayed making an announcement, he had this sort of soul-searching played out in the press, that a female candidate of the five or so we have so far, would have been punished for looking indecisive. Do you buy that?</p><p>WALTER: I`m sure there`s still -- there is still going -- and there will always be a double standard. When we look at whether they`re candidates of color or women are going to be judged different standards than white men.</p><p>At the same time, I do think every one of these candidates gets their little boomlet (ph), gets their time to make their case. And this is why the debates are going to be so important because all of this is right now is sort of fluff. When they`re all on the stage together, making the case that they have the best opportunity, I`m the best person here to go up against Donald Trump, that`s when voters really get to see what a they`re made of.</p><p>SIMMONS: You know, he`s a little bit -- I would argue that Beto O`Rourke is the best natural candidate running for this area.</p><p>BRENNAN: Natural.</p><p>SIMMONS: For this era, right? He understands social media. He`s -- he`s willing to engage in that fear in a way that Donald Trump has engaged in, And nobody else really kind of can do that.</p><p>What we don`t know is, can he do all the other things that have to be done in a campaign. Can he build out an organization? Can he raise the money? Can he withstand all the hits that are going to come his way? Those are really big things.</p><p>But, you know, this week, there was a -- a kind of a little bit of an upset. A lot of women I talked to were really upset about the way he talked about his wife and raising their kids. That came up a lot. So I took it on myself to start calling around to some of the people and friends and family of --</p><p>BRENNAN: Because he said his wife mainly raises the children.</p><p>SIMMONS: That`s right. So I started calling women who don`t live in Washington, who don`t live in California, and asking them, Michigan, Georgia, Texas, Ohio, asking them what they thought. And what -- the most interesting response was a 70-year-old woman relative in Detroit who said to me, oh, yes, I saw that. I really liked that. So I think sometimes --</p><p>BRENNAN: Because she thought she was giving -- she thought he was giving his wife credit?</p><p>SIMMONS: She thought he was giving his wife credit.</p><p>BRENNAN: I got it.</p><p>SIMMONS: So I think -- I think sometimes that -- that things sound differently to people who live in different places. And we just have to -- we have to wait and see how this all souses (ph) out from time --</p><p>WALTER: Right, which is why the process is so important. You haven`t heard Democrats yet -- it`s going to happen -- say, this process is too unwieldy. We`re going to damage the ultimate nominee by having all of these debates and this, you know, lasting far too long. Right now I think it is the only way to determine which one of these candidates meets all of those different criteria that Jamal pointed out, of who`s going to be able to raise the money, look like they can stand up to the president, be able to be inspiring, also have a pathway to the White House that looks to voters like a realistic path to the White House.</p><p>BRENNAN: All right. Well, we`ll have the leave it there with the three of you. But more to come when we come back from this break with some analysis of the week that was.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN: We turn now to our panel for some analysis on the other big news of the week. Jamal Simmons and Amy Walter are joined by Ramesh Ponnuru, who is a senior editor at \"National Review\" and a columnist for \"Bloomberg Opinion,\" and Mark Landler, who covers the White House and foreign policy for \"The New York Times.\"</p><p>Good to have you join us.</p><p>Ramesh, let me ask you, you know, Amy brought up in the last segment this point about it not just being about the 2020 presidential race. It`s also about some of these congressional seats. Senators, some of them we saw with this vote on the rebuke to the president, the accusation that maybe they were a little worried about their seats in 2020 and that may have swayed some Republicans to stick with the president instead of rebuking him.</p><p>How big of a concern and a factor was that?</p><p>RAMESH PONNURU, \"BLOOMBERG OPINION\": Well, I think it`s very striking that of the 12 Republican senators who did not vote with the president, who voted to disapprove his declaration of a national emergency, only one of them is running in 2020. There was a risk on both sides, right? There`s the general election risk because the emergency is unpopular, and the wall is unpopular. But among Republicans, it`s -- these things are very popular. And, obviously, I think a lot of Republicans showed that they were more concerned about winning their primaries than they were about the general election.</p><p>BRENNAN: Who do you have in mind? Is it Thom Tillis of North Carolina who took a lot of heat for that eleventh hour switch of his vote?</p><p>PONNURU: Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, all of them voted with the president and not with, you know, the -- the 12 Republicans, like Mitt Romney and Pat Toomey, Mike Lee and others, who had these constitutional concerns about what the president is doing.</p><p>BRENNAN: Mark, Mick Mulvaney was on this program and said that he thinks the White House, you know, has nothing to worry about with this attempt to override the veto. But how was this received inside the White House? It was the president`s first time to use the pen this this way.</p><p>MARK LANDLER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": And it was also first time the president was rebuffed this way by Republicans. Ramesh points out that several of them didn`t go the whole way.</p><p>But the fact of the matter is, after two years in which the Republicans have been just an absolute reliable sort of bastion for the president in Congress, I thought this was still symbolically important. And I`m sure that President Trump`s argument is, well, I didn`t pitch as hard as I could have. If I`d really asked for the votes, I would have gotten them.</p><p>But, nevertheless, they must be looking at this and thinking, do we have Mitch McConnell as reliably as we thought we did? And facing the prospects of more unpopular potential policy decisions and debates down the road, is this the first in what will be a more independent Republican majority in the Senate, a majority that`s going to make decisions not just blindly following the White House and President Trump?</p><p>BRENNAN: Some might say that`s wishful thinking?</p><p>WALTER: Yes.</p><p>LANDLER: Indeed. Indeed. And I stimulate that we haven`t seen it and we`ve had this same sort of discussion many, many times in the past. Well, this will be the moment that they show their independence and they continue not to do that.</p><p>But having said that, you know, this was a somewhat different set of circumstances. It didn`t play out quite as well as I think the White House hoped it would. And so that`s got to be at least somewhat concerning for them.</p><p>BRENNAN: Do you think this resonates with people at home or is it lost on them?</p><p>WALTER: I do think it -- it -- it doesn`t really resonates unless the president wants it to resonate, in which case what he does very well is turns it back against Congress. I think he loves the idea that, look, I told you people in Washington didn`t understand us or our vision for how we keep America safe. They`re -- they`re trapped in their old ways of thinking. I`m here to break us out of us. And so it actually works for him. Even when it`s members of his own party, I think this is very beneficial to him.</p><p>And I -- I do agree that -- with the question of whether this signals more dissention or whether it`s just -- this was a really easy vote. The veto -- they`re never going to have to vote on this again. They`re not going to have -- it`s going to die in the House most likely. They won`t have to vote on this again. And then it`s in the courts where ultimately it means that none of the discussion that we`re having right now may ever have to turn into reality.</p><p>BRENNAN: Ramesh, one of the few areas where we did see some -- some public criticism of the president from Republicans was on the foreign policy front. And, again, going into 2020, I guess there are some questions about, well, what does the president say he delivered on when it comes to North Korea? What does he say he delivered on with the promise to pull all troops out of Afghanistan? And we have some upcoming decisions on both of those things.</p><p>How much of a political lens should we be putting on them?</p><p>PONNURU: I tend to think that those sorts of foreign policy decisions are not all that politically significant in a presidential election, unless something has gone very, very wrong. And in that case, people start holding politicians accountable and asking why things that they themselves as voters weren`t paying attention to weren`t done.</p><p>So I -- I think the stakes politically are low, even if the stakes for our long-term national security are kind of high. Right now, I think the president can say that -- to his core voters, look, i have been trying to pull out of our commitments overseas, or at least downsize them in an intelligent way. And I think that that is going to be accepted as fine. I don`t think that there are a ton of Republican voters who are saying to themselves, you know, we need to be more involved in Syria. We need to be more involved in Iraq and Afghanistan. And so I think that he`s going to be fine on this front.</p><p>BRENNAN: Mark, we had the president go to the Pentagon on Friday for a classified briefing. Do we know what threats he was actually getting briefed on?</p><p>LANDLER: Well, we don`t precisely know what threats he was getting briefed on. The assumption is clear he was probably being briefed on North Korea. He was probably being briefed on Syria, where, after all, he made this decision to leave some American troops behind after saying he was going to withdraw them. And probably also on Afghanistan. We are in the midst of this peace reconciliation process with the Taliban, and part of that process is setting a definite timeline for withdrawing the remaining troops there.</p><p>So I am -- I`m sure all -- some combination of those issues, plus Iran, were probably all on the table at that point.</p><p>BRENNAN: And there are about 12,000 troops still in Afghanistan.</p><p>LANDLER: That`s right. And that -- that conversation has become very complicated in the last couple of weeks because the Afghan government feels that we, the United States, have cut them out of the process. We`re dealing directly with the Taliban. The Afghans are -- don`t have a seat at the table. And that`s become very contentious just in the -- in the last week in Washington with a couple visiting Afghan officials raising some very serious criticisms of the administration.</p><p>BRENNAN: Jamal, do you hear anything from this week with what`s being described as sort of a blow symbolically to the president or the frustrations in trying to deliver on some of these foreign policy promises. Is there any rich territory for Democrats to message and mine?</p><p>SIMMONS: I mean think of the Democratic political establishment or the Democratic left, the voters. People are thinking more Russia and Russian influence than they are about some of the more fine points of foreign policy. They generally get the president is not really doing very well, and the candidates don`t seem -- the Democratic candidates don`t seem to be that -- that far apart on this.</p><p>I think what people on the -- on the Democratic side are trying to do is alter an -- offer an alternate vision about what`s important. So the reason the president and immigration focuses importantly is for -- for his base is because it says to particularly white, disaffected voters, I`m the guy who`s standing up against the brown people coming into the United States and trying to preserve the country for you.</p><p>I think what the Democrats are trying to say is, there`s actually a bigger problem that happens. And so if you look at what happened with the cheating scandal with the schools, like there`s this sort of mob of people who are at the top. They`ve got all the goodies. So this goodies mob, and I`m not talking about Sealo (ph), but there`s like a goodies mob out there, right, that are dividing up all the opportunity among each other. And those are the people that we all have to be worried about. How do we tilt the scales back in favor of working people. And somebody like Elizabeth Warren, who talked about this idea of breaking up big tech companies, is somebody who`s driving this agenda on the left that says, maybe we`ve got to change the rules about how we deal with our economy, and that`s an alternate vision that I think Democrats are trying to establish and it might work.</p><p>WALTER: And yet that`s also going back to the, who -- who`s the safe choice. And for Democrats trying to balance these two very important segments of their electorate, the ones who do see that the system is rigged, they`re attracted to the Bernie Sanders message, also who`s going to turn out that Obama coalition that Hillary did not, younger voters, voters of color. But the newest coalition are those white suburban voters who came out, and guess who they voted for? They voted for Beto. That`s how Beto came so close in Texas. It wasn`t the rise or younger or Latino voters. I was white, suburban voters who came out and voted for Democrats in the House and for Beto. How do you keep those voters from either staying home or defecting back to -- to Donald Trump? If you put a candidate -- goes the theory -- someone like Elizabeth Warren, someone like Bernie Sanders, that`s going to turn off those voters who were willing to vote for say Democrats in 2018.</p><p>BRENNAN: And -- but, Jamal, Bernie Sanders is trying to woo black voters right now in South Carolina. He`s trying to make up a difference, I guess. The lesson he learned.</p><p>SIMMONS: He`s trying. But, you know, there`s a funny picture that was going around the Internet yesterday of him at an African-American church in South Carolina, but everybody in the room was white, right? And so he -- so what happened was, they -- they built a crowd, but it wasn`t actually the crowd of the membership of that particular church. So he`s got a -- he`s got a little bit of a tougher road.</p><p>I think of the two of them, Elizabeth Warren probably is the more -- is the one people may buy into a little bit more. But here`s my real guess, is that somebody, whoever the Democratic nominee is, will end up adopting a lot of the policy choices that Bernie and Elizabeth Warren put forward, because that seems to be where the passion of the left is.</p><p>BRENNAN: We will see.</p><p>Thanks to all of you.</p><p>And we will be back in a moment with a look at a unique new class of congressional interns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN: Politics and football meet head-on this spring with an unusual class of interns on Capitol Hill. CBS News special correspondent James Brown reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAMES BROWN, CBS NEWS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Michael Thomas, Austin Carr and Ryan Hunter are used to running, blocking, or catching for a living, but for the last couple of weeks, they have been running around the halls of Congress, tackling the big issues facing the country.</p><p>RYAN HUNTER, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS: I`ve been fortunate to sit in on meeting with foreign policy administrators from the Middle East, whether it be constituents from the state of Missouri and the city of Kansas City, St. Louis.</p><p>BROWN: Ryan Hunter is an offensive lineman for the Kansas City Chiefs. He`s interning for freshman Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri.</p><p>SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R), MISSOURI: It`s fun because we`re both new together. So Ryan`s new. I`m new. We`re kind of learning the ropes together. I think it`s phenomenal that NFL players like Ryan who are very busy guys and have a career that they`re pursuing want to be involved in their communities, want to be involved in service.</p><p>BROWN: Michael Thomas plays safety for the New York Giants. This is his second time working for Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents his district in Houston, Texas.</p><p>REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D), TEXAS: What a place to be, not necessarily only in my office, but in many offices where they can be change agents and translate that leadership on the field into making a difference.</p><p>MICHAEL THOMAS, NEW YORK GIANTS: Yes, after interning last year, I was like, I got to come back, because I saw firsthand what she`s doing and how much she`s really on the ground, you know, like putting in the work. A lot of things that we were fighting for, for criminal justice reform, bail reform, education, you know, re-entry with juvenile detentions and stuff like that, she`s already had bills written. You know, they`re on the floor. She`s proposing these things. So I`m like, OK, this is how we can take that next step.BROWN (on camera): And you are firmly convinced that Capitol Hill, this arena, this venue, if you will, can affect the kind of meaningful changes that you and others who have the same feelings can bring about?</p><p>THOMAS: Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, it`s going to take -- you know, it`s going to take time. You can`t -- nothing happens overnight. I can see how other people can say, man, like, they`re slow, we need -- we need something now. We need to do something now. And I get that passion. I feel it.</p><p>BROWN (voice over): Austin Carr is a wide receiver for the New Orleans Saints. He is pro-life and interested in some libertarian ideas, which is why he is interning for Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.</p><p>AUSTIN CARR, NEW ORLEANS SAINTS: I`m seeing how hard they work, and in particular Senator Rand Paul, how often he`s running to and fro to different meetings, different committee, meeting with constituents.</p><p>BROWN (on camera): What have you seen in this young man, senator?</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: We`re -- we`re glad to have him here. And I think it`s good to see another side of our athletes.</p><p>BROWN (voice over): According to the NFLPA, the average NFL career lasts just under four years. In 2014, the union started an externship program to prepare players for life after the NFL. Since then, 183 players have had on-the-job training in a variety of fields.</p><p>Michael Thomas is a member of the union`s executive board, and he sees this as an opportunity to speak for his community. Thomas was one of the players who protested police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem.</p><p>THOMAS: Me being here, being an inside intern, I see the steps that needs to be taken -- that need to be taken. I`m willing to put in the work. I`m willing to advocate for it. I`m willing to help out Congresswoman Jackson Lee any way I can using my voice and my platform, the same way I did it on the football field in taking a knee.</p><p>BROWN: Austin Carr met with the attorney general of Louisiana to talk about the opioid crisis.</p><p>CARR: Nationwide, the U.S. consumes 80 percent of opioids in the world, right?</p><p>BROWN: Ryan Hunter learned more about brain injuries after meeting with the Society for Neuroscience.</p><p>HUNTER: I`d rather be here than be in the Bahamas, because I`m learning so much for the future that this -- this experience on its own beats, you know, having an umbrella drink on the beach.</p><p>BROWN: These pro athletes came to Washington to learn from political leaders, but their mentors seem to learn from them, as well.</p><p>PAUL: But, no, I`m glad to see that Austin, you know, believes strongly in his faith and that it sounds like he wants to be part of trying to make things better in the country, but also be an example for, you know, kids out there that look up to our -- our stars.</p><p>HAWLEY: Having players say, I want to be involved, I want to serve, I want to see it from the inside, I want to do something about that, that`s awesome. We need more of that. And I think Ryan`s a great example.</p><p>JACKSON LEE: I hope he will be able to be here when we are seeing these bills pass out of the House and the Senate where we have changed the criminal justice system. Wouldn`t that be great? That`s my heart and passion. And I hope he will be part of it.</p><p>THOMAS: Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN: And we`ll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN: That`s it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I`m Margaret Brennan.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2193261421</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2X-79N1-DY0W-40JN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9185\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming Copyright MMXIX CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Happy St. Patrick`s day.</p><p>We begin with acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.</p><p>And happy St. Patrick`s day to you.</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  And to you, Ms.  Brennan.</p><p>BRENNAN:  I want to get right to it, in the wake of this horrific terror attack in New Zealand.</p><p>You know, there`s a lot of parsing of the president`s own language in referring to what happened here.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the number of attacks and support for white supremacy is up, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.  And even a Trump-appointed attorney in the state of Virginia, Thomas Cullen, was recently quoted as saying: \"White supremacy and far right extremism are among the greatest domestic security threats facing the United States.\"</p><p>Has the president been briefed on this?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Well, I don`t know who that gentleman is.  Certainly, the president`s briefed on all of...</p><p>BRENNAN:  You know who the Southern Poverty Law Center is.</p><p>MULVANEY:  I do.  I do.</p><p>The president`s absolutely briefed on all of the threats, both domestic and international.  But I want to push back against this idea that every time something bad happens everywhere around the world, folks who don`t like Donald Trump seem to blame it on Donald Trump.</p><p>I`m hoping we can get...</p><p>BRENNAN:  I`m not blaming it on the president.  I was asking about...</p><p>MULVANEY:  I didn`t say -- didn`t say...</p><p>BRENNAN:  ... his characterization.</p><p>MULVANEY:  I didn`t say you.  I`m saying that that`s clearly what some folks want -- want to do.  I have heard other members of -- of the Democrat Party trying to do it, folks at the Southern Poverty Law Center here trying to do it.</p><p>This is a tragic thing that happened in New Zealand.</p><p>BRENNAN:  They`re just saying the number of white nationalist groups has surged by 50 percent.</p><p>MULVANEY:  Since Trump has become -- office, right?</p><p>BRENNAN:  Well, in the past year.</p><p>MULVANEY:  There you go.  So, he -- here`s the point.  Why can`t we...</p><p>BRENNAN:  So, do you disagree that it`s a rising threat?</p><p>MULVANEY:  I -- I -- I -- I disagree that there`s a causal link between Donald Trump being president and something like this happening in New Zealand.</p><p>BRENNAN:  But that`s not the argument or the suggestion there...</p><p>MULVANEY:  OK, good.</p><p>BRENNAN:  ... by the judge or by that statistic.  Is the president aware that this is a rising threat?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Again, a rising threat.</p><p>I think the president you saw -- you saw him asked the other day, does he think it`s a rising threat?  And he says no.  I think there`s information that would back that up.</p><p>The issue is, how do you stop these crazy people?  Whether or not there`s one of them or four of them doesn`t make a difference, if they`re willing to go on live TV and stream the murder of people.  So I think that`s where the time is better spent.</p><p>Instead of worrying about, well, who`s to -- who`s to blame, how do we stop from doing this?  Donald Trump is no more to blame for what happened in New Zealand than Mark Zuckerberg is because he invented Facebook.  There are some terrible people in the world.  We need to work with our partners, of which New Zealand is one of, and to try and figure a way to find them, expose them and bring them to justice.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Well, President Trump, and certainly during the campaign talked quite a lot about the need to be specific, to name a threat in order to counter it.</p><p>So why minimize it?  Why not directly address white supremacy, and specifically Islamophobia?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Yes, I get a lot of questions about...</p><p>BRENNAN:  Because a number of world leaders did.  And the president didn`t.</p><p>MULVANEY:  I get a lot of questions from people saying, why -- you need to tell the president to do X, you need to tell the president to go and give it an Oval Office address on this or on that.</p><p>That`s not how the system works.  The president communicates in his way.  Different presidents have communicated in their way.  I don`t think anybody can -- can claim that Donald Trump hasn`t done exactly what we would want him to do in this circumstance.</p><p>We`ve immediately reached out to our allies.  We`ve expressed the absolute disgust at the tragic -- at the tragic events.  We`re doing what presidents are supposed to do.</p><p>That doesn`t mean it`s going to make everybody happy because of the hyper partisan times we live in.  But, again, I really -- it frustrates me, just as a citizen, that everything -- something -- every time something goes wrong around the world now, not just in our country, somehow, the president of the United States must be responsible.</p><p>And that`s just -- that`s absurd, and it doesn`t help contribute to the dialogue that`s necessary to fix these problems.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Point taken, but the president of the United States carries a megaphone louder than anyone in the world, and arguably this president likes to use his.</p><p>So, because you`re frustrated, why not remove any shadow of a doubt?  I mean during the campaign, as you know, as a candidate, the president called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States.  He said Islam hates us.</p><p>This kind of language in the past leads to these questions of, why isn`t the president now directly using that megaphone to condemn it?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Well then -- take -- take -- take -- take the words and put them in one category, and take the actions and put them in another.</p><p>Something the president doesn`t get hardly any credit for or any attention to is the work he`s done in defense of religious minorities all around the world, up to and including Muslims in the Middle East.  Some of the religious minorities that are the worst oppressed to the Middle East are some of the ones that this administration has been doing -- going to great lengths to protect.</p><p>So I hear what folks says, oh, Donald Trump said this during the campaign. Look at what we`ve done while we`ve been here.  I don`t think anybody could say that the president is anti-Muslim.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Well, the president`s tweeting now about a TV host who was suspended for anti-Muslim rhetoric.</p><p>So, it`s -- it`s, I think, a fair question to ask you about this.</p><p>But I want to move on to one of the fights that is going on in Congress and questions from a number of senators about exactly what programs are going to lose funding...</p><p>MULVANEY:  Sure.</p><p>BRENNAN:  ... in order to put together funding for the border wall.</p><p>When will the White House give this detailed list, specifically on military projects, to Congress?</p><p>MULVANEY:  It could be a while, and here`s why.  Here`s -- here`s what`s happening, is that we`ve already told Congress this, which is that none of the programs that were scheduled to be started or what we call obligated in 2019, so between now and the end of September, will be impacted at all.</p><p>BRENNAN:  The service chiefs have told Congress they have that list, but the White House is not...</p><p>MULVANEY:  No.</p><p>BRENNAN:  ... handing that list over.</p><p>MULVANEY:  No, no, that that`s absolutely -- I know of no list.  And if anybody should know, it would be me.</p><p>There`s no list of projects that are absolutely going to not be funded so that the wall can be.  What it is, is a list of programs that fit the criteria that I have just laid out for you, which is that they are meant to be funded beyond the end of this fiscal year.</p><p>Why is that important?  Because if we -- if it`s going to be a project that would have been funded, say, in 2021, OK, it gives us another couple of years to what we call backfill.  Congress will pass another appropriation this year, next year, so that ultimately none of the programs would be impacted.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Senator Tim Kaine, who sits on Armed Services, is going to be on the show later in the program.</p><p>But when we spoke with him, he specifically said that he thinks the White House is withholding these details until after this upcoming vote on the veto override occurs.  In other words, you`re trying to keep Republicans on board, and if you fully inform them about what you`re going to do to their district, then you might lose their vote.</p><p>MULVANEY:  I -- I don`t -- I will watch the show.  And, in fact, if I catch Tim in the green room, I will ask him what the basis is for that.</p><p>Does he just think it because he wants it to be true or someone told him there was actually a list?  Because, again, I`m chief of staff.  I`m also still technically over at the Office of Management and Budget.</p><p>BRENNAN:  And you still don`t know what`s getting cut?</p><p>MULVANEY:  And I know of no list that specifically...</p><p>BRENNAN:  And you don`t know what`s getting cut?</p><p>MULVANEY:  That`s correct.</p><p>I know of the universe of things that might be delayed or reduced or cut in a very extreme circumstance that could be funded -- used to fund the wall, but a list of a decision that`s already been made, saying, this money is going to be cut and spent over there, that`s not been made yet.</p><p>BRENNAN:  So, remove any doubt.  You say, no matter what these details are, you still have the votes to override...</p><p>MULVANEY:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BRENNAN:  ... this veto?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BRENNAN:  To block any kind of override?</p><p>MULVANEY:  Yes, no, we fully expect the veto override to fail in the House.</p><p>BRENNAN:  All right, thank you, Mick Mulvaney, for joining us.</p><p>MULVANEY:  Thanks, Margaret.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Just to clarify, that host is FOX News` Jeanine Pirro.</p><p>The network has condemned her commentary, and her broadcast did not air last night.</p><p>We spoke yesterday with Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.  He had just returned from a visit to the Venezuelan border and spoke to us from Bogota, Colombia.</p><p>We asked Senator Kaine about President Trump saying that he did not think white nationalism was a rising threat around the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA:  Margaret, it is on the rise.  And the president should call it out.</p><p>But, sadly, he`s not doing that.  We saw in the aftermath of the horrible attack in Charlottesville that he tried to say that the white supremacists, neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates there were just, you know, good people.</p><p>But when you see church shootings in Charleston, a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, you see this hate-filled manifesto of the shooter in New Zealand who is murdering Muslims, we have to confront the fact that there is a rise in white supremacy, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim attitudes.</p><p>The president uses language often that`s very similar to the language used by these bigots and racists.  And if he`s not going to call it out, then other leaders have to do more to call it out.  And I certainly will.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Well, the president did say it was a horrible thing that happened,but he said that the white nationalism issue is just a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.</p><p>What do you attribute the rise to?</p><p>KAINE:  Well, they have problems, but I think the president is using language that emboldens them.</p><p>He`s not creating them.  They`re out there.  But at the same time as he was tweeting out yesterday his support for the family members in New Zealand -- and that was appropriate -- he was vetoing the Senate`s rejection of his emergency declaration from Thursday.</p><p>And he used the word invaders to characterize people coming to the nation`s southern borders, which was exactly the same phrase that the shooter in New Zealand used to characterize the Muslims that he was attacking.  That kind of language from the person who probably has the loudest microphone on the planet Earth is hurtful and dangerous, and it tends to incite violence.</p><p>BRENNAN:  I want to ask you about an exchange you had this week that seemed quite tense.  You were very clearly frustrated with the acting secretary of defense, Shanahan, because you were asking why a list of military projects had not been provided to Congress that would be directly impacted by funding cuts due to reallocation for the president`s border wall.</p><p>KAINE:  I`m on the Armed Services Committee.  I represent Virginia.</p><p>I have a child in the military.  So I sent a letter on February 15 to the secretary of defense and said, if you`re going to ransack the Pentagon`s budget, tell me what projects you`re going to cut or delay or eliminate.  They wouldn`t provide an answer.</p><p>At the hearing on Thursday, we`re now going to vote that day on whether we support or reject the emergency declaration.  And they still hadn`t answered our question:  What projects are at stake?</p><p>At the hearing, he said, oh, I will send you the list later this afternoon.</p><p>And you`re right.  I kind of blew up at him.  You`re going to give us the list after we vote?  This is highly relevant to the vote about the president`s emergency declaration.  What projects are you going to ransack out of the Pentagon budget?  Is it going to be military housing?  Is it going to be trying to make our bases safer from terrorism with construction projects?</p><p>Is it going to be rebuilding Tyndall Air Force Base that got blitzed in the hurricanes last fall?  And they said they would give us the list after.</p><p>But, Margaret, to add insult to injury, they had to walk that back.  They don`t even want to give us the list now at all, because we`re going to have to have an override vote.  I don`t think the White House wants us to see the list before the override vote.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Why do you think the White House is withholding this information you say is so relevant because of an upcoming vote?</p><p>KAINE:  I think there`s one reason.</p><p>BRENNAN:  You`re -- you`re connecting.  You think they`re trying to influence the outcome of it?</p><p>KAINE:  Absolutely.  This is not the secretary of defense, in my view.  This is the White House wanting to hold the list back because they worry that, if senators and House members saw the potential projects that were going to be ransacked to pay for the president`s wall, they would lose votes.</p><p>And I think they`re going to try to hide the list until that veto override vote occurs in the House and then in the Senate.</p><p>BRENNAN:  You are, of course, in Colombia nearby what is a country that is really crippled in many ways economically right now, Venezuela.</p><p>There are about three million refugees who have fled.  The energy and oil industry is collapsing, as is the economy there.  What is it that you were going to the border to see?  What did you learn?</p><p>KAINE:  Well, Margaret, I wanted to see a couple of things, one, to support the Colombian government because their effort to provide assistance to these millions of Venezolanos has been really momentous, but, secondly, learn what more the United States can do.</p><p>We have worked together actually in an accord between the administration and Congress to provide significant amounts of humanitarian aid, to work together, to pull together a coalition of nations.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Nicolas Maduro still is in charge of that country, whether we like it or not.  And these sanctions have not seemingly changed his calculus.</p><p>The visas, the diplomatic isolation, what is this actually accomplishing at this point?</p><p>KAINE:  Well, it`s -- it`s giving hope to Venezuelans that there may finally be some change.  The question isn`t whether Maduro likes it or not.  The question is what the Venezuelan people want.</p><p>And the National Assembly has determined that the election of President Maduro was illegitimate.  There needs to be a new government.</p><p>So, what more can we do more?</p><p>BRENNAN:  Yes.</p><p>KAINE:  More humanitarian aid, more work together to pull more nations into our coalition.  The sanctions are important.  They`re having an effect.</p><p>Sanctions are economic, but there are also visa restrictions on Maduro and his cronies as they try to travel abroad.  We need to give hope to the Venezuelan people that we stand with them and support them.  It`s a massive humanitarian crisis driven by one person, Nicolas Maduro, and the Venezuelan people are speaking out, and they want something better.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Has the Trump administration, whose policy you seem to support right now, have they underestimated how strong he is?</p><p>KAINE:  No, I don`t know that they`ve underestimated it.</p><p>Look, this is -- this is not easy.  It`s a difficult situation.  And I do generally support what the Trump administration has done, with one exception.  I think loose talk about U.S. military action is a big mistake, one, because that`s not for the president.  It`s for Congress.</p><p>But second, the right strategy here -- there`s only one person using the military against Venezuelans.  And it`s Maduro.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Senator Kaine, thank you for joining us.  Safe travels.</p><p>KAINE:  Thank you, Margaret.  Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN:  We will be back in one minute with a lot more FACE THE NATION.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN:  We`re back now with former federal prosecutor Preet Bharara.</p><p>He was, of course, fired by President Trump after he refused to sign as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.</p><p>And he has a new book out, \"Doing Justice: A Prosecutor`s Thoughts on Crime, Punishment, and the Rule of Law.\"</p><p>Preet, good to have you here.</p><p>PREET BHARARA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BRENNAN:  I read the book.</p><p>I want to get to some of the news of the week, but first ask you actually how you ended this book, because I think it resonates this week, in the wake of the terror attack in New Zealand.</p><p>You recount a story and a case of a hate crime against someone who wanted to go out and kill Arabs after 9/11 and ended up killing some -- or -- and then injuring some South Asian individuals instead.</p><p>Is this just a continuation of Islamophobia, of white nationalism?  Is there something here?  Or, is -- as the president says, it`s not really a broader issue at all?</p><p>BHARARA:  Yes.  Well, thanks for asking about the end of the book.</p><p>I think a lot of the world is mourning the loss of innocent lives, up to 50 now, in New Zealand.  And, you know, from my old vantage point as a law enforcement officer, the chief law enforcement officer federally in Manhattan, law enforcement has certain tools, right?</p><p>You can do surveillance.  You can infiltrate organizations that propound hate and try to engage in terrorist acts.  You can also hold people accountable after the fact.</p><p>But one of the points I make in the book, \"Doing Justice,\" over and over again is, laws are not enough.  Law can do some things, but, at the end of the day, if you want to quell people`s hatred, you want to make people get along better, you want to have harmony, you have to have good people who are willing to step up to the plate and do, among other things, call out bad things when they happen.</p><p>And in the case that I was referring to that you mentioned in the -- in the end part of the book, it was a Bangladeshi immigrant after 9/11 who was shot in the face by someone, Mark Anthony Stroman, who decided that he wanted to take revenge on behalf of, I guess, his race for people who had perpetrated the act of 9/11, obviously, going and randomly shooting people where they worked.</p><p>And Rais Bhuiyan was not killed and decided in a way that I think is extraordinary to forgive the person who tried to kill him and tried to get him off death row and -- and spare him the death penalty.  He wasn`t ultimately successful.</p><p>But, to my mind, it`s an -- it`s an inspiring story of how some people go beyond what the law even requires, beyond what the law allows, to try to have forgiveness and -- and harmony go forward in the world.  And I think we need a little bit more of that and a little bit less of the nasty rhetoric and a little bit less of, you know, people like the president not stepping up to the plate and calling out bad things when they`re happening.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Important note there in this week.</p><p>But I want to turn to some of the other news that we`ve seen on the political and legal front.  You know, we saw on Friday the special counsel again asked for the fifth time a delay in the sentencing of Rick Gates, who was a -- a Trump campaign deputy, because, it was said, he`s cooperating.</p><p>How should people understand this?  What does this mean?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BHARARA:  Well, not just cooperating, but cooperating in -- quote, unquote -- \"several investigations.\"</p><p>And so, you know, I`m an outsider now, and I don`t still run the Southern District of New York, and I`m not aware of what`s going with various investigations that sometimes, you know, intersect with the special counsel`s investigation.</p><p>But I think people should view with some skepticism the notion that gets breathlessly reported every week that the Mueller investigation is coming to an end.  It may be, because Andrew Weissmann, who is one of the top deputies -- in fact, the top deputy -- with Robert Mueller, announced that he was stepping down, which indicates maybe it`s wrapping up.</p><p>But then, as you point out, you have this letter about Rick Gates, who`s cooperating in multiple investigations, and they delay the sentencing, which seems to indicate that he is substantially cooperating and engaging in some success for the prosecuting team.</p><p>So, you might expect other indictments, other work going forward.  So it doesn`t seem to me, based on that, although I don`t know, that the work of the special counsel is ending any time soon, unless it`s the case -- the one caveat I have is, unless it`s the case that the cases on which Rick Gates is cooperating are being parceled out -- parceled out to other U.S. attorney`s office -- offices like the Southern District of New York or D.C. or somewhere else, so the special counsel team can step back and have its work be done.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Steve Bannon and a few other individuals have said that actually the biggest risk to the president is not from the special counsel, but actually the Southern District of New York, which you know well.</p><p>Do you agree with that?</p><p>BHARARA:  Well, I don`t know if I -- I would frame it that way.  It`s a sort of a polemical way to frame it, but, yes, in the sense that the SDNY, which I led for 7.5 years, doesn`t have the circumscription on its ambit in the same way the special counsel does.</p><p>The special counsel was appointed, you know, under a particular regulation, and was supposed to look at only things relating to interference in the election and potentially collusion -- quote, unquote -- \"collusion\" with -- with Russians in connection with the election, and anything arising from it.</p><p>And one of those things that -- that arose from it was obstruction.  The Southern District of New York has a lot of people in it whose mission is only to find crime, be able to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, if it`s in the interests of justice to do it.  And they`re very aggressive and they`re very fearless and they`re very independent.</p><p>They don`t care about politics.  When I was there, we prosecuted Democrats and Republicans, and it didn`t matter who they were, you know, affiliated with.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Yes.</p><p>BHARARA:  And -- and so when one of -- one of the things I try to say in the book is to explain the philosophy and the culture of the men and women of the Southern District of New York.</p><p>BRENNAN:  And, of course, state and federal charges and how a president`s pardon could affect them are -- are different too.</p><p>I want to ask you as well about Paul Manafort.  He was sentenced in D.C. this week.  The sentence was added to, before that in Virginia, what some would characterize as a light sentence.</p><p>Do you think justice is done?</p><p>BHARARA:  It`s hard to say.  You know, punishment is a very difficult thing to calibrate.</p><p>You know, whether a few months more, a few months less...</p><p>BRENNAN:  Yes.</p><p>BHARARA:  ... is in the interest of justice is hard to measure like -- like mathematics.</p><p>I agree with the people who said that the first sentence of Paul Manafort of 47 months was a bit low, given the guidelines and given the nature and seriousness of the crime and how long it went on.  I think that, overall, the addition of 3.5 years from Judge Amy Berman Jackson makes it overall a 7.5-year sentence, which is closer to right.</p><p>I still think it`s overall low, but it`s hard to determine.</p><p>BRENNAN:  Preet Bharara, thank you for joining us.</p><p>BHARARA:  Thanks, Margaret.</p><p>BRENNAN:  The book is \"Doing Justice.\"</p><p>We`ll be back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN:  There are two more candidates in the presidential race, but it`s one who is not in the race, at least yet, who raised eyebrows when he accidentally made a slip in his speech last night.</p><p>Our Ed O`Keefe reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ED O`KEEFE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The man many Democrats are waiting for sure sounded like a presidential candidate Saturday night.</p><p>BIDEN:  I have the most progressive record of anybody running for the -- if -- anybody who would run.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>O`KEEFE:  Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected the make it official next month.</p><p>SEN.

He just looks at history, which suggests that people who have waited a little longer than this current crop that got in, you know, at the stroke of midnight essentially as the year began, and thinks that he has some time to -- to, you know, to spend because he`s got the name --</p><p>BRENNAN: Right.</p><p>O`KEEFE: Clearly has some money ready and -- and ready to come, has locked up some staff. We don`t know to what extent their -- the size of his operation will be. But all signs still point to early April sometime before Tax Day, April 15th.</p><p>JAMAL SIMMONS, HILL.TV: You know, Ed mentions history. And with the vice president, it`s -- it`s -- I don`t -- history is actually a pretty tough marker for him.</p><p>BRENNAN: What do you mean?</p><p>SIMMONS: Democrats, you know, he is very popular. People all over the country are hungering for him to get into the race. But Democrats have never elected a sitting or former vice president to the White House before. Democrats also, if you look at -- if you go back and look at some of the FiveThirtyEight polling, the person who was ahead in the national polls at this period a year out from election day did not ultimately win the White House. And there`s only three times that person won the nomination, it was Walter Mondale in 1984, Al Gore in 2000, and Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p><p>O`KEEFE: We know that (ph).</p><p>SIMMONS: Hillary is a tough marker. So the vice president really has to, I think, take on the fact that this -- that he`s going up against these trends, and that means he has to do things differently. He needs a more diverse staff than he has had in the past, he`s got to be willing to talk about progressive issues in a way that`s more compelling than he has in the past. And I hope that`s what they`re planning.</p><p>BRENNAN: Amy, do we need new blood, as former President Obama suggested? I mean he`s not necessarily going to endorse --</p><p>AMY WALTER, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": He`s not the newest person in the -- in the mix for his years there on the Senate side.</p><p>It`s really interesting watching Democrats grappling with their choices this time. They have all kinds of opportunities here, generationally, on race, and on -- and on gender.</p><p>BRENNAN: It seems --</p><p>WALTER: And on gender. And it seems that the issue really comes down to this. How safe of a choice do Democrats want to make? And by safe we have to -- we all are going to determine that. The Democrats are going to determine that, too, in very different ways. And the safe being really, who`s the one who we know can beat Donald Trump. That`s the -- that`s the question a lot of Democrats are asking themselves, what does that mean? And -- versus the, who`s the most disruptive in this field.</p><p>Waiting for Godot`s a good description. I also think primaries are a lot like trying to figure out who you`re going to marry. And do you go with the person who really races your heart or do you go with the person you want to bring home to your parents, right? And Democrats -- it -- it -- recently --</p><p>BRENNAN: And you don`t think the two can be the same thing?</p><p>WALTER: Sometimes -- (INAUDIBLE) -- sometimes they can be both. I think Barack Obama was both. I think in 2004, remember there was that infamous bumper stick their said, dated Dean, married Kerry, right?</p><p>SIMMONS: How did that work out?</p><p>WALTER: Dean was a lot of fun. And that`s what the -- and if you`re Democrats -- a lot of Democrats will say, exactly, when we made the safe choice, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, we lost. We`ve got to go with somebody who`s going to be engaging in a very different way.</p><p>The other -- just one more quick thing about engaging and broadening, going away from safe. It`s also about broadening the electoral map outside of the presidential race.</p><p>BRENNAN: Right.</p><p>WALTER: Which is the Senate. There are a bunch of Democrats I talked to who say, we could win the White House, but if we don`t win the Senate, then, guess what, not a lot of this is going to matter. We`ve got to go into places like Texas, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia. Those are the races that are going to determine control of the senate.</p><p>SIMMONS: Arizona.</p><p>WALTER: And Arizona.</p><p>BRENNAN: It was such a rollout for Beto O`Rourke.</p><p>O`KEEFE: Right.</p><p>BRENNAN: I mean he -- people are asking like he is anointed? Is this going to backfire on him?</p><p>O`KEEFE: Well -- and I think, to the -- to the charge that the media may have overdone it, we have to remember something. I made this point repeatedly in our reporting this past week. You talk to every other campaign that`s involved in this right now, the one name that kept coming up in private conversations was always him. Is he going to do it? Do you think he can raise $80 million again? So this was them essentially goading us into saying, you know, they`re scared of him. Very scared of him.</p><p>And this coffee shop counter-top campaign that he launched this week by jumping up on countertops repeatedly -- was it you that said, I hope he brought the Windex along.</p><p>WALTER: Yes, you need some -- you need some -- well, Clorox wipes. People are eating on those things.</p><p>O`KEEFE: You know, it seems to have gone well for him. And he started very strategically in southeastern Iowa, a part of the state where Democrats used to dominate and have struggled in recent years, and repeatedly people said to me, you know, they don`t usually come to this parted of the state until later in the primary, so we give him a lot of credit for doing it. And, we`ll see.</p><p>BRENNAN: Amy, there`s been some attention to perhaps a double standard here, that Beto delayed making an announcement, he had this sort of soul-searching played out in the press, that a female candidate of the five or so we have so far, would have been punished for looking indecisive. Do you buy that?</p><p>WALTER: I`m sure there`s still -- there is still going -- and there will always be a double standard. When we look at whether they`re candidates of color or women are going to be judged different standards than white men.</p><p>At the same time, I do think every one of these candidates gets their little boomlet (ph), gets their time to make their case. And this is why the debates are going to be so important because all of this is right now is sort of fluff. When they`re all on the stage together, making the case that they have the best opportunity, I`m the best person here to go up against Donald Trump, that`s when voters really get to see what a they`re made of.</p><p>SIMMONS: You know, he`s a little bit -- I would argue that Beto O`Rourke is the best natural candidate running for this area.</p><p>BRENNAN: Natural.</p><p>SIMMONS: For this era, right? He understands social media. He`s -- he`s willing to engage in that fear in a way that Donald Trump has engaged in, And nobody else really kind of can do that.</p><p>What we don`t know is, can he do all the other things that have to be done in a campaign. Can he build out an organization? Can he raise the money? Can he withstand all the hits that are going to come his way? Those are really big things.</p><p>But, you know, this week, there was a -- a kind of a little bit of an upset. A lot of women I talked to were really upset about the way he talked about his wife and raising their kids. That came up a lot. So I took it on myself to start calling around to some of the people and friends and family of --</p><p>BRENNAN: Because he said his wife mainly raises the children.</p><p>SIMMONS: That`s right. So I started calling women who don`t live in Washington, who don`t live in California, and asking them, Michigan, Georgia, Texas, Ohio, asking them what they thought. And what -- the most interesting response was a 70-year-old woman relative in Detroit who said to me, oh, yes, I saw that. I really liked that. So I think sometimes --</p><p>BRENNAN: Because she thought she was giving -- she thought he was giving his wife credit?</p><p>SIMMONS: She thought he was giving his wife credit.</p><p>BRENNAN: I got it.</p><p>SIMMONS: So I think -- I think sometimes that -- that things sound differently to people who live in different places. And we just have to -- we have to wait and see how this all souses (ph) out from time --</p><p>WALTER: Right, which is why the process is so important. You haven`t heard Democrats yet -- it`s going to happen -- say, this process is too unwieldy. We`re going to damage the ultimate nominee by having all of these debates and this, you know, lasting far too long. Right now I think it is the only way to determine which one of these candidates meets all of those different criteria that Jamal pointed out, of who`s going to be able to raise the money, look like they can stand up to the president, be able to be inspiring, also have a pathway to the White House that looks to voters like a realistic path to the White House.</p><p>BRENNAN: All right. Well, we`ll have the leave it there with the three of you. But more to come when we come back from this break with some analysis of the week that was.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN: We turn now to our panel for some analysis on the other big news of the week. Jamal Simmons and Amy Walter are joined by Ramesh Ponnuru, who is a senior editor at \"National Review\" and a columnist for \"Bloomberg Opinion,\" and Mark Landler, who covers the White House and foreign policy for \"The New York Times.\"</p><p>Good to have you join us.</p><p>Ramesh, let me ask you, you know, Amy brought up in the last segment this point about it not just being about the 2020 presidential race. It`s also about some of these congressional seats. Senators, some of them we saw with this vote on the rebuke to the president, the accusation that maybe they were a little worried about their seats in 2020 and that may have swayed some Republicans to stick with the president instead of rebuking him.</p><p>How big of a concern and a factor was that?</p><p>RAMESH PONNURU, \"BLOOMBERG OPINION\": Well, I think it`s very striking that of the 12 Republican senators who did not vote with the president, who voted to disapprove his declaration of a national emergency, only one of them is running in 2020. There was a risk on both sides, right? There`s the general election risk because the emergency is unpopular, and the wall is unpopular. But among Republicans, it`s -- these things are very popular. And, obviously, I think a lot of Republicans showed that they were more concerned about winning their primaries than they were about the general election.</p><p>BRENNAN: Who do you have in mind? Is it Thom Tillis of North Carolina who took a lot of heat for that eleventh hour switch of his vote?</p><p>PONNURU: Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, all of them voted with the president and not with, you know, the -- the 12 Republicans, like Mitt Romney and Pat Toomey, Mike Lee and others, who had these constitutional concerns about what the president is doing.</p><p>BRENNAN: Mark, Mick Mulvaney was on this program and said that he thinks the White House, you know, has nothing to worry about with this attempt to override the veto. But how was this received inside the White House? It was the president`s first time to use the pen this this way.</p><p>MARK LANDLER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": And it was also first time the president was rebuffed this way by Republicans. Ramesh points out that several of them didn`t go the whole way.</p><p>But the fact of the matter is, after two years in which the Republicans have been just an absolute reliable sort of bastion for the president in Congress, I thought this was still symbolically important. And I`m sure that President Trump`s argument is, well, I didn`t pitch as hard as I could have. If I`d really asked for the votes, I would have gotten them.</p><p>But, nevertheless, they must be looking at this and thinking, do we have Mitch McConnell as reliably as we thought we did? And facing the prospects of more unpopular potential policy decisions and debates down the road, is this the first in what will be a more independent Republican majority in the Senate, a majority that`s going to make decisions not just blindly following the White House and President Trump?</p><p>BRENNAN: Some might say that`s wishful thinking?</p><p>WALTER: Yes.</p><p>LANDLER: Indeed. Indeed. And I stimulate that we haven`t seen it and we`ve had this same sort of discussion many, many times in the past. Well, this will be the moment that they show their independence and they continue not to do that.</p><p>But having said that, you know, this was a somewhat different set of circumstances. It didn`t play out quite as well as I think the White House hoped it would. And so that`s got to be at least somewhat concerning for them.</p><p>BRENNAN: Do you think this resonates with people at home or is it lost on them?</p><p>WALTER: I do think it -- it -- it doesn`t really resonates unless the president wants it to resonate, in which case what he does very well is turns it back against Congress. I think he loves the idea that, look, I told you people in Washington didn`t understand us or our vision for how we keep America safe. They`re -- they`re trapped in their old ways of thinking. I`m here to break us out of us. And so it actually works for him. Even when it`s members of his own party, I think this is very beneficial to him.</p><p>And I -- I do agree that -- with the question of whether this signals more dissention or whether it`s just -- this was a really easy vote. The veto -- they`re never going to have to vote on this again. They`re not going to have -- it`s going to die in the House most likely. They won`t have to vote on this again. And then it`s in the courts where ultimately it means that none of the discussion that we`re having right now may ever have to turn into reality.</p><p>BRENNAN: Ramesh, one of the few areas where we did see some -- some public criticism of the president from Republicans was on the foreign policy front. And, again, going into 2020, I guess there are some questions about, well, what does the president say he delivered on when it comes to North Korea? What does he say he delivered on with the promise to pull all troops out of Afghanistan? And we have some upcoming decisions on both of those things.</p><p>How much of a political lens should we be putting on them?</p><p>PONNURU: I tend to think that those sorts of foreign policy decisions are not all that politically significant in a presidential election, unless something has gone very, very wrong. And in that case, people start holding politicians accountable and asking why things that they themselves as voters weren`t paying attention to weren`t done.</p><p>So I -- I think the stakes politically are low, even if the stakes for our long-term national security are kind of high. Right now, I think the president can say that -- to his core voters, look, i have been trying to pull out of our commitments overseas, or at least downsize them in an intelligent way. And I think that that is going to be accepted as fine. I don`t think that there are a ton of Republican voters who are saying to themselves, you know, we need to be more involved in Syria. We need to be more involved in Iraq and Afghanistan. And so I think that he`s going to be fine on this front.</p><p>BRENNAN: Mark, we had the president go to the Pentagon on Friday for a classified briefing. Do we know what threats he was actually getting briefed on?</p><p>LANDLER: Well, we don`t precisely know what threats he was getting briefed on. The assumption is clear he was probably being briefed on North Korea. He was probably being briefed on Syria, where, after all, he made this decision to leave some American troops behind after saying he was going to withdraw them. And probably also on Afghanistan. We are in the midst of this peace reconciliation process with the Taliban, and part of that process is setting a definite timeline for withdrawing the remaining troops there.</p><p>So I am -- I`m sure all -- some combination of those issues, plus Iran, were probably all on the table at that point.</p><p>BRENNAN: And there are about 12,000 troops still in Afghanistan.</p><p>LANDLER: That`s right. And that -- that conversation has become very complicated in the last couple of weeks because the Afghan government feels that we, the United States, have cut them out of the process. We`re dealing directly with the Taliban. The Afghans are -- don`t have a seat at the table. And that`s become very contentious just in the -- in the last week in Washington with a couple visiting Afghan officials raising some very serious criticisms of the administration.</p><p>BRENNAN: Jamal, do you hear anything from this week with what`s being described as sort of a blow symbolically to the president or the frustrations in trying to deliver on some of these foreign policy promises. Is there any rich territory for Democrats to message and mine?</p><p>SIMMONS: I mean think of the Democratic political establishment or the Democratic left, the voters. People are thinking more Russia and Russian influence than they are about some of the more fine points of foreign policy. They generally get the president is not really doing very well, and the candidates don`t seem -- the Democratic candidates don`t seem to be that -- that far apart on this.</p><p>I think what people on the -- on the Democratic side are trying to do is alter an -- offer an alternate vision about what`s important. So the reason the president and immigration focuses importantly is for -- for his base is because it says to particularly white, disaffected voters, I`m the guy who`s standing up against the brown people coming into the United States and trying to preserve the country for you.</p><p>I think what the Democrats are trying to say is, there`s actually a bigger problem that happens. And so if you look at what happened with the cheating scandal with the schools, like there`s this sort of mob of people who are at the top. They`ve got all the goodies. So this goodies mob, and I`m not talking about Sealo (ph), but there`s like a goodies mob out there, right, that are dividing up all the opportunity among each other. And those are the people that we all have to be worried about. How do we tilt the scales back in favor of working people. And somebody like Elizabeth Warren, who talked about this idea of breaking up big tech companies, is somebody who`s driving this agenda on the left that says, maybe we`ve got to change the rules about how we deal with our economy, and that`s an alternate vision that I think Democrats are trying to establish and it might work.</p><p>WALTER: And yet that`s also going back to the, who -- who`s the safe choice. And for Democrats trying to balance these two very important segments of their electorate, the ones who do see that the system is rigged, they`re attracted to the Bernie Sanders message, also who`s going to turn out that Obama coalition that Hillary did not, younger voters, voters of color. But the newest coalition are those white suburban voters who came out, and guess who they voted for? They voted for Beto. That`s how Beto came so close in Texas. It wasn`t the rise or younger or Latino voters. I was white, suburban voters who came out and voted for Democrats in the House and for Beto. How do you keep those voters from either staying home or defecting back to -- to Donald Trump? If you put a candidate -- goes the theory -- someone like Elizabeth Warren, someone like Bernie Sanders, that`s going to turn off those voters who were willing to vote for say Democrats in 2018.</p><p>BRENNAN: And -- but, Jamal, Bernie Sanders is trying to woo black voters right now in South Carolina. He`s trying to make up a difference, I guess. The lesson he learned.</p><p>SIMMONS: He`s trying. But, you know, there`s a funny picture that was going around the Internet yesterday of him at an African-American church in South Carolina, but everybody in the room was white, right? And so he -- so what happened was, they -- they built a crowd, but it wasn`t actually the crowd of the membership of that particular church. So he`s got a -- he`s got a little bit of a tougher road.</p><p>I think of the two of them, Elizabeth Warren probably is the more -- is the one people may buy into a little bit more. But here`s my real guess, is that somebody, whoever the Democratic nominee is, will end up adopting a lot of the policy choices that Bernie and Elizabeth Warren put forward, because that seems to be where the passion of the left is.</p><p>BRENNAN: We will see.</p><p>Thanks to all of you.</p><p>And we will be back in a moment with a look at a unique new class of congressional interns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN: Politics and football meet head-on this spring with an unusual class of interns on Capitol Hill. CBS News special correspondent James Brown reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAMES BROWN, CBS NEWS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Michael Thomas, Austin Carr and Ryan Hunter are used to running, blocking, or catching for a living, but for the last couple of weeks, they have been running around the halls of Congress, tackling the big issues facing the country.</p><p>RYAN HUNTER, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS: I`ve been fortunate to sit in on meeting with foreign policy administrators from the Middle East, whether it be constituents from the state of Missouri and the city of Kansas City, St. Louis.</p><p>BROWN: Ryan Hunter is an offensive lineman for the Kansas City Chiefs. He`s interning for freshman Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri.</p><p>SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R), MISSOURI: It`s fun because we`re both new together. So Ryan`s new. I`m new. We`re kind of learning the ropes together. I think it`s phenomenal that NFL players like Ryan who are very busy guys and have a career that they`re pursuing want to be involved in their communities, want to be involved in service.</p><p>BROWN: Michael Thomas plays safety for the New York Giants. This is his second time working for Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents his district in Houston, Texas.</p><p>REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D), TEXAS: What a place to be, not necessarily only in my office, but in many offices where they can be change agents and translate that leadership on the field into making a difference.</p><p>MICHAEL THOMAS, NEW YORK GIANTS: Yes, after interning last year, I was like, I got to come back, because I saw firsthand what she`s doing and how much she`s really on the ground, you know, like putting in the work. A lot of things that we were fighting for, for criminal justice reform, bail reform, education, you know, re-entry with juvenile detentions and stuff like that, she`s already had bills written. You know, they`re on the floor. She`s proposing these things. So I`m like, OK, this is how we can take that next step.BROWN (on camera): And you are firmly convinced that Capitol Hill, this arena, this venue, if you will, can affect the kind of meaningful changes that you and others who have the same feelings can bring about?</p><p>THOMAS: Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, it`s going to take -- you know, it`s going to take time. You can`t -- nothing happens overnight. I can see how other people can say, man, like, they`re slow, we need -- we need something now. We need to do something now. And I get that passion. I feel it.</p><p>BROWN (voice over): Austin Carr is a wide receiver for the New Orleans Saints. He is pro-life and interested in some libertarian ideas, which is why he is interning for Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.</p><p>AUSTIN CARR, NEW ORLEANS SAINTS: I`m seeing how hard they work, and in particular Senator Rand Paul, how often he`s running to and fro to different meetings, different committee, meeting with constituents.</p><p>BROWN (on camera): What have you seen in this young man, senator?</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: We`re -- we`re glad to have him here. And I think it`s good to see another side of our athletes.</p><p>BROWN (voice over): According to the NFLPA, the average NFL career lasts just under four years. In 2014, the union started an externship program to prepare players for life after the NFL. Since then, 183 players have had on-the-job training in a variety of fields.</p><p>Michael Thomas is a member of the union`s executive board, and he sees this as an opportunity to speak for his community. Thomas was one of the players who protested police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem.</p><p>THOMAS: Me being here, being an inside intern, I see the steps that needs to be taken -- that need to be taken. I`m willing to put in the work. I`m willing to advocate for it. I`m willing to help out Congresswoman Jackson Lee any way I can using my voice and my platform, the same way I did it on the football field in taking a knee.</p><p>BROWN: Austin Carr met with the attorney general of Louisiana to talk about the opioid crisis.</p><p>CARR: Nationwide, the U.S. consumes 80 percent of opioids in the world, right?</p><p>BROWN: Ryan Hunter learned more about brain injuries after meeting with the Society for Neuroscience.</p><p>HUNTER: I`d rather be here than be in the Bahamas, because I`m learning so much for the future that this -- this experience on its own beats, you know, having an umbrella drink on the beach.</p><p>BROWN: These pro athletes came to Washington to learn from political leaders, but their mentors seem to learn from them, as well.</p><p>PAUL: But, no, I`m glad to see that Austin, you know, believes strongly in his faith and that it sounds like he wants to be part of trying to make things better in the country, but also be an example for, you know, kids out there that look up to our -- our stars.</p><p>HAWLEY: Having players say, I want to be involved, I want to serve, I want to see it from the inside, I want to do something about that, that`s awesome. We need more of that. And I think Ryan`s a great example.</p><p>JACKSON LEE: I hope he will be able to be here when we are seeing these bills pass out of the House and the Senate where we have changed the criminal justice system. Wouldn`t that be great? That`s my heart and passion. And I hope he will be part of it.</p><p>THOMAS: Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN: And we`ll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRENNAN: That`s it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I`m Margaret Brennan.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2193261421</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNX-KWD1-JBHT-D0K5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9185\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming Copyright MMXIX CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Does President Trump see white nationalism as a rising threat around the world?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don`t really.

Happy St. Patrick`s day.</p><p>We begin with acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.</p><p>And happy St. Patrick`s day to you.</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: And to you, Ms. Brennan.</p><p>BRENNAN: I want to get right to it, in the wake of this horrific terror attack in New Zealand.</p><p>You know, there`s a lot of parsing of the president`s own language in referring to what happened here.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the number of attacks and support for white supremacy is up, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. And even a Trump- appointed attorney in the state of Virginia, Thomas Cullen, was recently quoted as saying: \"White supremacy and far right extremism are among the greatest domestic security threats facing the United States.\"</p><p>Has the president been briefed on this?</p><p>MULVANEY: Well, I don`t know who that gentleman is. Certainly, the president`s briefed on all of...</p><p>BRENNAN: You know who the Southern Poverty Law Center is.</p><p>MULVANEY: I do. I do.</p><p>The president`s absolutely briefed on all of the threats, both domestic and international. But I want to push back against this idea that every time something bad happens everywhere around the world, folks who don`t like Donald Trump seem to blame it on Donald Trump.</p><p>I`m hoping we can get...</p><p>BRENNAN: I`m not blaming it on the president. I was asking about...</p><p>MULVANEY: I didn`t say -- didn`t say...</p><p>BRENNAN: ... his characterization.</p><p>MULVANEY: I didn`t say you. I`m saying that that`s clearly what some folks want -- want to do. I have heard other members of -- of the Democrat Party trying to do it, folks at the Southern Poverty Law Center here trying to do it.</p><p>This is a tragic thing that happened in New Zealand.</p><p>BRENNAN: They`re just saying the number of white nationalist groups has surged by 50 percent.</p><p>MULVANEY: Since Trump has become -- office, right?</p><p>BRENNAN: Well, in the past year.</p><p>MULVANEY: There you go. So, he -- here`s the point. Why can`t we...</p><p>BRENNAN: So, do you disagree that it`s a rising threat?</p><p>MULVANEY: I -- I -- I -- I disagree that there`s a causal link between Donald Trump being president and something like this happening in New Zealand.</p><p>BRENNAN: But that`s not the argument or the suggestion there...</p><p>MULVANEY: OK, good.</p><p>BRENNAN: ... by the judge or by that statistic. Is the president aware that this is a rising threat?</p><p>MULVANEY: Again, a rising threat.</p><p>I think the president you saw -- you saw him asked the other day, does he think it`s a rising threat? And he says no. I think there`s information that would back that up.</p><p>The issue is, how do you stop these crazy people? Whether or not there`s one of them or four of them doesn`t make a difference, if they`re willing to go on live TV and stream the murder of people. So I think that`s where the time is better spent.</p><p>Instead of worrying about, well, who`s to -- who`s to blame, how do we stop from doing this? Donald Trump is no more to blame for what happened in New Zealand than Mark Zuckerberg is because he invented Facebook. There are some terrible people in the world. We need to work with our partners, of which New Zealand is one of, and to try and figure a way to find them, expose them and bring them to justice.</p><p>BRENNAN: Well, President Trump, and certainly during the campaign talked quite a lot about the need to be specific, to name a threat in order to counter it.</p><p>So why minimize it? Why not directly address white supremacy, and specifically Islamophobia?</p><p>MULVANEY: Yes, I get a lot of questions about...</p><p>BRENNAN: Because a number of world leaders did. And the president didn`t.</p><p>MULVANEY: I get a lot of questions from people saying, why -- you need to tell the president to do X, you need to tell the president to go and give it an Oval Office address on this or on that.</p><p>That`s not how the system works. The president communicates in his way. Different presidents have communicated in their way. I don`t think anybody can -- can claim that Donald Trump hasn`t done exactly what we would want him to do in this circumstance.</p><p>We`ve immediately reached out to our allies. We`ve expressed the absolute disgust at the tragic -- at the tragic events. We`re doing what presidents are supposed to do.</p><p>That doesn`t mean it`s going to make everybody happy because of the hyper partisan times we live in. But, again, I really -- it frustrates me, just as a citizen, that everything -- something -- every time something goes wrong around the world now, not just in our country, somehow, the president of the United States must be responsible.</p><p>And that`s just -- that`s absurd, and it doesn`t help contribute to the dialogue that`s necessary to fix these problems.</p><p>BRENNAN: Point taken, but the president of the United States carries a megaphone louder than anyone in the world, and arguably this president likes to use his.</p><p>So, because you`re frustrated, why not remove any shadow of a doubt? I mean during the campaign, as you know, as a candidate, the president called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. He said Islam hates us.</p><p>This kind of language in the past leads to these questions of, why isn`t the president now directly using that megaphone to condemn it?</p><p>MULVANEY: Well then -- take -- take -- take -- take the words and put them in one category, and take the actions and put them in another.</p><p>Something the president doesn`t get hardly any credit for or any attention to is the work he`s done in defense of religious minorities all around the world, up to and including Muslims in the Middle East. Some of the religious minorities that are the worst oppressed to the Middle East are some of the ones that this administration has been doing -- going to great lengths to protect.</p><p>So I hear what folks says, oh, Donald Trump said this during the campaign. Look at what we`ve done while we`ve been here. I don`t think anybody could say that the president is anti-Muslim.</p><p>BRENNAN: Well, the president`s tweeting now about a TV host who was suspended for anti-Muslim rhetoric.</p><p>So, it`s -- it`s, I think, a fair question to ask you about this.</p><p>But I want to move on to one of the fights that is going on in Congress and questions from a number of senators about exactly what programs are going to lose funding...</p><p>MULVANEY: Sure.</p><p>BRENNAN: ... in order to put together funding for the border wall.</p><p>When will the White House give this detailed list, specifically on military projects, to Congress?</p><p>MULVANEY: It could be a while, and here`s why. Here`s -- here`s what`s happening, is that we`ve already told Congress this, which is that none of the programs that were scheduled to be started or what we call obligated in 2019, so between now and the end of September, will be impacted at all.</p><p>BRENNAN: The service chiefs have told Congress they have that list, but the White House is not...</p><p>MULVANEY: No.</p><p>BRENNAN: ... handing that list over.</p><p>MULVANEY: No, no, that that`s absolutely -- I know of no list. And if anybody should know, it would be me.</p><p>There`s no list of projects that are absolutely going to not be funded so that the wall can be. What it is, is a list of programs that fit the criteria that I have just laid out for you, which is that they are meant to be funded beyond the end of this fiscal year.</p><p>Why is that important? Because if we -- if it`s going to be a project that would have been funded, say, in 2021, OK, it gives us another couple of years to what we call backfill. Congress will pass another appropriation this year, next year, so that ultimately none of the programs would be impacted.</p><p>BRENNAN: Senator Tim Kaine, who sits on Armed Services, is going to be on the show later in the program.</p><p>But when we spoke with him, he specifically said that he thinks the White House is withholding these details until after this upcoming vote on the veto override occurs. In other words, you`re trying to keep Republicans on board, and if you fully inform them about what you`re going to do to their district, then you might lose their vote.</p><p>MULVANEY: I -- I don`t -- I will watch the show. And, in fact, if I catch Tim in the green room, I will ask him what the basis is for that.</p><p>Does he just think it because he wants it to be true or someone told him there was actually a list? Because, again, I`m chief of staff. I`m also still technically over at the Office of Management and Budget.</p><p>BRENNAN: And you still don`t know what`s getting cut?</p><p>MULVANEY: And I know of no list that specifically...</p><p>BRENNAN: And you don`t know what`s getting cut?</p><p>MULVANEY: That`s correct.</p><p>I know of the universe of things that might be delayed or reduced or cut in a very extreme circumstance that could be funded -- used to fund the wall, but a list of a decision that`s already been made, saying, this money is going to be cut and spent over there, that`s not been made yet.</p><p>BRENNAN: So, remove any doubt. You say, no matter what these details are, you still have the votes to override...</p><p>MULVANEY: Oh, yes.</p><p>BRENNAN: ... this veto?</p><p>MULVANEY: Absolutely.</p><p>BRENNAN: To block any kind of override?</p><p>MULVANEY: Yes, no, we fully expect the veto override to fail in the House.</p><p>BRENNAN: All right, thank you, Mick Mulvaney, for joining us.</p><p>MULVANEY: Thanks, Margaret.</p><p>BRENNAN: Just to clarify, that host is FOX News` Jeanine Pirro.</p><p>The network has condemned her commentary, and her broadcast did not air last night.</p><p>We spoke yesterday with Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. He had just returned from a visit to the Venezuelan border and spoke to us from Bogota, Colombia.</p><p>We asked Senator Kaine about President Trump saying that he did not think white nationalism was a rising threat around the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA: Margaret, it is on the rise. And the president should call it out.</p><p>But, sadly, he`s not doing that. We saw in the aftermath of the horrible attack in Charlottesville that he tried to say that the white supremacists, neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates there were just, you know, good people.</p><p>But when you see church shootings in Charleston, a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, you see this hate-filled manifesto of the shooter in New Zealand who is murdering Muslims, we have to confront the fact that there is a rise in white supremacy, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim attitudes.</p><p>The president uses language often that`s very similar to the language used by these bigots and racists. And if he`s not going to call it out, then other leaders have to do more to call it out. And I certainly will.</p><p>BRENNAN: Well, the president did say it was a horrible thing that happened,but he said that the white nationalism issue is just a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.</p><p>What do you attribute the rise to?</p><p>KAINE: Well, they have problems, but I think the president is using language that emboldens them.</p><p>He`s not creating them. They`re out there. But at the same time as he was tweeting out yesterday his support for the family members in New Zealand -- and that was appropriate -- he was vetoing the Senate`s rejection of his emergency declaration from Thursday.</p><p>And he used the word invaders to characterize people coming to the nation`s southern borders, which was exactly the same phrase that the shooter in New Zealand used to characterize the Muslims that he was attacking. That kind of language from the person who probably has the loudest microphone on the planet Earth is hurtful and dangerous, and it tends to incite violence.</p><p>BRENNAN: I want to ask you about an exchange you had this week that seemed quite tense. You were very clearly frustrated with the acting secretary of defense, Shanahan, because you were asking why a list of military projects had not been provided to Congress that would be directly impacted by funding cuts due to reallocation for the president`s border wall.</p><p>KAINE: I`m on the Armed Services Committee. I represent Virginia.</p><p>I have a child in the military. So I sent a letter on February 15 to the secretary of defense and said, if you`re going to ransack the Pentagon`s budget, tell me what projects you`re going to cut or delay or eliminate. They wouldn`t provide an answer.</p><p>At the hearing on Thursday, we`re now going to vote that day on whether we support or reject the emergency declaration. And they still hadn`t answered our question: What projects are at stake?</p><p>At the hearing, he said, oh, I will send you the list later this afternoon.</p><p>And you`re right. I kind of blew up at him. You`re going to give us the list after we vote? This is highly relevant to the vote about the president`s emergency declaration. What projects are you going to ransack out of the Pentagon budget? Is it going to be military housing? Is it going to be trying to make our bases safer from terrorism with construction projects?</p><p>Is it going to be rebuilding Tyndall Air Force Base that got blitzed in the hurricanes last fall? And they said they would give us the list after.</p><p>But, Margaret, to add insult to injury, they had to walk that back. They don`t even want to give us the list now at all, because we`re going to have to have an override vote. I don`t think the White House wants us to see the list before the override vote.</p><p>BRENNAN: Why do you think the White House is withholding this information you say is so relevant because of an upcoming vote?</p><p>KAINE: I think there`s one reason.</p><p>BRENNAN: You`re -- you`re connecting. You think they`re trying to influence the outcome of it?</p><p>KAINE: Absolutely. This is not the secretary of defense, in my view. This is the White House wanting to hold the list back because they worry that, if senators and House members saw the potential projects that were going to be ransacked to pay for the president`s wall, they would lose votes.</p><p>And I think they`re going to try to hide the list until that veto override vote occurs in the House and then in the Senate.</p><p>BRENNAN: You are, of course, in Colombia nearby what is a country that is really crippled in many ways economically right now, Venezuela.</p><p>There are about three million refugees who have fled. The energy and oil industry is collapsing, as is the economy there. What is it that you were going to the border to see? What did you learn?</p><p>KAINE: Well, Margaret, I wanted to see a couple of things, one, to support the Colombian government because their effort to provide assistance to these millions of Venezolanos has been really momentous, but, secondly, learn what more the United States can do.</p><p>We have worked together actually in an accord between the administration and Congress to provide significant amounts of humanitarian aid, to work together, to pull together a coalition of nations.</p><p>BRENNAN: Nicolas Maduro still is in charge of that country, whether we like it or not. And these sanctions have not seemingly changed his calculus.</p><p>The visas, the diplomatic isolation, what is this actually accomplishing at this point?</p><p>KAINE: Well, it`s -- it`s giving hope to Venezuelans that there may finally be some change. The question isn`t whether Maduro likes it or not. The question is what the Venezuelan people want.</p><p>And the National Assembly has determined that the election of President Maduro was illegitimate. There needs to be a new government.</p><p>So, what more can we do more?</p><p>BRENNAN: Yes.</p><p>KAINE: More humanitarian aid, more work together to pull more nations into our coalition. The sanctions are important. They`re having an effect.</p><p>Sanctions are economic, but there are also visa restrictions on Maduro and his cronies as they try to travel abroad. We need to give hope to the Venezuelan people that we stand with them and support them. It`s a massive humanitarian crisis driven by one person, Nicolas Maduro, and the Venezuelan people are speaking out, and they want something better.</p><p>BRENNAN: Has the Trump administration, whose policy you seem to support right now, have they underestimated how strong he is?</p><p>KAINE: No, I don`t know that they`ve underestimated it.</p><p>Look, this is -- this is not easy. It`s a difficult situation. And I do generally support what the Trump administration has done, with one exception. I think loose talk about U.S. military action is a big mistake, one, because that`s not for the president. It`s for Congress.</p><p>But second, the right strategy here -- there`s only one person using the military against Venezuelans. And it`s Maduro.</p><p>BRENNAN: Senator Kaine, thank you for joining us. Safe travels.</p><p>KAINE: Thank you, Margaret. Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN: We will be back in one minute with a lot more FACE THE NATION.</p><p>BRENNAN: We`re back now with former federal prosecutor Preet Bharara.</p><p>He was, of course, fired by President Trump after he refused to sign as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.</p><p>And he has a new book out, \"Doing Justice: A Prosecutor`s Thoughts on Crime, Punishment, and the Rule of Law.\"</p><p>Preet, good to have you here.</p><p>PREET BHARARA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BRENNAN: I read the book.</p><p>I want to get to some of the news of the week, but first ask you actually how you ended this book, because I think it resonates this week, in the wake of the terror attack in New Zealand.</p><p>You recount a story and a case of a hate crime against someone who wanted to go out and kill Arabs after 9/11 and ended up killing some -- or -- and then injuring some South Asian individuals instead.</p><p>Is this just a continuation of Islamophobia, of white nationalism? Is there something here? Or, is -- as the president says, it`s not really a broader issue at all?</p><p>BHARARA: Yes. Well, thanks for asking about the end of the book.</p><p>I think a lot of the world is mourning the loss of innocent lives, up to 50 now, in New Zealand. And, you know, from my old vantage point as a law enforcement officer, the chief law enforcement officer federally in Manhattan, law enforcement has certain tools, right?</p><p>You can do surveillance. You can infiltrate organizations that propound hate and try to engage in terrorist acts. You can also hold people accountable after the fact.</p><p>But one of the points I make in the book, \"Doing Justice,\" over and over again is, laws are not enough. Law can do some things, but, at the end of the day, if you want to quell people`s hatred, you want to make people get along better, you want to have harmony, you have to have good people who are willing to step up to the plate and do, among other things, call out bad things when they happen.</p><p>And in the case that I was referring to that you mentioned in the -- in the end part of the book, it was a Bangladeshi immigrant after 9/11 who was shot in the face by someone, Mark Anthony Stroman, who decided that he wanted to take revenge on behalf of, I guess, his race for people who had perpetrated the act of 9/11, obviously, going and randomly shooting people where they worked.</p><p>And Rais Bhuiyan was not killed and decided in a way that I think is extraordinary to forgive the person who tried to kill him and tried to get him off death row and -- and spare him the death penalty. He wasn`t ultimately successful.</p><p>But, to my mind, it`s an -- it`s an inspiring story of how some people go beyond what the law even requires, beyond what the law allows, to try to have forgiveness and -- and harmony go forward in the world. And I think we need a little bit more of that and a little bit less of the nasty rhetoric and a little bit less of, you know, people like the president not stepping up to the plate and calling out bad things when they`re happening.</p><p>BRENNAN: Important note there in this week.</p><p>But I want to turn to some of the other news that we`ve seen on the political and legal front. You know, we saw on Friday the special counsel again asked for the fifth time a delay in the sentencing of Rick Gates, who was a -- a Trump campaign deputy, because, it was said, he`s cooperating.</p><p>How should people understand this? What does this mean?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BHARARA: Well, not just cooperating, but cooperating in -- quote, unquote -- \"several investigations.\"</p><p>And so, you know, I`m an outsider now, and I don`t still run the Southern District of New York, and I`m not aware of what`s going with various investigations that sometimes, you know, intersect with the special counsel`s investigation.</p><p>But I think people should view with some skepticism the notion that gets breathlessly reported every week that the Mueller investigation is coming to an end. It may be, because Andrew Weissmann, who is one of the top deputies -- in fact, the top deputy -- with Robert Mueller, announced that he was stepping down, which indicates maybe it`s wrapping up.</p><p>But then, as you point out, you have this letter about Rick Gates, who`s cooperating in multiple investigations, and they delay the sentencing, which seems to indicate that he is substantially cooperating and engaging in some success for the prosecuting team.</p><p>So, you might expect other indictments, other work going forward. So it doesn`t seem to me, based on that, although I don`t know, that the work of the special counsel is ending any time soon, unless it`s the case -- the one caveat I have is, unless it`s the case that the cases on which Rick Gates is cooperating are being parceled out -- parceled out to other U.S. attorney`s office -- offices like the Southern District of New York or D.C. or somewhere else, so the special counsel team can step back and have its work be done.</p><p>BRENNAN: Steve Bannon and a few other individuals have said that actually the biggest risk to the president is not from the special counsel, but actually the Southern District of New York, which you know well.</p><p>Do you agree with that?</p><p>BHARARA: Well, I don`t know if I -- I would frame it that way. It`s a sort of a polemical way to frame it, but, yes, in the sense that the SDNY, which I led for 7.5 years, doesn`t have the circumscription on its ambit in the same way the special counsel does.</p><p>The special counsel was appointed, you know, under a particular regulation, and was supposed to look at only things relating to interference in the election and potentially collusion -- quote, unquote -- \"collusion\" with -- with Russians in connection with the election, and anything arising from it.</p><p>And one of those things that -- that arose from it was obstruction. The Southern District of New York has a lot of people in it whose mission is only to find crime, be able to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, if it`s in the interests of justice to do it. And they`re very aggressive and they`re very fearless and they`re very independent.</p><p>They don`t care about politics. When I was there, we prosecuted Democrats and Republicans, and it didn`t matter who they were, you know, affiliated with.</p><p>BRENNAN: Yes.</p><p>BHARARA: And -- and so when one of -- one of the things I try to say in the book is to explain the philosophy and the culture of the men and women of the Southern District of New York.</p><p>BRENNAN: And, of course, state and federal charges and how a president`s pardon could affect them are -- are different too.</p><p>I want to ask you as well about Paul Manafort. He was sentenced in D.C. this week. The sentence was added to, before that in Virginia, what some would characterize as a light sentence.</p><p>Do you think justice is done?</p><p>BHARARA: It`s hard to say. You know, punishment is a very difficult thing to calibrate.</p><p>You know, whether a few months more, a few months less...</p><p>BRENNAN: Yes.</p><p>BHARARA: ... is in the interest of justice is hard to measure like -- like mathematics.</p><p>I agree with the people who said that the first sentence of Paul Manafort of 47 months was a bit low, given the guidelines and given the nature and seriousness of the crime and how long it went on. I think that, overall, the addition of 3.5 years from Judge Amy Berman Jackson makes it overall a 7.5-year sentence, which is closer to right.</p><p>I still think it`s overall low, but it`s hard to determine.</p><p>BRENNAN: Preet Bharara, thank you for joining us.</p><p>BHARARA: Thanks, Margaret.</p><p>BRENNAN: The book is \"Doing Justice.\"</p><p>We`ll be back in a moment.</p><p>BRENNAN: There are two more candidates in the presidential race, but it`s one who is not in the race, at least yet, who raised eyebrows when he accidentally made a slip in his speech last night.</p><p>Our Ed O`Keefe reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ED O`KEEFE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The man many Democrats are waiting for sure sounded like a presidential candidate Saturday night.</p><p>BIDEN: I have the most progressive record of anybody running for the -- if -- anybody who would run.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>O`KEEFE: Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected the make it official next month.</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That`s why I`m running for president. And it`s why I`m asking you for your support.</p><p>O`KEEFE: New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand today became the 14th Democrat to officially launch a presidential bid, even though she`s been officially campaigning for the job for eight weeks. Gillibrand plans to formally kick off her campaign next Sunday outside Trump Tower in New York.</p><p>Other candidates traveled to early primary states this weekend, hoping to build support.</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have common pain all over this country, but we have lost our sense of common purpose.</p><p>O`KEEFE: And Beto O`Rourke wrapped up a three-day tour in Iowa that launched his campaign.</p><p>BETO O`ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is my first time to ever visit Iowa.</p><p>O`KEEFE: O`Rourke narrowly lost the U.S. Senate bid in Texas last year, and presidential buzz has been building ever since.</p><p>His rollout was treated like a major media event. He told \"Vanity Fair\" magazine for a cover story, \"I`m just born to be in it.\"</p><p>And he sat for his first in-depth interview as a candidate with \"CBS THIS MORNING\" co-host Gayle King.</p><p>GAYLE KING, CO-HOST, \"CBS THIS MORNING\": Do you consider yourself more moderate or more progressive?</p><p>O`ROURKE: Yes. You know, if I think about a term like progressive, I want to make sure everybody has a chance, that our democracy fully reflects the genius of this country, that we make the investments in one another, and that`s universal guaranteed high-quality health care. It`s a living wage for everyone who works.</p><p>It`s supporting those who are looking for jobs. So, if that is progressive, I`m a progressive.</p><p>KING: You`re a progressive?</p><p>O`ROURKE: Yes.</p><p>KING: All right. All right. So I don`t even need to go into moderate then?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>O`KEEFE: Meanwhile, former Florida Governor and 2016 candidate Jeb Bush said this weekend that Republicans ought to be given a choice, suggesting someone needs to launch a primary challenge to President Trump.</p><p>He named Maryland Governor Larry Hogan as a possible option. Hogan told us a few weeks ago he isn`t ruling it out -- Margaret.</p><p>BRENNAN: Ed, thank you.</p><p>More on 2020 when we come back.</p><p>BRENNAN: We will be back in a moment.</p><p>BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.</p><p>Joining us for some more 2020 analysis are Jamal Simmons, Democratic strategist and host on Hill TV, Amy Walter of \"The Cook Political Report,\" and, of course, our own Ed O`Keefe.</p><p>Ed, you just laid out the crowded field. I was speaking to a Democratic strategist this week, or fundraiser I should say, who said this is like waiting for Gadot.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: When we`re waiting for Biden here?</p><p>BRENNAN: When we`re waiting for Biden.</p><p>O`KEEFE: Absolutely.</p><p>BRENNAN: And still not sure. Gadot never shows up.</p><p>O`KEEFE: Right.</p><p>BRENNAN: Is Biden going to show up?</p><p>O`KEEFE: I mean, if you believe the verbal slip-up last night at the Dover Downs, yes, he certainly made it seem like he is.</p><p>You know, I asked him earlier this week when he was at this firefighter`s union even here in D.C., along the rope line, what`s the hold-up? He says, there`s no hold-up. He just looks at history, which suggests that people who have waited a little longer than this current crop that got in, you know, at the stroke of midnight essentially as the year began, and thinks that he has some time to -- to, you know, to spend because he`s got the name --</p><p>BRENNAN: Right.</p><p>O`KEEFE: Clearly has some money ready and -- and ready to come, has locked up some staff. We don`t know to what extent their -- the size of his operation will be. But all signs still point to early April sometime before Tax Day, April 15th.</p><p>JAMAL SIMMONS, HILL.TV: You know, Ed mentions history. And with the vice president, it`s -- it`s -- I don`t -- history is actually a pretty tough marker for him.</p><p>BRENNAN: What do you mean?</p><p>SIMMONS: Democrats, you know, he is very popular. People all over the country are hungering for him to get into the race. But Democrats have never elected a sitting or former vice president to the White House before. Democrats also, if you look at -- if you go back and look at some of the FiveThirtyEight polling, the person who was ahead in the national polls at this period a year out from election day did not ultimately win the White House. And there`s only three times that person won the nomination, it was Walter Mondale in 1984, Al Gore in 2000, and Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p><p>O`KEEFE: We know that (ph).</p><p>SIMMONS: Hillary is a tough marker. So the vice president really has to, I think, take on the fact that this -- that he`s going up against these trends, and that means he has to do things differently. He needs a more diverse staff than he has had in the past, he`s got to be willing to talk about progressive issues in a way that`s more compelling than he has in the past. And I hope that`s what they`re planning.</p><p>BRENNAN: Amy, do we need new blood, as former President Obama suggested? I mean he`s not necessarily going to endorse --</p><p>AMY WALTER, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": He`s not the newest person in the -- in the mix for his years there on the Senate side.</p><p>It`s really interesting watching Democrats grappling with their choices this time. They have all kinds of opportunities here, generationally, on race, and on -- and on gender.</p><p>BRENNAN: It seems --</p><p>WALTER: And on gender. And it seems that the issue really comes down to this. How safe of a choice do Democrats want to make? And by safe we have to -- we all are going to determine that. The Democrats are going to determine that, too, in very different ways. And the safe being really, who`s the one who we know can beat Donald Trump. That`s the -- that`s the question a lot of Democrats are asking themselves, what does that mean? And -- versus the, who`s the most disruptive in this field.</p><p>Waiting for Godot`s a good description. I also think primaries are a lot like trying to figure out who you`re going to marry. And do you go with the person who really races your heart or do you go with the person you want to bring home to your parents, right? And Democrats -- it -- it -- recently --</p><p>BRENNAN: And you don`t think the two can be the same thing?</p><p>WALTER: Sometimes -- (INAUDIBLE) -- sometimes they can be both. I think Barack Obama was both. I think in 2004, remember there was that infamous bumper stick their said, dated Dean, married Kerry, right?</p><p>SIMMONS: How did that work out?</p><p>WALTER: Dean was a lot of fun. And that`s what the -- and if you`re Democrats -- a lot of Democrats will say, exactly, when we made the safe choice, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, we lost. We`ve got to go with somebody who`s going to be engaging in a very different way.</p><p>The other -- just one more quick thing about engaging and broadening, going away from safe. It`s also about broadening the electoral map outside of the presidential race.</p><p>BRENNAN: Right.</p><p>WALTER: Which is the Senate. There are a bunch of Democrats I talked to who say, we could win the White House, but if we don`t win the Senate, then, guess what, not a lot of this is going to matter. We`ve got to go into places like Texas, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia. Those are the races that are going to determine control of the senate.</p><p>SIMMONS: Arizona.</p><p>WALTER: And Arizona.</p><p>BRENNAN: It was such a rollout for Beto O`Rourke.</p><p>O`KEEFE: Right.</p><p>BRENNAN: I mean he -- people are asking like he is anointed? Is this going to backfire on him?</p><p>O`KEEFE: Well -- and I think, to the -- to the charge that the media may have overdone it, we have to remember something. I made this point repeatedly in our reporting this past week. You talk to every other campaign that`s involved in this right now, the one name that kept coming up in private conversations was always him. Is he going to do it? Do you think he can raise $80 million again? So this was them essentially goading us into saying, you know, they`re scared of him. Very scared of him.</p><p>And this coffee shop counter-top campaign that he launched this week by jumping up on countertops repeatedly -- was it you that said, I hope he brought the Windex along.</p><p>WALTER: Yes, you need some -- you need some -- well, Clorox wipes. People are eating on those things.</p><p>O`KEEFE: You know, it seems to have gone well for him. And he started very strategically in southeastern Iowa, a part of the state where Democrats used to dominate and have struggled in recent years, and repeatedly people said to me, you know, they don`t usually come to this parted of the state until later in the primary, so we give him a lot of credit for doing it. And, we`ll see.</p><p>BRENNAN: Amy, there`s been some attention to perhaps a double standard here, that Beto delayed making an announcement, he had this sort of soul- searching played out in the press, that a female candidate of the five or so we have so far, would have been punished for looking indecisive. Do you buy that?</p><p>WALTER: I`m sure there`s still -- there is still going -- and there will always be a double standard. When we look at whether they`re candidates of color or women are going to be judged different standards than white men.</p><p>At the same time, I do think every one of these candidates gets their little boomlet (ph), gets their time to make their case. And this is why the debates are going to be so important because all of this is right now is sort of fluff. When they`re all on the stage together, making the case that they have the best opportunity, I`m the best person here to go up against Donald Trump, that`s when voters really get to see what a they`re made of.</p><p>SIMMONS: You know, he`s a little bit -- I would argue that Beto O`Rourke is the best natural candidate running for this area.</p><p>BRENNAN: Natural.</p><p>SIMMONS: For this era, right? He understands social media. He`s -- he`s willing to engage in that fear in a way that Donald Trump has engaged in, And nobody else really kind of can do that.</p><p>What we don`t know is, can he do all the other things that have to be done in a campaign. Can he build out an organization? Can he raise the money? Can he withstand all the hits that are going to come his way? Those are really big things.</p><p>But, you know, this week, there was a -- a kind of a little bit of an upset. A lot of women I talked to were really upset about the way he talked about his wife and raising their kids. That came up a lot. So I took it on myself to start calling around to some of the people and friends and family of --</p><p>BRENNAN: Because he said his wife mainly raises the children.</p><p>SIMMONS: That`s right. So I started calling women who don`t live in Washington, who don`t live in California, and asking them, Michigan, Georgia, Texas, Ohio, asking them what they thought. And what -- the most interesting response was a 70-year-old woman relative in Detroit who said to me, oh, yes, I saw that. I really liked that. So I think sometimes --</p><p>BRENNAN: Because she thought she was giving -- she thought he was giving his wife credit?</p><p>SIMMONS: She thought he was giving his wife credit.</p><p>BRENNAN: I got it.</p><p>SIMMONS: So I think -- I think sometimes that -- that things sound differently to people who live in different places. And we just have to -- we have to wait and see how this all souses (ph) out from time --</p><p>WALTER: Right, which is why the process is so important. You haven`t heard Democrats yet -- it`s going to happen -- say, this process is too unwieldy. We`re going to damage the ultimate nominee by having all of these debates and this, you know, lasting far too long. Right now I think it is the only way to determine which one of these candidates meets all of those different criteria that Jamal pointed out, of who`s going to be able to raise the money, look like they can stand up to the president, be able to be inspiring, also have a pathway to the White House that looks to voters like a realistic path to the White House.</p><p>BRENNAN: All right. Well, we`ll have the leave it there with the three of you. But more to come when we come back from this break with some analysis of the week that was.</p><p>BRENNAN: We turn now to our panel for some analysis on the other big news of the week. Jamal Simmons and Amy Walter are joined by Ramesh Ponnuru, who is a senior editor at \"National Review\" and a columnist for \"Bloomberg Opinion,\" and Mark Landler, who covers the White House and foreign policy for \"The New York Times.\"</p><p>Good to have you join us.</p><p>Ramesh, let me ask you, you know, Amy brought up in the last segment this point about it not just being about the 2020 presidential race. It`s also about some of these congressional seats. Senators, some of them we saw with this vote on the rebuke to the president, the accusation that maybe they were a little worried about their seats in 2020 and that may have swayed some Republicans to stick with the president instead of rebuking him.</p><p>How big of a concern and a factor was that?</p><p>RAMESH PONNURU, \"BLOOMBERG OPINION\": Well, I think it`s very striking that of the 12 Republican senators who did not vote with the president, who voted to disapprove his declaration of a national emergency, only one of them is running in 2020. There was a risk on both sides, right? There`s the general election risk because the emergency is unpopular, and the wall is unpopular. But among Republicans, it`s -- these things are very popular. And, obviously, I think a lot of Republicans showed that they were more concerned about winning their primaries than they were about the general election.</p><p>BRENNAN: Who do you have in mind? Is it Thom Tillis of North Carolina who took a lot of heat for that eleventh hour switch of his vote?</p><p>PONNURU: Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, all of them voted with the president and not with, you know, the -- the 12 Republicans, like Mitt Romney and Pat Toomey, Mike Lee and others, who had these constitutional concerns about what the president is doing.</p><p>BRENNAN: Mark, Mick Mulvaney was on this program and said that he thinks the White House, you know, has nothing to worry about with this attempt to override the veto. But how was this received inside the White House? It was the president`s first time to use the pen this this way.</p><p>MARK LANDLER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": And it was also first time the president was rebuffed this way by Republicans. Ramesh points out that several of them didn`t go the whole way.</p><p>But the fact of the matter is, after two years in which the Republicans have been just an absolute reliable sort of bastion for the president in Congress, I thought this was still symbolically important. And I`m sure that President Trump`s argument is, well, I didn`t pitch as hard as I could have. If I`d really asked for the votes, I would have gotten them.</p><p>But, nevertheless, they must be looking at this and thinking, do we have Mitch McConnell as reliably as we thought we did? And facing the prospects of more unpopular potential policy decisions and debates down the road, is this the first in what will be a more independent Republican majority in the Senate, a majority that`s going to make decisions not just blindly following the White House and President Trump?</p><p>BRENNAN: Some might say that`s wishful thinking?</p><p>WALTER: Yes.</p><p>LANDLER: Indeed. Indeed. And I stimulate that we haven`t seen it and we`ve had this same sort of discussion many, many times in the past. Well, this will be the moment that they show their independence and they continue not to do that.</p><p>But having said that, you know, this was a somewhat different set of circumstances. It didn`t play out quite as well as I think the White House hoped it would. And so that`s got to be at least somewhat concerning for them.</p><p>BRENNAN: Do you think this resonates with people at home or is it lost on them?</p><p>WALTER: I do think it -- it -- it doesn`t really resonates unless the president wants it to resonate, in which case what he does very well is turns it back against Congress. I think he loves the idea that, look, I told you people in Washington didn`t understand us or our vision for how we keep America safe. They`re -- they`re trapped in their old ways of thinking. I`m here to break us out of us. And so it actually works for him. Even when it`s members of his own party, I think this is very beneficial to him.</p><p>And I -- I do agree that -- with the question of whether this signals more dissention or whether it`s just -- this was a really easy vote. The veto -- they`re never going to have to vote on this again. They`re not going to have -- it`s going to die in the House most likely. They won`t have to vote on this again. And then it`s in the courts where ultimately it means that none of the discussion that we`re having right now may ever have to turn into reality.</p><p>BRENNAN: Ramesh, one of the few areas where we did see some -- some public criticism of the president from Republicans was on the foreign policy front. And, again, going into 2020, I guess there are some questions about, well, what does the president say he delivered on when it comes to North Korea? What does he say he delivered on with the promise to pull all troops out of Afghanistan? And we have some upcoming decisions on both of those things.</p><p>How much of a political lens should we be putting on them?</p><p>PONNURU: I tend to think that those sorts of foreign policy decisions are not all that politically significant in a presidential election, unless something has gone very, very wrong. And in that case, people start holding politicians accountable and asking why things that they themselves as voters weren`t paying attention to weren`t done.</p><p>So I -- I think the stakes politically are low, even if the stakes for our long-term national security are kind of high. Right now, I think the president can say that -- to his core voters, look, i have been trying to pull out of our commitments overseas, or at least downsize them in an intelligent way. And I think that that is going to be accepted as fine. I don`t think that there are a ton of Republican voters who are saying to themselves, you know, we need to be more involved in Syria. We need to be more involved in Iraq and Afghanistan. And so I think that he`s going to be fine on this front.</p><p>BRENNAN: Mark, we had the president go to the Pentagon on Friday for a classified briefing. Do we know what threats he was actually getting briefed on?</p><p>LANDLER: Well, we don`t precisely know what threats he was getting briefed on. The assumption is clear he was probably being briefed on North Korea. He was probably being briefed on Syria, where, after all, he made this decision to leave some American troops behind after saying he was going to withdraw them. And probably also on Afghanistan. We are in the midst of this peace reconciliation process with the Taliban, and part of that process is setting a definite timeline for withdrawing the remaining troops there.</p><p>So I am -- I`m sure all -- some combination of those issues, plus Iran, were probably all on the table at that point.</p><p>BRENNAN: And there are about 12,000 troops still in Afghanistan.</p><p>LANDLER: That`s right. And that -- that conversation has become very complicated in the last couple of weeks because the Afghan government feels that we, the United States, have cut them out of the process. We`re dealing directly with the Taliban. The Afghans are -- don`t have a seat at the table. And that`s become very contentious just in the -- in the last week in Washington with a couple visiting Afghan officials raising some very serious criticisms of the administration.</p><p>BRENNAN: Jamal, do you hear anything from this week with what`s being described as sort of a blow symbolically to the president or the frustrations in trying to deliver on some of these foreign policy promises. Is there any rich territory for Democrats to message and mine?</p><p>SIMMONS: I mean think of the Democratic political establishment or the Democratic left, the voters. People are thinking more Russia and Russian influence than they are about some of the more fine points of foreign policy. They generally get the president is not really doing very well, and the candidates don`t seem -- the Democratic candidates don`t seem to be that -- that far apart on this.</p><p>I think what people on the -- on the Democratic side are trying to do is alter an -- offer an alternate vision about what`s important. So the reason the president and immigration focuses importantly is for -- for his base is because it says to particularly white, disaffected voters, I`m the guy who`s standing up against the brown people coming into the United States and trying to preserve the country for you.</p><p>I think what the Democrats are trying to say is, there`s actually a bigger problem that happens. And so if you look at what happened with the cheating scandal with the schools, like there`s this sort of mob of people who are at the top. They`ve got all the goodies. So this goodies mob, and I`m not talking about Sealo (ph), but there`s like a goodies mob out there, right, that are dividing up all the opportunity among each other. And those are the people that we all have to be worried about. How do we tilt the scales back in favor of working people. And somebody like Elizabeth Warren, who talked about this idea of breaking up big tech companies, is somebody who`s driving this agenda on the left that says, maybe we`ve got to change the rules about how we deal with our economy, and that`s an alternate vision that I think Democrats are trying to establish and it might work.</p><p>WALTER: And yet that`s also going back to the, who -- who`s the safe choice. And for Democrats trying to balance these two very important segments of their electorate, the ones who do see that the system is rigged, they`re attracted to the Bernie Sanders message, also who`s going to turn out that Obama coalition that Hillary did not, younger voters, voters of color. But the newest coalition are those white suburban voters who came out, and guess who they voted for? They voted for Beto. That`s how Beto came so close in Texas. It wasn`t the rise or younger or Latino voters. I was white, suburban voters who came out and voted for Democrats in the House and for Beto. How do you keep those voters from either staying home or defecting back to -- to Donald Trump? If you put a candidate -- goes the theory -- someone like Elizabeth Warren, someone like Bernie Sanders, that`s going to turn off those voters who were willing to vote for say Democrats in 2018.</p><p>BRENNAN: And -- but, Jamal, Bernie Sanders is trying to woo black voters right now in South Carolina. He`s trying to make up a difference, I guess. The lesson he learned.</p><p>SIMMONS: He`s trying. But, you know, there`s a funny picture that was going around the Internet yesterday of him at an African-American church in South Carolina, but everybody in the room was white, right? And so he -- so what happened was, they -- they built a crowd, but it wasn`t actually the crowd of the membership of that particular church. So he`s got a -- he`s got a little bit of a tougher road.</p><p>I think of the two of them, Elizabeth Warren probably is the more -- is the one people may buy into a little bit more. But here`s my real guess, is that somebody, whoever the Democratic nominee is, will end up adopting a lot of the policy choices that Bernie and Elizabeth Warren put forward, because that seems to be where the passion of the left is.</p><p>BRENNAN: We will see.</p><p>Thanks to all of you.</p><p>And we will be back in a moment with a look at a unique new class of congressional interns.</p><p>BRENNAN: Politics and football meet head-on this spring with an unusual class of interns on Capitol Hill. CBS News special correspondent James Brown reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAMES BROWN, CBS NEWS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Michael Thomas, Austin Carr and Ryan Hunter are used to running, blocking, or catching for a living, but for the last couple of weeks, they have been running around the halls of Congress, tackling the big issues facing the country.</p><p>RYAN HUNTER, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS: I`ve been fortunate to sit in on meeting with foreign policy administrators from the Middle East, whether it be constituents from the state of Missouri and the city of Kansas City, St. Louis.</p><p>BROWN: Ryan Hunter is an offensive lineman for the Kansas City Chiefs. He`s interning for freshman Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri.</p><p>SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R), MISSOURI: It`s fun because we`re both new together. So Ryan`s new. I`m new. We`re kind of learning the ropes together. I think it`s phenomenal that NFL players like Ryan who are very busy guys and have a career that they`re pursuing want to be involved in their communities, want to be involved in service.</p><p>BROWN: Michael Thomas plays safety for the New York Giants. This is his second time working for Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents his district in Houston, Texas.</p><p>REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D), TEXAS: What a place to be, not necessarily only in my office, but in many offices where they can be change agents and translate that leadership on the field into making a difference.</p><p>MICHAEL THOMAS, NEW YORK GIANTS: Yes, after interning last year, I was like, I got to come back, because I saw firsthand what she`s doing and how much she`s really on the ground, you know, like putting in the work. A lot of things that we were fighting for, for criminal justice reform, bail reform, education, you know, re-entry with juvenile detentions and stuff like that, she`s already had bills written. You know, they`re on the floor. She`s proposing these things. So I`m like, OK, this is how we can take that next step. BROWN (on camera): And you are firmly convinced that Capitol Hill, this arena, this venue, if you will, can affect the kind of meaningful changes that you and others who have the same feelings can bring about?</p><p>THOMAS: Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, it`s going to take -- you know, it`s going to take time. You can`t -- nothing happens overnight. I can see how other people can say, man, like, they`re slow, we need -- we need something now. We need to do something now. And I get that passion. I feel it.</p><p>BROWN (voice over): Austin Carr is a wide receiver for the New Orleans Saints. He is pro-life and interested in some libertarian ideas, which is why he is interning for Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.</p><p>AUSTIN CARR, NEW ORLEANS SAINTS: I`m seeing how hard they work, and in particular Senator Rand Paul, how often he`s running to and fro to different meetings, different committee, meeting with constituents.</p><p>BROWN (on camera): What have you seen in this young man, senator?</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: We`re -- we`re glad to have him here. And I think it`s good to see another side of our athletes.</p><p>BROWN (voice over): According to the NFLPA, the average NFL career lasts just under four years. In 2014, the union started an externship program to prepare players for life after the NFL. Since then, 183 players have had on-the-job training in a variety of fields.</p><p>Michael Thomas is a member of the union`s executive board, and he sees this as an opportunity to speak for his community. Thomas was one of the players who protested police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem.</p><p>THOMAS: Me being here, being an inside intern, I see the steps that needs to be taken -- that need to be taken. I`m willing to put in the work. I`m willing to advocate for it. I`m willing to help out Congresswoman Jackson Lee any way I can using my voice and my platform, the same way I did it on the football field in taking a knee.</p><p>BROWN: Austin Carr met with the attorney general of Louisiana to talk about the opioid crisis.</p><p>CARR: Nationwide, the U.S. consumes 80 percent of opioids in the world, right?</p><p>BROWN: Ryan Hunter learned more about brain injuries after meeting with the Society for Neuroscience.</p><p>HUNTER: I`d rather be here than be in the Bahamas, because I`m learning so much for the future that this -- this experience on its own beats, you know, having an umbrella drink on the beach.</p><p>BROWN: These pro athletes came to Washington to learn from political leaders, but their mentors seem to learn from them, as well.</p><p>PAUL: But, no, I`m glad to see that Austin, you know, believes strongly in his faith and that it sounds like he wants to be part of trying to make things better in the country, but also be an example for, you know, kids out there that look up to our -- our stars.</p><p>HAWLEY: Having players say, I want to be involved, I want to serve, I want to see it from the inside, I want to do something about that, that`s awesome. We need more of that. And I think Ryan`s a great example.</p><p>JACKSON LEE: I hope he will be able to be here when we are seeing these bills pass out of the House and the Senate where we have changed the criminal justice system. Wouldn`t that be great? That`s my heart and passion. And I hope he will be part of it.</p><p>THOMAS: Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN: And we`ll be right back.</p><p>BRENNAN: That`s it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I`m Margaret Brennan.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBSNEW-2019031701cb407</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBSNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNG-9271-JB20-G4H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">166768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9125\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 CBS Worldwide Inc.

I'm Maria Bartiromo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Straight ahead right here, \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" reaction from two lawmakers whose committees questioned former Trump attorney Michael Cohen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Devin Nunes, is here, and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee member Democrat Carolyn Maloney, ahead of Michael Cohen's next testimony this upcoming week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, Republican Senator Rick Scott on the resistance from some in his own party to President Trump's emergency declaration over the border wall.  Will the president be forced to veto any move to block it?  Plus, the senator's reaction to the summit in Hanoi between President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also with us this morning, Ken Starr on the pending release of the Mueller report.  How much of it, if any, will Attorney General Bill Barr make available for all of us to see?</p><p>And Chinese telecom company Huawei is in full spin mode now, after criticism from U.S. officials about its practices.</p><p>All that and a lot more right here right now, \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>And we begin this morning with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen scheduled for another round of now closed-door testimony before the House Intelligence Committee this Wednesday, this as Democrats ramp up their own investigation into the proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow.</p><p>Joining me right now, in an exclusive interview, is the ranking member of that committee.  He is Republican Congressman from California Devin Nunes.  He also sits on the House Ways and Means Committee.</p><p>And, Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>First, reaction to Michael Cohen this past week, and give us a sense of why it's important to go from the public hearing last week.  Now he's going to be in front of your committee behind closed doors this upcoming week.</p><p>NUNES:  So, remember, he was in public with the Oversight Committee.  Then he came behind closed doors with us for no reason at all.  This is not a man who has any classified information whatsoever.</p><p>We interviewed him for some eight, nine hours.  In fact, Republicans were pretty much done with interviewing after a couple of sessions.  We didn't have any more questions to ask him.  We're not sure why he's coming back, but he will be back this week once again in a classified setting, for someone who has no classified information.</p><p>So, from my perspective, it's all about building out a narrative.  They want to keep it behind closed doors, so that they can conveniently say, well, we can't talk about what happened behind closed doors, when the reality is, we can talk about whatever we want to talk about, because the guy has no classified information.  It's ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said a couple things this past week that some people are wondering if he perjured himself again by saying he never wanted a job in the White House.</p><p>And then I thought there was something really interesting in terms of the work you have done so well for the last year-and-a-half on the dossier.  He said he was never in Prague.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And isn't it true that, in the dossier, the dossier said that he went to Prague to go meet with Russian officials to meddle into the U.S. election?</p><p>NUNES:  Yes.  This is why they don't want him outside.  They don't -- they want him behind closed doors, so that we can't talk about the testimony.</p><p>The bottom line is, is that Cohen was great for Republicans.  It was great for Donald Trump, because we now know that the dossier was total bunk.  There was no truth to it.  And we know that because of -- that Cohen has testified now publicly that he wasn't in Prague, and there was no truth to anything in the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said there was no collusion, by the way.</p><p>NUNES:  No collusion -- no collusion conspiracy, no obstruction.</p><p>You know, these are all issues that were essentially made in that dossier that was the Democrat -- remember, for the viewers out there -- and I think a lot of people forget -- this was the Democratic campaign committee working with the Clinton campaign that produced this dirt, fed it into the FBI to start this investigation in the first place.</p><p>It was totally debunked this week, and it will be debunked again next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have been investigating this now for upwards of two years.</p><p>You have told us a lot.  You have informed the public a lot in terms of what took place in the 2016 election.  I don't think, without you and your colleagues, we would even know what really took place by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI and the DOJ.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes.  There's still more to come.  We're going to keep interviewing people.  We're going to get this information out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about that, because you're wrapping up your investigation.  You have got a couple of things to do.</p><p>One of them is, you have provided a list of the people that you would like to come down to speak to you and get testimony of them.  So we have got this list.  Go through some of these names and why they're important, Tashina Gauhar, Gregory Brower, John Carlin, Kevin Clinesmith.</p><p>Tashina Gauhar is important why?</p><p>NUNES:  So, these are all names that we had sent to our Republican task force at the end of the last Congress.</p><p>These names are all important, because we need to know if these people were involved in the chain of custody of the dossier that we just referred to, because the dossier makes claims that this information came from Russians.</p><p>So all the names that are on this list that we didn't get to last year that still need to be interviewed, if we're really looking for Russian collusion, we need to know if any of those people were actually talking to Russians on behalf of the Clinton campaign or any operative, whether it's Fusion GPS, what Russians were they actually talking to, because, look, they could be the problem.</p><p>They could be -- these Clinton people could be the ones that were in bed with Russians, for all we know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, these are all...</p><p>NUNES:  Or it could be total nonsense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Many of these names are associated with Hillary Clinton.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, obviously, names like Jake Sullivan, who was a P.R. guy, I believe, for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Robby Mook, another P.R. guy for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Sidney Blumenthal, tell me why he's on your list.</p><p>NUNES:  Well, he was also involved in one of the dossiers.  So there's several versions of the dossiers, OK?</p><p>So this was dirt he was feeding into through friends and acquaintances that got into the State Department, right?  So, remember, the dossier came at very different angles all over the place into the FBI and DOJ.</p><p>Some of those people in the Clinton campaign -- I think a lot of people forget this -- why would people in the Clinton campaign be tweeting out messages about Trump's involvement with Russia?  It's because they had the dossier.  They were promoting this message, this dirt out there in 2016.</p><p>And we need to ask these Clinton campaign people where they got it from.  Did they get it from Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS, the dossier that they were paying for, or did they get it from some Russian friends of theirs that they know of?</p><p>The bottom line is, is that everything that was in that dossier, all the accusations that were made, whether it was tweets from the Hillary campaign, press releases from the Hillary campaign, it was all nonsense.  It was stuff they were feeding into the press.  The press was writing about it, they were tweeting it out and promoting it out.  And they were all in on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a part of -- it was part of their strategy to get this narrative out that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians.  Give it to the media, let the media drive the bus on all of it.</p><p>And it actually worked, because...</p><p>NUNES:  At the end of the day -- at the end of the day, it worked.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... a year-and-a-half later, we're still talking about the potential of this.</p><p>NUNES:  That's right.  That's right.</p><p>And that's why we're trying to get to the bottom of who was involved.  That's why we have all these lists of people we need to interview.  We need to know what their involvement was in all this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, so this is a list of 32 people.</p><p>Do you think you're ever going to get these people to come down and give you testimony?  You don't have subpoena power anymore.  Your colleagues are trying to lift every rock and look for a crime around Donald Trump.</p><p>NUNES:  So, the Democrats claim that they're going to be so much nicer than we were to them.</p><p>So, remember, we gave them every single witness they wanted over the last two years when we were in the majority.  They claim they're going to give us witnesses.  So far, they have given us zero witnesses.</p><p>So, if they continue not to give us any witnesses, we will ask all of these people to voluntarily come into Congress to talk to us.  If they won't come in, we will either do it through the courts, or we will send it over to the Senate, and hope that Lindsey Graham and his team can get to the bottom of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Senator Graham has been with us many times over the last several weeks.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said he's doing a deep dive.  He's going to bring the necessary people to testify.  In fact, he's going to interview definitely the people who signed the FISA warrant.</p><p>So as you wrap up your investigation, you have got these 32 names you want to interview.  You have got, number two, declassification.  Are we ever going to see declassification for some of the documents that you think are most important to educate the American people about this?</p><p>NUNES:  Yes, I kind of sum it up this way.</p><p>There's really five areas, the interviews we just talked about.  There's the criminal referrals that have to be made.  There's the declassification, radical declassification.  We need to have declassification across from everyone we interview to everyone that Mueller interviewed.</p><p>Then we're going to have to have a fundamental FISA reform.  We can never again let the FISA process be used to target political campaigns, right?  We can't let our intelligence capabilities be targeted and pointed at political campaigns.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they went to the FISA court.  And they said, look, we have this dirty dossier, and that's the reason that we're going to spy on the Trump campaign, essentially.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes, and not only that.  Not only did they get a warrant to get into somebody's e-mails on the campaign and get -- to be able to suck all that up, e-mails and listen to phone calls and all of that.</p><p>They also opened a counterintelligence investigation into a political campaign.  Now, these are tools that are supposed to be used to go after terrorists, you know, the people that destroyed the buildings here in New York.</p><p>And then the final thing that we have to deal with is, the media was involved in all of this, this disinformation campaign.  They were given the dossier, and they spread it out.  They spread numerous fake news stories about myself, the work that we were doing on the committee, many members on our committee, staff on our committee.</p><p>That's going to have to be dealt with too, this disinformation campaign.  The slander and the libel will all have to be dealt with.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're saying you're going to deal with the misinformation out there.  How do you deal with that?  You have referred to them in the past as tech oligarchs to me.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes.</p><p>So, there's two ways that they're doing it.  So, the fake news media, they're putting out fake news stories.  Sometimes, it comes from the Democrats, right, and the dossier.  They feed it to the media.  The media runs a story</p><p>And then the numerous tech companies out there that are really controlling what all Americans see, right?  So, what these tech companies have become is, they try to pretend they're not, but they're content developers.  They're developing content, OK, through two ways, one, algorithms.  So they're controlling what you and I see when we get on our device.</p><p>So for them to say that they're not developing content is nonsense.  The other thing that they're doing is, they're monetizing this.  So there are some people that will not get rewarded.  Like, if you're a conservative out there putting conservative videos together, you're not going to get money for that, right?  People are not going to advertise on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NUNES:  So, all this has -- has got to be dealt with, I think, in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me get back to that, because I want to find out how are you going to do that.</p><p>But speaking of interviews and your team looking at who you want to speak to, I want to talk about this letter that your colleagues Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan sent to the attorney general, William Barr.</p><p>And, basically, they are asking for a number of things from the A.G.  And they mention in particular Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad.  These are two individuals that worked at the Department of Justice and now work at the special counsel 's office.</p><p>Can you tell me about Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad?</p><p>NUNES:  So, Weissmann is the number two.  It's Mueller's deputy.  He was involved in the custody of the dossier.  So, in early 2016, he was given the dossier.</p><p>This is somebody, him and the other individual that's mentioned there, both DOJ people, both on the Mueller team.  They shouldn't be involved in this investigation.  I don't know -- well, and the questions that my colleagues are asking is...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NUNES:  ... is, you know, there's clear regulations that DOJ has that you can't be conflicted.  And so they're asking questions.</p><p>Look, did they disclose to Mueller before Mueller picked them that they were involved in the chain of custody of this dossier?  Because I will tell you, if I was -- I don't know that they're going to have any criminal indictments or not, but, if I was any attorney, I would be saying, look, these people that are bringing this forward, they shouldn't be involved in this because they are biased.</p><p>We already know the people that were kicked off were biased.  But you also have the fact that these two individuals that Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows are asking about were involved in the chain of custody of important evidence, the dossier, the dirt from the Clinton campaign, that is the basis for this entire hoax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is important, because, for a long time, I have been asking the question, can the Robert Mueller special counsel report have credibility if it doesn't look at what we know to have been wrongdoing by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI?</p><p>So, Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows write to Bill Barr.  And they say this. Number one, we'd like you to identify all actions taken by Weissmann and Ahmad, including disclosures to apprise the department or the special counsel's office of their role in the events Bruce Ohr testified to about supplying the FBI with information relating to the Trump campaign.</p><p>So, they also want to explain all the actions taken by Weissmann and Ahmad after learning that Steele, Simpson and Nellie Ohr were providing Bruce Ohr information for the purpose of relaying it to the FBI, provide all documents and communications referring or relating to disclosures made by Weissmann and Ahmad, and provide documents and communications related to the process the department used to evaluate prosecutors and investigators' independence.</p><p>So they're right now still working on the special counsel's investigation, Robert Mueller.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.  And they're not -- they're not independent investigators.  These are people that were in on this from the beginning.  They knew about the dossier.  They were -- they brought this dossier forward.</p><p>I don't know if they told -- maybe they told Mueller, and Mueller decided to waive these requirements that are there.  Also, let's not forget, we also have evidence that, at one time, that Weissmann was meeting with reporters.</p><p>And so you have this.  And this is part of this whole disinformation campaign.  I should have said this earlier.  It's not just the media.  It's not just that they were getting it from the Clinton campaign.  You also had people within the Department of Justice and the FBI that were briefing reporters.</p><p>Now, what on earth are you doing briefing reporters?  What was Weissmann doing talking to AP reporters, right?  We have asked those questions and never got the answers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>Well, it's a good point that you make.  Jordan and Meadows want this information from the A.G. by March 15 at 5:00 p.m.</p><p>I want to take a short break, but we have got more to cover here.</p><p>Number one, do you think they are going to get this information by March 15?  And, also, Mueller's report going to drop soon.  Got to get your expectations.</p><p>Congressman Devin Nunes is with us this morning.  He's staying with us.</p><p>Quick break, and then we will talk about the concerns about China technology giant Huawei as well and the red flags being raised by U.S. lawmakers on how Beijing may be infiltrating American universities to spread its propaganda.</p><p>Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures.  Let me know what you would like to know from Devin Nunes on Instagram @SundayFutures.</p><p>Stay with us, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>And I am back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the ranking member on the House Intel Committee.</p><p>And, Congressman, you just said that you want to get these people a list of 32 people down, so that you can interview them.</p><p>What happens next?  I mean, our audience wants to see accountability.  What are you expecting in terms of accountability?  How will Bill Barr response to this letter that Meadows and Jordan just sent him?</p><p>And do you think -- I mean, when you say criminal charges, what does that mean, criminal referrals?</p><p>NUNES:  Let me start with this.</p><p>All of us want to see justice equal under the law, right?  So we want to see everyone held accountable.</p><p>I believe that, if the new attorney general and the Department of Justice, if they don't take all of this on, and do a full scrub and have full accountability and transparency for the American people, you're going to see generations of conservatives who will not trust the Department of Justice, they will not trust the FBI, and they for sure will not trust the FISA process.</p><p>So I mentioned this in things that we have left to do earlier.  And I don't want to gloss over it, because it's very important.  The FISA laws were first written in the '70s.  They need to be completely rewritten because of what the Clinton campaign and the former people at DOJ and FBI were able to do.</p><p>That's going to be a whole undertaking that Congress has to undertake.  If that's not done -- so we need accountability by -- from the attorney general and the Department of Justice for all the people that were involved in this mess.  And, at the same time, Congress is going to have to rewrite the laws that allow the intelligence agencies to go after American citizens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have brought all of this information forward.  You have put it right there in front of Bill Barr.</p><p>Is he going to act on it, do you think?  What are your indications...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NUNES:  Well, we're going to -- yes, we will continue -- we will continue to work with the Justice Department.  Barr just got in there, so let's give him some time here.</p><p>I think, once the new deputy attorney general gets in, and then we will slowly get to work, and start to work with them to try to bring accountability to everyone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Last week, a federal judge in Florida ordered the release of the depositions given by former British spy Christopher Steele and an associate.</p><p>What are you expecting in terms of getting these depositions unsealed?</p><p>NUNES:  So, this is great, because this is going to -- I think it's going to be on March 14 is going to be the day.</p><p>So, remember, Christopher Steele is the guy who was hired by the Democrats to go get information from the Russians.  He wouldn't come and talk to us, right?  He's already been criminally referred to the Justice Department.  He was supposedly an asset for the FBI.  We never got to interview him.</p><p>Luckily, someone sued him and a guy named, I think, David Kramer, who was also involved in the creation and -- creation and dissemination of the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NUNES:  So, he pled the Fifth to us.</p><p>So between Christopher Steele and Kramer, we really want to know, what did they tell the court?  So this is going to be fascinating information.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the Mueller report?  Are you expecting it to drop soon?  What's going on there?</p><p>NUNES:  You know, you're going to interview Ken Starr a little later.</p><p>I don't understand.  If Mueller doesn't have any crimes that he's -- that he's going to prosecute on, then I don't know what report we'd be looking for, because, as far as I can tell, the Mueller investigation was stood up for one reason, and one reason only, and that was based on the dossier.</p><p>And, remember, we have never seen the scope memo that started -- we have talked about it many times on your show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NUNES:  I hope people understand this.</p><p>There's a classified scope memo of what Mueller is supposed to be doing.  It's been hidden from Congress.  It's been hidden from the American people.  My guess is, all it is, is the information from the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, real quick, Adam Schiff is looking for a crime.  And he's doubling down on investigations.</p><p>Let's take a short break, and then I have got to ask you about your colleague Adam Schiff.</p><p>Then, Senator Rick Scott and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney are here.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the ranking member on the House Intel Committee.</p><p>Your colleague who is the chairman of the Intel Committee is Adam Schiff.  He said a long time ago he had more than circumstantial evidence that there's collusion between the president.  He's still out there looking for a crime, as you're trying to finish up your investigation to indicate wrongdoing that he continues to push back on.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes, it's a lot like looking for, like, some mythical creature, right, this collusion creature?</p><p>So I often say -- I joke that it's like in search of Sasquatch, or Loch Ness Monster, or Chupacabra, which is like this mythical animal supposedly in the Southwest.  They just don't exist.</p><p>And so he's just doing a lot of chasing the ghost around in the closet.  He's made lots of promises, and now he's basically moving the goalposts to where they're no longer on collusion anymore.  They're on to basically every single one of Donald Trump's business ventures that he was ever involved in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NUNES:  So, it's gotten way out of control, in terms, this is no longer -- this has nothing to do with Russia anymore.  This is just like going after Trump, which is not the job of the Intelligence Committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they want him out.  I mean, let's face it.</p><p>I want to move on to China, because you have done an investigation for multi years at the Intel Committee.</p><p>And this week, I had the opportunity to speak with the chief security officer of Huawei Telecom.  You have said for many years that China has been stealing our intellectual property for years.</p><p>Listen to this exchange I have got to get your reaction to, Andy Purdy from Huawei.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You just said there have been no major issues around Huawei.</p><p>But, in fact, over the last year, years, several years, I can cite a list of companies that have sued you and you have done settlements with, Motorola Solutions, T-Mobile, Cisco.</p><p>All of those companies sued Huawei for stealing trade secrets.</p><p>ANDY PURDY, HUAWEI CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER:  There have been no major cybersecurity incidents in the world involving Huawei.</p><p>That industry and the fact that we have had some lawsuits in the past has characterized the industry for the last 20 years.  We have resolved those issues, and we're moving forward.  The remaining issues, we hope to resolve in the next year or so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andy, it's not accurate to say that there were no issues around Huawei, when you had lawsuits for stealing trade secrets.  Huawei settled a lawsuit with Motorola Solutions for stealing trade secrets.</p><p>You settled a lawsuit with Cisco for stealing router trade secrets.  So are you saying that, yes, these issues and lawsuits went on in the past, and we settled them, and now we're not going to steal anymore?  Is that what you're saying?</p><p>PURDY:  I'm saying two things.</p><p>I'm saying that, but I'm also saying there have been no major cybersecurity incidents in the world in the 170 countries in which we do business.  Our customers trust us around the world.  And we believe there are additional mechanisms that can be done, so we can provide assurance and transparency, so that we can help make the -- America benefit from us being allowed to compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand that you are on this P.R. trip today, and you have this whole-page ad in The Journal.  And I agree that Huawei needs to convince the world that we can actually trust the products of the company.</p><p>But to say there have been no issues with Huawei is just 100 percent inaccurate.  I just listed the number of companies that have sued you for stealing trade secrets and the settlements that you have done.</p><p>PURDY:  Maria, I didn't disagree with the facts of those cases.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there you go.</p><p>What do people need to understand about Huawei and China?</p><p>NUNES:  Like all major companies in China, they're owned by the Chinese Communist Party.  They're owned by the leadership.</p><p>Huawei especially is one of the largest.  They are developing connections across the entire globe, the entire communications network around the globe, so that they can have -- they can suck up anyone's e-mails, phone calls, text messages.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>NUNES:  That's what they're working on.</p><p>And any of the countries that allow Huawei to come in and put in the backbone of their architecture, they're absolutely crazy, because everything from their government is going to be headed straight to Chinese intelligence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have a report here by IPVM.  And they call themselves the leading researcher on all video -- all things video cameras.</p><p>They report that Huawei Telecom components are currently in 60 percent of all video cameras across the world.  That's -- I don't want to be an alarmist, but that tells me that China is not just listening to us.  They're watching us.</p><p>NUNES:  Well, and don't forget, the big tech companies are able to do that too.</p><p>And so -- but, as it relates to Huawei, the challenge is, this is not a private company, as much as it is a government-owned company from the Chinese communists.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>I want to ask you about the so-called Confucius centers, because you and I have spoken about this in the past.  But there was a new Senate investigation.  And they're warning that these Chinese state-run centers are at -- in more than 100 U.S. colleges.</p><p>You have got Confucius centers in and around Silicon Valley, like near Stanford.  They're sharing research.  What do you make of Confucius centers?</p><p>NUNES:  Well, I would say first that Senate report that you referred to, great report done by Senator Portman and his team.</p><p>It's not just the 100 universities that they're involved in.  It's what they do there, right?  So they're bringing in what are likely either intelligence officers or people that are working with Chinese intelligence.</p><p>They're doing -- they're seeding people into companies.  They're recruiting people.  These are all things that are in this Senate Intelligence -- or the Senate report by Rob Portman that I would encourage all of your viewers to go and take a Sunday and read it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not only that, but China has an enormous amount of money.  So they're buying up companies, like energy companies and banks, and getting American data that way too, another way to...</p><p>NUNES:  And that's a whole 'nother -- yes.  And they're doing that all over the globe, which that could be a whole show just on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's great to have you on the program.</p><p>NUNES:  Thank you.  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Congressman Devin Nunes joining us.</p><p>We will take a break.</p><p>When we come back, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee member Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney is with us on Michael Cohen's testimony.</p><p>And then Republican Senator Rick Scott on the showdown over President Trump's emergency declaration.</p><p>A lot to come, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  ... lose a few Republicans in the Senate.  All you need is 51 to get it out of the Senate.  So it will pass the House with a handful of Republican votes.  It'll come to the Senate.  It might get 51.</p><p>It'll get vetoed by the president.  And Republicans will stand with the president to sustain his veto, and it will be deader than dead.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, that was South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham last week with me right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" sharing his prediction on the fate of a Democratic House resolution intended to block President Trump's national emergency declaration to build a border wall.</p><p>The Senate will soon consider the measure after it passed the House last week.  Some Republicans are signaling their support over concerns a future Democratic president could also choose to go the national emergency route to bypass Congress.  That's why they're pushing back on this.</p><p>Joining me right now in an exclusive interview is Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott.  He sits on the Senate Homeland and Governmental Affairs and Armed Services Committees.</p><p>And, Senator, it's good to have you this morning.</p><p>How are you going to vote in that measure?</p><p>SEN. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA:  Well, I'm going to vote for border security.  I'm going to vote with the president.</p><p>The -- everybody that's going to vote on this ought to go down to the border, like I did, talk to Border Patrol.  And here's what they're going to tell you.  One, they need more people.  Two, they need new technology.  The technology that they've got is decades-old.</p><p>And, three, they have got to have barriers, just so they operational control.  So, if you go talk to them, there's no way you could then say, oh, I'm going to vote against border security.</p><p>The Democrats don't want border security.  American public wants border security.  They want results.  I know a lot of people don't like the process.  None of us like this process.  It's all caused because the Democrats don't believe in border security.  I want results.  I know the president wants results.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, so what about your colleagues who say the reason that I have to push back and not vote with the president is because a Democratic president in the future might take advantage of the same thing?</p><p>This has been used, what, 60 times, go -- calling a national emergency.</p><p>SCOTT:  Right.</p><p>Well, look, you know, a lot -- people can come up with a rationale for voting against things.  I think the American public, they want results.  The president tried.  Look, he -- I mean, he's tried to get the Democrats to fund the border.</p><p>He offered things.  He said, let's talk about DACA.  Let's talk about fixing the TPS program.  And they said no way.  They did everything they could to make sure there was no border security.  So the president is doing what he has to do to take care of the American public, which believes in having a secure border.</p><p>And I'm going to vote with the president.  And I hope every Republican and I hope the Democrats will take the time, go to the border.  Once they do, they are either -- they have one choice, either vote for border security or go tell border security that you don't care about their safety, and you're telling Americans you don't care about their safety.</p><p>It's a simple choice, in my opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about your colleagues on the Republican side that are going against the president?  Why aren't your colleagues firmly behind this president, then?</p><p>SCOTT:  I think -- I think people are -- you know, they want to say that, oh, this is not the right process.</p><p>And I agree.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCOTT:  It's not the right process.  I mean, nobody wants this to be the right -- the process we go through.  Why are we here?</p><p>Because Washington is completely dysfunctional.  That's it.  Washington doesn't work.  I have been there about two months.  It doesn't work.  But the Democrats will not fund what Americans want.  Americans want border security.  The president is doing his job.  Secure the border.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you say Washington doesn't work, is that because that too many people in the Congress have their own ideologies, and they're not doing what their constituents really want them to do?</p><p>SCOTT:  I think there's a bunch of actors.</p><p>I think -- I mean, look at the Democrats.  They will go give a talk about border security, and then will -- they will vote against it.  There's just a lot of actors up there.  We have got to get people that -- one, I believe in term limits.  I think that should happen.</p><p>We have got to get new people up there that are just absolutely committed to getting something done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SCOTT:  We shouldn't pay people if you shut down government, if you don't pass a budget.  That's your job.  There's some basic things that -- I'm a business guy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SCOTT:  And so, in business, you try to get things accomplished.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this.</p><p>The bill is going to come to the Senate floor when?  What's the timing on this?  When do you expect to vote?</p><p>SCOTT:  We don't -- we're not sure exactly when we're going to vote on it.</p><p>I think it's still another couple weeks at least that's going to come.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>SCOTT:  It's got to come -- I think it's got to come to Armed Services first.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCOTT:  So -- and then we have a 15-day -- so I think it's at least two more weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, the president just back from Hanoi with his meeting with Kim Jong-un.  Your reaction to that?</p><p>The president talks a lot about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, so -- but we are yet to see any real movement in terms of denuclearization.</p><p>SCOTT:  Well, first off, let's remember, he's a dictator.  Kim Jong-un is a dictator.  He's a thug.  He's a murderer.  That's what he is.</p><p>Now, I think the president is doing the right thing by trying to figure out how we make our country safer, by sitting down with him and saying, you need to denuclearize.  And this is why your country, you and your citizens, will be in a better position.</p><p>Now, in business, you know that you have to walk away from deals a lot.  That's the way it -- what happens.  Often, before you get a deal, you have to walk away from it.</p><p>I think the president did the right thing.  He walked away because he's not getting what he wanted out of the deal.  And I'm proud of him for doing that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but what can we expect on this issue?</p><p>SCOTT:  Well, what you hope for is that North Korea comes to their senses and says, look, I want to have freedom and democracy, I want to have our citizens with plenty of food, I want to have them -- great jobs.</p><p>That's what you would hope.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCOTT:  But we have to remember, this guy is a tyrant.  He's a thug.  He murders his own citizens, his own family.  So you have to -- you have to have low expectations.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.</p><p>Senator, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>SCOTT:  Nice seeing you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator Rick Scott joining us there.</p><p>Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney up next on her committee's questioning of Michael Cohen last week, as well as a number of issues.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So, they don't have anything with Russia.  There's no collusion.  So now they go and morph into, let's inspect every deal he's ever done.</p><p>We're going to go into his finances.  We're going to check his deals.  We're going to check -- these people are sick.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP:  They're sick.</p><p>I saw little shifty Schiff yesterday.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TRUMP:  No, it's the first time.  He went into a meeting.  And he said, \"We're going to look into his finances.\"</p><p>I said, where did that come from?  He always talked about Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was President Trump at CPAC slamming House Democrats.</p><p>This comes as they ramp up their investigation into the president's finances, following Michael Cohen's public testimony this past week on payments made to women before the election.</p><p>Joining me right now is Democratic Congresswoman from New York Carolyn Maloney.  She sits on the House Oversight Committee.  And she's wearing a jacket which was given to her from the Fire Department of New York.</p><p>Good to see you.</p><p>REP. CAROLYN MALONEY (D), NEW YORK:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get to the compensation fund for the 9/11 victims in a second, because I know that's why you were in the jacket.  And good for you that you're wearing that jacket.</p><p>MALONEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was there at the New York Stock Exchange.  And it's a horrible day.  And we will never forget.  We know that.</p><p>But let me ask you first about Michael Cohen.</p><p>Congresswoman, some of those questions last week were so bizarre.  Does President Trump have a love child?  Does he beat his wife?  I mean, all this stuff focusing on everything that the American people really do not want.</p><p>They would like to see these two sides work together.  What's your reaction to Michael Cohen last week?  And what are you trying to do?</p><p>MALONEY:  Well, I thought that his testimony was alarming, because it did point to possible crimes and campaign finance violations, ethics violations, and possible tax and insurance crimes.</p><p>And he gave a list of people that he thought could lead to other possible crimes.  And this really was the first hearing, oversight hearing, that the Democrats had on the White House and holding them accountable for alleged crimes in trying to influence and disrupt an election and other things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's what I'm saying.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>Look, we know that there was no collusion so far.  We have no evidence of that.  We're waiting on the Robert Mueller report.</p><p>But isn't it true that you're supposed to follow and see if there was wrongdoing done, and then follow the crime?  But here, it's like, you have got your guy and you want to find a crime.  You want to look under every rock to try to hope to find a crime.  You have got your guy, Donald Trump.  He's the guy you want to find a crime.</p><p>That's the path you and your colleagues are moving toward, no?</p><p>MALONEY:  I would say that our whole system of government was founded on checks and balances and holding everyone accountable and holding everyone to the law.  And...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did Michael Cohen perjure himself again?  Because a couple of times, he said things that some of your colleagues on the right are saying, look, that's a lie?  Like, he said he didn't want a job in the White House.  He said he's never been to Prague, by the way.</p><p>That was what the dossier said.</p><p>MALONEY:  Well, I believe him, because he has no reason to lie.  Right now, as you know, he's going to jail...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MALONEY:  ... partially because he lied to Congress.</p><p>And I -- he would gain nothing by lying to Congress again, except increasing his term in jail.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you justify bringing a guy down who has already lied to Congress once, and that's why he was indicted and going to jail, but this is your first witness?</p><p>I mean, given all of this wrongdoing and upset over the FISA abuse, and what happened in the 2016 election, is this really the first person you want to bring down to question?</p><p>MALONEY:  Well, he was one of the closest confidants of the president for 10 years, both while he was president and while he was running for office and even before that.  He gave valuable information about how the president operates.</p><p>He answered one of my questions about meetings, because the president always says, \"I knew nothing about this meeting.\"</p><p>He said nothing ever happened at Trump Tower or any time that the president -- that was an important meeting, that the president was briefed before the meeting, and the participants went back and told him what happened at the meeting.</p><p>Right now, we're trying to gather information.  He also testified that he was cooperating with prosecutors in several other investigations.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MALONEY:  So there is a lot of investigations, including the important Mueller one, where the facts have to be looked at and studied to see if there was any obstruction of justice, if there was an attempt to influence the outcome of an American election with a foreign power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he said no collusion, right?  I think Michael Cohen also said no...</p><p>MALONEY:  That's what he said.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So far, we have heard from the House, the Senate, the DOJ and the FBI that there's no collusion.  I mean, so...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALONEY:  Well, he gave us a list of names.</p><p>And I know that the Democrats are sending out questions to roughly 60 other witnesses to gain information.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MALONEY:  What we need to do -- and I think you did hit something, that it should be more bipartisan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MALONEY:  We should start agreeing on a set of facts that both sides agree on.  And...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, exactly.  And we should agree.  Right.  We should agree on at least the Constitution and process, things like that.</p><p>But there's a lot of division in your party.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALONEY:  But we have a responsibility.  We have a responsibility to the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You absolutely do.</p><p>MALONEY:  And on honesty in government, on oversight in government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what we all want, honesty.</p><p>MALONEY:  And we want our democracy to be just as strong after we leave office as...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I'm with you on that.  That's for sure.</p><p>MALONEY:  And we...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there is a lot of division in your party right now.</p><p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez basically stopped Amazon from coming to your district, New York.  What are you going to do to get Amazon back, and your reaction to all of that?</p><p>MALONEY:  Well, to me, I find it tragic that they are not coming at this point.</p><p>And I have joined the governor and the mayor and many, many others, including the leaders of all the public housing projects, the leaders of our community, the people that I represent.  They wanted Amazon to come.  They wanted the jobs.  They wanted the transit improvement.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But AOC didn't want it.  Is she the face of your party at this point?</p><p>She's talking about this Green Deal that's going to cost $94 trillion.  What are you going to do about it, if you're a moderate Democrat and you're faced with these radical ideas all the way to the left?</p><p>MALONEY:  Well, we can always disagree.  We don't always agree on everything.  So you fight for what you believe in.</p><p>I believe in a diversified economy, and I believe in more jobs for New York.  And I think this statement that we're working to reach out to Amazon is an important statement to other businesses that we want to welcome jobs, that we want to work with them to help our country and help people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, first, you got to get the tax -- first, you got to get the tax structure better, and you have got to make sure you're not double-taxing, right?  And you have got...</p><p>MALONEY:  Absolutely.  That's the biggest -- that is...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, have you spoken to Cuomo about that?</p><p>MALONEY:  Oh, absolutely.  Everyone in New York is totally opposed to what we call SALT, removing the deduction of city and state taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.</p><p>MALONEY:  It is an arrow into our heart.  We have to change that.  I'm working on a report on how it impacts not only New York, but every other state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We have got a hard break, so we have got to go.</p><p>MALONEY:  That's a top priority of ours.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But this compensation fund is so important.  Thank you so much for pushing for it.  The victims need help.</p><p>MALONEY:  Thank you for supporting the victims and survivors and first-responders of 9/11.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>MALONEY:  They were there for us.  We need to be there for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman, thank you.</p><p>MALONEY:  And we need to pass and make permanent the Victims Compensation Fund.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman...</p><p>MALONEY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... Carolyn Maloney.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>MALONEY:  Thank you.  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You too.</p><p>MALONEY:  Great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are awaiting the final report from special counsel Robert Mueller into possible Russian collusion.  The president says that it will be up to Attorney General Bill Barr to determine just how much from the report will be made public.</p><p>Joining me right now, in an exclusive interview, is former Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr, also a former U.S. solicitor general.</p><p>Great to see you, sir.  Thanks very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>KENNETH STARR, FORMER SPECIAL PROSECUTOR:  Oh, my pleasure, Maria.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, on the Mueller report, what are you expecting?  What should we be looking at once that report does drop?</p><p>STARR:  I think we should go back to what Bill Barr said in his confirmation hearings, Maria.</p><p>And that is, he's going to receive a confidential report.  Now, the word confidential has to have meaning.  That is what the regulations say, and that he, Bill Barr, will make the determination of what goes up to Congress.</p><p>So we're behind the veil of ignorance.  We don't know.  But I think we're already see seeing indications, especially from the Michael Cohen testimony, the way that entire episode unfolded, is, there may be less to the Mueller report as it's publicly available than meets the eye.</p><p>He may also just say, there's no -- first of all, he presumably will say no collusion, because thus far, as you well know, there's been no evidence of collusion with the Russians.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>Well, what about what we have been talking about all morning with Devin Nunes, Carolyn Maloney, the fact that there was wrongdoing, there have been criminal charges inferred or suggested by the inspector general for Andrew McCabe?</p><p>Will we see accountability?  What does that mean, criminal charges refers?</p><p>STARR:  Right.  It's a process that simply has to unfold.</p><p>And I know it's frustrating on this side of the process, until those decisions have been made.  But one of the things that we saw this week was just a remarkable set of questions -- and now that's what the conversation is about -- for Michael Cohen.</p><p>And one of the things that's not being -- you asked Congresswoman Maloney a bit about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>STARR:  Which is credibility.</p><p>The first thing you ask about a witness is, is the witness credible?  And there are serious issues of credibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we're going to talk more about this.</p><p>STARR:  The next thing you ask is...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have got an extensive segment with you coming up for FOX Insider.  We will talk about Michael Cohen.  So I will see you then.</p><p>Good to see you.  Ken Starr, thank you.</p><p>Thanks for joining us, everybody.</p><p>FOX Business Network tomorrow morning, join me on \"Mornings With Maria.\"</p><p>Have a great Sunday.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2187627200</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJY-K8P1-JBHT-D31R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7942\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Maria Bartiromo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Straight ahead right here, \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" reaction from two lawmakers whose committees questioned former Trump attorney Michael Cohen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Devin Nunes, is here, and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee member Democrat Carolyn Maloney, ahead of Michael Cohen's next testimony this upcoming week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, Republican Senator Rick Scott on the resistance from some in his own party to President Trump's emergency declaration over the border wall.  Will the president be forced to veto any move to block it?  Plus, the senator's reaction to the summit in Hanoi between President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also with us this morning, Ken Starr on the pending release of the Mueller report.  How much of it, if any, will Attorney General Bill Barr make available for all of us to see?</p><p>And Chinese telecom company Huawei is in full spin mode now, after criticism from U.S. officials about its practices.</p><p>All that and a lot more right here right now, \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>And we begin this morning with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen scheduled for another round of now closed-door testimony before the House Intelligence Committee this Wednesday, this as Democrats ramp up their own investigation into the proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow.</p><p>Joining me right now, in an exclusive interview, is the ranking member of that committee.  He is Republican Congressman from California Devin Nunes.  He also sits on the House Ways and Means Committee.</p><p>And, Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>First, reaction to Michael Cohen this past week, and give us a sense of why it's important to go from the public hearing last week.  Now he's going to be in front of your committee behind closed doors this upcoming week.</p><p>NUNES:  So, remember, he was in public with the Oversight Committee.  Then he came behind closed doors with us for no reason at all.  This is not a man who has any classified information whatsoever.</p><p>We interviewed him for some eight, nine hours.  In fact, Republicans were pretty much done with interviewing after a couple of sessions.  We didn't have any more questions to ask him.  We're not sure why he's coming back, but he will be back this week once again in a classified setting, for someone who has no classified information.</p><p>So, from my perspective, it's all about building out a narrative.  They want to keep it behind closed doors, so that they can conveniently say, well, we can't talk about what happened behind closed doors, when the reality is, we can talk about whatever we want to talk about, because the guy has no classified information.  It's ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said a couple things this past week that some people are wondering if he perjured himself again by saying he never wanted a job in the White House.</p><p>And then I thought there was something really interesting in terms of the work you have done so well for the last year-and-a-half on the dossier.  He said he was never in Prague.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And isn't it true that, in the dossier, the dossier said that he went to Prague to go meet with Russian officials to meddle into the U.S. election?</p><p>NUNES:  Yes.  This is why they don't want him outside.  They don't -- they want him behind closed doors, so that we can't talk about the testimony.</p><p>The bottom line is, is that Cohen was great for Republicans.  It was great for Donald Trump, because we now know that the dossier was total bunk.  There was no truth to it.  And we know that because of -- that Cohen has testified now publicly that he wasn't in Prague, and there was no truth to anything in the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said there was no collusion, by the way.</p><p>NUNES:  No collusion -- no collusion conspiracy, no obstruction.</p><p>You know, these are all issues that were essentially made in that dossier that was the Democrat -- remember, for the viewers out there -- and I think a lot of people forget -- this was the Democratic campaign committee working with the Clinton campaign that produced this dirt, fed it into the FBI to start this investigation in the first place.</p><p>It was totally debunked this week, and it will be debunked again next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have been investigating this now for upwards of two years.</p><p>You have told us a lot.  You have informed the public a lot in terms of what took place in the 2016 election.  I don't think, without you and your colleagues, we would even know what really took place by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI and the DOJ.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes.  There's still more to come.  We're going to keep interviewing people.  We're going to get this information out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about that, because you're wrapping up your investigation.  You have got a couple of things to do.</p><p>One of them is, you have provided a list of the people that you would like to come down to speak to you and get testimony of them.  So we have got this list.  Go through some of these names and why they're important, Tashina Gauhar, Gregory Brower, John Carlin, Kevin Clinesmith.</p><p>Tashina Gauhar is important why?</p><p>NUNES:  So, these are all names that we had sent to our Republican task force at the end of the last Congress.</p><p>These names are all important, because we need to know if these people were involved in the chain of custody of the dossier that we just referred to, because the dossier makes claims that this information came from Russians.</p><p>So all the names that are on this list that we didn't get to last year that still need to be interviewed, if we're really looking for Russian collusion, we need to know if any of those people were actually talking to Russians on behalf of the Clinton campaign or any operative, whether it's Fusion GPS, what Russians were they actually talking to, because, look, they could be the problem.</p><p>They could be -- these Clinton people could be the ones that were in bed with Russians, for all we know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, these are all...</p><p>NUNES:  Or it could be total nonsense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Many of these names are associated with Hillary Clinton.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, obviously, names like Jake Sullivan, who was a P.R. guy, I believe, for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Robby Mook, another P.R. guy for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Sidney Blumenthal, tell me why he's on your list.</p><p>NUNES:  Well, he was also involved in one of the dossiers.  So there's several versions of the dossiers, OK?</p><p>So this was dirt he was feeding into through friends and acquaintances that got into the State Department, right?  So, remember, the dossier came at very different angles all over the place into the FBI and DOJ.</p><p>Some of those people in the Clinton campaign -- I think a lot of people forget this -- why would people in the Clinton campaign be tweeting out messages about Trump's involvement with Russia?  It's because they had the dossier.  They were promoting this message, this dirt out there in 2016.</p><p>And we need to ask these Clinton campaign people where they got it from.  Did they get it from Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS, the dossier that they were paying for, or did they get it from some Russian friends of theirs that they know of?</p><p>The bottom line is, is that everything that was in that dossier, all the accusations that were made, whether it was tweets from the Hillary campaign, press releases from the Hillary campaign, it was all nonsense.  It was stuff they were feeding into the press.  The press was writing about it, they were tweeting it out and promoting it out.  And they were all in on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a part of -- it was part of their strategy to get this narrative out that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians.  Give it to the media, let the media drive the bus on all of it.</p><p>And it actually worked, because...</p><p>NUNES:  At the end of the day -- at the end of the day, it worked.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... a year-and-a-half later, we're still talking about the potential of this.</p><p>NUNES:  That's right.  That's right.</p><p>And that's why we're trying to get to the bottom of who was involved.  That's why we have all these lists of people we need to interview.  We need to know what their involvement was in all this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, so this is a list of 32 people.</p><p>Do you think you're ever going to get these people to come down and give you testimony?  You don't have subpoena power anymore.  Your colleagues are trying to lift every rock and look for a crime around Donald Trump.</p><p>NUNES:  So, the Democrats claim that they're going to be so much nicer than we were to them.</p><p>So, remember, we gave them every single witness they wanted over the last two years when we were in the majority.  They claim they're going to give us witnesses.  So far, they have given us zero witnesses.</p><p>So, if they continue not to give us any witnesses, we will ask all of these people to voluntarily come into Congress to talk to us.  If they won't come in, we will either do it through the courts, or we will send it over to the Senate, and hope that Lindsey Graham and his team can get to the bottom of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Senator Graham has been with us many times over the last several weeks.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said he's doing a deep dive.  He's going to bring the necessary people to testify.  In fact, he's going to interview definitely the people who signed the FISA warrant.</p><p>So as you wrap up your investigation, you have got these 32 names you want to interview.  You have got, number two, declassification.  Are we ever going to see declassification for some of the documents that you think are most important to educate the American people about this?</p><p>NUNES:  Yes, I kind of sum it up this way.</p><p>There's really five areas, the interviews we just talked about.  There's the criminal referrals that have to be made.  There's the declassification, radical declassification.  We need to have declassification across from everyone we interview to everyone that Mueller interviewed.</p><p>Then we're going to have to have a fundamental FISA reform.  We can never again let the FISA process be used to target political campaigns, right?  We can't let our intelligence capabilities be targeted and pointed at political campaigns.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they went to the FISA court.  And they said, look, we have this dirty dossier, and that's the reason that we're going to spy on the Trump campaign, essentially.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes, and not only that.  Not only did they get a warrant to get into somebody's e-mails on the campaign and get -- to be able to suck all that up, e-mails and listen to phone calls and all of that.</p><p>They also opened a counterintelligence investigation into a political campaign.  Now, these are tools that are supposed to be used to go after terrorists, you know, the people that destroyed the buildings here in New York.</p><p>And then the final thing that we have to deal with is, the media was involved in all of this, this disinformation campaign.  They were given the dossier, and they spread it out.  They spread numerous fake news stories about myself, the work that we were doing on the committee, many members on our committee, staff on our committee.</p><p>That's going to have to be dealt with too, this disinformation campaign.  The slander and the libel will all have to be dealt with.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're saying you're going to deal with the misinformation out there.  How do you deal with that?  You have referred to them in the past as tech oligarchs to me.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes.</p><p>So, there's two ways that they're doing it.  So, the fake news media, they're putting out fake news stories.  Sometimes, it comes from the Democrats, right, and the dossier.  They feed it to the media.  The media runs a story</p><p>And then the numerous tech companies out there that are really controlling what all Americans see, right?  So, what these tech companies have become is, they try to pretend they're not, but they're content developers.  They're developing content, OK, through two ways, one, algorithms.  So they're controlling what you and I see when we get on our device.</p><p>So for them to say that they're not developing content is nonsense.  The other thing that they're doing is, they're monetizing this.  So there are some people that will not get rewarded.  Like, if you're a conservative out there putting conservative videos together, you're not going to get money for that, right?  People are not going to advertise on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NUNES:  So, all this has -- has got to be dealt with, I think, in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me get back to that, because I want to find out how are you going to do that.</p><p>But speaking of interviews and your team looking at who you want to speak to, I want to talk about this letter that your colleagues Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan sent to the attorney general, William Barr.</p><p>And, basically, they are asking for a number of things from the A.G.  And they mention in particular Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad.  These are two individuals that worked at the Department of Justice and now work at the special counsel 's office.</p><p>Can you tell me about Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad?</p><p>NUNES:  So, Weissmann is the number two.  It's Mueller's deputy.  He was involved in the custody of the dossier.  So, in early 2016, he was given the dossier.</p><p>This is somebody, him and the other individual that's mentioned there, both DOJ people, both on the Mueller team.  They shouldn't be involved in this investigation.  I don't know -- well, and the questions that my colleagues are asking is...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NUNES:  ... is, you know, there's clear regulations that DOJ has that you can't be conflicted.  And so they're asking questions.</p><p>Look, did they disclose to Mueller before Mueller picked them that they were involved in the chain of custody of this dossier?  Because I will tell you, if I was -- I don't know that they're going to have any criminal indictments or not, but, if I was any attorney, I would be saying, look, these people that are bringing this forward, they shouldn't be involved in this because they are biased.</p><p>We already know the people that were kicked off were biased.  But you also have the fact that these two individuals that Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows are asking about were involved in the chain of custody of important evidence, the dossier, the dirt from the Clinton campaign, that is the basis for this entire hoax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is important, because, for a long time, I have been asking the question, can the Robert Mueller special counsel report have credibility if it doesn't look at what we know to have been wrongdoing by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI?</p><p>So, Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows write to Bill Barr.  And they say this. Number one, we'd like you to identify all actions taken by Weissmann and Ahmad, including disclosures to apprise the department or the special counsel's office of their role in the events Bruce Ohr testified to about supplying the FBI with information relating to the Trump campaign.</p><p>So, they also want to explain all the actions taken by Weissmann and Ahmad after learning that Steele, Simpson and Nellie Ohr were providing Bruce Ohr information for the purpose of relaying it to the FBI, provide all documents and communications referring or relating to disclosures made by Weissmann and Ahmad, and provide documents and communications related to the process the department used to evaluate prosecutors and investigators' independence.</p><p>So they're right now still working on the special counsel's investigation, Robert Mueller.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.  And they're not -- they're not independent investigators.  These are people that were in on this from the beginning.  They knew about the dossier.  They were -- they brought this dossier forward.</p><p>I don't know if they told -- maybe they told Mueller, and Mueller decided to waive these requirements that are there.  Also, let's not forget, we also have evidence that, at one time, that Weissmann was meeting with reporters.</p><p>And so you have this.  And this is part of this whole disinformation campaign.  I should have said this earlier.  It's not just the media.  It's not just that they were getting it from the Clinton campaign.  You also had people within the Department of Justice and the FBI that were briefing reporters.</p><p>Now, what on earth are you doing briefing reporters?  What was Weissmann doing talking to AP reporters, right?  We have asked those questions and never got the answers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>Well, it's a good point that you make.  Jordan and Meadows want this information from the A.G. by March 15 at 5:00 p.m.</p><p>I want to take a short break, but we have got more to cover here.</p><p>Number one, do you think they are going to get this information by March 15?  And, also, Mueller's report going to drop soon.  Got to get your expectations.</p><p>Congressman Devin Nunes is with us this morning.  He's staying with us.</p><p>Quick break, and then we will talk about the concerns about China technology giant Huawei as well and the red flags being raised by U.S. lawmakers on how Beijing may be infiltrating American universities to spread its propaganda.</p><p>Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures.  Let me know what you would like to know from Devin Nunes on Instagram @SundayFutures.</p><p>Stay with us, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>And I am back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the ranking member on the House Intel Committee.</p><p>And, Congressman, you just said that you want to get these people a list of 32 people down, so that you can interview them.</p><p>What happens next?  I mean, our audience wants to see accountability.  What are you expecting in terms of accountability?  How will Bill Barr response to this letter that Meadows and Jordan just sent him?</p><p>And do you think -- I mean, when you say criminal charges, what does that mean, criminal referrals?</p><p>NUNES:  Let me start with this.</p><p>All of us want to see justice equal under the law, right?  So we want to see everyone held accountable.</p><p>I believe that, if the new attorney general and the Department of Justice, if they don't take all of this on, and do a full scrub and have full accountability and transparency for the American people, you're going to see generations of conservatives who will not trust the Department of Justice, they will not trust the FBI, and they for sure will not trust the FISA process.</p><p>So I mentioned this in things that we have left to do earlier.  And I don't want to gloss over it, because it's very important.  The FISA laws were first written in the '70s.  They need to be completely rewritten because of what the Clinton campaign and the former people at DOJ and FBI were able to do.</p><p>That's going to be a whole undertaking that Congress has to undertake.  If that's not done -- so we need accountability by -- from the attorney general and the Department of Justice for all the people that were involved in this mess.  And, at the same time, Congress is going to have to rewrite the laws that allow the intelligence agencies to go after American citizens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have brought all of this information forward.  You have put it right there in front of Bill Barr.</p><p>Is he going to act on it, do you think?  What are your indications...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NUNES:  Well, we're going to -- yes, we will continue -- we will continue to work with the Justice Department.  Barr just got in there, so let's give him some time here.</p><p>I think, once the new deputy attorney general gets in, and then we will slowly get to work, and start to work with them to try to bring accountability to everyone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Last week, a federal judge in Florida ordered the release of the depositions given by former British spy Christopher Steele and an associate.</p><p>What are you expecting in terms of getting these depositions unsealed?</p><p>NUNES:  So, this is great, because this is going to -- I think it's going to be on March 14 is going to be the day.</p><p>So, remember, Christopher Steele is the guy who was hired by the Democrats to go get information from the Russians.  He wouldn't come and talk to us, right?  He's already been criminally referred to the Justice Department.  He was supposedly an asset for the FBI.  We never got to interview him.</p><p>Luckily, someone sued him and a guy named, I think, David Kramer, who was also involved in the creation and -- creation and dissemination of the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NUNES:  So, he pled the Fifth to us.</p><p>So between Christopher Steele and Kramer, we really want to know, what did they tell the court?  So this is going to be fascinating information.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the Mueller report?  Are you expecting it to drop soon?  What's going on there?</p><p>NUNES:  You know, you're going to interview Ken Starr a little later.</p><p>I don't understand.  If Mueller doesn't have any crimes that he's -- that he's going to prosecute on, then I don't know what report we'd be looking for, because, as far as I can tell, the Mueller investigation was stood up for one reason, and one reason only, and that was based on the dossier.</p><p>And, remember, we have never seen the scope memo that started -- we have talked about it many times on your show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NUNES:  I hope people understand this.</p><p>There's a classified scope memo of what Mueller is supposed to be doing.  It's been hidden from Congress.  It's been hidden from the American people.  My guess is, all it is, is the information from the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, real quick, Adam Schiff is looking for a crime.  And he's doubling down on investigations.</p><p>Let's take a short break, and then I have got to ask you about your colleague Adam Schiff.</p><p>Then, Senator Rick Scott and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney are here.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the ranking member on the House Intel Committee.</p><p>Your colleague who is the chairman of the Intel Committee is Adam Schiff.  He said a long time ago he had more than circumstantial evidence that there's collusion between the president.  He's still out there looking for a crime, as you're trying to finish up your investigation to indicate wrongdoing that he continues to push back on.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes, it's a lot like looking for, like, some mythical creature, right, this collusion creature?</p><p>So I often say -- I joke that it's like in search of Sasquatch, or Loch Ness Monster, or Chupacabra, which is like this mythical animal supposedly in the Southwest.  They just don't exist.</p><p>And so he's just doing a lot of chasing the ghost around in the closet.  He's made lots of promises, and now he's basically moving the goalposts to where they're no longer on collusion anymore.  They're on to basically every single one of Donald Trump's business ventures that he was ever involved in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NUNES:  So, it's gotten way out of control, in terms, this is no longer -- this has nothing to do with Russia anymore.  This is just like going after Trump, which is not the job of the Intelligence Committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they want him out.  I mean, let's face it.</p><p>I want to move on to China, because you have done an investigation for multi years at the Intel Committee.</p><p>And this week, I had the opportunity to speak with the chief security officer of Huawei Telecom.  You have said for many years that China has been stealing our intellectual property for years.</p><p>Listen to this exchange I have got to get your reaction to, Andy Purdy from Huawei.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You just said there have been no major issues around Huawei.</p><p>But, in fact, over the last year, years, several years, I can cite a list of companies that have sued you and you have done settlements with, Motorola Solutions, T-Mobile, Cisco.</p><p>All of those companies sued Huawei for stealing trade secrets.</p><p>ANDY PURDY, HUAWEI CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER:  There have been no major cybersecurity incidents in the world involving Huawei.</p><p>That industry and the fact that we have had some lawsuits in the past has characterized the industry for the last 20 years.  We have resolved those issues, and we're moving forward.  The remaining issues, we hope to resolve in the next year or so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andy, it's not accurate to say that there were no issues around Huawei, when you had lawsuits for stealing trade secrets.  Huawei settled a lawsuit with Motorola Solutions for stealing trade secrets.</p><p>You settled a lawsuit with Cisco for stealing router trade secrets.  So are you saying that, yes, these issues and lawsuits went on in the past, and we settled them, and now we're not going to steal anymore?  Is that what you're saying?</p><p>PURDY:  I'm saying two things.</p><p>I'm saying that, but I'm also saying there have been no major cybersecurity incidents in the world in the 170 countries in which we do business.  Our customers trust us around the world.  And we believe there are additional mechanisms that can be done, so we can provide assurance and transparency, so that we can help make the -- America benefit from us being allowed to compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand that you are on this P.R. trip today, and you have this whole-page ad in The Journal.  And I agree that Huawei needs to convince the world that we can actually trust the products of the company.</p><p>But to say there have been no issues with Huawei is just 100 percent inaccurate.  I just listed the number of companies that have sued you for stealing trade secrets and the settlements that you have done.</p><p>PURDY:  Maria, I didn't disagree with the facts of those cases.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there you go.</p><p>What do people need to understand about Huawei and China?</p><p>NUNES:  Like all major companies in China, they're owned by the Chinese Communist Party.  They're owned by the leadership.</p><p>Huawei especially is one of the largest.  They are developing connections across the entire globe, the entire communications network around the globe, so that they can have -- they can suck up anyone's e-mails, phone calls, text messages.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>NUNES:  That's what they're working on.</p><p>And any of the countries that allow Huawei to come in and put in the backbone of their architecture, they're absolutely crazy, because everything from their government is going to be headed straight to Chinese intelligence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have a report here by IPVM.  And they call themselves the leading researcher on all video -- all things video cameras.</p><p>They report that Huawei Telecom components are currently in 60 percent of all video cameras across the world.  That's -- I don't want to be an alarmist, but that tells me that China is not just listening to us.  They're watching us.</p><p>NUNES:  Well, and don't forget, the big tech companies are able to do that too.</p><p>And so -- but, as it relates to Huawei, the challenge is, this is not a private company, as much as it is a government-owned company from the Chinese communists.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>I want to ask you about the so-called Confucius centers, because you and I have spoken about this in the past.  But there was a new Senate investigation.  And they're warning that these Chinese state-run centers are at -- in more than 100 U.S. colleges.</p><p>You have got Confucius centers in and around Silicon Valley, like near Stanford.  They're sharing research.  What do you make of Confucius centers?</p><p>NUNES:  Well, I would say first that Senate report that you referred to, great report done by Senator Portman and his team.</p><p>It's not just the 100 universities that they're involved in.  It's what they do there, right?  So they're bringing in what are likely either intelligence officers or people that are working with Chinese intelligence.</p><p>They're doing -- they're seeding people into companies.  They're recruiting people.  These are all things that are in this Senate Intelligence -- or the Senate report by Rob Portman that I would encourage all of your viewers to go and take a Sunday and read it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not only that, but China has an enormous amount of money.  So they're buying up companies, like energy companies and banks, and getting American data that way too, another way to...</p><p>NUNES:  And that's a whole 'nother -- yes.  And they're doing that all over the globe, which that could be a whole show just on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's great to have you on the program.</p><p>NUNES:  Thank you.  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Congressman Devin Nunes joining us.</p><p>We will take a break.</p><p>When we come back, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee member Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney is with us on Michael Cohen's testimony.</p><p>And then Republican Senator Rick Scott on the showdown over President Trump's emergency declaration.</p><p>A lot to come, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  ... lose a few Republicans in the Senate.  All you need is 51 to get it out of the Senate.  So it will pass the House with a handful of Republican votes.  It'll come to the Senate.  It might get 51.</p><p>It'll get vetoed by the president.  And Republicans will stand with the president to sustain his veto, and it will be deader than dead.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, that was South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham last week with me right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" sharing his prediction on the fate of a Democratic House resolution intended to block President Trump's national emergency declaration to build a border wall.</p><p>The Senate will soon consider the measure after it passed the House last week.  Some Republicans are signaling their support over concerns a future Democratic president could also choose to go the national emergency route to bypass Congress.  That's why they're pushing back on this.</p><p>Joining me right now in an exclusive interview is Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott.  He sits on the Senate Homeland and Governmental Affairs and Armed Services Committees.</p><p>And, Senator, it's good to have you this morning.</p><p>How are you going to vote in that measure?</p><p>SEN. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA:  Well, I'm going to vote for border security.  I'm going to vote with the president.</p><p>The -- everybody that's going to vote on this ought to go down to the border, like I did, talk to Border Patrol.  And here's what they're going to tell you.  One, they need more people.  Two, they need new technology.  The technology that they've got is decades-old.</p><p>And, three, they have got to have barriers, just so they operational control.  So, if you go talk to them, there's no way you could then say, oh, I'm going to vote against border security.</p><p>The Democrats don't want border security.  American public wants border security.  They want results.  I know a lot of people don't like the process.  None of us like this process.  It's all caused because the Democrats don't believe in border security.  I want results.  I know the president wants results.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, so what about your colleagues who say the reason that I have to push back and not vote with the president is because a Democratic president in the future might take advantage of the same thing?</p><p>This has been used, what, 60 times, go -- calling a national emergency.</p><p>SCOTT:  Right.</p><p>Well, look, you know, a lot -- people can come up with a rationale for voting against things.  I think the American public, they want results.  The president tried.  Look, he -- I mean, he's tried to get the Democrats to fund the border.</p><p>He offered things.  He said, let's talk about DACA.  Let's talk about fixing the TPS program.  And they said no way.  They did everything they could to make sure there was no border security.  So the president is doing what he has to do to take care of the American public, which believes in having a secure border.</p><p>And I'm going to vote with the president.  And I hope every Republican and I hope the Democrats will take the time, go to the border.  Once they do, they are either -- they have one choice, either vote for border security or go tell border security that you don't care about their safety, and you're telling Americans you don't care about their safety.</p><p>It's a simple choice, in my opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about your colleagues on the Republican side that are going against the president?  Why aren't your colleagues firmly behind this president, then?</p><p>SCOTT:  I think -- I think people are -- you know, they want to say that, oh, this is not the right process.</p><p>And I agree.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCOTT:  It's not the right process.  I mean, nobody wants this to be the right -- the process we go through.  Why are we here?</p><p>Because Washington is completely dysfunctional.  That's it.  Washington doesn't work.  I have been there about two months.  It doesn't work.  But the Democrats will not fund what Americans want.  Americans want border security.  The president is doing his job.  Secure the border.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you say Washington doesn't work, is that because that too many people in the Congress have their own ideologies, and they're not doing what their constituents really want them to do?</p><p>SCOTT:  I think there's a bunch of actors.</p><p>I think -- I mean, look at the Democrats.  They will go give a talk about border security, and then will -- they will vote against it.  There's just a lot of actors up there.  We have got to get people that -- one, I believe in term limits.  I think that should happen.</p><p>We have got to get new people up there that are just absolutely committed to getting something done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SCOTT:  We shouldn't pay people if you shut down government, if you don't pass a budget.  That's your job.  There's some basic things that -- I'm a business guy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SCOTT:  And so, in business, you try to get things accomplished.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this.</p><p>The bill is going to come to the Senate floor when?  What's the timing on this?  When do you expect to vote?</p><p>SCOTT:  We don't -- we're not sure exactly when we're going to vote on it.</p><p>I think it's still another couple weeks at least that's going to come.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>SCOTT:  It's got to come -- I think it's got to come to Armed Services first.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCOTT:  So -- and then we have a 15-day -- so I think it's at least two more weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, the president just back from Hanoi with his meeting with Kim Jong-un.  Your reaction to that?</p><p>The president talks a lot about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, so -- but we are yet to see any real movement in terms of denuclearization.</p><p>SCOTT:  Well, first off, let's remember, he's a dictator.  Kim Jong-un is a dictator.  He's a thug.  He's a murderer.  That's what he is.</p><p>Now, I think the president is doing the right thing by trying to figure out how we make our country safer, by sitting down with him and saying, you need to denuclearize.  And this is why your country, you and your citizens, will be in a better position.</p><p>Now, in business, you know that you have to walk away from deals a lot.  That's the way it -- what happens.  Often, before you get a deal, you have to walk away from it.</p><p>I think the president did the right thing.  He walked away because he's not getting what he wanted out of the deal.  And I'm proud of him for doing that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but what can we expect on this issue?</p><p>SCOTT:  Well, what you hope for is that North Korea comes to their senses and says, look, I want to have freedom and democracy, I want to have our citizens with plenty of food, I want to have them -- great jobs.</p><p>That's what you would hope.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCOTT:  But we have to remember, this guy is a tyrant.  He's a thug.  He murders his own citizens, his own family.  So you have to -- you have to have low expectations.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.</p><p>Senator, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>SCOTT:  Nice seeing you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator Rick Scott joining us there.</p><p>Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney up next on her committee's questioning of Michael Cohen last week, as well as a number of issues.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So, they don't have anything with Russia.  There's no collusion.  So now they go and morph into, let's inspect every deal he's ever done.</p><p>We're going to go into his finances.  We're going to check his deals.  We're going to check -- these people are sick.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP:  They're sick.</p><p>I saw little shifty Schiff yesterday.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TRUMP:  No, it's the first time.  He went into a meeting.  And he said, \"We're going to look into his finances.\"</p><p>I said, where did that come from?  He always talked about Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was President Trump at CPAC slamming House Democrats.</p><p>This comes as they ramp up their investigation into the president's finances, following Michael Cohen's public testimony this past week on payments made to women before the election.</p><p>Joining me right now is Democratic Congresswoman from New York Carolyn Maloney.  She sits on the House Oversight Committee.  And she's wearing a jacket which was given to her from the Fire Department of New York.</p><p>Good to see you.</p><p>REP. CAROLYN MALONEY (D), NEW YORK:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get to the compensation fund for the 9/11 victims in a second, because I know that's why you were in the jacket.  And good for you that you're wearing that jacket.</p><p>MALONEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was there at the New York Stock Exchange.  And it's a horrible day.  And we will never forget.  We know that.</p><p>But let me ask you first about Michael Cohen.</p><p>Congresswoman, some of those questions last week were so bizarre.  Does President Trump have a love child?  Does he beat his wife?  I mean, all this stuff focusing on everything that the American people really do not want.</p><p>They would like to see these two sides work together.  What's your reaction to Michael Cohen last week?  And what are you trying to do?</p><p>MALONEY:  Well, I thought that his testimony was alarming, because it did point to possible crimes and campaign finance violations, ethics violations, and possible tax and insurance crimes.</p><p>And he gave a list of people that he thought could lead to other possible crimes.  And this really was the first hearing, oversight hearing, that the Democrats had on the White House and holding them accountable for alleged crimes in trying to influence and disrupt an election and other things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's what I'm saying.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>Look, we know that there was no collusion so far.  We have no evidence of that.  We're waiting on the Robert Mueller report.</p><p>But isn't it true that you're supposed to follow and see if there was wrongdoing done, and then follow the crime?  But here, it's like, you have got your guy and you want to find a crime.  You want to look under every rock to try to hope to find a crime.  You have got your guy, Donald Trump.  He's the guy you want to find a crime.</p><p>That's the path you and your colleagues are moving toward, no?</p><p>MALONEY:  I would say that our whole system of government was founded on checks and balances and holding everyone accountable and holding everyone to the law.  And...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did Michael Cohen perjure himself again?  Because a couple of times, he said things that some of your colleagues on the right are saying, look, that's a lie?  Like, he said he didn't want a job in the White House.  He said he's never been to Prague, by the way.</p><p>That was what the dossier said.</p><p>MALONEY:  Well, I believe him, because he has no reason to lie.  Right now, as you know, he's going to jail...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MALONEY:  ... partially because he lied to Congress.</p><p>And I -- he would gain nothing by lying to Congress again, except increasing his term in jail.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you justify bringing a guy down who has already lied to Congress once, and that's why he was indicted and going to jail, but this is your first witness?</p><p>I mean, given all of this wrongdoing and upset over the FISA abuse, and what happened in the 2016 election, is this really the first person you want to bring down to question?</p><p>MALONEY:  Well, he was one of the closest confidants of the president for 10 years, both while he was president and while he was running for office and even before that.  He gave valuable information about how the president operates.</p><p>He answered one of my questions about meetings, because the president always says, \"I knew nothing about this meeting.\"</p><p>He said nothing ever happened at Trump Tower or any time that the president -- that was an important meeting, that the president was briefed before the meeting, and the participants went back and told him what happened at the meeting.</p><p>Right now, we're trying to gather information.  He also testified that he was cooperating with prosecutors in several other investigations.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MALONEY:  So there is a lot of investigations, including the important Mueller one, where the facts have to be looked at and studied to see if there was any obstruction of justice, if there was an attempt to influence the outcome of an American election with a foreign power.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he said no collusion, right?  I think Michael Cohen also said no...</p><p>MALONEY:  That's what he said.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So far, we have heard from the House, the Senate, the DOJ and the FBI that there's no collusion.  I mean, so...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALONEY:  Well, he gave us a list of names.</p><p>And I know that the Democrats are sending out questions to roughly 60 other witnesses to gain information.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MALONEY:  What we need to do -- and I think you did hit something, that it should be more bipartisan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MALONEY:  We should start agreeing on a set of facts that both sides agree on.  And...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, exactly.  And we should agree.  Right.  We should agree on at least the Constitution and process, things like that.</p><p>But there's a lot of division in your party.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALONEY:  But we have a responsibility.  We have a responsibility to the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You absolutely do.</p><p>MALONEY:  And on honesty in government, on oversight in government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what we all want, honesty.</p><p>MALONEY:  And we want our democracy to be just as strong after we leave office as...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I'm with you on that.  That's for sure.</p><p>MALONEY:  And we...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there is a lot of division in your party right now.</p><p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez basically stopped Amazon from coming to your district, New York.  What are you going to do to get Amazon back, and your reaction to all of that?</p><p>MALONEY:  Well, to me, I find it tragic that they are not coming at this point.</p><p>And I have joined the governor and the mayor and many, many others, including the leaders of all the public housing projects, the leaders of our community, the people that I represent.  They wanted Amazon to come.  They wanted the jobs.  They wanted the transit improvement.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But AOC didn't want it.  Is she the face of your party at this point?</p><p>She's talking about this Green Deal that's going to cost $94 trillion.  What are you going to do about it, if you're a moderate Democrat and you're faced with these radical ideas all the way to the left?</p><p>MALONEY:  Well, we can always disagree.  We don't always agree on everything.  So you fight for what you believe in.</p><p>I believe in a diversified economy, and I believe in more jobs for New York.  And I think this statement that we're working to reach out to Amazon is an important statement to other businesses that we want to welcome jobs, that we want to work with them to help our country and help people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, first, you got to get the tax -- first, you got to get the tax structure better, and you have got to make sure you're not double-taxing, right?  And you have got...</p><p>MALONEY:  Absolutely.  That's the biggest -- that is...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, have you spoken to Cuomo about that?</p><p>MALONEY:  Oh, absolutely.  Everyone in New York is totally opposed to what we call SALT, removing the deduction of city and state taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.</p><p>MALONEY:  It is an arrow into our heart.  We have to change that.  I'm working on a report on how it impacts not only New York, but every other state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We have got a hard break, so we have got to go.</p><p>MALONEY:  That's a top priority of ours.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But this compensation fund is so important.  Thank you so much for pushing for it.  The victims need help.</p><p>MALONEY:  Thank you for supporting the victims and survivors and first-responders of 9/11.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>MALONEY:  They were there for us.  We need to be there for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman, thank you.</p><p>MALONEY:  And we need to pass and make permanent the Victims Compensation Fund.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congresswoman...</p><p>MALONEY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... Carolyn Maloney.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>MALONEY:  Thank you.  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You too.</p><p>MALONEY:  Great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are awaiting the final report from special counsel Robert Mueller into possible Russian collusion.  The president says that it will be up to Attorney General Bill Barr to determine just how much from the report will be made public.</p><p>Joining me right now, in an exclusive interview, is former Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr, also a former U.S. solicitor general.</p><p>Great to see you, sir.  Thanks very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>KENNETH STARR, FORMER SPECIAL PROSECUTOR:  Oh, my pleasure, Maria.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, on the Mueller report, what are you expecting?  What should we be looking at once that report does drop?</p><p>STARR:  I think we should go back to what Bill Barr said in his confirmation hearings, Maria.</p><p>And that is, he's going to receive a confidential report.  Now, the word confidential has to have meaning.  That is what the regulations say, and that he, Bill Barr, will make the determination of what goes up to Congress.</p><p>So we're behind the veil of ignorance.  We don't know.  But I think we're already see seeing indications, especially from the Michael Cohen testimony, the way that entire episode unfolded, is, there may be less to the Mueller report as it's publicly available than meets the eye.</p><p>He may also just say, there's no -- first of all, he presumably will say no collusion, because thus far, as you well know, there's been no evidence of collusion with the Russians.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>Well, what about what we have been talking about all morning with Devin Nunes, Carolyn Maloney, the fact that there was wrongdoing, there have been criminal charges inferred or suggested by the inspector general for Andrew McCabe?</p><p>Will we see accountability?  What does that mean, criminal charges refers?</p><p>STARR:  Right.  It's a process that simply has to unfold.</p><p>And I know it's frustrating on this side of the process, until those decisions have been made.  But one of the things that we saw this week was just a remarkable set of questions -- and now that's what the conversation is about -- for Michael Cohen.</p><p>And one of the things that's not being -- you asked Congresswoman Maloney a bit about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>STARR:  Which is credibility.</p><p>The first thing you ask about a witness is, is the witness credible?  And there are serious issues of credibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we're going to talk more about this.</p><p>STARR:  The next thing you ask is...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have got an extensive segment with you coming up for FOX Insider.  We will talk about Michael Cohen.  So I will see you then.</p><p>Good to see you.  Ken Starr, thank you.</p><p>Thanks for joining us, everybody.</p><p>FOX Business Network tomorrow morning, join me on \"Mornings With Maria.\"</p><p>Have a great Sunday.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2187627993</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJY-K8P1-JBHT-D31W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7942\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Maria Bartiromo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Straight ahead right here, \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" reaction from two lawmakers whose committees questioned former Trump attorney Michael Cohen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Devin Nunes, is here, and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee member Democrat Carolyn Maloney, ahead of Michael Cohen's next testimony this upcoming week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, Republican Senator Rick Scott on the resistance from some in his own party to President Trump's emergency declaration over the border wall. Will the president be forced to veto any move to block it? Plus, the senator's reaction to the summit in Hanoi between President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also with us this morning, Ken Starr on the pending release of the Mueller report. How much of it, if any, will Attorney General Bill Barr make available for all of us to see?</p><p>And Chinese telecom company Huawei is in full spin mode now, after criticism from U.S. officials about its practices.</p><p>All that and a lot more right here right now, \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>And we begin this morning with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen scheduled for another round of now closed-door testimony before the House Intelligence Committee this Wednesday, this as Democrats ramp up their own investigation into the proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow.</p><p>Joining me right now, in an exclusive interview, is the ranking member of that committee. He is Republican Congressman from California Devin Nunes. He also sits on the House Ways and Means Committee.</p><p>And, Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA: Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>First, reaction to Michael Cohen this past week, and give us a sense of why it's important to go from the public hearing last week. Now he's going to be in front of your committee behind closed doors this upcoming week.</p><p>NUNES: So, remember, he was in public with the Oversight Committee. Then he came behind closed doors with us for no reason at all. This is not a man who has any classified information whatsoever.</p><p>We interviewed him for some eight, nine hours. In fact, Republicans were pretty much done with interviewing after a couple of sessions. We didn't have any more questions to ask him. We're not sure why he's coming back, but he will be back this week once again in a classified setting, for someone who has no classified information.</p><p>So, from my perspective, it's all about building out a narrative. They want to keep it behind closed doors, so that they can conveniently say, well, we can't talk about what happened behind closed doors, when the reality is, we can talk about whatever we want to talk about, because the guy has no classified information. It's ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He said a couple things this past week that some people are wondering if he perjured himself again by saying he never wanted a job in the White House.</p><p>And then I thought there was something really interesting in terms of the work you have done so well for the last year-and-a-half on the dossier. He said he was never in Prague.</p><p>NUNES: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And isn't it true that, in the dossier, the dossier said that he went to Prague to go meet with Russian officials to meddle into the U.S. election?</p><p>NUNES: Yes. This is why they don't want him outside. They don't -- they want him behind closed doors, so that we can't talk about the testimony.</p><p>The bottom line is, is that Cohen was great for Republicans. It was great for Donald Trump, because we now know that the dossier was total bunk. There was no truth to it. And we know that because of -- that Cohen has testified now publicly that he wasn't in Prague, and there was no truth to anything in the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he said there was no collusion, by the way.</p><p>NUNES: No collusion -- no collusion conspiracy, no obstruction.</p><p>You know, these are all issues that were essentially made in that dossier that was the Democrat -- remember, for the viewers out there -- and I think a lot of people forget -- this was the Democratic campaign committee working with the Clinton campaign that produced this dirt, fed it into the FBI to start this investigation in the first place.</p><p>It was totally debunked this week, and it will be debunked again next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you have been investigating this now for upwards of two years.</p><p>You have told us a lot. You have informed the public a lot in terms of what took place in the 2016 election. I don't think, without you and your colleagues, we would even know what really took place by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI and the DOJ.</p><p>NUNES: Yes. There's still more to come. We're going to keep interviewing people. We're going to get this information out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, tell us about that, because you're wrapping up your investigation. You have got a couple of things to do.</p><p>One of them is, you have provided a list of the people that you would like to come down to speak to you and get testimony of them. So we have got this list. Go through some of these names and why they're important, Tashina Gauhar, Gregory Brower, John Carlin, Kevin Clinesmith.</p><p>Tashina Gauhar is important why?</p><p>NUNES: So, these are all names that we had sent to our Republican task force at the end of the last Congress.</p><p>These names are all important, because we need to know if these people were involved in the chain of custody of the dossier that we just referred to, because the dossier makes claims that this information came from Russians.</p><p>So all the names that are on this list that we didn't get to last year that still need to be interviewed, if we're really looking for Russian collusion, we need to know if any of those people were actually talking to Russians on behalf of the Clinton campaign or any operative, whether it's Fusion GPS, what Russians were they actually talking to, because, look, they could be the problem.</p><p>They could be -- these Clinton people could be the ones that were in bed with Russians, for all we know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, these are all...</p><p>NUNES: Or it could be total nonsense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Many of these names are associated with Hillary Clinton.</p><p>NUNES: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, obviously, names like Jake Sullivan, who was a P.R. guy, I believe, for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>NUNES: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Robby Mook, another P.R. guy for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Sidney Blumenthal, tell me why he's on your list.</p><p>NUNES: Well, he was also involved in one of the dossiers. So there's several versions of the dossiers, OK?</p><p>So this was dirt he was feeding into through friends and acquaintances that got into the State Department, right? So, remember, the dossier came at very different angles all over the place into the FBI and DOJ.</p><p>Some of those people in the Clinton campaign -- I think a lot of people forget this -- why would people in the Clinton campaign be tweeting out messages about Trump's involvement with Russia? It's because they had the dossier. They were promoting this message, this dirt out there in 2016.</p><p>And we need to ask these Clinton campaign people where they got it from. Did they get it from Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS, the dossier that they were paying for, or did they get it from some Russian friends of theirs that they know of?</p><p>The bottom line is, is that everything that was in that dossier, all the accusations that were made, whether it was tweets from the Hillary campaign, press releases from the Hillary campaign, it was all nonsense. It was stuff they were feeding into the press. The press was writing about it, they were tweeting it out and promoting it out. And they were all in on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was a part of -- it was part of their strategy to get this narrative out that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians. Give it to the media, let the media drive the bus on all of it.</p><p>And it actually worked, because...</p><p>NUNES: At the end of the day -- at the end of the day, it worked.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ... a year-and-a-half later, we're still talking about the potential of this.</p><p>NUNES: That's right. That's right.</p><p>And that's why we're trying to get to the bottom of who was involved. That's why we have all these lists of people we need to interview. We need to know what their involvement was in all this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, so this is a list of 32 people.</p><p>Do you think you're ever going to get these people to come down and give you testimony? You don't have subpoena power anymore. Your colleagues are trying to lift every rock and look for a crime around Donald Trump.</p><p>NUNES: So, the Democrats claim that they're going to be so much nicer than we were to them.</p><p>So, remember, we gave them every single witness they wanted over the last two years when we were in the majority. They claim they're going to give us witnesses. So far, they have given us zero witnesses.</p><p>So, if they continue not to give us any witnesses, we will ask all of these people to voluntarily come into Congress to talk to us. If they won't come in, we will either do it through the courts, or we will send it over to the Senate, and hope that Lindsey Graham and his team can get to the bottom of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Senator Graham has been with us many times over the last several weeks.</p><p>NUNES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he said he's doing a deep dive. He's going to bring the necessary people to testify. In fact, he's going to interview definitely the people who signed the FISA warrant.</p><p>So as you wrap up your investigation, you have got these 32 names you want to interview. You have got, number two, declassification. Are we ever going to see declassification for some of the documents that you think are most important to educate the American people about this?</p><p>NUNES: Yes, I kind of sum it up this way.</p><p>There's really five areas, the interviews we just talked about. There's the criminal referrals that have to be made. There's the declassification, radical declassification. We need to have declassification across from everyone we interview to everyone that Mueller interviewed.</p><p>Then we're going to have to have a fundamental FISA reform. We can never again let the FISA process be used to target political campaigns, right? We can't let our intelligence capabilities be targeted and pointed at political campaigns.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, they went to the FISA court. And they said, look, we have this dirty dossier, and that's the reason that we're going to spy on the Trump campaign, essentially.</p><p>NUNES: Yes, and not only that. Not only did they get a warrant to get into somebody's e-mails on the campaign and get -- to be able to suck all that up, e-mails and listen to phone calls and all of that.</p><p>They also opened a counterintelligence investigation into a political campaign. Now, these are tools that are supposed to be used to go after terrorists, you know, the people that destroyed the buildings here in New York.</p><p>And then the final thing that we have to deal with is, the media was involved in all of this, this disinformation campaign. They were given the dossier, and they spread it out. They spread numerous fake news stories about myself, the work that we were doing on the committee, many members on our committee, staff on our committee.</p><p>That's going to have to be dealt with too, this disinformation campaign. The slander and the libel will all have to be dealt with.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're saying you're going to deal with the misinformation out there. How do you deal with that? You have referred to them in the past as tech oligarchs to me.</p><p>NUNES: Yes.</p><p>So, there's two ways that they're doing it. So, the fake news media, they're putting out fake news stories. Sometimes, it comes from the Democrats, right, and the dossier. They feed it to the media. The media runs a story</p><p>And then the numerous tech companies out there that are really controlling what all Americans see, right? So, what these tech companies have become is, they try to pretend they're not, but they're content developers. They're developing content, OK, through two ways, one, algorithms. So they're controlling what you and I see when we get on our device.</p><p>So for them to say that they're not developing content is nonsense. The other thing that they're doing is, they're monetizing this. So there are some people that will not get rewarded. Like, if you're a conservative out there putting conservative videos together, you're not going to get money for that, right? People are not going to advertise on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NUNES: So, all this has -- has got to be dealt with, I think, in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, let me get back to that, because I want to find out how are you going to do that.</p><p>But speaking of interviews and your team looking at who you want to speak to, I want to talk about this letter that your colleagues Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan sent to the attorney general, William Barr.</p><p>And, basically, they are asking for a number of things from the A.G. And they mention in particular Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad. These are two individuals that worked at the Department of Justice and now work at the special counsel 's office.</p><p>Can you tell me about Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad?</p><p>NUNES: So, Weissmann is the number two. It's Mueller's deputy. He was involved in the custody of the dossier. So, in early 2016, he was given the dossier.</p><p>This is somebody, him and the other individual that's mentioned there, both DOJ people, both on the Mueller team. They shouldn't be involved in this investigation. I don't know -- well, and the questions that my colleagues are asking is...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NUNES: ... is, you know, there's clear regulations that DOJ has that you can't be conflicted. And so they're asking questions.</p><p>Look, did they disclose to Mueller before Mueller picked them that they were involved in the chain of custody of this dossier? Because I will tell you, if I was -- I don't know that they're going to have any criminal indictments or not, but, if I was any attorney, I would be saying, look, these people that are bringing this forward, they shouldn't be involved in this because they are biased.</p><p>We already know the people that were kicked off were biased. But you also have the fact that these two individuals that Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows are asking about were involved in the chain of custody of important evidence, the dossier, the dirt from the Clinton campaign, that is the basis for this entire hoax.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is important, because, for a long time, I have been asking the question, can the Robert Mueller special counsel report have credibility if it doesn't look at what we know to have been wrongdoing by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI?</p><p>So, Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows write to Bill Barr. And they say this. Number one, we'd like you to identify all actions taken by Weissmann and Ahmad, including disclosures to apprise the department or the special counsel's office of their role in the events Bruce Ohr testified to about supplying the FBI with information relating to the Trump campaign.</p><p>So, they also want to explain all the actions taken by Weissmann and Ahmad after learning that Steele, Simpson and Nellie Ohr were providing Bruce Ohr information for the purpose of relaying it to the FBI, provide all documents and communications referring or relating to disclosures made by Weissmann and Ahmad, and provide documents and communications related to the process the department used to evaluate prosecutors and investigators' independence.</p><p>So they're right now still working on the special counsel's investigation, Robert Mueller.</p><p>NUNES: Right. And they're not -- they're not independent investigators. These are people that were in on this from the beginning. They knew about the dossier. They were -- they brought this dossier forward.</p><p>I don't know if they told -- maybe they told Mueller, and Mueller decided to waive these requirements that are there. Also, let's not forget, we also have evidence that, at one time, that Weissmann was meeting with reporters.</p><p>And so you have this. And this is part of this whole disinformation campaign. I should have said this earlier. It's not just the media. It's not just that they were getting it from the Clinton campaign. You also had people within the Department of Justice and the FBI that were briefing reporters.</p><p>Now, what on earth are you doing briefing reporters? What was Weissmann doing talking to AP reporters, right? We have asked those questions and never got the answers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Well, it's a good point that you make. Jordan and Meadows want this information from the A.G. by March 15 at 5:00 p.m.</p><p>I want to take a short break, but we have got more to cover here.</p><p>Number one, do you think they are going to get this information by March 15? And, also, Mueller's report going to drop soon. Got to get your expectations.</p><p>Congressman Devin Nunes is with us this morning. He's staying with us.</p><p>Quick break, and then we will talk about the concerns about China technology giant Huawei as well and the red flags being raised by U.S. lawmakers on how Beijing may be infiltrating American universities to spread its propaganda.</p><p>Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures. Let me know what you would like to know from Devin Nunes on Instagram @SundayFutures.</p><p>Stay with us, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>And I am back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the ranking member on the House Intel Committee.</p><p>And, Congressman, you just said that you want to get these people a list of 32 people down, so that you can interview them.</p><p>What happens next? I mean, our audience wants to see accountability. What are you expecting in terms of accountability? How will Bill Barr response to this letter that Meadows and Jordan just sent him?</p><p>And do you think -- I mean, when you say criminal charges, what does that mean, criminal referrals?</p><p>NUNES: Let me start with this.</p><p>All of us want to see justice equal under the law, right? So we want to see everyone held accountable.</p><p>I believe that, if the new attorney general and the Department of Justice, if they don't take all of this on, and do a full scrub and have full accountability and transparency for the American people, you're going to see generations of conservatives who will not trust the Department of Justice, they will not trust the FBI, and they for sure will not trust the FISA process.</p><p>So I mentioned this in things that we have left to do earlier. And I don't want to gloss over it, because it's very important. The FISA laws were first written in the '70s. They need to be completely rewritten because of what the Clinton campaign and the former people at DOJ and FBI were able to do.</p><p>That's going to be a whole undertaking that Congress has to undertake. If that's not done -- so we need accountability by -- from the attorney general and the Department of Justice for all the people that were involved in this mess. And, at the same time, Congress is going to have to rewrite the laws that allow the intelligence agencies to go after American citizens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have brought all of this information forward. You have put it right there in front of Bill Barr.</p><p>Is he going to act on it, do you think? What are your indications...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NUNES: Well, we're going to -- yes, we will continue -- we will continue to work with the Justice Department. Barr just got in there, so let's give him some time here.</p><p>I think, once the new deputy attorney general gets in, and then we will slowly get to work, and start to work with them to try to bring accountability to everyone.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Last week, a federal judge in Florida ordered the release of the depositions given by former British spy Christopher Steele and an associate.</p><p>What are you expecting in terms of getting these depositions unsealed?</p><p>NUNES: So, this is great, because this is going to -- I think it's going to be on March 14 is going to be the day.</p><p>So, remember, Christopher Steele is the guy who was hired by the Democrats to go get information from the Russians. He wouldn't come and talk to us, right? He's already been criminally referred to the Justice Department. He was supposedly an asset for the FBI. We never got to interview him.</p><p>Luckily, someone sued him and a guy named, I think, David Kramer, who was also involved in the creation and -- creation and dissemination of the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NUNES: So, he pled the Fifth to us.</p><p>So between Christopher Steele and Kramer, we really want to know, what did they tell the court? So this is going to be fascinating information.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the Mueller report? Are you expecting it to drop soon? What's going on there?</p><p>NUNES: You know, you're going to interview Ken Starr a little later.</p><p>I don't understand. If Mueller doesn't have any crimes that he's -- that he's going to prosecute on, then I don't know what report we'd be looking for, because, as far as I can tell, the Mueller investigation was stood up for one reason, and one reason only, and that was based on the dossier.</p><p>And, remember, we have never seen the scope memo that started -- we have talked about it many times on your show.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NUNES: I hope people understand this.</p><p>There's a classified scope memo of what Mueller is supposed to be doing. It's been hidden from Congress. It's been hidden from the American people. My guess is, all it is, is the information from the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, real quick, Adam Schiff is looking for a crime. And he's doubling down on investigations.</p><p>Let's take a short break, and then I have got to ask you about your colleague Adam Schiff.</p><p>Then, Senator Rick Scott and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney are here.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the ranking member on the House Intel Committee.</p><p>Your colleague who is the chairman of the Intel Committee is Adam Schiff. He said a long time ago he had more than circumstantial evidence that there's collusion between the president. He's still out there looking for a crime, as you're trying to finish up your investigation to indicate wrongdoing that he continues to push back on.</p><p>NUNES: Yes, it's a lot like looking for, like, some mythical creature, right, this collusion creature?</p><p>So I often say -- I joke that it's like in search of Sasquatch, or Loch Ness Monster, or Chupacabra, which is like this mythical animal supposedly in the Southwest. They just don't exist.</p><p>And so he's just doing a lot of chasing the ghost around in the closet. He's made lots of promises, and now he's basically moving the goalposts to where they're no longer on collusion anymore. They're on to basically every single one of Donald Trump's business ventures that he was ever involved in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NUNES: So, it's gotten way out of control, in terms, this is no longer -- this has nothing to do with Russia anymore. This is just like going after Trump, which is not the job of the Intelligence Committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they want him out. I mean, let's face it.</p><p>I want to move on to China, because you have done an investigation for multi years at the Intel Committee.</p><p>And this week, I had the opportunity to speak with the chief security officer of Huawei Telecom. You have said for many years that China has been stealing our intellectual property for years.</p><p>Listen to this exchange I have got to get your reaction to, Andy Purdy from Huawei.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You just said there have been no major issues around Huawei.</p><p>But, in fact, over the last year, years, several years, I can cite a list of companies that have sued you and you have done settlements with, Motorola Solutions, T-Mobile, Cisco.</p><p>All of those companies sued Huawei for stealing trade secrets.</p><p>ANDY PURDY, HUAWEI CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER: There have been no major cybersecurity incidents in the world involving Huawei.</p><p>That industry and the fact that we have had some lawsuits in the past has characterized the industry for the last 20 years. We have resolved those issues, and we're moving forward. The remaining issues, we hope to resolve in the next year or so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Andy, it's not accurate to say that there were no issues around Huawei, when you had lawsuits for stealing trade secrets. Huawei settled a lawsuit with Motorola Solutions for stealing trade secrets.</p><p>You settled a lawsuit with Cisco for stealing router trade secrets. So are you saying that, yes, these issues and lawsuits went on in the past, and we settled them, and now we're not going to steal anymore? Is that what you're saying?</p><p>PURDY: I'm saying two things.</p><p>I'm saying that, but I'm also saying there have been no major cybersecurity incidents in the world in the 170 countries in which we do business. Our customers trust us around the world. And we believe there are additional mechanisms that can be done, so we can provide assurance and transparency, so that we can help make the -- America benefit from us being allowed to compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, I understand that you are on this P.R. trip today, and you have this whole-page ad in The Journal. And I agree that Huawei needs to convince the world that we can actually trust the products of the company.</p><p>But to say there have been no issues with Huawei is just 100 percent inaccurate. I just listed the number of companies that have sued you for stealing trade secrets and the settlements that you have done.</p><p>PURDY: Maria, I didn't disagree with the facts of those cases.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And there you go.</p><p>What do people need to understand about Huawei and China?</p><p>NUNES: Like all major companies in China, they're owned by the Chinese Communist Party. They're owned by the leadership.</p><p>Huawei especially is one of the largest. They are developing connections across the entire globe, the entire communications network around the globe, so that they can have -- they can suck up anyone's e-mails, phone calls, text messages.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>NUNES: That's what they're working on.</p><p>And any of the countries that allow Huawei to come in and put in the backbone of their architecture, they're absolutely crazy, because everything from their government is going to be headed straight to Chinese intelligence.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I have a report here by IPVM. And they call themselves the leading researcher on all video -- all things video cameras.</p><p>They report that Huawei Telecom components are currently in 60 percent of all video cameras across the world. That's -- I don't want to be an alarmist, but that tells me that China is not just listening to us. They're watching us.</p><p>NUNES: Well, and don't forget, the big tech companies are able to do that too.</p><p>And so -- but, as it relates to Huawei, the challenge is, this is not a private company, as much as it is a government-owned company from the Chinese communists.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>I want to ask you about the so-called Confucius centers, because you and I have spoken about this in the past. But there was a new Senate investigation. And they're warning that these Chinese state-run centers are at -- in more than 100 U.S. colleges.</p><p>You have got Confucius centers in and around Silicon Valley, like near Stanford. They're sharing research. What do you make of Confucius centers?</p><p>NUNES: Well, I would say first that Senate report that you referred to, great report done by Senator Portman and his team.</p><p>It's not just the 100 universities that they're involved in. It's what they do there, right? So they're bringing in what are likely either intelligence officers or people that are working with Chinese intelligence.</p><p>They're doing -- they're seeding people into companies. They're recruiting people. These are all things that are in this Senate Intelligence -- or the Senate report by Rob Portman that I would encourage all of your viewers to go and take a Sunday and read it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not only that, but China has an enormous amount of money. So they're buying up companies, like energy companies and banks, and getting American data that way too, another way to...</p><p>NUNES: And that's a whole 'nother -- yes. And they're doing that all over the globe, which that could be a whole show just on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, it's great to have you on the program.</p><p>NUNES: Thank you. Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Congressman Devin Nunes joining us.</p><p>We will take a break.</p><p>When we come back, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee member Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney is with us on Michael Cohen's testimony.</p><p>And then Republican Senator Rick Scott on the showdown over President Trump's emergency declaration.</p><p>A lot to come, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: ... lose a few Republicans in the Senate. All you need is 51 to get it out of the Senate. So it will pass the House with a handful of Republican votes. It'll come to the Senate. It might get 51.</p><p>It'll get vetoed by the president. And Republicans will stand with the president to sustain his veto, and it will be deader than dead.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, that was South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham last week with me right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" sharing his prediction on the fate of a Democratic House resolution intended to block President Trump's national emergency declaration to build a border wall.</p><p>The Senate will soon consider the measure after it passed the House last week. Some Republicans are signaling their support over concerns a future Democratic president could also choose to go the national emergency route to bypass Congress. That's why they're pushing back on this.</p><p>Joining me right now in an exclusive interview is Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott. He sits on the Senate Homeland and Governmental Affairs and Armed Services Committees.</p><p>And, Senator, it's good to have you this morning.</p><p>How are you going to vote in that measure?</p><p>SEN. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA: Well, I'm going to vote for border security. I'm going to vote with the president.</p><p>The -- everybody that's going to vote on this ought to go down to the border, like I did, talk to Border Patrol. And here's what they're going to tell you. One, they need more people. Two, they need new technology. The technology that they've got is decades-old.</p><p>And, three, they have got to have barriers, just so they operational control. So, if you go talk to them, there's no way you could then say, oh, I'm going to vote against border security.</p><p>The Democrats don't want border security. American public wants border security. They want results. I know a lot of people don't like the process. None of us like this process. It's all caused because the Democrats don't believe in border security. I want results. I know the president wants results.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, so what about your colleagues who say the reason that I have to push back and not vote with the president is because a Democratic president in the future might take advantage of the same thing?</p><p>This has been used, what, 60 times, go -- calling a national emergency.</p><p>SCOTT: Right.</p><p>Well, look, you know, a lot -- people can come up with a rationale for voting against things. I think the American public, they want results. The president tried. Look, he -- I mean, he's tried to get the Democrats to fund the border.</p><p>He offered things. He said, let's talk about DACA. Let's talk about fixing the TPS program. And they said no way. They did everything they could to make sure there was no border security. So the president is doing what he has to do to take care of the American public, which believes in having a secure border.</p><p>And I'm going to vote with the president. And I hope every Republican and I hope the Democrats will take the time, go to the border. Once they do, they are either -- they have one choice, either vote for border security or go tell border security that you don't care about their safety, and you're telling Americans you don't care about their safety.</p><p>It's a simple choice, in my opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, what about your colleagues on the Republican side that are going against the president? Why aren't your colleagues firmly behind this president, then?</p><p>SCOTT: I think -- I think people are -- you know, they want to say that, oh, this is not the right process.</p><p>And I agree.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCOTT: It's not the right process. I mean, nobody wants this to be the right -- the process we go through. Why are we here?</p><p>Because Washington is completely dysfunctional. That's it. Washington doesn't work. I have been there about two months. It doesn't work. But the Democrats will not fund what Americans want. Americans want border security. The president is doing his job. Secure the border.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When you say Washington doesn't work, is that because that too many people in the Congress have their own ideologies, and they're not doing what their constituents really want them to do?</p><p>SCOTT: I think there's a bunch of actors.</p><p>I think -- I mean, look at the Democrats. They will go give a talk about border security, and then will -- they will vote against it. There's just a lot of actors up there. We have got to get people that -- one, I believe in term limits. I think that should happen.</p><p>We have got to get new people up there that are just absolutely committed to getting something done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SCOTT: We shouldn't pay people if you shut down government, if you don't pass a budget. That's your job. There's some basic things that -- I'm a business guy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SCOTT: And so, in business, you try to get things accomplished.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this.</p><p>The bill is going to come to the Senate floor when? What's the timing on this? When do you expect to vote?</p><p>SCOTT: We don't -- we're not sure exactly when we're going to vote on it.</p><p>I think it's still another couple weeks at least that's going to come.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>SCOTT: It's got to come -- I think it's got to come to Armed Services first.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCOTT: So -- and then we have a 15-day -- so I think it's at least two more weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, the president just back from Hanoi with his meeting with Kim Jong-un. Your reaction to that?</p><p>The president talks a lot about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, so -- but we are yet to see any real movement in terms of denuclearization.</p><p>SCOTT: Well, first off, let's remember, he's a dictator. Kim Jong-un is a dictator. He's a thug. He's a murderer. That's what he is.</p><p>Now, I think the president is doing the right thing by trying to figure out how we make our country safer, by sitting down with him and saying, you need to denuclearize. And this is why your country, you and your citizens, will be in a better position.</p><p>Now, in business, you know that you have to walk away from deals a lot. That's the way it -- what happens. Often, before you get a deal, you have to walk away from it.</p><p>I think the president did the right thing. He walked away because he's not getting what he wanted out of the deal. And I'm proud of him for doing that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but what can we expect on this issue?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, what you hope for is that North Korea comes to their senses and says, look, I want to have freedom and democracy, I want to have our citizens with plenty of food, I want to have them -- great jobs.</p><p>That's what you would hope.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCOTT: But we have to remember, this guy is a tyrant. He's a thug. He murders his own citizens, his own family. So you have to -- you have to have low expectations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.</p><p>Senator, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>SCOTT: Nice seeing you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator Rick Scott joining us there.</p><p>Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney up next on her committee's questioning of Michael Cohen last week, as well as a number of issues.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So, they don't have anything with Russia. There's no collusion. So now they go and morph into, let's inspect every deal he's ever done.</p><p>We're going to go into his finances. We're going to check his deals. We're going to check -- these people are sick.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: They're sick.</p><p>I saw little shifty Schiff yesterday.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TRUMP: No, it's the first time. He went into a meeting. And he said, \"We're going to look into his finances.\"</p><p>I said, where did that come from? He always talked about Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was President Trump at CPAC slamming House Democrats.</p><p>This comes as they ramp up their investigation into the president's finances, following Michael Cohen's public testimony this past week on payments made to women before the election.</p><p>Joining me right now is Democratic Congresswoman from New York Carolyn Maloney. She sits on the House Oversight Committee. And she's wearing a jacket which was given to her from the Fire Department of New York.</p><p>Good to see you.</p><p>REP. CAROLYN MALONEY (D), NEW YORK: Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to get to the compensation fund for the 9/11 victims in a second, because I know that's why you were in the jacket. And good for you that you're wearing that jacket.</p><p>MALONEY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was there at the New York Stock Exchange. And it's a horrible day. And we will never forget. We know that.</p><p>But let me ask you first about Michael Cohen.</p><p>Congresswoman, some of those questions last week were so bizarre. Does President Trump have a love child? Does he beat his wife? I mean, all this stuff focusing on everything that the American people really do not want.</p><p>They would like to see these two sides work together. What's your reaction to Michael Cohen last week? And what are you trying to do?</p><p>MALONEY: Well, I thought that his testimony was alarming, because it did point to possible crimes and campaign finance violations, ethics violations, and possible tax and insurance crimes.</p><p>And he gave a list of people that he thought could lead to other possible crimes. And this really was the first hearing, oversight hearing, that the Democrats had on the White House and holding them accountable for alleged crimes in trying to influence and disrupt an election and other things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying.</p><p>Look, we know that there was no collusion so far. We have no evidence of that. We're waiting on the Robert Mueller report.</p><p>But isn't it true that you're supposed to follow and see if there was wrongdoing done, and then follow the crime? But here, it's like, you have got your guy and you want to find a crime. You want to look under every rock to try to hope to find a crime. You have got your guy, Donald Trump. He's the guy you want to find a crime.</p><p>That's the path you and your colleagues are moving toward, no?</p><p>MALONEY: I would say that our whole system of government was founded on checks and balances and holding everyone accountable and holding everyone to the law. And...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did Michael Cohen perjure himself again? Because a couple of times, he said things that some of your colleagues on the right are saying, look, that's a lie? Like, he said he didn't want a job in the White House. He said he's never been to Prague, by the way.</p><p>That was what the dossier said.</p><p>MALONEY: Well, I believe him, because he has no reason to lie. Right now, as you know, he's going to jail...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MALONEY: ... partially because he lied to Congress.</p><p>And I -- he would gain nothing by lying to Congress again, except increasing his term in jail.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, how do you justify bringing a guy down who has already lied to Congress once, and that's why he was indicted and going to jail, but this is your first witness?</p><p>I mean, given all of this wrongdoing and upset over the FISA abuse, and what happened in the 2016 election, is this really the first person you want to bring down to question?</p><p>MALONEY: Well, he was one of the closest confidants of the president for 10 years, both while he was president and while he was running for office and even before that. He gave valuable information about how the president operates.</p><p>He answered one of my questions about meetings, because the president always says, \"I knew nothing about this meeting.\"</p><p>He said nothing ever happened at Trump Tower or any time that the president -- that was an important meeting, that the president was briefed before the meeting, and the participants went back and told him what happened at the meeting.</p><p>Right now, we're trying to gather information. He also testified that he was cooperating with prosecutors in several other investigations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MALONEY: So there is a lot of investigations, including the important Mueller one, where the facts have to be looked at and studied to see if there was any obstruction of justice, if there was an attempt to influence the outcome of an American election with a foreign power.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, he said no collusion, right? I think Michael Cohen also said no...</p><p>MALONEY: That's what he said.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So far, we have heard from the House, the Senate, the DOJ and the FBI that there's no collusion. I mean, so...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALONEY: Well, he gave us a list of names.</p><p>And I know that the Democrats are sending out questions to roughly 60 other witnesses to gain information.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MALONEY: What we need to do -- and I think you did hit something, that it should be more bipartisan.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MALONEY: We should start agreeing on a set of facts that both sides agree on. And...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, exactly. And we should agree. Right. We should agree on at least the Constitution and process, things like that.</p><p>But there's a lot of division in your party.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MALONEY: But we have a responsibility. We have a responsibility to the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You absolutely do.</p><p>MALONEY: And on honesty in government, on oversight in government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what we all want, honesty.</p><p>MALONEY: And we want our democracy to be just as strong after we leave office as...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I'm with you on that. That's for sure.</p><p>MALONEY: And we...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: But there is a lot of division in your party right now.</p><p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez basically stopped Amazon from coming to your district, New York. What are you going to do to get Amazon back, and your reaction to all of that?</p><p>MALONEY: Well, to me, I find it tragic that they are not coming at this point.</p><p>And I have joined the governor and the mayor and many, many others, including the leaders of all the public housing projects, the leaders of our community, the people that I represent. They wanted Amazon to come. They wanted the jobs. They wanted the transit improvement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But AOC didn't want it. Is she the face of your party at this point?</p><p>She's talking about this Green Deal that's going to cost $94 trillion. What are you going to do about it, if you're a moderate Democrat and you're faced with these radical ideas all the way to the left?</p><p>MALONEY: Well, we can always disagree. We don't always agree on everything. So you fight for what you believe in.</p><p>I believe in a diversified economy, and I believe in more jobs for New York. And I think this statement that we're working to reach out to Amazon is an important statement to other businesses that we want to welcome jobs, that we want to work with them to help our country and help people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, first, you got to get the tax -- first, you got to get the tax structure better, and you have got to make sure you're not double- taxing, right? And you have got...</p><p>MALONEY: Absolutely. That's the biggest -- that is...</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, have you spoken to Cuomo about that?</p><p>MALONEY: Oh, absolutely. Everyone in New York is totally opposed to what we call SALT, removing the deduction of city and state taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right.</p><p>MALONEY: It is an arrow into our heart. We have to change that. I'm working on a report on how it impacts not only New York, but every other state.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We have got a hard break, so we have got to go.</p><p>MALONEY: That's a top priority of ours.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But this compensation fund is so important. Thank you so much for pushing for it. The victims need help.</p><p>MALONEY: Thank you for supporting the victims and survivors and first- responders of 9/11.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course.</p><p>MALONEY: They were there for us. We need to be there for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congresswoman, thank you.</p><p>MALONEY: And we need to pass and make permanent the Victims Compensation Fund.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congresswoman...</p><p>MALONEY: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ... Carolyn Maloney.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>MALONEY: Thank you. Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You too.</p><p>MALONEY: Great.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We are awaiting the final report from special counsel Robert Mueller into possible Russian collusion. The president says that it will be up to Attorney General Bill Barr to determine just how much from the report will be made public.</p><p>Joining me right now, in an exclusive interview, is former Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr, also a former U.S. solicitor general.</p><p>Great to see you, sir. Thanks very much for joining us this morning.</p><p>KENNETH STARR, FORMER SPECIAL PROSECUTOR: Oh, my pleasure, Maria. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: First, on the Mueller report, what are you expecting? What should we be looking at once that report does drop?</p><p>STARR: I think we should go back to what Bill Barr said in his confirmation hearings, Maria.</p><p>And that is, he's going to receive a confidential report. Now, the word confidential has to have meaning. That is what the regulations say, and that he, Bill Barr, will make the determination of what goes up to Congress.</p><p>So we're behind the veil of ignorance. We don't know. But I think we're already see seeing indications, especially from the Michael Cohen testimony, the way that entire episode unfolded, is, there may be less to the Mueller report as it's publicly available than meets the eye.</p><p>He may also just say, there's no -- first of all, he presumably will say no collusion, because thus far, as you well know, there's been no evidence of collusion with the Russians.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>Well, what about what we have been talking about all morning with Devin Nunes, Carolyn Maloney, the fact that there was wrongdoing, there have been criminal charges inferred or suggested by the inspector general for Andrew McCabe?</p><p>Will we see accountability? What does that mean, criminal charges refers?</p><p>STARR: Right. It's a process that simply has to unfold.</p><p>And I know it's frustrating on this side of the process, until those decisions have been made. But one of the things that we saw this week was just a remarkable set of questions -- and now that's what the conversation is about -- for Michael Cohen.</p><p>And one of the things that's not being -- you asked Congresswoman Maloney a bit about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>STARR: Which is credibility.</p><p>The first thing you ask about a witness is, is the witness credible? And there are serious issues of credibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we're going to talk more about this.</p><p>STARR: The next thing you ask is...</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have got an extensive segment with you coming up for FOX Insider. We will talk about Michael Cohen. So I will see you then.</p><p>Good to see you. Ken Starr, thank you.</p><p>Thanks for joining us, everybody.</p><p>FOX Business Network tomorrow morning, join me on \"Mornings With Maria.\"</p><p>Have a great

Do you support Scott Pruitt?</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I hope he's going to be  great.  </p><p> WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel whether the president will fire his  EPA chief over ethics violations.  </p><p> And our \"Power Player of the Week,\" a member of the Obama cabinet goes back  to school.  </p><p> SYLVIA BURWELL, FORMER HHS SECRETARY:  There were two themes in the Mathews  Council (ph).  One was education and the other was public service.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right now on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE:  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.  </p><p> We begin with breaking news.  The State Department is monitoring reports of  a poison gas attack in a rebel-held town near Syria's capital of Damascus.   Video from Syrian activists claims to show victims, including children,  getting hosed down.  A human's rights group says dozens have been killed in  the attack.  And we'll stay on top of this story.  </p><p> Now to the face-off for trade between the U.S. and China, which has sent  tension soaring and market stumbling.  In the latest move, President Trump  threatened to impose tariffs on another $100 billion in Chinese exports,  something that nation has vowed to fight.  A trade war without serious  consequences for consumers and businesses and investors.  </p><p> Joining me now, President Trump's new top White House economic adviser,  Larry Kudlow.  </p><p> Larry, welcome to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p> LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER:  Thank you, Chris.   Thanks a lot.</p><p> WALLACE:  You keep saying that there is no trade war, that this is part of  negotiations between the U.S. and China.  But the Chinese history says  there are any talks and says, quote, China is fully prepared to hit back  forcefully and without hesitation.  </p><p> And here was Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Friday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We will continue to have discussions.   But there is the potential of a trade war.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Now, you're a market guy.  The markets dropped 572 points on  Friday.  Clearly, there are a lot of serious investors who think there's a  real chance of a trade war.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  I suppose so.  I mean, I know there are some jitters out there.  I  don't think there's any trade or insight.  Just technically, we have taken  no actions, you understand that.  And even the Thursday announcement for  President Trump, he asked Ambassador Lighthizer to consider additional  actions.  </p><p> It's a long process.  Several months here.  We put our papers, we take  public comments.  We then review the public comments and then decisions  will be made.  </p><p> So far, no tariffs and no action has been enacted.  Point number two.  I  believe China's response to the U.S. actions, which is a complaint against  stealing intellectual property against forced technology transfers, I think  that's a legitimate complaint, so does the rest of the world.</p><p> But China's response was highly unsatisfactory and I think that's  unfortunate.  We do have constant communication with them, to be sure.  I  hope their side picks up on this.  But so far, stonewalling us is not the  answer.  </p><p> Listen -- </p><p> WALLACE:  And that's what they're doing is stonewalling?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Basically.  I mean, lots of rhetoric out there, like, you know,  old communist party type stuff.  The whole world, please, the whole world  knows China has been violating trade laws for many years and President  Trump is the guy calling them on it and he's right to do so.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Is the president -- you say he's calling them on it.  Is he  bluffing or will he impose tariffs if China doesn't change its trade  practice?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Look, I -- he's not bluffing.  I mean, there are a number of tools  at his disposal.  </p><p> Just one thing there -- people are saying Trump, Trump, Trump.  This is a  problem caused by China, not a problem caused by President Trump, and I  would go so far as to say, Trump is there to fix the problem.  </p><p> If you talk to the president as I have, he regards himself as a free  trader, all right?  As do I.  But his argument, and it's a good one, you  can't have free trade, which is pro-growth around the world unless China  brings down its barriers, opens up its markets --  </p><p> WALLACE:  But, Larry --  </p><p> KUDLOW:  -- and stop this technology steal that they're doing.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Nobody is saying that China isn't to blame here.  The question  is, the president's response.  As you point out, you are a tree trader.  </p><p> Here is what you said just last month when President Trump announced his  first round of tariffs.  And this wasn't an announcement.  This was real  imposition of tariffs on aluminum and steel.  Here you are.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KUDLOW:  Tariff hikes are prosperity killers.  They always have been and  they always will be.  Tariffs are taxes and the ones who suffer most are  the users.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  So who should we believe, that Larry Kudlow or this one?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  I thought you might run that.  I'm opposed to blanket tariffs and  that's where it first started.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But that's what the president is talking about?</p><p> KUDLOW:  No, he has changed his view, even on the national security action.   We've got a lot of exceptions and a lot of carve-outs.</p><p> WALLACE:  But you're not talking about carve-outs or exceptions for China.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Well, hang on.  So, I oppose the blanket tariffs, I always do.  </p><p> Now, with respect to China, I've always been a hard-liner on China, and  while I don't like tariffs, sometimes there is no substitution for putting  tariffs into the discussion, into the process.  That is part of the quiver  of arrows that the president has.  </p><p> Look, he's a great negotiator.  He has a whole history of that.  But in  this process, tariffs have to be part of it.  There's no two ways about it.   Then, hopefully, there will be discussions and hopefully, in just the next  two months, the Chinese will come seriously back to the table.  </p><p> President Trump has told me, we were together a long time on Thursday and  Friday.  He likes President Xi.  They get along.  He respects President Xi  as a negotiator, but they have not played by the rules, Chris.  This has  been going on.  </p><p> Technology is everything to this country, everything -- our  entrepreneurship, our innovation, our future growth, our productivity.  We  cut corporate tax rates precisely to unlock the animal spirits around  technology.  </p><p> We cannot let China willy-nilly steal our technology.  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK.  You said on Friday that you were going to announce a trade  coalition of the willing today, other countries that were going to join us  in taking on China.  Who are they?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Well, I don't (ph) -- I didn't make this announcement.  I'm just  observing.  </p><p> WALLACE:  No, no, you set on Friday, between 24 and 48 hours I'm going to  announce the trade coalition of the willing.  Do you have them?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  They are coming to us.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Who are they?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Japan, Europe, Australia, Canada.  They have come to us.  The  president actually -- </p><p> WALLACE:  They are not talking about tariffs.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Sure they are.  </p><p> WALLACE:  No, they're not.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Sure they are.</p><p> WALLACE:  Japan said that they were going to join us in taking this issue  to the world trade organization and to object to Chinese trade practices  just as free traders have done for years.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  But if China maintains its third world status, as they have in the  WTO, then other countries are free to take whatever actions they want.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But -- if I just depress this, has any other country joined us in  threatening tariffs if China doesn't clean up its act?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  I can't answer that.  I don't even want to answer that.  </p><p> All I'm saying is my trade coalition of the willing will put the whole  world behind the United States' actions against China, and this is going to  have a big effect on China.  China does not want to lose face, but China  does not want to be regarded as the enemy in trade for the entire world.  </p><p> The WTO, by the way, is one of the processes.  Ambassador Lighthizer has  that in his releases.  So, we'll work there.  We'll work directly with the  Chinese.  </p><p> But I want to make this clear: President Trump is a great negotiator.  The  tariffs, which none of us particularly want, may -- I say may -- have to be  part of this discussion and argument.  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK, I want to pick up on that because ever since I first met we  go back a ways.  And ever since I first met you in the Reagan White House,  you have been an apostle of growth.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Yes.</p><p> WALLACE:  You say that growth cures income inequality.  Growth cures budget  deficits.  But if China and if -- let me just finish, if China and the U.S.  slapped tariffs on each other, even President Trump said that could hurt  the economy.  Here he is.  </p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So, we may take a hit, and,  you know what, ultimately, we're going to be much stronger for it.  But  it's something we had to do.  </p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  And here's a line from an article: Trump should also examine the  historical record on tariffs because they have almost never worked as  intended and almost always delivered an unhappy ending.  </p><p> Larry, I assume you agree with that because you wrote it.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  I do.  I wrote it.  I agree with it.  It's still my position.  The  president knows that.  We had lots of conversations.  </p><p> But around this action, I'm going to stay with us -- the path to free-trade  has to include China acting in concert with first world nations, with  (INAUDIBLE) nations.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Even if we end up in trade were?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  We're not going to end up in a trade war.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, they aren't backing off.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Look, we haven't even enacted anything yet.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I understand.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  So, let's go easy on the trade war.  We got several months here.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But you say the president isn't bluffing.  You say tariffs have  to be part of the discussion.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  I do.</p><p> WALLACE:  So, if they don't back off -- </p><p> KUDLOW:  We will see.  We will see.  </p><p> Remember this: the U.S. economy is doing very well now.  By the way, at the  time, you learned your lesson as well when we first spoke back in 1980.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I listened.</p><p> KUDLOW:  You've been very good on that, I'm proud of you.  </p><p> Now, having said all that, we are growing at over 3 percent annual rate for  the last three quarters.  This is investment spending, equipment spending  is booming.  Jobs are rising.  Consumer confidence is high.  Small business  confidence is high.  </p><p> All I'm saying is forget trade wars.  Why don't you just look at the  progress of the American economy?  </p><p> WALLACE:  I --  </p><p> KUDLOW:  We can take --  </p><p> WALLACE:  That's the concern though that people have is this is going to  put a brake on that --   </p><p> KUDLOW:  It cant -- it can't possibly.  It can't possibly.  The sums here  are too small.  But the principals are very strong.  Do you see what I'm  saying?  </p><p> WALLACE:  I understand that but as you well know trade war sometime  escalate.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Well, I haven't seen a trade war since Smoot Hawley, of 1930s.   And even I was -- </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  I have to ask you to other questions and we've got  three other minutes to get them in.  </p><p> One of the drags on the market right now is the concern that Washington is  going to regulate big tech.  Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Facebook, is  going to testify before Congress this week.  </p><p> Does the president want to see Washington regulate how Facebook uses its  users' data, what it does with its users' data and also how it screens ads?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Look, I think the president right now will be intently watching  the congressional hearings.  I think that's going to be step number one.  I  think he has his doubts whether Facebook has violated protocols, I don't  know.  We will see.  </p><p> I wish Mr. Zuckerberg -- I hope he comes to Congress wearing a nice  business suit and shirt and tie, so he will be taking more seriously.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Not a t-shirt?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Right, I'm tired of that t-shirt, hoody stuff.  He does run one of  the largest corporations of the world, for heaven's sakes.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  But we (INAUDIBLE) agree to regulate -- </p><p> KUDLOW:  We are waiting on Congress.  Let's see what comes out of that  before the administration takes any particular action.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Amazon -- the president keeps hitting the company for  failing to pay taxes, for its deal with the Post Office.  </p><p> Here he was on Air Force One.  </p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Well, Amazon is just not on an even playing field.  You know, they  have a tremendous lobbying effort in addition to having \"The Washington  Post,\" which is, as far as I'm concerned, another lobbyist.  </p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  In fact, the Post Office makes money off Amazon.  It doesn't lose  money.  And Amazon collects taxes in all 45 states.  </p><p> So, is this just talk or is the president seriously considering taking  action against Amazon?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  The president is asking that Amazon and all the Internet retailers  have a level playing field with respect to tax.  And while it's true -- </p><p> WALLACE:  But Amazon is one of the companies that does have a level playing  field.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  In recent years, they've done much better in collecting state  taxes, sales taxes.  However, they don't always connect local sales taxes,  and we've had too much protection in this area.  They are not a fledgling  industry anymore.  </p><p> So, what the president is saying is raising this issue for discussion.  I  don't think it's aimed at anybody.  We just need a level playing field and  you're going to have a court decision very soon, Chris, that's going to  make this more explicit.  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK, I've got a minute left.  There is talk this morning that the  president may ask Congress to undo part of the $1.3 trillion spending bill  to cut back some of the expenditures that were made.  Is that true and how  far along are you on that?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  It's playing in the White House.  My friend, OMB Director Mick  Mulvaney, he and I are on -- I'm an ex-OMB guy.  I feel his pain.  </p><p> We are looking at an enhanced rescission package.  I'm not going to use  numbers.  This is all around town.  </p><p> I think the Republican Party on the Hill has finally figured out.  It's  really not a bad idea to trim some spending because, after all, spending  can lead to deficits and spending interferes with the economy.  And  President Trump is a deregulator and a tax cutter.  So, we want and much  more modest government role.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Larry, thank you.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p> WALLACE:  Thanks for your time.  Always good to talk with you, and I keep  listening and learning.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  You've been great.  You've been absolutely one of the best people  down through the years.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> WALLACE:  That's where I blew all of my credibility.  Thank you, Larry.   Always a pleasure.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  That was a joke and a compliment.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Thank you.</p><p> Up next, reaction from one of the top Democrats in the House, Congressman  Joe Crowley on his party's message for the 2018 midterms and talk he might  replace Nancy Pelosi as the next speaker of the House.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  A look at the cherry blossoms along the tidal basin here in D.C.,  which have peak bloom this week and were just beautiful.  </p><p> Washington always has its eye on the next election and as we get closer to  the 2018 midterms, many are predicting a blue wave with Democrats taking  back the House and possibly the Senate.  </p><p> Joining us now, New York Congressman Joe Crowley, chair of the House  Democratic Caucus and the subject of growing chatter among Democrats as a  possible replacement for Nancy Pelosi after the election.  He's not going  to like me saying that.  </p><p> Congressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. </p><p> REP. JOE CROWLEY (D-NY), HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIRMAN:  Thanks, Chris.   Good to be with you.  </p><p> WALLACE:  You just heard Larry Kudlow.  What do you think of his arguments  for potentially, potentially using tariffs against China?  And if not that,  how do you propose we stop their unfair trading practice?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Well, Chris, I'm also a member of the Ways and Means Committee  and so I do recognize there's a role for tariffs in the economy.  But I  think what really it has created is a great deal more chaos.  People really  don't know what the president's plans are or what Mr. Kudlow's plan is as  it relates to China, and the trade war that has now begun, or at least the  initial start of that has begun.  </p><p> I think that's left a lot of Americans with uncertainty about what this -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  What should they do?  If you are not going to use tariffs, how do  you stop behind the unfair trade practices, the theft of intellectual  property?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Well, first of all, let me just say for the record that when it  came to the issue of China, I did not vote for normal trade with China.  I  believe they were not economically nor politically mature enough to be  dealing with us on the same par.  And having said, I think that's panned  out to be true.  </p><p> But I do think we have to do this in a much more calculated way, and I --  with more of a plan.  Let's have an understanding of what the ultimate goal  is here.  Is the goal to raise the price of products here in the United  States or to lower the price of agricultural products in the United States?   That is the overall goal, because that's what some of the effect may very  well be if China retaliates in this war.  Where is ultimately going?   That's what we don't understand about this.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Donald Trump won the presidency because he convinced a lot of  voters, including a lot of Democratic voters in the industrial heartland  that he had a better idea for how to build the economy, how to get them  jobs than Hillary Clinton did.  Now, Democrats are going into the 2018  midterms with what they call a better deal.  </p><p> Here is Nancy Pelosi on that.  </p><p> (BEGN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Democrats are offering a  better deal, better jobs, better wages, a better future.  A better deal is  founded on strong values that we share.  Strong values fueled by fresh  ideas.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Forgive me, Congressman, but that sounds like standard Democratic  boilerplate.  So, give me one fresh idea that Democrats are offering voters  for November.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Fresh idea?  First of all, Chris, Donald Trump did not win by a  lot of Democratic votes in the Midwest.  It was fractions of a vote that  actually are responsible for him being president of the United States  today.  </p><p> But what I think one great fresh idea is a real infrastructure package for  the American people.  What the president has offered a 20-80 plan, 20  percent from the federal, 80 percent from local governments is not going to  wash.  It's not going to work.  What Democrats are proposing is really an  80-20 or 75-25 plan where the federal government comes up with the  resources for 80 percent and works with local governments to put America  back to work and invest in American infrastructure and invest in America.  </p><p> That's jobs.  That's a bridge to the new economy.  That's giving people the  opportunity to put their kids through college, to afford health care with a  real job.  That's the kind of message the Democrats are talking about.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But let's look at the Trump record on the economy, which  obviously you agree is going to be the key issue in November.  </p><p> Employers are adding an average of 202,000 jobs a month this year.  The  unemployment rate has been 4.1 percent for six straight months.  That's the  lowest level in 17 years.  And wages are up 2.7 percent, the highest rate  of almost nine years.  </p><p> Congressman, a solid majority of Americans, according to the polls, feel  good about the Trump economy.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Show me how any of those statistics the difference of any month  that President Obama was president of United States -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Well, I just said that the 4.1 percent is the lowest level in 17  years.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  It's moving on a downward trend.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But it wasn't 4.1 percent.   Wage growth wasn't up.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Where was it when President Bush left office?  </p><p> WALLACE:  President Bush or President Obama?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  President Bush, when he left office, and President Obama came  from --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, I understand, the world is in recession.</p><p> CROWLEY:  Right.  And so, we -- Democrats really moved us towards this job  growth through the sustained economy.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Are you saying the president deserves no -- </p><p> CROWLEY:  I didn't say that.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I'm asking.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  What I'm suggesting is that I believe what this is based on is a  false premise.  The notion of the tax cut is going to lead to somehow help  the American people along (ph) I think is a scam.  I think what they've  done is the desperate need to pass anything by the end of the year.  They  rammed through a bill without fully really understanding what was in the  bill.  </p><p> It was done in a very, very highly partisan way, and I think in the end,  it's the average worker, the middle class, in this going to suffer because  the result of the tax cut bill.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's turn to another subject, immigration.  The president has  ordered the deployment of up to 4,000 members of the National Guard to the  southern border and the fact is more people are attempting to cross the  border illegally.  Just take a look at these statistics.  </p><p> In March of 2017, 16,000 people were caught at the border.  That number  tripled last month, March of 2018, to more than 50,000.  </p><p> Don't we need to stop the surge?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  I think what we need is comprehensive immigration reform.  We've  been talking about this for decades and we just haven't seen it happen, not  since 1986.  What I think is interesting to go back to 1986 where you saw a  comprehensive immigration reform and comprehensive tax reform done in a  bipartisan way.  It was long-lasting because it was done both -- Democrats  and Republicans came together.  </p><p> Here we have a very partisan approach to this.  The president talks about  building a wall, but Mexico is going to pay for it.  Now, he's putting  troops down at the border, a very provocative move.  But at the same time,  it's not really solving the problem.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  You say it's a very provocative move.   Barack  Obama put 1,800 at the border.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  It was to some degree provocative, not in the same breath that  this president has done.  What the verbiage, the language that our  president has used towards immigrants in this nation is really -- it's  abhorrent to me, quite frankly.  It's not representative of who we are as a  nation.  </p><p> So, this president, making this move is different from any other president  doing it quite frankly.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's turn to the midterms.  President Trump says that your party  is vulnerable in November.  Here he is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats haven't learned --  they still think the loyal citizens who care about jobs and borders and  security are deplorable.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  How confident are you the Democrats will win in November and take  back control of the House?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  We're a long way from November.  Let's be clear about that.  </p><p> But I'm confident that the American people want to bring balance back to  the United States government.  What they see right now is Republicans in  charge of the presidency, the Senate, the House and some would argue the  Supreme Court.  </p><p> Every branch of government seems to be controlled in some way or facet (ph)  by Republicans.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Forgive me.  That was what voters decided.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Well, look, they have an opportunity here to change course and  correction, that's the beauty of our democracy.  The House of  Representatives, every member of the House of Representatives is up for  election this year and a third of the Senate.  So, people have the  opportunity to bring that balance back.  </p><p> We know that the first midterm election of an incumbent president on  average sees 40 seats swing in the opposite direction.  It's not going to  happen on its own.  Democrats are not going to win that back just simply be  up against President Trump.  We need to be for, as I mentioned before, our  economic policies, our better deal and is a deal are become very clear to  the American people.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  In more than a third of House races, Republicans  running for those seats have run ads that go after Nancy Pelosi.  Here's an  example from the recent special election in Pennsylvania '18.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AD ANNOUNCER:  Conor Lamb is a Pelosi liberal.  His values aren't our  values.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Now, that Democrat, Conor Lamb, won, but one of the ways in which  he won was that he promised not to support Nancy Pelosi if Democrats take  the House and she's up for speaker again.  </p><p> Is Nancy Pelosi a liability for Democrats in this campaign?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  I think it was more reflective of the fact that Republicans are  bankrupt on the ideas.  They don't have anything else to offer except to go  after Nancy Pelosi to win elections.  That's -- if they think, that's a  winning strategy, they're completely mistaken and wrong.  It's not a  winning strategy.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I mean, forgive me, but Conor Lamb apparently thought it was an  issue because he dumped Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Conor Lamb won because he ran a local election.  He talked about  that the cuts that the Republicans were attempting to make and to privatize  Social Security.  He talked about what affect local -- what affect the  federal government has on local politics, on people's lives.  And that's  why he won that election, not because of Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p> WALLACE:  If Democrats win the House in November, will you run either to  replace Nancy Pelosi if she steps down or against her if she doesn't?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Well, on the first portion of that, I would wait and see just  what happened in terms of Nancy Pelosi deciding not to run.  But if Nancy  Pelosi stays, I don't -- I don't see a scenario by which I would challenge  her for that position.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Do you want to be speaker?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Look, I'm focused right now on winning back the House of  Representatives, to be in the majority, to be the chair of the Democratic  Caucus in the majority.  I'm doing that job right now.  I want to be the  best chair of the Democratic Caucus I possibly can be, help my colleagues  get reelected and help when back seats for the House Democratic Caucus.  </p><p> That's my focus and goal.  That's the focus and goal of the entire  Democratic leadership.  We are one mind, Chris, and that is we want to win  back the house.  That's goal one and the only goal right now.  </p><p> WALLACE:  One last question in this.  On top Democrat was quoted as saying  that at age 56, which you are now, that you are a spring chicken by  congressional standards.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Well, I've had others say that I'm not such a spring chicken  after all.  Look, at the end of the day, we have a very vibrant Democratic  Caucus.  We have some incredibly talented young people.  </p><p> I think people running today like Mikie Sherrill.  She was a Navy grad.   She is running for office in New Jersey.  </p><p> I think of Joe Neguse who's running in Colorado.  I think of Brendan Kelly.   Some great people are running all around this country and we are becoming  more vibrant as a Democratic Caucus. </p><p> So, I think we have nothing to look forward to but good days ahead of us.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Congressman Crowley, thank you.  Thanks for coming in today.   Please come back, sir.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  I'm happy to come back.  Thank you.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the  escalating tariff threats between the U.S. and China.  </p><p> Plus, we'll discuss the president's Pruitt problem and growing ethical  concerns about the EPA chief.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Coming up, President Trump sends the National Guard to the  border.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We have very bad laws for our border.  We're going to be doing  things militarily until we can have a wall and proper security.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel what the deployment means, next on FOX  NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But I think we're going to  have a fantastic relationship long-term with China, but we have to get this  straightened out. We have to have some balance. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: President Trump taking a hard line on China,  saying it's time to stop Beijing from taking advantage of the U.S. on  trade.</p><p> And it's time now for our Sunday group. </p><p> GOP strategist Karl Rove. Columnist for \"The Hill,\" Juan Williams. Former  Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards. And the head of Heritage Action for  America, Michael Needham. </p><p> Well, Karl, there's no question that we have a problem with Chinese trade  practices, but is it the best solution to threaten them with tariffs? </p><p> KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think so. We have two problems  with them. The biggest problem is, they're stealing our intellectual  property. And in all this kerfuffle over tariffs, we've missed the fact  that on March 23rd the administration filed what it should have done, which  is an action with the WTO challenging from top to bottom the Chinese on  their intellectual property rights. That's where we can win and win big for  the American companies, the American consumer and for the concept of free  trade. </p><p> But tariffs, really problematic. The president said we're going to levy $60  billion in tariffs on the Chinese. Peter Navarro, his trade expert, came  out and said, and the Chinese are not going to retaliate. The Chinese said,  we're going to respond with $50 billion of tariffs. The president says,  this is unfair, I'm going to come with $100 billion worth of tariffs. $160  billion worth of tariffs would be paid by American taxpayers. This year the  value of the tax cut, as estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, is  $135 billion to American taxpayers. Next year, $280 billion. Economic  growth is happening because of pro-growth -- in part because of the pro- growth policies of the tax code. What happens if you take that away by  tariffs? </p><p> He's attacking a problem we don't need to really be worried about. We by  $500 billion from them. They buy $130 billion from us. Let's focus on  selling more to them and we're not going to get there by putting tariffs on  Chinese products. </p><p> WALLACE: Michael, are you as negative about the idea of tariffs and what  impact could it conceivably have on economic growth, which at this point  may be the best argument Republicans have going for them going into the  midterms? </p><p> MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Yes, look, large, broad  tariffs aren't the right way to go. Nobody wants a trade war. I agree with  what Larry Kudlow said, I don't think we're going to have a trade war. </p><p> At the same time, I think the strongest fact the president has going for  him is he's always been looking about for American interests, he's always  been looking out for American security. And for 20 years liberal elites  have promised us that if we just integrate China into the global trade  network, they will start acting like a responsible stakeholder in the  international community. They haven't. And it's been a lie. </p><p> And the president is right to take seriously the threat of China, their  irresponsibility on intellectual property, their requirements that American  companies when they come into China give up their intellectual property and  the vast irresponsibility of the Chinese government around the world,  integrating them into a trade framework had not worked. We need to be  tough. We just need to be smart about how we're being tough. We need to be  targeted. And I think some of what the president has laid out has not been  targeted and smart. </p><p> WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, look, I understand the concern about  tariffs. On the other hand, as Michael points out, China has continued with  unfair trade practices, stealing or threatening, pressuring to get our  intellectual property. I have to say, I asked Congressman Crowley that and  didn't get much of an answer. Do you have a specific idea of how we get  them to clean up their act? </p><p> DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, first of all, I  don't think tariffs are a trade policy. And one of the things that's  missing here I think in the Pacific region is a trade policy. We had an  opportunity, I think, under the Obama administration of a TPP that was  fairly negotiated. I mean I didn't support that because I thought that it  was missing in terms of protections for American workers, which would have  had a direct impact on our relationship -- our trade relationship with  China. And I think that what is happening now is this sort of ad hoc  imposition of tariffs that's really throwing the markets around. </p><p> Now, do I care about that for wealthy people? No, but I do care about that  for American workers and for retirements and for -- for farmers. And so --</p><p> WALLACE: So what should we do? </p><p> EDWARDS: You know, and so I think that, you know, what we should do is we  should actually have a trade policy for the region that allows us, with our  neighbors and our allies, to stack up against China. And right now we don't  have that. </p><p> WALLACE: If you go to the WTO and, as Michael has pointed out, it hasn't  worked. There was a ruling I just read this weekend that the WTO made about  certain Chinese trade practices. They have spent six years, and they still  are mulling how to comply. </p><p> EDWARDS: Well, I'm not really sure the WTO is necessarily the framework. It  may be -- it's one avenue. But the real framework is our European allies,  which are facing exactly the same problem with China, but we've done  nothing to coordinate a strategy with -- with Europe and with the Pacific  region in terms of dealing with China, particularly on intellectual  property. </p><p> WALLACE: All right, I want to switch to another big story this week, and  that is immigration and President Trump's decision to send up to 4,000  members of the National Guard to the southern border to guard that border.  He talked at one point about a caravan of about 1,000 people coming up  through Mexico to the United States. Here he is. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yesterday it came out where  this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody's ever seen  before. They don't want to mention that. So we have to change our laws. And  the Democrats, what they're doing is just -- it's insanity. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Juan, now under questioning, the white House ended up having to  cite reports of incidents of rate with another caravan back in 2014. But  what about the larger issue and what about the president's decision to send  border -- rather, National Guard to the border? </p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, this is political theater  for a man who promised to build a wall that would be paid for by Mexico.  That hasn't happened and you've had some people in his base say, hey, what  happened to your pledge to build a wall? </p><p> The reality is, the border crossings are -- I think it's a 45 plus year  low. </p><p> WALLACE: Well, no, no, no, we --</p><p> WILLIAMS: No, we saw the tick up that you illustrated earlier in the show  in the month of March. That's not representative of the long term here. And  the long term is in fact that in terms of border crossings from Mexico,  they too are at net zero migration. This is the reality. But what you have  is most illegals in this country have overstayed visas. They haven't run  through any wall or snuck under a wall or jumped over a wall. </p><p> WALLACE: Well, there's no wall.</p><p> WILLIAMS: There's a -- well, that are -- there are walls in places that we  think. I mean it's not as if we haven't done anything about border  security. But the caravan, the caravan's been coming up as an Easter ritual  for the last five plus years, Chris. And I think what you have here is an  attempt to trigger fear and hysteria over, oh, there's a horde coming at  the southern border and they're coming and they're going to invade America. </p><p> But I think it's all about this president trying to say to his base, hey, I  am putting a wall up, or if I'm not putting a wall up, I'm going to put  soldiers there. Soldiers who, by the way, have no authority to detain  anyone, arrest anyone, no bullets in their guns. I mean it's -- it's a  joke. </p><p> WALLACE: I -- I -- I can see both Michael and Karl with -- ready to come  out of their seats. </p><p> Karl, I'll --</p><p> ROVE: I want to briefly agree with one -- the only thing that Juan said  that was correct, which is the caravan has been going on for a long while  and the Mexicans were fully capable of taking care of them. But the rest of  what Juan said, bologna. </p><p> Look, we -- we have a problem on the border. If you look at -- if you look  at the crossings compared to a year ago, they have doubled. And we are  facing a surge. And the president was right to say to the states -- it was  on an impulse, but that doesn't make it a bad impulse, that the states need  help. </p><p> You noticed -- did you see with the first National Guard unit was from  Texas to be sent to the border immediately after the president's order, an  aviation unit because, what was the first unit to go from Arizona? A  construction unit. There are things along the border that the National  Guard can do in a moment like this when additional resources are needed  that is justified and ample. And I trust the secretary of Homeland Security  to arrive at it and so do the governors of most of the border states. </p><p> We have Jerry Brown wringing his hands in Sacramento as to what he ought to  do, but otherwise this is a useful thing. President Obama did it. President  Bush did it in a similar moment. It's not because of the caravan, but it's  because of a more secular trend that's troubling. The number of illegal  border crossings has doubled this year verses last year.</p><p> WALLACE: All right. I know we're not going to settle this. You can argue  during the commercial. </p><p> WILLIAMS: It's a deal.</p><p> WALLACE: All right, we have to take a break here. </p><p> When we come back, the Trump administration imposes new sanctions on  Russian oligarchs and businesses to punish the Kremlin for alleged meddling  in the 2016 election. </p><p> Plus, the fate of Scott Pruitt. What would you like to ask the panel about  whether the president should stand by or fire his EPA chief? Just go to  FaceBook or Twitter, at Fox News Sunday, and we may use your question on  the air. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Is draining the swamp renting an apartment from the  wife of a Washington lobbyist? </p><p> SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: I don't think that that's even remotely  fair to ask that question. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt pushing back on ethics  allegations against him, including renting a room in a Capitol Hill condo  for $50 a night. </p><p> And we're back now with the panel.</p><p> Well, Michael, you're one of 10 leading conservatives who sent a letter to  President Trump yesterday urging him to keep Pruitt at EPA. And Saturday  night the president tweeted this, rent for this condo was about market  rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job. </p><p> Are you not troubled by the growing list of ethical concerns about Scott  Pruitt? </p><p> NEEDHAM: Yes, look, Scott Pruitt is taking on one of the sacred cows of the  extreme progressive left, which is that in the debate between job growth  and job creation and environmentalism there is no room for any belief in  terms of anything other than always siding with environmentalists. And  anyone who takes that side should be attacked in a mean-spirited manner.  And that's what's going on towards EPA administrator Pruitt right now. </p><p> In that environment, all of us who take on the left for some these things  should be squeaking clean because you give them fuel to create issues. And  I think Scott Pruitt should not have done many of the things that he's  done, which has allowed the left to sidetrack the discussion from policy  and take it towards the personnel -- the personal and the ad hominem. </p><p> If you compare what Scott Pruitt is going through, to what Obama --  President Obama's EPA administrators went through, Gina McCarthy deleted  5,000 tweets because she wanted to get around FOIA requirements. Gina  McCarthy spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on foreign travel.  Lisa Jackson, the administrator before Gina McCarthy, had a fake e-mail  account to get around FOIA requests. She spent $155,000 on a single trip to  China. And so there's a gigantic double standard. The reason the double  standard exists is because of the policies that Scott Pruitt is pursuing,  and he should be lauded for the -- for his noble efforts on those policies. </p><p> WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of Scott  Pruitt's behavior we got this tweet from 6152Tom. Is there any truth to it  that he is a target, as he is getting the most done? Has made some bad  expense decisions but his value-added seems to be the best of any cabinet  person. </p><p> Juan, how do you answer Tom? </p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, I think there's a real situation here in terms of have --  President Trump having promised to drain the swamp and then you have Scott  Pruitt -- and let's just put aside the policy arguments because I think for  Michael -- </p><p> NEEDHAM: Shouldn't that be what matters, policy --</p><p> WILLIAMS: No, not at the moment. </p><p> NEEDHAM: You don't think policy matters?</p><p> WILLIAMS: Let's just -- let's separated it for a second, Michael, because I  think conservative activists and conservative donors and people in  businesses that are affected by environmental regulations just say, well,  he's doing what we want, so let's leave it alone. But can you imagine if  this was any other president and you had a cabinet secretary who was  engaged in this kind of behavior, can't even answer a question from Ed  Henry of Fox News. I don't think he's a -- Fox News is not some liberal  organization out here trying to undercut a conservative. No. </p><p> But what you have is someone who has taken advantage of not only what is a  sweetheart deal, pennies for dollars in terms of that condo, but the condo  being rented from a lobbyist whose clients have business in front of the  EPA. That, on the face of it, Michael, is disqualifying. So we can talk  about policy and we can have arguments about --</p><p> WALLACE: All right.</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> NEEDHAM: I am -- I am going to look forward to going back and finding Juan  Williams speaking out about Gina McCarthy deleting 5,000 text messages to  get around FOIA. I am sure Juan was outraged at the $150,000 -- </p><p> WILLIAMS: No, I don't think that's good behavior. But I'm just telling you,  I'm just -- it's shocking to me that you will make excuses for what is  inexcusable. </p><p> NEEDHAM: But you said they were disqualifying. Was Lisa Jackson's $155,000  trip to China disqualifying?</p><p> WILLIAMS: That's -- look, she spent, by the way, on security, much less.  Scott Pruitt spent three times as much. He has alarms and red flashing  things and added -- asking for more people just to get through D.C.  traffic. </p><p> WALLACE: All right.</p><p> WILLIAMS: It's ridiculous. </p><p> WALLACE: I --</p><p> WILLIAMS: For a drain the swamp administration? </p><p> WALLACE: OK. </p><p> I want to -- we were going to talk about Russia. We may still get to it. </p><p> But I want to focus now on the breaking story today, and that is this --  what appears to be a poison gas attack on a rebel-held suburb outside of  Damascus. There are reports that dozens of people may have been killed and  even more were hit by this. </p><p> The president has begun to tweet on this subject today and I hope we'll put  up one tweet. Many dead including women and children in mindless chemical  attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian  army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin,  Russia and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad. Big price.</p><p> It's interesting, Karl. There has not been outside confirmation that this  was a poison attack, but it's interesting, one, the president is saying it,  and, two, not only condemning it, but also in maybe the strongest terms  I've never heard him, condemning President Putin's support for Assad. </p><p> ROVE: Yes. The president -- the president is not obligated to act. So  confirm if this was a poison gas attack, which it looks like it was. The  estimates now are at least 70 dead, maybe as many as 150, a number of them  children, all of them civilians. But now the United States will have to act  as the president acted in the aftermath of the sarin gas attack in early  2017. Otherwise, our credibility in the region is going to be greatly  diminished. </p><p> WALLACE: Yes, let me just pick up on that with you because in one of his  earlier tweets he said the reason that this has fallen apart is because  President Obama did not enforce the redline when he was president on --  when it came to gas attacks by Assad. He -- and when the president did  launch that attack, those -- I think it was 59 missiles -- back in the  spring of 2017, he said, if it happens again, I'll strike again. How much  is he on the line now (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p> ROVE: Well, he's on the line. And, look, I think there's some -- I think  there is some -- you know, there's some reason why he said -- some evidence  that he was correct when he said President Obama should have acted. It's  unseemly for the president, however, to be reflecting on that, in my  opinion. </p><p> He ought to -- he ought to act. It was one of the most important moments in  the definition of his foreign policy last year that when this attack did  occur he reacted in 25 percent of the air capacity of the Syrian air force  disappeared in a matter of moments. He has to exact another price in order  to send a second signal that just because a year has passed, doesn't mean  you can engage in this behavior again.</p><p> WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to what appears -- and we  need to say it's not confirmed yet -- what appears to be an attack, and, if  so, what action President Trump is going to need to take? </p><p> EDWARDS: Well, the president is the president today. And I think that the  American people and the Congress actually have to engage in a discussion  about Syria that is a moral discussion when it comes to the use, if this is  true, of poison gas. I mean this is a human rights crisis and the president  has an obligation to act. </p><p> That said, over this last year and a half, our policy has actually allowed  Assad, with Russia's help, to consolidate his power. And that leaves open  the door to do these kinds -- to engage in these kind of atrocities because  we think we've rolled back the Islamic States. In fact, what we've done is  we've actually created an environment where it goes underground, it's not  consolidating land, but continues to engage in terrorist behavior and  activity. </p><p> WALLACE: Would you agree that President Obama is much more responsible for  the disaster and the humanitarian slaughter in Syria than President Trump  is? </p><p> EDWARDS: Well, let me just say, I -- at the time when I was in Congress, I  called on the president and supported the idea -- </p><p> WALLACE: President Obama. </p><p> EDWARDS: President Obama, and support of the idea that we should actually  be on the side of the Syrian people who were facing exactly the same kinds  of atrocities. And it's come to this point. </p><p> But the fact is that today in April 2018, President Trump is the president  and it's his obligation to act and not just reflect on what a bad job he  thinks that President Obama did. </p><p> WALLACE: We have less than a minute left. </p><p> Michael.</p><p> NEEDHAM: Yes, look, I think that -- that President Trump should act, as  Karl said. I think that President Trump needs to see things through in  Syria. And I think that we should give President Trump credit for having a  very muscular and strong American policy towards Syria. And, more  importantly, towards Russia, which is backing Syria in terms of getting  anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, the action he took earlier this year in  Syria, pushing forward to put small, tactical nuclear weapons into our  arsenal. And so I think President Trump has had a very strong foreign  policy and he needs to make sure that he continues that, following through  with Syria. </p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, John Bolton comes on board tomorrow and we'll see what  happens. But I think Trump has been trying to pull troops out of Syria  without Pentagon approval. </p><p> WALLACE: Thanks, panel. See you next Sunday. </p><p> Up next our \"Power Player of the Week.\" How the president of a major  university here in Washington works the campus like a big city mayor. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: Hang around Washington long enough and you see plenty of turnover.  Cabinet secretaries come and go and administrations, and -- and, as we've  seen recently, when presidents change their mind. So what happens to those  former big shots? Here is our \"Power Player of the week.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SYLVIA BURWELL, PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITY: I think the role is a  little more like a mayor than a CEO.</p><p> Hi. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): Sylvia Matthews Burwell is president of American  University here in Washington. And she works the campus like a mayor. </p><p> BURWELL: Very nice to meet you both. Thank you both. </p><p> Right now we're passing the library. </p><p> WALLACE: Here was a video in her new job when the school year started last  summer. </p><p> BURWELL: Great to see some students on campus. </p><p> Oh, wait a minute, there's Claude (ph), the AU legend, out for a morning  run. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): So I understand you insist everyone calls you Sylvia. </p><p> BURWELL: That's right. </p><p> WALLACE: Why? </p><p> BURWELL: Because I think it's part of being a part of the university and  having people feel like they can engage. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): If Burwell looks familiar, she was a member of  President Obama's cabinet. First his budget director, then secretary of  Health and Human Services, trying to fix Obamacare after the disastrous  rollout, and then dealing with the Ebola crisis. </p><p> BURWELL: So having very large critical issues made it a pretty challenging  time. </p><p> WALLACE: But running a university with 13,000 students and a tradition of  public service is also challenging. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): How much does it cost, tuition, room and board, to go  to AU for a year? </p><p> BURWELL: About $60,000. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): Burwell says she's trying to cut cost and find new  ways to help students who can't afford it. </p><p> Then, there were several racist incidents last fall, including confederate  flag posters on bulletin boards. Burwell held a town hall. </p><p> BURWELL: We want to make sure that you know we're taking our steps. We need  your help and support too. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't feel safe here. I don't feel happy here. I  don't feel nicer. I feel worse.</p><p> WALLACE (on camera): Was that a tough meeting for you? </p><p> BURWELL: You know, it -- it was a tough meeting most of all because of the  pain that the incidents cause. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): One reform, every student must now take a course that  includes diversity training. </p><p> BURWELL: It is about learning to listen from others differing points of  view and differing experiences. </p><p> WALLACE: Burwell grew up in Hinton, West Virginia. Her grandparents, Greek  immigrants. </p><p> BURWELL: There were two themes in the Matthews household. One was education  and the other was public service. </p><p> WALLACE: She followed both paths, going to Harvard and becoming a Rhodes  Scholar. Then interspersing government work with 11 years helping run the  Gates and Walmart Foundations. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): How does it feel to see so much of the Obama legacy,  including Obamacare, being rolled back by President Trump? </p><p> BURWELL: There will be people who don't receive treatment and actually die  because they can't afford the care, the preventative care, or the care  along the way. And so this has real-world consequences for individuals in  their lives. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): But Burwell embraces her new role as college  president, including one game as guest coach of the women's basketball  team. </p><p> BURWELL: I'm undefeated. It was terrific. It was wonderful. I loved it. </p><p> WALLACE: It's all part of seeing AU as a town, and she's the mayor. </p><p> BURWELL: Meeting these students who have so much energy, excitement and  passion, and that is an incredible gift every day. </p><p> But I hope I'll see you around campus.</p><p> Bye.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE: Burwell had no experience in academia as either a professor or  school administrator, but she's taken to being a university president like  a natural. </p><p> And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The State Department is monitoring reports of a poison gas attack in a rebel-held town near Syria's capital of Damascus. Video from Syrian activists claims to show victims, including children, getting hosed down. A human's rights group says dozens have been killed in the attack. And we'll stay on top of this story.</p><p>Now to the face-off for trade between the U.S. and China, which has sent tension soaring and market stumbling. In the latest move, President Trump threatened to impose tariffs on another $100 billion in Chinese exports, something that nation has vowed to fight. A trade war without serious consequences for consumers and businesses and investors.</p><p>Joining me now, President Trump's new top White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow.</p><p>Larry, welcome to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER: Thank you, Chris. Thanks a lot.</p><p>WALLACE: You keep saying that there is no trade war, that this is part of negotiations between the U.S. and China. But the Chinese history says there are any talks and says, quote, China is fully prepared to hit back forcefully and without hesitation.</p><p>And here was Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: We will continue to have discussions. But there is the potential of a trade war.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Now, you're a market guy. The markets dropped 572 points on Friday. Clearly, there are a lot of serious investors who think there's a real chance of a trade war.</p><p>KUDLOW: I suppose so. I mean, I know there are some jitters out there. I don't think there's any trade or insight. Just technically, we have taken no actions, you understand that. And even the Thursday announcement for President Trump, he asked Ambassador Lighthizer to consider additional actions.</p><p>It's a long process. Several months here. We put our papers, we take public comments. We then review the public comments and then decisions will be made.</p><p>So far, no tariffs and no action has been enacted. Point number two. I believe China's response to the U.S. actions, which is a complaint against stealing intellectual property against forced technology transfers, I think that's a legitimate complaint, so does the rest of the world.</p><p>But China's response was highly unsatisfactory and I think that's unfortunate. We do have constant communication with them, to be sure. I hope their side picks up on this. But so far, stonewalling us is not the answer.</p><p>Listen --</p><p>WALLACE: And that's what they're doing is stonewalling?</p><p>KUDLOW: Basically. I mean, lots of rhetoric out there, like, you know, old communist party type stuff. The whole world, please, the whole world knows China has been violating trade laws for many years and President Trump is the guy calling them on it and he's right to do so.</p><p>WALLACE: Is the president -- you say he's calling them on it. Is he bluffing or will he impose tariffs if China doesn't change its trade practice?</p><p>KUDLOW: Look, I -- he's not bluffing. I mean, there are a number of tools at his disposal.</p><p>Just one thing there -- people are saying Trump, Trump, Trump. This is a problem caused by China, not a problem caused by President Trump, and I would go so far as to say, Trump is there to fix the problem.</p><p>If you talk to the president as I have, he regards himself as a free trader, all right? As do I. But his argument, and it's a good one, you can't have free trade, which is pro-growth around the world unless China brings down its barriers, opens up its markets --</p><p>WALLACE: But, Larry --</p><p>KUDLOW: -- and stop this technology steal that they're doing.</p><p>WALLACE: Nobody is saying that China isn't to blame here. The question is, the president's response. As you point out, you are a tree trader.</p><p>Here is what you said just last month when President Trump announced his first round of tariffs. And this wasn't an announcement. This was real imposition of tariffs on aluminum and steel. Here you are.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KUDLOW: Tariff hikes are prosperity killers. They always have been and they always will be. Tariffs are taxes and the ones who suffer most are the users.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: So who should we believe, that Larry Kudlow or this one?</p><p>KUDLOW: I thought you might run that. I'm opposed to blanket tariffs and that's where it first started.</p><p>WALLACE: But that's what the president is talking about?</p><p>KUDLOW: No, he has changed his view, even on the national security action. We've got a lot of exceptions and a lot of carve-outs.</p><p>WALLACE: But you're not talking about carve-outs or exceptions for China.</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, hang on. So, I oppose the blanket tariffs, I always do.</p><p>Now, with respect to China, I've always been a hard-liner on China, and while I don't like tariffs, sometimes there is no substitution for putting tariffs into the discussion, into the process. That is part of the quiver of arrows that the president has.</p><p>Look, he's a great negotiator. He has a whole history of that. But in this process, tariffs have to be part of it. There's no two ways about it. Then, hopefully, there will be discussions and hopefully, in just the next two months, the Chinese will come seriously back to the table.</p><p>President Trump has told me, we were together a long time on Thursday and Friday. He likes President Xi. They get along. He respects President Xi as a negotiator, but they have not played by the rules, Chris. This has been going on.</p><p>Technology is everything to this country, everything -- our entrepreneurship, our innovation, our future growth, our productivity. We cut corporate tax rates precisely to unlock the animal spirits around technology.</p><p>We cannot let China willy-nilly steal our technology.</p><p>WALLACE: OK. You said on Friday that you were going to announce a trade coalition of the willing today, other countries that were going to join us in taking on China. Who are they?</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, I don't (ph) -- I didn't make this announcement. I'm just observing.</p><p>WALLACE: No, no, you set on Friday, between 24 and 48 hours I'm going to announce the trade coalition of the willing. Do you have them?</p><p>KUDLOW: They are coming to us.</p><p>WALLACE: Who are they?</p><p>KUDLOW: Japan, Europe, Australia, Canada. They have come to us. The president actually --</p><p>WALLACE: They are not talking about tariffs.</p><p>KUDLOW: Sure they are.</p><p>WALLACE: No, they're not.</p><p>KUDLOW: Sure they are.</p><p>WALLACE: Japan said that they were going to join us in taking this issue to the world trade organization and to object to Chinese trade practices just as free traders have done for years.</p><p>KUDLOW: But if China maintains its third world status, as they have in the WTO, then other countries are free to take whatever actions they want.</p><p>WALLACE: But -- if I just depress this, has any other country joined us in threatening tariffs if China doesn't clean up its act?</p><p>KUDLOW: I can't answer that. I don't even want to answer that.</p><p>All I'm saying is my trade coalition of the willing will put the whole world behind the United States' actions against China, and this is going to have a big effect on China. China does not want to lose face, but China does not want to be regarded as the enemy in trade for the entire world.</p><p>The WTO, by the way, is one of the processes. Ambassador Lighthizer has that in his releases. So, we'll work there. We'll work directly with the Chinese.</p><p>But I want to make this clear: President Trump is a great negotiator. The tariffs, which none of us particularly want, may -- I say may -- have to be part of this discussion and argument.</p><p>WALLACE: OK, I want to pick up on that because ever since I first met we go back a ways. And ever since I first met you in the Reagan White House, you have been an apostle of growth.</p><p>KUDLOW: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: You say that growth cures income inequality. Growth cures budget deficits. But if China and if -- let me just finish, if China and the U.S. slapped tariffs on each other, even President Trump said that could hurt the economy. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So, we may take a hit, and, you know what, ultimately, we're going to be much stronger for it. But it's something we had to do.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: And here's a line from an article: Trump should also examine the historical record on tariffs because they have almost never worked as intended and almost always delivered an unhappy ending.</p><p>Larry, I assume you agree with that because you wrote it.</p><p>KUDLOW: I do. I wrote it. I agree with it. It's still my position. The president knows that. We had lots of conversations.</p><p>But around this action, I'm going to stay with us -- the path to free-trade has to include China acting in concert with first world nations, with (INAUDIBLE) nations.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: Even if we end up in trade were?</p><p>KUDLOW: We're not going to end up in a trade war.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, they aren't backing off.</p><p>KUDLOW: Look, we haven't even enacted anything yet.</p><p>WALLACE: I understand.</p><p>KUDLOW: So, let's go easy on the trade war. We got several months here.</p><p>WALLACE: But you say the president isn't bluffing. You say tariffs have to be part of the discussion.</p><p>KUDLOW: I do.</p><p>WALLACE: So, if they don't back off --</p><p>KUDLOW: We will see. We will see.</p><p>Remember this: the U.S. economy is doing very well now. By the way, at the time, you learned your lesson as well when we first spoke back in 1980.</p><p>WALLACE: I listened.</p><p>KUDLOW: You've been very good on that, I'm proud of you.</p><p>Now, having said all that, we are growing at over 3 percent annual rate for the last three quarters. This is investment spending, equipment spending is booming. Jobs are rising. Consumer confidence is high. Small business confidence is high.</p><p>All I'm saying is forget trade wars. Why don't you just look at the progress of the American economy?</p><p>WALLACE: I --</p><p>KUDLOW: We can take --</p><p>WALLACE: That's the concern though that people have is this is going to put a brake on that --</p><p>KUDLOW: It cant -- it can't possibly. It can't possibly. The sums here are too small. But the principals are very strong. Do you see what I'm saying?</p><p>WALLACE: I understand that but as you well know trade war sometime escalate.</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, I haven't seen a trade war since Smoot Hawley, of 1930s. And even I was --</p><p>WALLACE: All right. I have to ask you to other questions and we've got three other minutes to get them in.</p><p>One of the drags on the market right now is the concern that Washington is going to regulate big tech. Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Facebook, is going to testify before Congress this week.</p><p>Does the president want to see Washington regulate how Facebook uses its users' data, what it does with its users' data and also how it screens ads?</p><p>KUDLOW: Look, I think the president right now will be intently watching the congressional hearings. I think that's going to be step number one. I think he has his doubts whether Facebook has violated protocols, I don't know. We will see.</p><p>I wish Mr. Zuckerberg -- I hope he comes to Congress wearing a nice business suit and shirt and tie, so he will be taking more seriously.</p><p>WALLACE: Not a t-shirt?</p><p>KUDLOW: Right, I'm tired of that t-shirt, hoody stuff. He does run one of the largest corporations of the world, for heaven's sakes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: But we (INAUDIBLE) agree to regulate --</p><p>KUDLOW: We are waiting on Congress. Let's see what comes out of that before the administration takes any particular action.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. Amazon -- the president keeps hitting the company for failing to pay taxes, for its deal with the Post Office.</p><p>Here he was on Air Force One.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Well, Amazon is just not on an even playing field. You know, they have a tremendous lobbying effort in addition to having \"The Washington Post,\" which is, as far as I'm concerned, another lobbyist.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: In fact, the Post Office makes money off Amazon. It doesn't lose money. And Amazon collects taxes in all 45 states.</p><p>So, is this just talk or is the president seriously considering taking action against Amazon?</p><p>KUDLOW: The president is asking that Amazon and all the Internet retailers have a level playing field with respect to tax. And while it's true --</p><p>WALLACE: But Amazon is one of the companies that does have a level playing field.</p><p>KUDLOW: In recent years, they've done much better in collecting state taxes, sales taxes. However, they don't always connect local sales taxes, and we've had too much protection in this area. They are not a fledgling industry anymore.</p><p>So, what the president is saying is raising this issue for discussion. I don't think it's aimed at anybody. We just need a level playing field and you're going to have a court decision very soon, Chris, that's going to make this more explicit.</p><p>WALLACE: OK, I've got a minute left. There is talk this morning that the president may ask Congress to undo part of the $1.3 trillion spending bill to cut back some of the expenditures that were made. Is that true and how far along are you on that?</p><p>KUDLOW: It's playing in the White House. My friend, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, he and I are on -- I'm an ex-OMB guy. I feel his pain.</p><p>We are looking at an enhanced rescission package. I'm not going to use numbers. This is all around town.</p><p>I think the Republican Party on the Hill has finally figured out. It's really not a bad idea to trim some spending because, after all, spending can lead to deficits and spending interferes with the economy. And President Trump is a deregulator and a tax cutter. So, we want and much more modest government role.</p><p>WALLACE: Larry, thank you.</p><p>KUDLOW: Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE: Thanks for your time. Always good to talk with you, and I keep listening and learning.</p><p>KUDLOW: You've been great. You've been absolutely one of the best people down through the years.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE: That's where I blew all of my credibility. Thank you, Larry. Always a pleasure.</p><p>KUDLOW: That was a joke and a compliment.</p><p>WALLACE: Thank you.</p><p>Up next, reaction from one of the top Democrats in the House, Congressman Joe Crowley on his party's message for the 2018 midterms and talk he might replace Nancy Pelosi as the next speaker of the House.</p><p>WALLACE: A look at the cherry blossoms along the tidal basin here in D.C., which have peak bloom this week and were just beautiful.</p><p>Washington always has its eye on the next election and as we get closer to the 2018 midterms, many are predicting a blue wave with Democrats taking back the House and possibly the Senate.</p><p>Joining us now, New York Congressman Joe Crowley, chair of the House Democratic Caucus and the subject of growing chatter among Democrats as a possible replacement for Nancy Pelosi after the election. He's not going to like me saying that.</p><p>Congressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>REP. JOE CROWLEY (D-NY), HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIRMAN: Thanks, Chris. Good to be with you.</p><p>WALLACE: You just heard Larry Kudlow. What do you think of his arguments for potentially, potentially using tariffs against China? And if not that, how do you propose we stop their unfair trading practice?</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, Chris, I'm also a member of the Ways and Means Committee and so I do recognize there's a role for tariffs in the economy. But I think what really it has created is a great deal more chaos. People really don't know what the president's plans are or what Mr. Kudlow's plan is as it relates to China, and the trade war that has now begun, or at least the initial start of that has begun.</p><p>I think that's left a lot of Americans with uncertainty about what this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: What should they do? If you are not going to use tariffs, how do you stop behind the unfair trade practices, the theft of intellectual property?</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, first of all, let me just say for the record that when it came to the issue of China, I did not vote for normal trade with China. I believe they were not economically nor politically mature enough to be dealing with us on the same par. And having said, I think that's panned out to be true.</p><p>But I do think we have to do this in a much more calculated way, and I -- with more of a plan. Let's have an understanding of what the ultimate goal is here. Is the goal to raise the price of products here in the United States or to lower the price of agricultural products in the United States? That is the overall goal, because that's what some of the effect may very well be if China retaliates in this war. Where is ultimately going? That's what we don't understand about this.</p><p>WALLACE: Donald Trump won the presidency because he convinced a lot of voters, including a lot of Democratic voters in the industrial heartland that he had a better idea for how to build the economy, how to get them jobs than Hillary Clinton did. Now, Democrats are going into the 2018 midterms with what they call a better deal.</p><p>Here is Nancy Pelosi on that.</p><p>(BEGN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Democrats are offering a better deal, better jobs, better wages, a better future. A better deal is founded on strong values that we share. Strong values fueled by fresh ideas.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Forgive me, Congressman, but that sounds like standard Democratic boilerplate. So, give me one fresh idea that Democrats are offering voters for November.</p><p>CROWLEY: Fresh idea? First of all, Chris, Donald Trump did not win by a lot of Democratic votes in the Midwest. It was fractions of a vote that actually are responsible for him being president of the United States today.</p><p>But what I think one great fresh idea is a real infrastructure package for the American people. What the president has offered a 20-80 plan, 20 percent from the federal, 80 percent from local governments is not going to wash. It's not going to work. What Democrats are proposing is really an 80-20 or 75-25 plan where the federal government comes up with the resources for 80 percent and works with local governments to put America back to work and invest in American infrastructure and invest in America.</p><p>That's jobs. That's a bridge to the new economy. That's giving people the opportunity to put their kids through college, to afford health care with a real job. That's the kind of message the Democrats are talking about.</p><p>WALLACE: But let's look at the Trump record on the economy, which obviously you agree is going to be the key issue in November.</p><p>Employers are adding an average of 202,000 jobs a month this year. The unemployment rate has been 4.1 percent for six straight months. That's the lowest level in 17 years. And wages are up 2.7 percent, the highest rate of almost nine years.</p><p>Congressman, a solid majority of Americans, according to the polls, feel good about the Trump economy.</p><p>CROWLEY: Show me how any of those statistics the difference of any month that President Obama was president of United States --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: Well, I just said that the 4.1 percent is the lowest level in 17 years.</p><p>CROWLEY: It's moving on a downward trend.</p><p>WALLACE: But it wasn't 4.1 percent. Wage growth wasn't up.</p><p>CROWLEY: Where was it when President Bush left office?</p><p>WALLACE: President Bush or President Obama?</p><p>CROWLEY: President Bush, when he left office, and President Obama came from --</p><p>WALLACE: Well, I understand, the world is in recession.</p><p>CROWLEY: Right. And so, we -- Democrats really moved us towards this job growth through the sustained economy.</p><p>WALLACE: Are you saying the president deserves no --</p><p>CROWLEY: I didn't say that.</p><p>WALLACE: I'm asking.</p><p>CROWLEY: What I'm suggesting is that I believe what this is based on is a false premise. The notion of the tax cut is going to lead to somehow help the American people along (ph) I think is a scam. I think what they've done is the desperate need to pass anything by the end of the year. They rammed through a bill without fully really understanding what was in the bill.</p><p>It was done in a very, very highly partisan way, and I think in the end, it's the average worker, the middle class, in this going to suffer because the result of the tax cut bill.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's turn to another subject, immigration. The president has ordered the deployment of up to 4,000 members of the National Guard to the southern border and the fact is more people are attempting to cross the border illegally. Just take a look at these statistics.</p><p>In March of 2017, 16,000 people were caught at the border. That number tripled last month, March of 2018, to more than 50,000.</p><p>Don't we need to stop the surge?</p><p>CROWLEY: I think what we need is comprehensive immigration reform. We've been talking about this for decades and we just haven't seen it happen, not since 1986. What I think is interesting to go back to 1986 where you saw a comprehensive immigration reform and comprehensive tax reform done in a bipartisan way. It was long-lasting because it was done both -- Democrats and Republicans came together.</p><p>Here we have a very partisan approach to this. The president talks about building a wall, but Mexico is going to pay for it. Now, he's putting troops down at the border, a very provocative move. But at the same time, it's not really solving the problem.</p><p>WALLACE: Wait a minute. You say it's a very provocative move. Barack Obama put 1,800 at the border.</p><p>CROWLEY: It was to some degree provocative, not in the same breath that this president has done. What the verbiage, the language that our president has used towards immigrants in this nation is really -- it's abhorrent to me, quite frankly. It's not representative of who we are as a nation.</p><p>So, this president, making this move is different from any other president doing it quite frankly.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's turn to the midterms. President Trump says that your party is vulnerable in November. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Democrats haven't learned -- they still think the loyal citizens who care about jobs and borders and security are deplorable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: How confident are you the Democrats will win in November and take back control of the House?</p><p>CROWLEY: We're a long way from November. Let's be clear about that.</p><p>But I'm confident that the American people want to bring balance back to the United States government. What they see right now is Republicans in charge of the presidency, the Senate, the House and some would argue the Supreme Court.</p><p>Every branch of government seems to be controlled in some way or facet (ph) by Republicans.</p><p>WALLACE: Forgive me. That was what voters decided.</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, look, they have an opportunity here to change course and correction, that's the beauty of our democracy. The House of Representatives, every member of the House of Representatives is up for election this year and a third of the Senate. So, people have the opportunity to bring that balance back.</p><p>We know that the first midterm election of an incumbent president on average sees 40 seats swing in the opposite direction. It's not going to happen on its own. Democrats are not going to win that back just simply be up against President Trump. We need to be for, as I mentioned before, our economic policies, our better deal and is a deal are become very clear to the American people.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. In more than a third of House races, Republicans running for those seats have run ads that go after Nancy Pelosi. Here's an example from the recent special election in Pennsylvania '18.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AD ANNOUNCER: Conor Lamb is a Pelosi liberal. His values aren't our values.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Now, that Democrat, Conor Lamb, won, but one of the ways in which he won was that he promised not to support Nancy Pelosi if Democrats take the House and she's up for speaker again.</p><p>Is Nancy Pelosi a liability for Democrats in this campaign?</p><p>CROWLEY: I think it was more reflective of the fact that Republicans are bankrupt on the ideas. They don't have anything else to offer except to go after Nancy Pelosi to win elections. That's -- if they think, that's a winning strategy, they're completely mistaken and wrong. It's not a winning strategy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: I mean, forgive me, but Conor Lamb apparently thought it was an issue because he dumped Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>CROWLEY: Conor Lamb won because he ran a local election. He talked about that the cuts that the Republicans were attempting to make and to privatize Social Security. He talked about what affect local -- what affect the federal government has on local politics, on people's lives. And that's why he won that election, not because of Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>WALLACE: If Democrats win the House in November, will you run either to replace Nancy Pelosi if she steps down or against her if she doesn't?</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, on the first portion of that, I would wait and see just what happened in terms of Nancy Pelosi deciding not to run. But if Nancy Pelosi stays, I don't -- I don't see a scenario by which I would challenge her for that position.</p><p>WALLACE: Do you want to be speaker?</p><p>CROWLEY: Look, I'm focused right now on winning back the House of Representatives, to be in the majority, to be the chair of the Democratic Caucus in the majority. I'm doing that job right now. I want to be the best chair of the Democratic Caucus I possibly can be, help my colleagues get reelected and help when back seats for the House Democratic Caucus.</p><p>That's my focus and goal. That's the focus and goal of the entire Democratic leadership. We are one mind, Chris, and that is we want to win back the house. That's goal one and the only goal right now.</p><p>WALLACE: One last question in this. On top Democrat was quoted as saying that at age 56, which you are now, that you are a spring chicken by congressional standards.</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, I've had others say that I'm not such a spring chicken after all. Look, at the end of the day, we have a very vibrant Democratic Caucus. We have some incredibly talented young people.</p><p>I think people running today like Mikie Sherrill. She was a Navy grad. She is running for office in New Jersey.</p><p>I think of Joe Neguse who's running in Colorado. I think of Brendan Kelly. Some great people are running all around this country and we are becoming more vibrant as a Democratic Caucus.</p><p>So, I think we have nothing to look forward to but good days ahead of us.</p><p>WALLACE: Congressman Crowley, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. Please come back, sir.</p><p>CROWLEY: I'm happy to come back. Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the escalating tariff threats between the U.S. and China.</p><p>Plus, we'll discuss the president's Pruitt problem and growing ethical concerns about the EPA chief.</p><p>WALLACE: Coming up, President Trump sends the National Guard to the border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have very bad laws for our border. We're going to be doing things militarily until we can have a wall and proper security.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel what the deployment means, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship long-term with China, but we have to get this straightened out. We have to have some balance.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: President Trump taking a hard line on China, saying it's time to stop Beijing from taking advantage of the U.S. on trade.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group.</p><p>GOP strategist Karl Rove. Columnist for \"The Hill,\" Juan Williams. Former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards. And the head of Heritage Action for America, Michael Needham.</p><p>Well, Karl, there's no question that we have a problem with Chinese trade practices, but is it the best solution to threaten them with tariffs?</p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think so. We have two problems with them. The biggest problem is, they're stealing our intellectual property. And in all this kerfuffle over tariffs, we've missed the fact that on March 23rd the administration filed what it should have done, which is an action with the WTO challenging from top to bottom the Chinese on their intellectual property rights. That's where we can win and win big for the American companies, the American consumer and for the concept of free trade.</p><p>But tariffs, really problematic. The president said we're going to levy $60 billion in tariffs on the Chinese. Peter Navarro, his trade expert, came out and said, and the Chinese are not going to retaliate. The Chinese said, we're going to respond with $50 billion of tariffs. The president says, this is unfair, I'm going to come with $100 billion worth of tariffs. $160 billion worth of tariffs would be paid by American taxpayers. This year the value of the tax cut, as estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, is $135 billion to American taxpayers. Next year, $280 billion. Economic growth is happening because of pro-growth -- in part because of the pro- growth policies of the tax code. What happens if you take that away by tariffs?</p><p>He's attacking a problem we don't need to really be worried about. We by $500 billion from them. They buy $130 billion from us. Let's focus on selling more to them and we're not going to get there by putting tariffs on Chinese products.</p><p>WALLACE: Michael, are you as negative about the idea of tariffs and what impact could it conceivably have on economic growth, which at this point may be the best argument Republicans have going for them going into the midterms?</p><p>MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Yes, look, large, broad tariffs aren't the right way to go. Nobody wants a trade war. I agree with what Larry Kudlow said, I don't think we're going to have a trade war.</p><p>At the same time, I think the strongest fact the president has going for him is he's always been looking about for American interests, he's always been looking out for American security. And for 20 years liberal elites have promised us that if we just integrate China into the global trade network, they will start acting like a responsible stakeholder in the international community. They haven't. And it's been a lie.</p><p>And the president is right to take seriously the threat of China, their irresponsibility on intellectual property, their requirements that American companies when they come into China give up their intellectual property and the vast irresponsibility of the Chinese government around the world, integrating them into a trade framework had not worked. We need to be tough. We just need to be smart about how we're being tough. We need to be targeted. And I think some of what the president has laid out has not been targeted and smart.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, look, I understand the concern about tariffs. On the other hand, as Michael points out, China has continued with unfair trade practices, stealing or threatening, pressuring to get our intellectual property. I have to say, I asked Congressman Crowley that and didn't get much of an answer. Do you have a specific idea of how we get them to clean up their act?</p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, first of all, I don't think tariffs are a trade policy. And one of the things that's missing here I think in the Pacific region is a trade policy. We had an opportunity, I think, under the Obama administration of a TPP that was fairly negotiated. I mean I didn't support that because I thought that it was missing in terms of protections for American workers, which would have had a direct impact on our relationship -- our trade relationship with China. And I think that what is happening now is this sort of ad hoc imposition of tariffs that's really throwing the markets around.</p><p>Now, do I care about that for wealthy people? No, but I do care about that for American workers and for retirements and for -- for farmers. And so --</p><p>WALLACE: So what should we do?</p><p>EDWARDS: You know, and so I think that, you know, what we should do is we should actually have a trade policy for the region that allows us, with our neighbors and our allies, to stack up against China. And right now we don't have that.</p><p>WALLACE: If you go to the WTO and, as Michael has pointed out, it hasn't worked. There was a ruling I just read this weekend that the WTO made about certain Chinese trade practices. They have spent six years, and they still are mulling how to comply.</p><p>EDWARDS: Well, I'm not really sure the WTO is necessarily the framework. It may be -- it's one avenue. But the real framework is our European allies, which are facing exactly the same problem with China, but we've done nothing to coordinate a strategy with -- with Europe and with the Pacific region in terms of dealing with China, particularly on intellectual property.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, I want to switch to another big story this week, and that is immigration and President Trump's decision to send up to 4,000 members of the National Guard to the southern border to guard that border. He talked at one point about a caravan of about 1,000 people coming up through Mexico to the United States. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yesterday it came out where this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody's ever seen before. They don't want to mention that. So we have to change our laws. And the Democrats, what they're doing is just -- it's insanity.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Juan, now under questioning, the white House ended up having to cite reports of incidents of rate with another caravan back in 2014. But what about the larger issue and what about the president's decision to send border -- rather, National Guard to the border?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, this is political theater for a man who promised to build a wall that would be paid for by Mexico. That hasn't happened and you've had some people in his base say, hey, what happened to your pledge to build a wall?</p><p>The reality is, the border crossings are -- I think it's a 45 plus year low.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, no, no, no, we --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, we saw the tick up that you illustrated earlier in the show in the month of March. That's not representative of the long term here. And the long term is in fact that in terms of border crossings from Mexico, they too are at net zero migration. This is the reality. But what you have is most illegals in this country have overstayed visas. They haven't run through any wall or snuck under a wall or jumped over a wall.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, there's no wall.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There's a -- well, that are -- there are walls in places that we think. I mean it's not as if we haven't done anything about border security. But the caravan, the caravan's been coming up as an Easter ritual for the last five plus years, Chris. And I think what you have here is an attempt to trigger fear and hysteria over, oh, there's a horde coming at the southern border and they're coming and they're going to invade America.</p><p>But I think it's all about this president trying to say to his base, hey, I am putting a wall up, or if I'm not putting a wall up, I'm going to put soldiers there. Soldiers who, by the way, have no authority to detain anyone, arrest anyone, no bullets in their guns. I mean it's -- it's a joke.</p><p>WALLACE: I -- I -- I can see both Michael and Karl with -- ready to come out of their seats.</p><p>Karl, I'll --</p><p>ROVE: I want to briefly agree with one -- the only thing that Juan said that was correct, which is the caravan has been going on for a long while and the Mexicans were fully capable of taking care of them. But the rest of what Juan said, bologna.</p><p>Look, we -- we have a problem on the border. If you look at -- if you look at the crossings compared to a year ago, they have doubled. And we are facing a surge. And the president was right to say to the states -- it was on an impulse, but that doesn't make it a bad impulse, that the states need help.</p><p>You noticed -- did you see with the first National Guard unit was from Texas to be sent to the border immediately after the president's order, an aviation unit because, what was the first unit to go from Arizona? A construction unit. There are things along the border that the National Guard can do in a moment like this when additional resources are needed that is justified and ample. And I trust the secretary of Homeland Security to arrive at it and so do the governors of most of the border states.</p><p>We have Jerry Brown wringing his hands in Sacramento as to what he ought to do, but otherwise this is a useful thing. President Obama did it. President Bush did it in a similar moment. It's not because of the caravan, but it's because of a more secular trend that's troubling. The number of illegal border crossings has doubled this year verses last year.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. I know we're not going to settle this. You can argue during the commercial.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's a deal.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, we have to take a break here.</p><p>When we come back, the Trump administration imposes new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and businesses to punish the Kremlin for alleged meddling in the 2016 election.</p><p>Plus, the fate of Scott Pruitt. What would you like to ask the panel about whether the president should stand by or fire his EPA chief? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter, at Fox News Sunday, and we may use your question on the air.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Is draining the swamp renting an apartment from the wife of a Washington lobbyist?</p><p>SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: I don't think that that's even remotely fair to ask that question.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt pushing back on ethics allegations against him, including renting a room in a Capitol Hill condo for $50 a night.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Well, Michael, you're one of 10 leading conservatives who sent a letter to President Trump yesterday urging him to keep Pruitt at EPA. And Saturday night the president tweeted this, rent for this condo was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job.</p><p>Are you not troubled by the growing list of ethical concerns about Scott Pruitt?</p><p>NEEDHAM: Yes, look, Scott Pruitt is taking on one of the sacred cows of the extreme progressive left, which is that in the debate between job growth and job creation and environmentalism there is no room for any belief in terms of anything other than always siding with environmentalists. And anyone who takes that side should be attacked in a mean-spirited manner. And that's what's going on towards EPA administrator Pruitt right now.</p><p>In that environment, all of us who take on the left for some these things should be squeaking clean because you give them fuel to create issues. And I think Scott Pruitt should not have done many of the things that he's done, which has allowed the left to sidetrack the discussion from policy and take it towards the personnel -- the personal and the ad hominem.</p><p>If you compare what Scott Pruitt is going through, to what Obama -- President Obama's EPA administrators went through, Gina McCarthy deleted 5,000 tweets because she wanted to get around FOIA requirements. Gina McCarthy spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on foreign travel. Lisa Jackson, the administrator before Gina McCarthy, had a fake e-mail account to get around FOIA requests. She spent $155,000 on a single trip to China. And so there's a gigantic double standard. The reason the double standard exists is because of the policies that Scott Pruitt is pursuing, and he should be lauded for the -- for his noble efforts on those policies.</p><p>WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of Scott Pruitt's behavior we got this tweet from 6152Tom. Is there any truth to it that he is a target, as he is getting the most done? Has made some bad expense decisions but his value-added seems to be the best of any cabinet person.</p><p>Juan, how do you answer Tom?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think there's a real situation here in terms of have -- President Trump having promised to drain the swamp and then you have Scott Pruitt -- and let's just put aside the policy arguments because I think for Michael --</p><p>NEEDHAM: Shouldn't that be what matters, policy --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, not at the moment.</p><p>NEEDHAM: You don't think policy matters?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Let's just -- let's separated it for a second, Michael, because I think conservative activists and conservative donors and people in businesses that are affected by environmental regulations just say, well, he's doing what we want, so let's leave it alone. But can you imagine if this was any other president and you had a cabinet secretary who was engaged in this kind of behavior, can't even answer a question from Ed Henry of Fox News. I don't think he's a -- Fox News is not some liberal organization out here trying to undercut a conservative. No.</p><p>But what you have is someone who has taken advantage of not only what is a sweetheart deal, pennies for dollars in terms of that condo, but the condo being rented from a lobbyist whose clients have business in front of the EPA. That, on the face of it, Michael, is disqualifying. So we can talk about policy and we can have arguments about --</p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>NEEDHAM: I am -- I am going to look forward to going back and finding Juan Williams speaking out about Gina McCarthy deleting 5,000 text messages to get around FOIA. I am sure Juan was outraged at the $150,000 --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I don't think that's good behavior. But I'm just telling you, I'm just -- it's shocking to me that you will make excuses for what is inexcusable.</p><p>NEEDHAM: But you said they were disqualifying. Was Lisa Jackson's $155,000 trip to China disqualifying?</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's -- look, she spent, by the way, on security, much less. Scott Pruitt spent three times as much. He has alarms and red flashing things and added -- asking for more people just to get through D.C. traffic.</p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's ridiculous.</p><p>WALLACE: I --</p><p>WILLIAMS: For a drain the swamp administration?</p><p>WALLACE: OK.</p><p>I want to -- we were going to talk about Russia. We may still get to it.</p><p>But I want to focus now on the breaking story today, and that is this -- what appears to be a poison gas attack on a rebel-held suburb outside of Damascus. There are reports that dozens of people may have been killed and even more were hit by this.</p><p>The president has begun to tweet on this subject today and I hope we'll put up one tweet. Many dead including women and children in mindless chemical attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad. Big price.</p><p>It's interesting, Karl. There has not been outside confirmation that this was a poison attack, but it's interesting, one, the president is saying it, and, two, not only condemning it, but also in maybe the strongest terms I've never heard him, condemning President Putin's support for Assad.</p><p>ROVE: Yes. The president -- the president is not obligated to act. So confirm if this was a poison gas attack, which it looks like it was. The estimates now are at least 70 dead, maybe as many as 150, a number of them children, all of them civilians. But now the United States will have to act as the president acted in the aftermath of the sarin gas attack in early 2017. Otherwise, our credibility in the region is going to be greatly diminished.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes, let me just pick up on that with you because in one of his earlier tweets he said the reason that this has fallen apart is because President Obama did not enforce the redline when he was president on -- when it came to gas attacks by Assad. He -- and when the president did launch that attack, those -- I think it was 59 missiles -- back in the spring of 2017, he said, if it happens again, I'll strike again. How much is he on the line now (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>ROVE: Well, he's on the line. And, look, I think there's some -- I think there is some -- you know, there's some reason why he said -- some evidence that he was correct when he said President Obama should have acted. It's unseemly for the president, however, to be reflecting on that, in my opinion.</p><p>He ought to -- he ought to act. It was one of the most important moments in the definition of his foreign policy last year that when this attack did occur he reacted in 25 percent of the air capacity of the Syrian air force disappeared in a matter of moments. He has to exact another price in order to send a second signal that just because a year has passed, doesn't mean you can engage in this behavior again.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to what appears -- and we need to say it's not confirmed yet -- what appears to be an attack, and, if so, what action President Trump is going to need to take?</p><p>EDWARDS: Well, the president is the president today. And I think that the American people and the Congress actually have to engage in a discussion about Syria that is a moral discussion when it comes to the use, if this is true, of poison gas. I mean this is a human rights crisis and the president has an obligation to act.</p><p>That said, over this last year and a half, our policy has actually allowed Assad, with Russia's help, to consolidate his power. And that leaves open the door to do these kinds -- to engage in these kind of atrocities because we think we've rolled back the Islamic States. In fact, what we've done is we've actually created an environment where it goes underground, it's not consolidating land, but continues to engage in terrorist behavior and activity.</p><p>WALLACE: Would you agree that President Obama is much more responsible for the disaster and the humanitarian slaughter in Syria than President Trump is?</p><p>EDWARDS: Well, let me just say, I -- at the time when I was in Congress, I called on the president and supported the idea --</p><p>WALLACE: President Obama.</p><p>EDWARDS: President Obama, and support of the idea that we should actually be on the side of the Syrian people who were facing exactly the same kinds of atrocities. And it's come to this point.</p><p>But the fact is that today in April 2018, President Trump is the president and it's his obligation to act and not just reflect on what a bad job he thinks that President Obama did.</p><p>WALLACE: We have less than a minute left.</p><p>Michael.</p><p>NEEDHAM: Yes, look, I think that -- that President Trump should act, as Karl said. I think that President Trump needs to see things through in Syria. And I think that we should give President Trump credit for having a very muscular and strong American policy towards Syria. And, more importantly, towards Russia, which is backing Syria in terms of getting anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, the action he took earlier this year in Syria, pushing forward to put small, tactical nuclear weapons into our arsenal. And so I think President Trump has had a very strong foreign policy and he needs to make sure that he continues that, following through with Syria.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, John Bolton comes on board tomorrow and we'll see what happens. But I think Trump has been trying to pull troops out of Syria without Pentagon approval.</p><p>WALLACE: Thanks, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p>Up next our \"Power Player of the Week.\" How the president of a major university here in Washington works the campus like a big city mayor.</p><p>WALLACE: Hang around Washington long enough and you see plenty of turnover. Cabinet secretaries come and go and administrations, and -- and, as we've seen recently, when presidents change their mind. So what happens to those former big shots? Here is our \"Power Player of the week.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SYLVIA BURWELL, PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITY: I think the role is a little more like a mayor than a CEO.</p><p>Hi.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Sylvia Matthews Burwell is president of American University here in Washington. And she works the campus like a mayor.</p><p>BURWELL: Very nice to meet you both. Thank you both.</p><p>Right now we're passing the library.</p><p>WALLACE: Here was a video in her new job when the school year started last summer.</p><p>BURWELL: Great to see some students on campus.</p><p>Oh, wait a minute, there's Claude (ph), the AU legend, out for a morning run.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So I understand you insist everyone calls you Sylvia.</p><p>BURWELL: That's right.</p><p>WALLACE: Why?</p><p>BURWELL: Because I think it's part of being a part of the university and having people feel like they can engage.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): If Burwell looks familiar, she was a member of President Obama's cabinet. First his budget director, then secretary of Health and Human Services, trying to fix Obamacare after the disastrous rollout, and then dealing with the Ebola crisis.</p><p>BURWELL: So having very large critical issues made it a pretty challenging time.</p><p>WALLACE: But running a university with 13,000 students and a tradition of public service is also challenging.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): How much does it cost, tuition, room and board, to go to AU for a year?</p><p>BURWELL: About $60,000.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Burwell says she's trying to cut cost and find new ways to help students who can't afford it.</p><p>Then, there were several racist incidents last fall, including confederate flag posters on bulletin boards. Burwell held a town hall.</p><p>BURWELL: We want to make sure that you know we're taking our steps. We need your help and support too.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't feel safe here. I don't feel happy here. I don't feel nicer. I feel worse.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Was that a tough meeting for you?</p><p>BURWELL: You know, it -- it was a tough meeting most of all because of the pain that the incidents cause.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): One reform, every student must now take a course that includes diversity training.</p><p>BURWELL: It is about learning to listen from others differing points of view and differing experiences.</p><p>WALLACE: Burwell grew up in Hinton, West Virginia. Her grandparents, Greek immigrants.</p><p>BURWELL: There were two themes in the Matthews household. One was education and the other was public service.</p><p>WALLACE: She followed both paths, going to Harvard and becoming a Rhodes Scholar. Then interspersing government work with 11 years helping run the Gates and Walmart Foundations.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): How does it feel to see so much of the Obama legacy, including Obamacare, being rolled back by President Trump?</p><p>BURWELL: There will be people who don't receive treatment and actually die because they can't afford the care, the preventative care, or the care along the way. And so this has real-world consequences for individuals in their lives.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): But Burwell embraces her new role as college president, including one game as guest coach of the women's basketball team.</p><p>BURWELL: I'm undefeated. It was terrific. It was wonderful.

The State Department is monitoring reports of  a poison gas attack in a rebel-held town near Syria's capital of Damascus.   Video from Syrian activists claims to show victims, including children,  getting hosed down.  A human's rights group says dozens have been killed in  the attack.  And we'll stay on top of this story.  </p><p>Now to the face-off for trade between the U.S. and China, which has sent  tension soaring and market stumbling.  In the latest move, President Trump  threatened to impose tariffs on another $100 billion in Chinese exports,  something that nation has vowed to fight.  A trade war without serious  consequences for consumers and businesses and investors.  </p><p>Joining me now, President Trump's new top White House economic adviser,  Larry Kudlow.  </p><p>Larry, welcome to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER:  Thank you, Chris.   Thanks a lot.</p><p>WALLACE:  You keep saying that there is no trade war, that this is part of  negotiations between the U.S. and China.  But the Chinese history says  there are any talks and says, quote, China is fully prepared to hit back  forcefully and without hesitation.  </p><p>And here was Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Friday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We will continue to have discussions.   But there is the potential of a trade war.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Now, you're a market guy.  The markets dropped 572 points on  Friday.  Clearly, there are a lot of serious investors who think there's a  real chance of a trade war.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I suppose so.  I mean, I know there are some jitters out there.  I  don't think there's any trade or insight.  Just technically, we have taken  no actions, you understand that.  And even the Thursday announcement for  President Trump, he asked Ambassador Lighthizer to consider additional  actions.  </p><p>It's a long process.  Several months here.  We put our papers, we take  public comments.  We then review the public comments and then decisions  will be made.  </p><p>So far, no tariffs and no action has been enacted.  Point number two.  I  believe China's response to the U.S. actions, which is a complaint against  stealing intellectual property against forced technology transfers, I think  that's a legitimate complaint, so does the rest of the world.</p><p>But China's response was highly unsatisfactory and I think that's  unfortunate.  We do have constant communication with them, to be sure.  I  hope their side picks up on this.  But so far, stonewalling us is not the  answer.  </p><p>Listen -- </p><p>WALLACE:  And that's what they're doing is stonewalling?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Basically.  I mean, lots of rhetoric out there, like, you know,  old communist party type stuff.  The whole world, please, the whole world  knows China has been violating trade laws for many years and President  Trump is the guy calling them on it and he's right to do so.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Is the president -- you say he's calling them on it.  Is he  bluffing or will he impose tariffs if China doesn't change its trade  practice?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I -- he's not bluffing.  I mean, there are a number of tools  at his disposal.  </p><p>Just one thing there -- people are saying Trump, Trump, Trump.  This is a  problem caused by China, not a problem caused by President Trump, and I  would go so far as to say, Trump is there to fix the problem.  </p><p>If you talk to the president as I have, he regards himself as a free  trader, all right?  As do I.  But his argument, and it's a good one, you  can't have free trade, which is pro-growth around the world unless China  brings down its barriers, opens up its markets --  </p><p>WALLACE:  But, Larry --  </p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and stop this technology steal that they're doing.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Nobody is saying that China isn't to blame here.  The question  is, the president's response.  As you point out, you are a tree trader.  </p><p>Here is what you said just last month when President Trump announced his  first round of tariffs.  And this wasn't an announcement.  This was real  imposition of tariffs on aluminum and steel.  Here you are.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Tariff hikes are prosperity killers.  They always have been and  they always will be.  Tariffs are taxes and the ones who suffer most are  the users.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  So who should we believe, that Larry Kudlow or this one?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I thought you might run that.  I'm opposed to blanket tariffs and  that's where it first started.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But that's what the president is talking about?</p><p>KUDLOW:  No, he has changed his view, even on the national security action.   We've got a lot of exceptions and a lot of carve-outs.</p><p>WALLACE:  But you're not talking about carve-outs or exceptions for China.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, hang on.  So, I oppose the blanket tariffs, I always do.  </p><p>Now, with respect to China, I've always been a hard-liner on China, and  while I don't like tariffs, sometimes there is no substitution for putting  tariffs into the discussion, into the process.  That is part of the quiver  of arrows that the president has.  </p><p>Look, he's a great negotiator.  He has a whole history of that.  But in  this process, tariffs have to be part of it.  There's no two ways about it.   Then, hopefully, there will be discussions and hopefully, in just the next  two months, the Chinese will come seriously back to the table.  </p><p>President Trump has told me, we were together a long time on Thursday and  Friday.  He likes President Xi.  They get along.  He respects President Xi  as a negotiator, but they have not played by the rules, Chris.  This has  been going on.  </p><p>Technology is everything to this country, everything -- our  entrepreneurship, our innovation, our future growth, our productivity.  We  cut corporate tax rates precisely to unlock the animal spirits around  technology.  </p><p>We cannot let China willy-nilly steal our technology.  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK.  You said on Friday that you were going to announce a trade  coalition of the willing today, other countries that were going to join us  in taking on China.  Who are they?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't (ph) -- I didn't make this announcement.  I'm just  observing.  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, you set on Friday, between 24 and 48 hours I'm going to  announce the trade coalition of the willing.  Do you have them?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  They are coming to us.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Who are they?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Japan, Europe, Australia, Canada.  They have come to us.  The  president actually -- </p><p>WALLACE:  They are not talking about tariffs.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Sure they are.  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, they're not.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Sure they are.</p><p>WALLACE:  Japan said that they were going to join us in taking this issue  to the world trade organization and to object to Chinese trade practices  just as free traders have done for years.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  But if China maintains its third world status, as they have in the  WTO, then other countries are free to take whatever actions they want.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But -- if I just depress this, has any other country joined us in  threatening tariffs if China doesn't clean up its act?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I can't answer that.  I don't even want to answer that.  </p><p>All I'm saying is my trade coalition of the willing will put the whole  world behind the United States' actions against China, and this is going to  have a big effect on China.  China does not want to lose face, but China  does not want to be regarded as the enemy in trade for the entire world.  </p><p>The WTO, by the way, is one of the processes.  Ambassador Lighthizer has  that in his releases.  So, we'll work there.  We'll work directly with the  Chinese.  </p><p>But I want to make this clear: President Trump is a great negotiator.  The  tariffs, which none of us particularly want, may -- I say may -- have to be  part of this discussion and argument.  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK, I want to pick up on that because ever since I first met we  go back a ways.  And ever since I first met you in the Reagan White House,  you have been an apostle of growth.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  You say that growth cures income inequality.  Growth cures budget  deficits.  But if China and if -- let me just finish, if China and the U.S.  slapped tariffs on each other, even President Trump said that could hurt  the economy.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So, we may take a hit, and,  you know what, ultimately, we're going to be much stronger for it.  But  it's something we had to do.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  And here's a line from an article: Trump should also examine the  historical record on tariffs because they have almost never worked as  intended and almost always delivered an unhappy ending.  </p><p>Larry, I assume you agree with that because you wrote it.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I do.  I wrote it.  I agree with it.  It's still my position.  The  president knows that.  We had lots of conversations.  </p><p>But around this action, I'm going to stay with us -- the path to free-trade  has to include China acting in concert with first world nations, with  (INAUDIBLE) nations.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Even if we end up in trade were?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  We're not going to end up in a trade war.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, they aren't backing off.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, we haven't even enacted anything yet.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I understand.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  So, let's go easy on the trade war.  We got several months here.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But you say the president isn't bluffing.  You say tariffs have  to be part of the discussion.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I do.</p><p>WALLACE:  So, if they don't back off -- </p><p>KUDLOW:  We will see.  We will see.  </p><p>Remember this: the U.S. economy is doing very well now.  By the way, at the  time, you learned your lesson as well when we first spoke back in 1980.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I listened.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You've been very good on that, I'm proud of you.  </p><p>Now, having said all that, we are growing at over 3 percent annual rate for  the last three quarters.  This is investment spending, equipment spending  is booming.  Jobs are rising.  Consumer confidence is high.  Small business  confidence is high.  </p><p>All I'm saying is forget trade wars.  Why don't you just look at the  progress of the American economy?  </p><p>WALLACE:  I --  </p><p>KUDLOW:  We can take --  </p><p>WALLACE:  That's the concern though that people have is this is going to  put a brake on that --   </p><p>KUDLOW:  It cant -- it can't possibly.  It can't possibly.  The sums here  are too small.  But the principals are very strong.  Do you see what I'm  saying?  </p><p>WALLACE:  I understand that but as you well know trade war sometime  escalate.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I haven't seen a trade war since Smoot Hawley, of 1930s.   And even I was -- </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  I have to ask you to other questions and we've got  three other minutes to get them in.  </p><p>One of the drags on the market right now is the concern that Washington is  going to regulate big tech.  Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Facebook, is  going to testify before Congress this week.  </p><p>Does the president want to see Washington regulate how Facebook uses its  users' data, what it does with its users' data and also how it screens ads?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I think the president right now will be intently watching  the congressional hearings.  I think that's going to be step number one.  I  think he has his doubts whether Facebook has violated protocols, I don't  know.  We will see.  </p><p>I wish Mr. Zuckerberg -- I hope he comes to Congress wearing a nice  business suit and shirt and tie, so he will be taking more seriously.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Not a t-shirt?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Right, I'm tired of that t-shirt, hoody stuff.  He does run one of  the largest corporations of the world, for heaven's sakes.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  But we (INAUDIBLE) agree to regulate -- </p><p>KUDLOW:  We are waiting on Congress.  Let's see what comes out of that  before the administration takes any particular action.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Amazon -- the president keeps hitting the company for  failing to pay taxes, for its deal with the Post Office.  </p><p>Here he was on Air Force One.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, Amazon is just not on an even playing field.  You know, they  have a tremendous lobbying effort in addition to having \"The Washington  Post,\" which is, as far as I'm concerned, another lobbyist.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  In fact, the Post Office makes money off Amazon.  It doesn't lose  money.  And Amazon collects taxes in all 45 states.  </p><p>So, is this just talk or is the president seriously considering taking  action against Amazon?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  The president is asking that Amazon and all the Internet retailers  have a level playing field with respect to tax.  And while it's true -- </p><p>WALLACE:  But Amazon is one of the companies that does have a level playing  field.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  In recent years, they've done much better in collecting state  taxes, sales taxes.  However, they don't always connect local sales taxes,  and we've had too much protection in this area.  They are not a fledgling  industry anymore.  </p><p>So, what the president is saying is raising this issue for discussion.  I  don't think it's aimed at anybody.  We just need a level playing field and  you're going to have a court decision very soon, Chris, that's going to  make this more explicit.  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK, I've got a minute left.  There is talk this morning that the  president may ask Congress to undo part of the $1.3 trillion spending bill  to cut back some of the expenditures that were made.  Is that true and how  far along are you on that?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  It's playing in the White House.  My friend, OMB Director Mick  Mulvaney, he and I are on -- I'm an ex-OMB guy.  I feel his pain.  </p><p>We are looking at an enhanced rescission package.  I'm not going to use  numbers.  This is all around town.  </p><p>I think the Republican Party on the Hill has finally figured out.  It's  really not a bad idea to trim some spending because, after all, spending  can lead to deficits and spending interferes with the economy.  And  President Trump is a deregulator and a tax cutter.  So, we want and much  more modest government role.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Larry, thank you.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE:  Thanks for your time.  Always good to talk with you, and I keep  listening and learning.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  You've been great.  You've been absolutely one of the best people  down through the years.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE:  That's where I blew all of my credibility.  Thank you, Larry.   Always a pleasure.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  That was a joke and a compliment.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Thank you.</p><p>Up next, reaction from one of the top Democrats in the House, Congressman  Joe Crowley on his party's message for the 2018 midterms and talk he might  replace Nancy Pelosi as the next speaker of the House.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  A look at the cherry blossoms along the tidal basin here in D.C.,  which have peak bloom this week and were just beautiful.  </p><p>Washington always has its eye on the next election and as we get closer to  the 2018 midterms, many are predicting a blue wave with Democrats taking  back the House and possibly the Senate.  </p><p>Joining us now, New York Congressman Joe Crowley, chair of the House  Democratic Caucus and the subject of growing chatter among Democrats as a  possible replacement for Nancy Pelosi after the election.  He's not going  to like me saying that.  </p><p>Congressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. </p><p>REP. JOE CROWLEY (D-NY), HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIRMAN:  Thanks, Chris.   Good to be with you.  </p><p>WALLACE:  You just heard Larry Kudlow.  What do you think of his arguments  for potentially, potentially using tariffs against China?  And if not that,  how do you propose we stop their unfair trading practice?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, Chris, I'm also a member of the Ways and Means Committee  and so I do recognize there's a role for tariffs in the economy.  But I  think what really it has created is a great deal more chaos.  People really  don't know what the president's plans are or what Mr. Kudlow's plan is as  it relates to China, and the trade war that has now begun, or at least the  initial start of that has begun.  </p><p>I think that's left a lot of Americans with uncertainty about what this -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  What should they do?  If you are not going to use tariffs, how do  you stop behind the unfair trade practices, the theft of intellectual  property?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, first of all, let me just say for the record that when it  came to the issue of China, I did not vote for normal trade with China.  I  believe they were not economically nor politically mature enough to be  dealing with us on the same par.  And having said, I think that's panned  out to be true.  </p><p>But I do think we have to do this in a much more calculated way, and I --  with more of a plan.  Let's have an understanding of what the ultimate goal  is here.  Is the goal to raise the price of products here in the United  States or to lower the price of agricultural products in the United States?   That is the overall goal, because that's what some of the effect may very  well be if China retaliates in this war.  Where is ultimately going?   That's what we don't understand about this.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Donald Trump won the presidency because he convinced a lot of  voters, including a lot of Democratic voters in the industrial heartland  that he had a better idea for how to build the economy, how to get them  jobs than Hillary Clinton did.  Now, Democrats are going into the 2018  midterms with what they call a better deal.  </p><p>Here is Nancy Pelosi on that.  </p><p>(BEGN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Democrats are offering a  better deal, better jobs, better wages, a better future.  A better deal is  founded on strong values that we share.  Strong values fueled by fresh  ideas.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Forgive me, Congressman, but that sounds like standard Democratic  boilerplate.  So, give me one fresh idea that Democrats are offering voters  for November.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Fresh idea?  First of all, Chris, Donald Trump did not win by a  lot of Democratic votes in the Midwest.  It was fractions of a vote that  actually are responsible for him being president of the United States  today.  </p><p>But what I think one great fresh idea is a real infrastructure package for  the American people.  What the president has offered a 20-80 plan, 20  percent from the federal, 80 percent from local governments is not going to  wash.  It's not going to work.  What Democrats are proposing is really an  80-20 or 75-25 plan where the federal government comes up with the  resources for 80 percent and works with local governments to put America  back to work and invest in American infrastructure and invest in America.  </p><p>That's jobs.  That's a bridge to the new economy.  That's giving people the  opportunity to put their kids through college, to afford health care with a  real job.  That's the kind of message the Democrats are talking about.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But let's look at the Trump record on the economy, which  obviously you agree is going to be the key issue in November.  </p><p>Employers are adding an average of 202,000 jobs a month this year.  The  unemployment rate has been 4.1 percent for six straight months.  That's the  lowest level in 17 years.  And wages are up 2.7 percent, the highest rate  of almost nine years.  </p><p>Congressman, a solid majority of Americans, according to the polls, feel  good about the Trump economy.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Show me how any of those statistics the difference of any month  that President Obama was president of United States -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I just said that the 4.1 percent is the lowest level in 17  years.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  It's moving on a downward trend.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But it wasn't 4.1 percent.   Wage growth wasn't up.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Where was it when President Bush left office?  </p><p>WALLACE:  President Bush or President Obama?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  President Bush, when he left office, and President Obama came  from --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I understand, the world is in recession.</p><p>CROWLEY:  Right.  And so, we -- Democrats really moved us towards this job  growth through the sustained economy.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Are you saying the president deserves no -- </p><p>CROWLEY:  I didn't say that.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I'm asking.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  What I'm suggesting is that I believe what this is based on is a  false premise.  The notion of the tax cut is going to lead to somehow help  the American people along (ph) I think is a scam.  I think what they've  done is the desperate need to pass anything by the end of the year.  They  rammed through a bill without fully really understanding what was in the  bill.  </p><p>It was done in a very, very highly partisan way, and I think in the end,  it's the average worker, the middle class, in this going to suffer because  the result of the tax cut bill.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's turn to another subject, immigration.  The president has  ordered the deployment of up to 4,000 members of the National Guard to the  southern border and the fact is more people are attempting to cross the  border illegally.  Just take a look at these statistics.  </p><p>In March of 2017, 16,000 people were caught at the border.  That number  tripled last month, March of 2018, to more than 50,000.  </p><p>Don't we need to stop the surge?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  I think what we need is comprehensive immigration reform.  We've  been talking about this for decades and we just haven't seen it happen, not  since 1986.  What I think is interesting to go back to 1986 where you saw a  comprehensive immigration reform and comprehensive tax reform done in a  bipartisan way.  It was long-lasting because it was done both -- Democrats  and Republicans came together.  </p><p>Here we have a very partisan approach to this.  The president talks about  building a wall, but Mexico is going to pay for it.  Now, he's putting  troops down at the border, a very provocative move.  But at the same time,  it's not really solving the problem.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  You say it's a very provocative move.   Barack  Obama put 1,800 at the border.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  It was to some degree provocative, not in the same breath that  this president has done.  What the verbiage, the language that our  president has used towards immigrants in this nation is really -- it's  abhorrent to me, quite frankly.  It's not representative of who we are as a  nation.  </p><p>So, this president, making this move is different from any other president  doing it quite frankly.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's turn to the midterms.  President Trump says that your party  is vulnerable in November.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats haven't learned --  they still think the loyal citizens who care about jobs and borders and  security are deplorable.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  How confident are you the Democrats will win in November and take  back control of the House?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  We're a long way from November.  Let's be clear about that.  </p><p>But I'm confident that the American people want to bring balance back to  the United States government.  What they see right now is Republicans in  charge of the presidency, the Senate, the House and some would argue the  Supreme Court.  </p><p>Every branch of government seems to be controlled in some way or facet (ph)  by Republicans.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Forgive me.  That was what voters decided.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, look, they have an opportunity here to change course and  correction, that's the beauty of our democracy.  The House of  Representatives, every member of the House of Representatives is up for  election this year and a third of the Senate.  So, people have the  opportunity to bring that balance back.  </p><p>We know that the first midterm election of an incumbent president on  average sees 40 seats swing in the opposite direction.  It's not going to  happen on its own.  Democrats are not going to win that back just simply be  up against President Trump.  We need to be for, as I mentioned before, our  economic policies, our better deal and is a deal are become very clear to  the American people.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  In more than a third of House races, Republicans  running for those seats have run ads that go after Nancy Pelosi.  Here's an  example from the recent special election in Pennsylvania '18.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AD ANNOUNCER:  Conor Lamb is a Pelosi liberal.  His values aren't our  values.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Now, that Democrat, Conor Lamb, won, but one of the ways in which  he won was that he promised not to support Nancy Pelosi if Democrats take  the House and she's up for speaker again.  </p><p>Is Nancy Pelosi a liability for Democrats in this campaign?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  I think it was more reflective of the fact that Republicans are  bankrupt on the ideas.  They don't have anything else to offer except to go  after Nancy Pelosi to win elections.  That's -- if they think, that's a  winning strategy, they're completely mistaken and wrong.  It's not a  winning strategy.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I mean, forgive me, but Conor Lamb apparently thought it was an  issue because he dumped Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Conor Lamb won because he ran a local election.  He talked about  that the cuts that the Republicans were attempting to make and to privatize  Social Security.  He talked about what affect local -- what affect the  federal government has on local politics, on people's lives.  And that's  why he won that election, not because of Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p>WALLACE:  If Democrats win the House in November, will you run either to  replace Nancy Pelosi if she steps down or against her if she doesn't?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, on the first portion of that, I would wait and see just  what happened in terms of Nancy Pelosi deciding not to run.  But if Nancy  Pelosi stays, I don't -- I don't see a scenario by which I would challenge  her for that position.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do you want to be speaker?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Look, I'm focused right now on winning back the House of  Representatives, to be in the majority, to be the chair of the Democratic  Caucus in the majority.  I'm doing that job right now.  I want to be the  best chair of the Democratic Caucus I possibly can be, help my colleagues  get reelected and help when back seats for the House Democratic Caucus.  </p><p>That's my focus and goal.  That's the focus and goal of the entire  Democratic leadership.  We are one mind, Chris, and that is we want to win  back the house.  That's goal one and the only goal right now.  </p><p>WALLACE:  One last question in this.  On top Democrat was quoted as saying  that at age 56, which you are now, that you are a spring chicken by  congressional standards.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, I've had others say that I'm not such a spring chicken  after all.  Look, at the end of the day, we have a very vibrant Democratic  Caucus.  We have some incredibly talented young people.  </p><p>I think people running today like Mikie Sherrill.  She was a Navy grad.   She is running for office in New Jersey.  </p><p>I think of Joe Neguse who's running in Colorado.  I think of Brendan Kelly.   Some great people are running all around this country and we are becoming  more vibrant as a Democratic Caucus. </p><p>So, I think we have nothing to look forward to but good days ahead of us.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Congressman Crowley, thank you.  Thanks for coming in today.   Please come back, sir.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  I'm happy to come back.  Thank you.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the  escalating tariff threats between the U.S. and China.  </p><p>Plus, we'll discuss the president's Pruitt problem and growing ethical  concerns about the EPA chief.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Coming up, President Trump sends the National Guard to the  border.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have very bad laws for our border.  We're going to be doing  things militarily until we can have a wall and proper security.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel what the deployment means, next on FOX  NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But I think we're going to  have a fantastic relationship long-term with China, but we have to get this  straightened out. We have to have some balance. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: President Trump taking a hard line on China,  saying it's time to stop Beijing from taking advantage of the U.S. on  trade.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group. </p><p>GOP strategist Karl Rove. Columnist for \"The Hill,\" Juan Williams. Former  Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards. And the head of Heritage Action for  America, Michael Needham. </p><p>Well, Karl, there's no question that we have a problem with Chinese trade  practices, but is it the best solution to threaten them with tariffs? </p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think so. We have two problems  with them. The biggest problem is, they're stealing our intellectual  property. And in all this kerfuffle over tariffs, we've missed the fact  that on March 23rd the administration filed what it should have done, which  is an action with the WTO challenging from top to bottom the Chinese on  their intellectual property rights. That's where we can win and win big for  the American companies, the American consumer and for the concept of free  trade. </p><p>But tariffs, really problematic. The president said we're going to levy $60  billion in tariffs on the Chinese. Peter Navarro, his trade expert, came  out and said, and the Chinese are not going to retaliate. The Chinese said,  we're going to respond with $50 billion of tariffs. The president says,  this is unfair, I'm going to come with $100 billion worth of tariffs. $160  billion worth of tariffs would be paid by American taxpayers. This year the  value of the tax cut, as estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, is  $135 billion to American taxpayers. Next year, $280 billion. Economic  growth is happening because of pro-growth -- in part because of the pro- growth policies of the tax code. What happens if you take that away by  tariffs? </p><p>He's attacking a problem we don't need to really be worried about. We by  $500 billion from them. They buy $130 billion from us. Let's focus on  selling more to them and we're not going to get there by putting tariffs on  Chinese products. </p><p>WALLACE: Michael, are you as negative about the idea of tariffs and what  impact could it conceivably have on economic growth, which at this point  may be the best argument Republicans have going for them going into the  midterms? </p><p>MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Yes, look, large, broad  tariffs aren't the right way to go. Nobody wants a trade war. I agree with  what Larry Kudlow said, I don't think we're going to have a trade war. </p><p>At the same time, I think the strongest fact the president has going for  him is he's always been looking about for American interests, he's always  been looking out for American security. And for 20 years liberal elites  have promised us that if we just integrate China into the global trade  network, they will start acting like a responsible stakeholder in the  international community. They haven't. And it's been a lie. </p><p>And the president is right to take seriously the threat of China, their  irresponsibility on intellectual property, their requirements that American  companies when they come into China give up their intellectual property and  the vast irresponsibility of the Chinese government around the world,  integrating them into a trade framework had not worked. We need to be  tough. We just need to be smart about how we're being tough. We need to be  targeted. And I think some of what the president has laid out has not been  targeted and smart. </p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, look, I understand the concern about  tariffs. On the other hand, as Michael points out, China has continued with  unfair trade practices, stealing or threatening, pressuring to get our  intellectual property. I have to say, I asked Congressman Crowley that and  didn't get much of an answer. Do you have a specific idea of how we get  them to clean up their act? </p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, first of all, I  don't think tariffs are a trade policy. And one of the things that's  missing here I think in the Pacific region is a trade policy. We had an  opportunity, I think, under the Obama administration of a TPP that was  fairly negotiated. I mean I didn't support that because I thought that it  was missing in terms of protections for American workers, which would have  had a direct impact on our relationship -- our trade relationship with  China. And I think that what is happening now is this sort of ad hoc  imposition of tariffs that's really throwing the markets around. </p><p>Now, do I care about that for wealthy people? No, but I do care about that  for American workers and for retirements and for -- for farmers. And so --</p><p>WALLACE: So what should we do? </p><p>EDWARDS: You know, and so I think that, you know, what we should do is we  should actually have a trade policy for the region that allows us, with our  neighbors and our allies, to stack up against China. And right now we don't  have that. </p><p>WALLACE: If you go to the WTO and, as Michael has pointed out, it hasn't  worked. There was a ruling I just read this weekend that the WTO made about  certain Chinese trade practices. They have spent six years, and they still  are mulling how to comply. </p><p>EDWARDS: Well, I'm not really sure the WTO is necessarily the framework. It  may be -- it's one avenue. But the real framework is our European allies,  which are facing exactly the same problem with China, but we've done  nothing to coordinate a strategy with -- with Europe and with the Pacific  region in terms of dealing with China, particularly on intellectual  property. </p><p>WALLACE: All right, I want to switch to another big story this week, and  that is immigration and President Trump's decision to send up to 4,000  members of the National Guard to the southern border to guard that border.  He talked at one point about a caravan of about 1,000 people coming up  through Mexico to the United States. Here he is. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yesterday it came out where  this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody's ever seen  before. They don't want to mention that. So we have to change our laws. And  the Democrats, what they're doing is just -- it's insanity. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Juan, now under questioning, the white House ended up having to  cite reports of incidents of rate with another caravan back in 2014. But  what about the larger issue and what about the president's decision to send  border -- rather, National Guard to the border? </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, this is political theater  for a man who promised to build a wall that would be paid for by Mexico.  That hasn't happened and you've had some people in his base say, hey, what  happened to your pledge to build a wall? </p><p>The reality is, the border crossings are -- I think it's a 45 plus year  low. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, no, no, no, we --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, we saw the tick up that you illustrated earlier in the show  in the month of March. That's not representative of the long term here. And  the long term is in fact that in terms of border crossings from Mexico,  they too are at net zero migration. This is the reality. But what you have  is most illegals in this country have overstayed visas. They haven't run  through any wall or snuck under a wall or jumped over a wall. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, there's no wall.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There's a -- well, that are -- there are walls in places that we  think. I mean it's not as if we haven't done anything about border  security. But the caravan, the caravan's been coming up as an Easter ritual  for the last five plus years, Chris. And I think what you have here is an  attempt to trigger fear and hysteria over, oh, there's a horde coming at  the southern border and they're coming and they're going to invade America. </p><p>But I think it's all about this president trying to say to his base, hey, I  am putting a wall up, or if I'm not putting a wall up, I'm going to put  soldiers there. Soldiers who, by the way, have no authority to detain  anyone, arrest anyone, no bullets in their guns. I mean it's -- it's a  joke. </p><p>WALLACE: I -- I -- I can see both Michael and Karl with -- ready to come  out of their seats. </p><p>Karl, I'll --</p><p>ROVE: I want to briefly agree with one -- the only thing that Juan said  that was correct, which is the caravan has been going on for a long while  and the Mexicans were fully capable of taking care of them. But the rest of  what Juan said, bologna. </p><p>Look, we -- we have a problem on the border. If you look at -- if you look  at the crossings compared to a year ago, they have doubled. And we are  facing a surge. And the president was right to say to the states -- it was  on an impulse, but that doesn't make it a bad impulse, that the states need  help. </p><p>You noticed -- did you see with the first National Guard unit was from  Texas to be sent to the border immediately after the president's order, an  aviation unit because, what was the first unit to go from Arizona? A  construction unit. There are things along the border that the National  Guard can do in a moment like this when additional resources are needed  that is justified and ample. And I trust the secretary of Homeland Security  to arrive at it and so do the governors of most of the border states. </p><p>We have Jerry Brown wringing his hands in Sacramento as to what he ought to  do, but otherwise this is a useful thing. President Obama did it. President  Bush did it in a similar moment. It's not because of the caravan, but it's  because of a more secular trend that's troubling. The number of illegal  border crossings has doubled this year verses last year.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. I know we're not going to settle this. You can argue  during the commercial. </p><p>WILLIAMS: It's a deal.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, we have to take a break here. </p><p>When we come back, the Trump administration imposes new sanctions on  Russian oligarchs and businesses to punish the Kremlin for alleged meddling  in the 2016 election. </p><p>Plus, the fate of Scott Pruitt. What would you like to ask the panel about  whether the president should stand by or fire his EPA chief? Just go to  FaceBook or Twitter, at Fox News Sunday, and we may use your question on  the air. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Is draining the swamp renting an apartment from the  wife of a Washington lobbyist? </p><p>SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: I don't think that that's even remotely  fair to ask that question. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt pushing back on ethics  allegations against him, including renting a room in a Capitol Hill condo  for $50 a night. </p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Well, Michael, you're one of 10 leading conservatives who sent a letter to  President Trump yesterday urging him to keep Pruitt at EPA. And Saturday  night the president tweeted this, rent for this condo was about market  rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job. </p><p>Are you not troubled by the growing list of ethical concerns about Scott  Pruitt? </p><p>NEEDHAM: Yes, look, Scott Pruitt is taking on one of the sacred cows of the  extreme progressive left, which is that in the debate between job growth  and job creation and environmentalism there is no room for any belief in  terms of anything other than always siding with environmentalists. And  anyone who takes that side should be attacked in a mean-spirited manner.  And that's what's going on towards EPA administrator Pruitt right now. </p><p>In that environment, all of us who take on the left for some these things  should be squeaking clean because you give them fuel to create issues. And  I think Scott Pruitt should not have done many of the things that he's  done, which has allowed the left to sidetrack the discussion from policy  and take it towards the personnel -- the personal and the ad hominem. </p><p>If you compare what Scott Pruitt is going through, to what Obama --  President Obama's EPA administrators went through, Gina McCarthy deleted  5,000 tweets because she wanted to get around FOIA requirements. Gina  McCarthy spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on foreign travel.  Lisa Jackson, the administrator before Gina McCarthy, had a fake e-mail  account to get around FOIA requests. She spent $155,000 on a single trip to  China. And so there's a gigantic double standard. The reason the double  standard exists is because of the policies that Scott Pruitt is pursuing,  and he should be lauded for the -- for his noble efforts on those policies. </p><p>WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of Scott  Pruitt's behavior we got this tweet from 6152Tom. Is there any truth to it  that he is a target, as he is getting the most done? Has made some bad  expense decisions but his value-added seems to be the best of any cabinet  person. </p><p>Juan, how do you answer Tom? </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think there's a real situation here in terms of have --  President Trump having promised to drain the swamp and then you have Scott  Pruitt -- and let's just put aside the policy arguments because I think for  Michael -- </p><p>NEEDHAM: Shouldn't that be what matters, policy --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, not at the moment. </p><p>NEEDHAM: You don't think policy matters?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Let's just -- let's separated it for a second, Michael, because I  think conservative activists and conservative donors and people in  businesses that are affected by environmental regulations just say, well,  he's doing what we want, so let's leave it alone. But can you imagine if  this was any other president and you had a cabinet secretary who was  engaged in this kind of behavior, can't even answer a question from Ed  Henry of Fox News. I don't think he's a -- Fox News is not some liberal  organization out here trying to undercut a conservative. No. </p><p>But what you have is someone who has taken advantage of not only what is a  sweetheart deal, pennies for dollars in terms of that condo, but the condo  being rented from a lobbyist whose clients have business in front of the  EPA. That, on the face of it, Michael, is disqualifying. So we can talk  about policy and we can have arguments about --</p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>NEEDHAM: I am -- I am going to look forward to going back and finding Juan  Williams speaking out about Gina McCarthy deleting 5,000 text messages to  get around FOIA. I am sure Juan was outraged at the $150,000 -- </p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I don't think that's good behavior. But I'm just telling you,  I'm just -- it's shocking to me that you will make excuses for what is  inexcusable. </p><p>NEEDHAM: But you said they were disqualifying. Was Lisa Jackson's $155,000  trip to China disqualifying?</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's -- look, she spent, by the way, on security, much less.  Scott Pruitt spent three times as much. He has alarms and red flashing  things and added -- asking for more people just to get through D.C.  traffic. </p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's ridiculous. </p><p>WALLACE: I --</p><p>WILLIAMS: For a drain the swamp administration? </p><p>WALLACE: OK. </p><p>I want to -- we were going to talk about Russia. We may still get to it. </p><p>But I want to focus now on the breaking story today, and that is this --  what appears to be a poison gas attack on a rebel-held suburb outside of  Damascus. There are reports that dozens of people may have been killed and  even more were hit by this. </p><p>The president has begun to tweet on this subject today and I hope we'll put  up one tweet. Many dead including women and children in mindless chemical  attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian  army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin,  Russia and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad. Big price.</p><p>It's interesting, Karl. There has not been outside confirmation that this  was a poison attack, but it's interesting, one, the president is saying it,  and, two, not only condemning it, but also in maybe the strongest terms  I've never heard him, condemning President Putin's support for Assad. </p><p>ROVE: Yes. The president -- the president is not obligated to act. So  confirm if this was a poison gas attack, which it looks like it was. The  estimates now are at least 70 dead, maybe as many as 150, a number of them  children, all of them civilians. But now the United States will have to act  as the president acted in the aftermath of the sarin gas attack in early  2017. Otherwise, our credibility in the region is going to be greatly  diminished. </p><p>WALLACE: Yes, let me just pick up on that with you because in one of his  earlier tweets he said the reason that this has fallen apart is because  President Obama did not enforce the redline when he was president on --  when it came to gas attacks by Assad. He -- and when the president did  launch that attack, those -- I think it was 59 missiles -- back in the  spring of 2017, he said, if it happens again, I'll strike again. How much  is he on the line now (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>ROVE: Well, he's on the line. And, look, I think there's some -- I think  there is some -- you know, there's some reason why he said -- some evidence  that he was correct when he said President Obama should have acted. It's  unseemly for the president, however, to be reflecting on that, in my  opinion. </p><p>He ought to -- he ought to act. It was one of the most important moments in  the definition of his foreign policy last year that when this attack did  occur he reacted in 25 percent of the air capacity of the Syrian air force  disappeared in a matter of moments. He has to exact another price in order  to send a second signal that just because a year has passed, doesn't mean  you can engage in this behavior again.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to what appears -- and we  need to say it's not confirmed yet -- what appears to be an attack, and, if  so, what action President Trump is going to need to take? </p><p>EDWARDS: Well, the president is the president today. And I think that the  American people and the Congress actually have to engage in a discussion  about Syria that is a moral discussion when it comes to the use, if this is  true, of poison gas. I mean this is a human rights crisis and the president  has an obligation to act. </p><p>That said, over this last year and a half, our policy has actually allowed  Assad, with Russia's help, to consolidate his power. And that leaves open  the door to do these kinds -- to engage in these kind of atrocities because  we think we've rolled back the Islamic States. In fact, what we've done is  we've actually created an environment where it goes underground, it's not  consolidating land, but continues to engage in terrorist behavior and  activity. </p><p>WALLACE: Would you agree that President Obama is much more responsible for  the disaster and the humanitarian slaughter in Syria than President Trump  is? </p><p>EDWARDS: Well, let me just say, I -- at the time when I was in Congress, I  called on the president and supported the idea -- </p><p>WALLACE: President Obama. </p><p>EDWARDS: President Obama, and support of the idea that we should actually  be on the side of the Syrian people who were facing exactly the same kinds  of atrocities. And it's come to this point. </p><p>But the fact is that today in April 2018, President Trump is the president  and it's his obligation to act and not just reflect on what a bad job he  thinks that President Obama did. </p><p>WALLACE: We have less than a minute left. </p><p>Michael.</p><p>NEEDHAM: Yes, look, I think that -- that President Trump should act, as  Karl said. I think that President Trump needs to see things through in  Syria. And I think that we should give President Trump credit for having a  very muscular and strong American policy towards Syria. And, more  importantly, towards Russia, which is backing Syria in terms of getting  anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, the action he took earlier this year in  Syria, pushing forward to put small, tactical nuclear weapons into our  arsenal. And so I think President Trump has had a very strong foreign  policy and he needs to make sure that he continues that, following through  with Syria. </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, John Bolton comes on board tomorrow and we'll see what  happens. But I think Trump has been trying to pull troops out of Syria  without Pentagon approval. </p><p>WALLACE: Thanks, panel. See you next Sunday. </p><p>Up next our \"Power Player of the Week.\" How the president of a major  university here in Washington works the campus like a big city mayor. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Hang around Washington long enough and you see plenty of turnover.  Cabinet secretaries come and go and administrations, and -- and, as we've  seen recently, when presidents change their mind. So what happens to those  former big shots? Here is our \"Power Player of the week.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SYLVIA BURWELL, PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITY: I think the role is a  little more like a mayor than a CEO.</p><p>Hi. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Sylvia Matthews Burwell is president of American  University here in Washington. And she works the campus like a mayor. </p><p>BURWELL: Very nice to meet you both. Thank you both. </p><p>Right now we're passing the library. </p><p>WALLACE: Here was a video in her new job when the school year started last  summer. </p><p>BURWELL: Great to see some students on campus. </p><p>Oh, wait a minute, there's Claude (ph), the AU legend, out for a morning  run. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So I understand you insist everyone calls you Sylvia. </p><p>BURWELL: That's right. </p><p>WALLACE: Why? </p><p>BURWELL: Because I think it's part of being a part of the university and  having people feel like they can engage. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): If Burwell looks familiar, she was a member of  President Obama's cabinet. First his budget director, then secretary of  Health and Human Services, trying to fix Obamacare after the disastrous  rollout, and then dealing with the Ebola crisis. </p><p>BURWELL: So having very large critical issues made it a pretty challenging  time. </p><p>WALLACE: But running a university with 13,000 students and a tradition of  public service is also challenging. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): How much does it cost, tuition, room and board, to go  to AU for a year? </p><p>BURWELL: About $60,000. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Burwell says she's trying to cut cost and find new  ways to help students who can't afford it. </p><p>Then, there were several racist incidents last fall, including confederate  flag posters on bulletin boards. Burwell held a town hall. </p><p>BURWELL: We want to make sure that you know we're taking our steps. We need  your help and support too. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't feel safe here. I don't feel happy here. I  don't feel nicer. I feel worse.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Was that a tough meeting for you? </p><p>BURWELL: You know, it -- it was a tough meeting most of all because of the  pain that the incidents cause. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): One reform, every student must now take a course that  includes diversity training. </p><p>BURWELL: It is about learning to listen from others differing points of  view and differing experiences. </p><p>WALLACE: Burwell grew up in Hinton, West Virginia. Her grandparents, Greek  immigrants. </p><p>BURWELL: There were two themes in the Matthews household. One was education  and the other was public service. </p><p>WALLACE: She followed both paths, going to Harvard and becoming a Rhodes  Scholar. Then interspersing government work with 11 years helping run the  Gates and Walmart Foundations. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): How does it feel to see so much of the Obama legacy,  including Obamacare, being rolled back by President Trump? </p><p>BURWELL: There will be people who don't receive treatment and actually die  because they can't afford the care, the preventative care, or the care  along the way. And so this has real-world consequences for individuals in  their lives. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): But Burwell embraces her new role as college  president, including one game as guest coach of the women's basketball  team. </p><p>BURWELL: I'm undefeated. It was terrific. It was wonderful. I loved it. </p><p>WALLACE: It's all part of seeing AU as a town, and she's the mayor. </p><p>BURWELL: Meeting these students who have so much energy, excitement and  passion, and that is an incredible gift every day. </p><p>But I hope I'll see you around campus.</p><p>Bye.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: Burwell had no experience in academia as either a professor or  school administrator, but she's taken to being a university president like  a natural. </p><p>And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The State Department is monitoring reports of  a poison gas attack in a rebel-held town near Syria's capital of Damascus.   Video from Syrian activists claims to show victims, including children,  getting hosed down.  A human's rights group says dozens have been killed in  the attack.  And we'll stay on top of this story.  </p><p> Now to the face-off for trade between the U.S. and China, which has sent  tension soaring and market stumbling.  In the latest move, President Trump  threatened to impose tariffs on another $100 billion in Chinese exports,  something that nation has vowed to fight.  A trade war without serious  consequences for consumers and businesses and investors.  </p><p> Joining me now, President Trump's new top White House economic adviser,  Larry Kudlow.  </p><p> Larry, welcome to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p> LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER:  Thank you, Chris.   Thanks a lot.</p><p> WALLACE:  You keep saying that there is no trade war, that this is part of  negotiations between the U.S. and China.  But the Chinese history says  there are any talks and says, quote, China is fully prepared to hit back  forcefully and without hesitation.  </p><p> And here was Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Friday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We will continue to have discussions.   But there is the potential of a trade war.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Now, you're a market guy.  The markets dropped 572 points on  Friday.  Clearly, there are a lot of serious investors who think there's a  real chance of a trade war.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  I suppose so.  I mean, I know there are some jitters out there.  I  don't think there's any trade or insight.  Just technically, we have taken  no actions, you understand that.  And even the Thursday announcement for  President Trump, he asked Ambassador Lighthizer to consider additional  actions.  </p><p> It's a long process.  Several months here.  We put our papers, we take  public comments.  We then review the public comments and then decisions  will be made.  </p><p> So far, no tariffs and no action has been enacted.  Point number two.  I  believe China's response to the U.S. actions, which is a complaint against  stealing intellectual property against forced technology transfers, I think  that's a legitimate complaint, so does the rest of the world.</p><p> But China's response was highly unsatisfactory and I think that's  unfortunate.  We do have constant communication with them, to be sure.  I  hope their side picks up on this.  But so far, stonewalling us is not the  answer.  </p><p> Listen -- </p><p> WALLACE:  And that's what they're doing is stonewalling?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Basically.  I mean, lots of rhetoric out there, like, you know,  old communist party type stuff.  The whole world, please, the whole world  knows China has been violating trade laws for many years and President  Trump is the guy calling them on it and he's right to do so.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Is the president -- you say he's calling them on it.  Is he  bluffing or will he impose tariffs if China doesn't change its trade  practice?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Look, I -- he's not bluffing.  I mean, there are a number of tools  at his disposal.  </p><p> Just one thing there -- people are saying Trump, Trump, Trump.  This is a  problem caused by China, not a problem caused by President Trump, and I  would go so far as to say, Trump is there to fix the problem.  </p><p> If you talk to the president as I have, he regards himself as a free  trader, all right?  As do I.  But his argument, and it's a good one, you  can't have free trade, which is pro-growth around the world unless China  brings down its barriers, opens up its markets --  </p><p> WALLACE:  But, Larry --  </p><p> KUDLOW:  -- and stop this technology steal that they're doing.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Nobody is saying that China isn't to blame here.  The question  is, the president's response.  As you point out, you are a tree trader.  </p><p> Here is what you said just last month when President Trump announced his  first round of tariffs.  And this wasn't an announcement.  This was real  imposition of tariffs on aluminum and steel.  Here you are.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KUDLOW:  Tariff hikes are prosperity killers.  They always have been and  they always will be.  Tariffs are taxes and the ones who suffer most are  the users.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  So who should we believe, that Larry Kudlow or this one?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  I thought you might run that.  I'm opposed to blanket tariffs and  that's where it first started.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But that's what the president is talking about?</p><p> KUDLOW:  No, he has changed his view, even on the national security action.   We've got a lot of exceptions and a lot of carve-outs.</p><p> WALLACE:  But you're not talking about carve-outs or exceptions for China.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Well, hang on.  So, I oppose the blanket tariffs, I always do.  </p><p> Now, with respect to China, I've always been a hard-liner on China, and  while I don't like tariffs, sometimes there is no substitution for putting  tariffs into the discussion, into the process.  That is part of the quiver  of arrows that the president has.  </p><p> Look, he's a great negotiator.  He has a whole history of that.  But in  this process, tariffs have to be part of it.  There's no two ways about it.   Then, hopefully, there will be discussions and hopefully, in just the next  two months, the Chinese will come seriously back to the table.  </p><p> President Trump has told me, we were together a long time on Thursday and  Friday.  He likes President Xi.  They get along.  He respects President Xi  as a negotiator, but they have not played by the rules, Chris.  This has  been going on.  </p><p> Technology is everything to this country, everything -- our  entrepreneurship, our innovation, our future growth, our productivity.  We  cut corporate tax rates precisely to unlock the animal spirits around  technology.  </p><p> We cannot let China willy-nilly steal our technology.  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK.  You said on Friday that you were going to announce a trade  coalition of the willing today, other countries that were going to join us  in taking on China.  Who are they?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Well, I don't (ph) -- I didn't make this announcement.  I'm just  observing.  </p><p> WALLACE:  No, no, you set on Friday, between 24 and 48 hours I'm going to  announce the trade coalition of the willing.  Do you have them?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  They are coming to us.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Who are they?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Japan, Europe, Australia, Canada.  They have come to us.  The  president actually -- </p><p> WALLACE:  They are not talking about tariffs.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Sure they are.  </p><p> WALLACE:  No, they're not.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Sure they are.</p><p> WALLACE:  Japan said that they were going to join us in taking this issue  to the world trade organization and to object to Chinese trade practices  just as free traders have done for years.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  But if China maintains its third world status, as they have in the  WTO, then other countries are free to take whatever actions they want.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But -- if I just depress this, has any other country joined us in  threatening tariffs if China doesn't clean up its act?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  I can't answer that.  I don't even want to answer that.  </p><p> All I'm saying is my trade coalition of the willing will put the whole  world behind the United States' actions against China, and this is going to  have a big effect on China.  China does not want to lose face, but China  does not want to be regarded as the enemy in trade for the entire world.  </p><p> The WTO, by the way, is one of the processes.  Ambassador Lighthizer has  that in his releases.  So, we'll work there.  We'll work directly with the  Chinese.  </p><p> But I want to make this clear: President Trump is a great negotiator.  The  tariffs, which none of us particularly want, may -- I say may -- have to be  part of this discussion and argument.  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK, I want to pick up on that because ever since I first met we  go back a ways.  And ever since I first met you in the Reagan White House,  you have been an apostle of growth.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Yes.</p><p> WALLACE:  You say that growth cures income inequality.  Growth cures budget  deficits.  But if China and if -- let me just finish, if China and the U.S.  slapped tariffs on each other, even President Trump said that could hurt  the economy.  Here he is.  </p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So, we may take a hit, and,  you know what, ultimately, we're going to be much stronger for it.  But  it's something we had to do.  </p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  And here's a line from an article: Trump should also examine the  historical record on tariffs because they have almost never worked as  intended and almost always delivered an unhappy ending.  </p><p> Larry, I assume you agree with that because you wrote it.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  I do.  I wrote it.  I agree with it.  It's still my position.  The  president knows that.  We had lots of conversations.  </p><p> But around this action, I'm going to stay with us -- the path to free-trade  has to include China acting in concert with first world nations, with  (INAUDIBLE) nations.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Even if we end up in trade were?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  We're not going to end up in a trade war.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, they aren't backing off.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Look, we haven't even enacted anything yet.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I understand.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  So, let's go easy on the trade war.  We got several months here.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But you say the president isn't bluffing.  You say tariffs have  to be part of the discussion.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  I do.</p><p> WALLACE:  So, if they don't back off -- </p><p> KUDLOW:  We will see.  We will see.  </p><p> Remember this: the U.S. economy is doing very well now.  By the way, at the  time, you learned your lesson as well when we first spoke back in 1980.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I listened.</p><p> KUDLOW:  You've been very good on that, I'm proud of you.  </p><p> Now, having said all that, we are growing at over 3 percent annual rate for  the last three quarters.  This is investment spending, equipment spending  is booming.  Jobs are rising.  Consumer confidence is high.  Small business  confidence is high.  </p><p> All I'm saying is forget trade wars.  Why don't you just look at the  progress of the American economy?  </p><p> WALLACE:  I --  </p><p> KUDLOW:  We can take --  </p><p> WALLACE:  That's the concern though that people have is this is going to  put a brake on that --   </p><p> KUDLOW:  It cant -- it can't possibly.  It can't possibly.  The sums here  are too small.  But the principals are very strong.  Do you see what I'm  saying?  </p><p> WALLACE:  I understand that but as you well know trade war sometime  escalate.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Well, I haven't seen a trade war since Smoot Hawley, of 1930s.   And even I was -- </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  I have to ask you to other questions and we've got  three other minutes to get them in.  </p><p> One of the drags on the market right now is the concern that Washington is  going to regulate big tech.  Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Facebook, is  going to testify before Congress this week.  </p><p> Does the president want to see Washington regulate how Facebook uses its  users' data, what it does with its users' data and also how it screens ads?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Look, I think the president right now will be intently watching  the congressional hearings.  I think that's going to be step number one.  I  think he has his doubts whether Facebook has violated protocols, I don't  know.  We will see.  </p><p> I wish Mr. Zuckerberg -- I hope he comes to Congress wearing a nice  business suit and shirt and tie, so he will be taking more seriously.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Not a t-shirt?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Right, I'm tired of that t-shirt, hoody stuff.  He does run one of  the largest corporations of the world, for heaven's sakes.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  But we (INAUDIBLE) agree to regulate -- </p><p> KUDLOW:  We are waiting on Congress.  Let's see what comes out of that  before the administration takes any particular action.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Amazon -- the president keeps hitting the company for  failing to pay taxes, for its deal with the Post Office.  </p><p> Here he was on Air Force One.  </p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Well, Amazon is just not on an even playing field.  You know, they  have a tremendous lobbying effort in addition to having \"The Washington  Post,\" which is, as far as I'm concerned, another lobbyist.  </p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  In fact, the Post Office makes money off Amazon.  It doesn't lose  money.  And Amazon collects taxes in all 45 states.  </p><p> So, is this just talk or is the president seriously considering taking  action against Amazon?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  The president is asking that Amazon and all the Internet retailers  have a level playing field with respect to tax.  And while it's true -- </p><p> WALLACE:  But Amazon is one of the companies that does have a level playing  field.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  In recent years, they've done much better in collecting state  taxes, sales taxes.  However, they don't always connect local sales taxes,  and we've had too much protection in this area.  They are not a fledgling  industry anymore.  </p><p> So, what the president is saying is raising this issue for discussion.  I  don't think it's aimed at anybody.  We just need a level playing field and  you're going to have a court decision very soon, Chris, that's going to  make this more explicit.  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK, I've got a minute left.  There is talk this morning that the  president may ask Congress to undo part of the $1.3 trillion spending bill  to cut back some of the expenditures that were made.  Is that true and how  far along are you on that?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  It's playing in the White House.  My friend, OMB Director Mick  Mulvaney, he and I are on -- I'm an ex-OMB guy.  I feel his pain.  </p><p> We are looking at an enhanced rescission package.  I'm not going to use  numbers.  This is all around town.  </p><p> I think the Republican Party on the Hill has finally figured out.  It's  really not a bad idea to trim some spending because, after all, spending  can lead to deficits and spending interferes with the economy.  And  President Trump is a deregulator and a tax cutter.  So, we want and much  more modest government role.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Larry, thank you.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p> WALLACE:  Thanks for your time.  Always good to talk with you, and I keep  listening and learning.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  You've been great.  You've been absolutely one of the best people  down through the years.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> WALLACE:  That's where I blew all of my credibility.  Thank you, Larry.   Always a pleasure.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  That was a joke and a compliment.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Thank you.</p><p> Up next, reaction from one of the top Democrats in the House, Congressman  Joe Crowley on his party's message for the 2018 midterms and talk he might  replace Nancy Pelosi as the next speaker of the House.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  A look at the cherry blossoms along the tidal basin here in D.C.,  which have peak bloom this week and were just beautiful.  </p><p> Washington always has its eye on the next election and as we get closer to  the 2018 midterms, many are predicting a blue wave with Democrats taking  back the House and possibly the Senate.  </p><p> Joining us now, New York Congressman Joe Crowley, chair of the House  Democratic Caucus and the subject of growing chatter among Democrats as a  possible replacement for Nancy Pelosi after the election.  He's not going  to like me saying that.  </p><p> Congressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. </p><p> REP. JOE CROWLEY (D-NY), HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIRMAN:  Thanks, Chris.   Good to be with you.  </p><p> WALLACE:  You just heard Larry Kudlow.  What do you think of his arguments  for potentially, potentially using tariffs against China?  And if not that,  how do you propose we stop their unfair trading practice?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Well, Chris, I'm also a member of the Ways and Means Committee  and so I do recognize there's a role for tariffs in the economy.  But I  think what really it has created is a great deal more chaos.  People really  don't know what the president's plans are or what Mr. Kudlow's plan is as  it relates to China, and the trade war that has now begun, or at least the  initial start of that has begun.  </p><p> I think that's left a lot of Americans with uncertainty about what this -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  What should they do?  If you are not going to use tariffs, how do  you stop behind the unfair trade practices, the theft of intellectual  property?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Well, first of all, let me just say for the record that when it  came to the issue of China, I did not vote for normal trade with China.  I  believe they were not economically nor politically mature enough to be  dealing with us on the same par.  And having said, I think that's panned  out to be true.  </p><p> But I do think we have to do this in a much more calculated way, and I --  with more of a plan.  Let's have an understanding of what the ultimate goal  is here.  Is the goal to raise the price of products here in the United  States or to lower the price of agricultural products in the United States?   That is the overall goal, because that's what some of the effect may very  well be if China retaliates in this war.  Where is ultimately going?   That's what we don't understand about this.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Donald Trump won the presidency because he convinced a lot of  voters, including a lot of Democratic voters in the industrial heartland  that he had a better idea for how to build the economy, how to get them  jobs than Hillary Clinton did.  Now, Democrats are going into the 2018  midterms with what they call a better deal.  </p><p> Here is Nancy Pelosi on that.  </p><p> (BEGN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Democrats are offering a  better deal, better jobs, better wages, a better future.  A better deal is  founded on strong values that we share.  Strong values fueled by fresh  ideas.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Forgive me, Congressman, but that sounds like standard Democratic  boilerplate.  So, give me one fresh idea that Democrats are offering voters  for November.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Fresh idea?  First of all, Chris, Donald Trump did not win by a  lot of Democratic votes in the Midwest.  It was fractions of a vote that  actually are responsible for him being president of the United States  today.  </p><p> But what I think one great fresh idea is a real infrastructure package for  the American people.  What the president has offered a 20-80 plan, 20  percent from the federal, 80 percent from local governments is not going to  wash.  It's not going to work.  What Democrats are proposing is really an  80-20 or 75-25 plan where the federal government comes up with the  resources for 80 percent and works with local governments to put America  back to work and invest in American infrastructure and invest in America.  </p><p> That's jobs.  That's a bridge to the new economy.  That's giving people the  opportunity to put their kids through college, to afford health care with a  real job.  That's the kind of message the Democrats are talking about.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But let's look at the Trump record on the economy, which  obviously you agree is going to be the key issue in November.  </p><p> Employers are adding an average of 202,000 jobs a month this year.  The  unemployment rate has been 4.1 percent for six straight months.  That's the  lowest level in 17 years.  And wages are up 2.7 percent, the highest rate  of almost nine years.  </p><p> Congressman, a solid majority of Americans, according to the polls, feel  good about the Trump economy.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Show me how any of those statistics the difference of any month  that President Obama was president of United States -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Well, I just said that the 4.1 percent is the lowest level in 17  years.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  It's moving on a downward trend.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But it wasn't 4.1 percent.   Wage growth wasn't up.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Where was it when President Bush left office?  </p><p> WALLACE:  President Bush or President Obama?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  President Bush, when he left office, and President Obama came  from --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, I understand, the world is in recession.</p><p> CROWLEY:  Right.  And so, we -- Democrats really moved us towards this job  growth through the sustained economy.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Are you saying the president deserves no -- </p><p> CROWLEY:  I didn't say that.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I'm asking.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  What I'm suggesting is that I believe what this is based on is a  false premise.  The notion of the tax cut is going to lead to somehow help  the American people along (ph) I think is a scam.  I think what they've  done is the desperate need to pass anything by the end of the year.  They  rammed through a bill without fully really understanding what was in the  bill.  </p><p> It was done in a very, very highly partisan way, and I think in the end,  it's the average worker, the middle class, in this going to suffer because  the result of the tax cut bill.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's turn to another subject, immigration.  The president has  ordered the deployment of up to 4,000 members of the National Guard to the  southern border and the fact is more people are attempting to cross the  border illegally.  Just take a look at these statistics.  </p><p> In March of 2017, 16,000 people were caught at the border.  That number  tripled last month, March of 2018, to more than 50,000.  </p><p> Don't we need to stop the surge?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  I think what we need is comprehensive immigration reform.  We've  been talking about this for decades and we just haven't seen it happen, not  since 1986.  What I think is interesting to go back to 1986 where you saw a  comprehensive immigration reform and comprehensive tax reform done in a  bipartisan way.  It was long-lasting because it was done both -- Democrats  and Republicans came together.  </p><p> Here we have a very partisan approach to this.  The president talks about  building a wall, but Mexico is going to pay for it.  Now, he's putting  troops down at the border, a very provocative move.  But at the same time,  it's not really solving the problem.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  You say it's a very provocative move.   Barack  Obama put 1,800 at the border.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  It was to some degree provocative, not in the same breath that  this president has done.  What the verbiage, the language that our  president has used towards immigrants in this nation is really -- it's  abhorrent to me, quite frankly.  It's not representative of who we are as a  nation.  </p><p> So, this president, making this move is different from any other president  doing it quite frankly.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's turn to the midterms.  President Trump says that your party  is vulnerable in November.  Here he is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats haven't learned --  they still think the loyal citizens who care about jobs and borders and  security are deplorable.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  How confident are you the Democrats will win in November and take  back control of the House?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  We're a long way from November.  Let's be clear about that.  </p><p> But I'm confident that the American people want to bring balance back to  the United States government.  What they see right now is Republicans in  charge of the presidency, the Senate, the House and some would argue the  Supreme Court.  </p><p> Every branch of government seems to be controlled in some way or facet (ph)  by Republicans.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Forgive me.  That was what voters decided.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Well, look, they have an opportunity here to change course and  correction, that's the beauty of our democracy.  The House of  Representatives, every member of the House of Representatives is up for  election this year and a third of the Senate.  So, people have the  opportunity to bring that balance back.  </p><p> We know that the first midterm election of an incumbent president on  average sees 40 seats swing in the opposite direction.  It's not going to  happen on its own.  Democrats are not going to win that back just simply be  up against President Trump.  We need to be for, as I mentioned before, our  economic policies, our better deal and is a deal are become very clear to  the American people.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  In more than a third of House races, Republicans  running for those seats have run ads that go after Nancy Pelosi.  Here's an  example from the recent special election in Pennsylvania '18.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AD ANNOUNCER:  Conor Lamb is a Pelosi liberal.  His values aren't our  values.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Now, that Democrat, Conor Lamb, won, but one of the ways in which  he won was that he promised not to support Nancy Pelosi if Democrats take  the House and she's up for speaker again.  </p><p> Is Nancy Pelosi a liability for Democrats in this campaign?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  I think it was more reflective of the fact that Republicans are  bankrupt on the ideas.  They don't have anything else to offer except to go  after Nancy Pelosi to win elections.  That's -- if they think, that's a  winning strategy, they're completely mistaken and wrong.  It's not a  winning strategy.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I mean, forgive me, but Conor Lamb apparently thought it was an  issue because he dumped Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Conor Lamb won because he ran a local election.  He talked about  that the cuts that the Republicans were attempting to make and to privatize  Social Security.  He talked about what affect local -- what affect the  federal government has on local politics, on people's lives.  And that's  why he won that election, not because of Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p> WALLACE:  If Democrats win the House in November, will you run either to  replace Nancy Pelosi if she steps down or against her if she doesn't?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Well, on the first portion of that, I would wait and see just  what happened in terms of Nancy Pelosi deciding not to run.  But if Nancy  Pelosi stays, I don't -- I don't see a scenario by which I would challenge  her for that position.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Do you want to be speaker?  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Look, I'm focused right now on winning back the House of  Representatives, to be in the majority, to be the chair of the Democratic  Caucus in the majority.  I'm doing that job right now.  I want to be the  best chair of the Democratic Caucus I possibly can be, help my colleagues  get reelected and help when back seats for the House Democratic Caucus.  </p><p> That's my focus and goal.  That's the focus and goal of the entire  Democratic leadership.  We are one mind, Chris, and that is we want to win  back the house.  That's goal one and the only goal right now.  </p><p> WALLACE:  One last question in this.  On top Democrat was quoted as saying  that at age 56, which you are now, that you are a spring chicken by  congressional standards.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  Well, I've had others say that I'm not such a spring chicken  after all.  Look, at the end of the day, we have a very vibrant Democratic  Caucus.  We have some incredibly talented young people.  </p><p> I think people running today like Mikie Sherrill.  She was a Navy grad.   She is running for office in New Jersey.  </p><p> I think of Joe Neguse who's running in Colorado.  I think of Brendan Kelly.   Some great people are running all around this country and we are becoming  more vibrant as a Democratic Caucus. </p><p> So, I think we have nothing to look forward to but good days ahead of us.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Congressman Crowley, thank you.  Thanks for coming in today.   Please come back, sir.  </p><p> CROWLEY:  I'm happy to come back.  Thank you.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the  escalating tariff threats between the U.S. and China.  </p><p> Plus, we'll discuss the president's Pruitt problem and growing ethical  concerns about the EPA chief.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Coming up, President Trump sends the National Guard to the  border.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We have very bad laws for our border.  We're going to be doing  things militarily until we can have a wall and proper security.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel what the deployment means, next on FOX  NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But I think we're going to  have a fantastic relationship long-term with China, but we have to get this  straightened out. We have to have some balance. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: President Trump taking a hard line on China,  saying it's time to stop Beijing from taking advantage of the U.S. on  trade.</p><p> And it's time now for our Sunday group. </p><p> GOP strategist Karl Rove. Columnist for \"The Hill,\" Juan Williams. Former  Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards. And the head of Heritage Action for  America, Michael Needham. </p><p> Well, Karl, there's no question that we have a problem with Chinese trade  practices, but is it the best solution to threaten them with tariffs? </p><p> KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think so. We have two problems  with them. The biggest problem is, they're stealing our intellectual  property. And in all this kerfuffle over tariffs, we've missed the fact  that on March 23rd the administration filed what it should have done, which  is an action with the WTO challenging from top to bottom the Chinese on  their intellectual property rights. That's where we can win and win big for  the American companies, the American consumer and for the concept of free  trade. </p><p> But tariffs, really problematic. The president said we're going to levy $60  billion in tariffs on the Chinese. Peter Navarro, his trade expert, came  out and said, and the Chinese are not going to retaliate. The Chinese said,  we're going to respond with $50 billion of tariffs. The president says,  this is unfair, I'm going to come with $100 billion worth of tariffs. $160  billion worth of tariffs would be paid by American taxpayers. This year the  value of the tax cut, as estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, is  $135 billion to American taxpayers. Next year, $280 billion. Economic  growth is happening because of pro-growth -- in part because of the pro- growth policies of the tax code. What happens if you take that away by  tariffs? </p><p> He's attacking a problem we don't need to really be worried about. We by  $500 billion from them. They buy $130 billion from us. Let's focus on  selling more to them and we're not going to get there by putting tariffs on  Chinese products. </p><p> WALLACE: Michael, are you as negative about the idea of tariffs and what  impact could it conceivably have on economic growth, which at this point  may be the best argument Republicans have going for them going into the  midterms? </p><p> MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Yes, look, large, broad  tariffs aren't the right way to go. Nobody wants a trade war. I agree with  what Larry Kudlow said, I don't think we're going to have a trade war. </p><p> At the same time, I think the strongest fact the president has going for  him is he's always been looking about for American interests, he's always  been looking out for American security. And for 20 years liberal elites  have promised us that if we just integrate China into the global trade  network, they will start acting like a responsible stakeholder in the  international community. They haven't. And it's been a lie. </p><p> And the president is right to take seriously the threat of China, their  irresponsibility on intellectual property, their requirements that American  companies when they come into China give up their intellectual property and  the vast irresponsibility of the Chinese government around the world,  integrating them into a trade framework had not worked. We need to be  tough. We just need to be smart about how we're being tough. We need to be  targeted. And I think some of what the president has laid out has not been  targeted and smart. </p><p> WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, look, I understand the concern about  tariffs. On the other hand, as Michael points out, China has continued with  unfair trade practices, stealing or threatening, pressuring to get our  intellectual property. I have to say, I asked Congressman Crowley that and  didn't get much of an answer. Do you have a specific idea of how we get  them to clean up their act? </p><p> DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, first of all, I  don't think tariffs are a trade policy. And one of the things that's  missing here I think in the Pacific region is a trade policy. We had an  opportunity, I think, under the Obama administration of a TPP that was  fairly negotiated. I mean I didn't support that because I thought that it  was missing in terms of protections for American workers, which would have  had a direct impact on our relationship -- our trade relationship with  China. And I think that what is happening now is this sort of ad hoc  imposition of tariffs that's really throwing the markets around. </p><p> Now, do I care about that for wealthy people? No, but I do care about that  for American workers and for retirements and for -- for farmers. And so --</p><p> WALLACE: So what should we do? </p><p> EDWARDS: You know, and so I think that, you know, what we should do is we  should actually have a trade policy for the region that allows us, with our  neighbors and our allies, to stack up against China. And right now we don't  have that. </p><p> WALLACE: If you go to the WTO and, as Michael has pointed out, it hasn't  worked. There was a ruling I just read this weekend that the WTO made about  certain Chinese trade practices. They have spent six years, and they still  are mulling how to comply. </p><p> EDWARDS: Well, I'm not really sure the WTO is necessarily the framework. It  may be -- it's one avenue. But the real framework is our European allies,  which are facing exactly the same problem with China, but we've done  nothing to coordinate a strategy with -- with Europe and with the Pacific  region in terms of dealing with China, particularly on intellectual  property. </p><p> WALLACE: All right, I want to switch to another big story this week, and  that is immigration and President Trump's decision to send up to 4,000  members of the National Guard to the southern border to guard that border.  He talked at one point about a caravan of about 1,000 people coming up  through Mexico to the United States. Here he is. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yesterday it came out where  this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody's ever seen  before. They don't want to mention that. So we have to change our laws. And  the Democrats, what they're doing is just -- it's insanity. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Juan, now under questioning, the white House ended up having to  cite reports of incidents of rate with another caravan back in 2014. But  what about the larger issue and what about the president's decision to send  border -- rather, National Guard to the border? </p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, this is political theater  for a man who promised to build a wall that would be paid for by Mexico.  That hasn't happened and you've had some people in his base say, hey, what  happened to your pledge to build a wall? </p><p> The reality is, the border crossings are -- I think it's a 45 plus year  low. </p><p> WALLACE: Well, no, no, no, we --</p><p> WILLIAMS: No, we saw the tick up that you illustrated earlier in the show  in the month of March. That's not representative of the long term here. And  the long term is in fact that in terms of border crossings from Mexico,  they too are at net zero migration. This is the reality. But what you have  is most illegals in this country have overstayed visas. They haven't run  through any wall or snuck under a wall or jumped over a wall. </p><p> WALLACE: Well, there's no wall.</p><p> WILLIAMS: There's a -- well, that are -- there are walls in places that we  think. I mean it's not as if we haven't done anything about border  security. But the caravan, the caravan's been coming up as an Easter ritual  for the last five plus years, Chris. And I think what you have here is an  attempt to trigger fear and hysteria over, oh, there's a horde coming at  the southern border and they're coming and they're going to invade America. </p><p> But I think it's all about this president trying to say to his base, hey, I  am putting a wall up, or if I'm not putting a wall up, I'm going to put  soldiers there. Soldiers who, by the way, have no authority to detain  anyone, arrest anyone, no bullets in their guns. I mean it's -- it's a  joke. </p><p> WALLACE: I -- I -- I can see both Michael and Karl with -- ready to come  out of their seats. </p><p> Karl, I'll --</p><p> ROVE: I want to briefly agree with one -- the only thing that Juan said  that was correct, which is the caravan has been going on for a long while  and the Mexicans were fully capable of taking care of them. But the rest of  what Juan said, bologna. </p><p> Look, we -- we have a problem on the border. If you look at -- if you look  at the crossings compared to a year ago, they have doubled. And we are  facing a surge. And the president was right to say to the states -- it was  on an impulse, but that doesn't make it a bad impulse, that the states need  help. </p><p> You noticed -- did you see with the first National Guard unit was from  Texas to be sent to the border immediately after the president's order, an  aviation unit because, what was the first unit to go from Arizona? A  construction unit. There are things along the border that the National  Guard can do in a moment like this when additional resources are needed  that is justified and ample. And I trust the secretary of Homeland Security  to arrive at it and so do the governors of most of the border states. </p><p> We have Jerry Brown wringing his hands in Sacramento as to what he ought to  do, but otherwise this is a useful thing. President Obama did it. President  Bush did it in a similar moment. It's not because of the caravan, but it's  because of a more secular trend that's troubling. The number of illegal  border crossings has doubled this year verses last year.</p><p> WALLACE: All right. I know we're not going to settle this. You can argue  during the commercial. </p><p> WILLIAMS: It's a deal.</p><p> WALLACE: All right, we have to take a break here. </p><p> When we come back, the Trump administration imposes new sanctions on  Russian oligarchs and businesses to punish the Kremlin for alleged meddling  in the 2016 election. </p><p> Plus, the fate of Scott Pruitt. What would you like to ask the panel about  whether the president should stand by or fire his EPA chief? Just go to  FaceBook or Twitter, at Fox News Sunday, and we may use your question on  the air. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Is draining the swamp renting an apartment from the  wife of a Washington lobbyist? </p><p> SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: I don't think that that's even remotely  fair to ask that question. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt pushing back on ethics  allegations against him, including renting a room in a Capitol Hill condo  for $50 a night. </p><p> And we're back now with the panel.</p><p> Well, Michael, you're one of 10 leading conservatives who sent a letter to  President Trump yesterday urging him to keep Pruitt at EPA. And Saturday  night the president tweeted this, rent for this condo was about market  rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job. </p><p> Are you not troubled by the growing list of ethical concerns about Scott  Pruitt? </p><p> NEEDHAM: Yes, look, Scott Pruitt is taking on one of the sacred cows of the  extreme progressive left, which is that in the debate between job growth  and job creation and environmentalism there is no room for any belief in  terms of anything other than always siding with environmentalists. And  anyone who takes that side should be attacked in a mean-spirited manner.  And that's what's going on towards EPA administrator Pruitt right now. </p><p> In that environment, all of us who take on the left for some these things  should be squeaking clean because you give them fuel to create issues. And  I think Scott Pruitt should not have done many of the things that he's  done, which has allowed the left to sidetrack the discussion from policy  and take it towards the personnel -- the personal and the ad hominem. </p><p> If you compare what Scott Pruitt is going through, to what Obama --  President Obama's EPA administrators went through, Gina McCarthy deleted  5,000 tweets because she wanted to get around FOIA requirements. Gina  McCarthy spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on foreign travel.  Lisa Jackson, the administrator before Gina McCarthy, had a fake e-mail  account to get around FOIA requests. She spent $155,000 on a single trip to  China. And so there's a gigantic double standard. The reason the double  standard exists is because of the policies that Scott Pruitt is pursuing,  and he should be lauded for the -- for his noble efforts on those policies. </p><p> WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of Scott  Pruitt's behavior we got this tweet from 6152Tom. Is there any truth to it  that he is a target, as he is getting the most done? Has made some bad  expense decisions but his value-added seems to be the best of any cabinet  person. </p><p> Juan, how do you answer Tom? </p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, I think there's a real situation here in terms of have --  President Trump having promised to drain the swamp and then you have Scott  Pruitt -- and let's just put aside the policy arguments because I think for  Michael -- </p><p> NEEDHAM: Shouldn't that be what matters, policy --</p><p> WILLIAMS: No, not at the moment. </p><p> NEEDHAM: You don't think policy matters?</p><p> WILLIAMS: Let's just -- let's separated it for a second, Michael, because I  think conservative activists and conservative donors and people in  businesses that are affected by environmental regulations just say, well,  he's doing what we want, so let's leave it alone. But can you imagine if  this was any other president and you had a cabinet secretary who was  engaged in this kind of behavior, can't even answer a question from Ed  Henry of Fox News. I don't think he's a -- Fox News is not some liberal  organization out here trying to undercut a conservative. No. </p><p> But what you have is someone who has taken advantage of not only what is a  sweetheart deal, pennies for dollars in terms of that condo, but the condo  being rented from a lobbyist whose clients have business in front of the  EPA. That, on the face of it, Michael, is disqualifying. So we can talk  about policy and we can have arguments about --</p><p> WALLACE: All right.</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> NEEDHAM: I am -- I am going to look forward to going back and finding Juan  Williams speaking out about Gina McCarthy deleting 5,000 text messages to  get around FOIA. I am sure Juan was outraged at the $150,000 -- </p><p> WILLIAMS: No, I don't think that's good behavior. But I'm just telling you,  I'm just -- it's shocking to me that you will make excuses for what is  inexcusable. </p><p> NEEDHAM: But you said they were disqualifying. Was Lisa Jackson's $155,000  trip to China disqualifying?</p><p> WILLIAMS: That's -- look, she spent, by the way, on security, much less.  Scott Pruitt spent three times as much. He has alarms and red flashing  things and added -- asking for more people just to get through D.C.  traffic. </p><p> WALLACE: All right.</p><p> WILLIAMS: It's ridiculous. </p><p> WALLACE: I --</p><p> WILLIAMS: For a drain the swamp administration? </p><p> WALLACE: OK. </p><p> I want to -- we were going to talk about Russia. We may still get to it. </p><p> But I want to focus now on the breaking story today, and that is this --  what appears to be a poison gas attack on a rebel-held suburb outside of  Damascus. There are reports that dozens of people may have been killed and  even more were hit by this. </p><p> The president has begun to tweet on this subject today and I hope we'll put  up one tweet. Many dead including women and children in mindless chemical  attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian  army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin,  Russia and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad. Big price.</p><p> It's interesting, Karl. There has not been outside confirmation that this  was a poison attack, but it's interesting, one, the president is saying it,  and, two, not only condemning it, but also in maybe the strongest terms  I've never heard him, condemning President Putin's support for Assad. </p><p> ROVE: Yes. The president -- the president is not obligated to act. So  confirm if this was a poison gas attack, which it looks like it was. The  estimates now are at least 70 dead, maybe as many as 150, a number of them  children, all of them civilians. But now the United States will have to act  as the president acted in the aftermath of the sarin gas attack in early  2017. Otherwise, our credibility in the region is going to be greatly  diminished. </p><p> WALLACE: Yes, let me just pick up on that with you because in one of his  earlier tweets he said the reason that this has fallen apart is because  President Obama did not enforce the redline when he was president on --  when it came to gas attacks by Assad. He -- and when the president did  launch that attack, those -- I think it was 59 missiles -- back in the  spring of 2017, he said, if it happens again, I'll strike again. How much  is he on the line now (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p> ROVE: Well, he's on the line. And, look, I think there's some -- I think  there is some -- you know, there's some reason why he said -- some evidence  that he was correct when he said President Obama should have acted. It's  unseemly for the president, however, to be reflecting on that, in my  opinion. </p><p> He ought to -- he ought to act. It was one of the most important moments in  the definition of his foreign policy last year that when this attack did  occur he reacted in 25 percent of the air capacity of the Syrian air force  disappeared in a matter of moments. He has to exact another price in order  to send a second signal that just because a year has passed, doesn't mean  you can engage in this behavior again.</p><p> WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to what appears -- and we  need to say it's not confirmed yet -- what appears to be an attack, and, if  so, what action President Trump is going to need to take? </p><p> EDWARDS: Well, the president is the president today. And I think that the  American people and the Congress actually have to engage in a discussion  about Syria that is a moral discussion when it comes to the use, if this is  true, of poison gas. I mean this is a human rights crisis and the president  has an obligation to act. </p><p> That said, over this last year and a half, our policy has actually allowed  Assad, with Russia's help, to consolidate his power. And that leaves open  the door to do these kinds -- to engage in these kind of atrocities because  we think we've rolled back the Islamic States. In fact, what we've done is  we've actually created an environment where it goes underground, it's not  consolidating land, but continues to engage in terrorist behavior and  activity. </p><p> WALLACE: Would you agree that President Obama is much more responsible for  the disaster and the humanitarian slaughter in Syria than President Trump  is? </p><p> EDWARDS: Well, let me just say, I -- at the time when I was in Congress, I  called on the president and supported the idea -- </p><p> WALLACE: President Obama. </p><p> EDWARDS: President Obama, and support of the idea that we should actually  be on the side of the Syrian people who were facing exactly the same kinds  of atrocities. And it's come to this point. </p><p> But the fact is that today in April 2018, President Trump is the president  and it's his obligation to act and not just reflect on what a bad job he  thinks that President Obama did. </p><p> WALLACE: We have less than a minute left. </p><p> Michael.</p><p> NEEDHAM: Yes, look, I think that -- that President Trump should act, as  Karl said. I think that President Trump needs to see things through in  Syria. And I think that we should give President Trump credit for having a  very muscular and strong American policy towards Syria. And, more  importantly, towards Russia, which is backing Syria in terms of getting  anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, the action he took earlier this year in  Syria, pushing forward to put small, tactical nuclear weapons into our  arsenal. And so I think President Trump has had a very strong foreign  policy and he needs to make sure that he continues that, following through  with Syria. </p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, John Bolton comes on board tomorrow and we'll see what  happens. But I think Trump has been trying to pull troops out of Syria  without Pentagon approval. </p><p> WALLACE: Thanks, panel. See you next Sunday. </p><p> Up next our \"Power Player of the Week.\" How the president of a major  university here in Washington works the campus like a big city mayor. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: Hang around Washington long enough and you see plenty of turnover.  Cabinet secretaries come and go and administrations, and -- and, as we've  seen recently, when presidents change their mind. So what happens to those  former big shots? Here is our \"Power Player of the week.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SYLVIA BURWELL, PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITY: I think the role is a  little more like a mayor than a CEO.</p><p> Hi. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): Sylvia Matthews Burwell is president of American  University here in Washington. And she works the campus like a mayor. </p><p> BURWELL: Very nice to meet you both. Thank you both. </p><p> Right now we're passing the library. </p><p> WALLACE: Here was a video in her new job when the school year started last  summer. </p><p> BURWELL: Great to see some students on campus. </p><p> Oh, wait a minute, there's Claude (ph), the AU legend, out for a morning  run. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): So I understand you insist everyone calls you Sylvia. </p><p> BURWELL: That's right. </p><p> WALLACE: Why? </p><p> BURWELL: Because I think it's part of being a part of the university and  having people feel like they can engage. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): If Burwell looks familiar, she was a member of  President Obama's cabinet. First his budget director, then secretary of  Health and Human Services, trying to fix Obamacare after the disastrous  rollout, and then dealing with the Ebola crisis. </p><p> BURWELL: So having very large critical issues made it a pretty challenging  time. </p><p> WALLACE: But running a university with 13,000 students and a tradition of  public service is also challenging. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): How much does it cost, tuition, room and board, to go  to AU for a year? </p><p> BURWELL: About $60,000. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): Burwell says she's trying to cut cost and find new  ways to help students who can't afford it. </p><p> Then, there were several racist incidents last fall, including confederate  flag posters on bulletin boards. Burwell held a town hall. </p><p> BURWELL: We want to make sure that you know we're taking our steps. We need  your help and support too. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't feel safe here. I don't feel happy here. I  don't feel nicer. I feel worse.</p><p> WALLACE (on camera): Was that a tough meeting for you? </p><p> BURWELL: You know, it -- it was a tough meeting most of all because of the  pain that the incidents cause. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): One reform, every student must now take a course that  includes diversity training. </p><p> BURWELL: It is about learning to listen from others differing points of  view and differing experiences. </p><p> WALLACE: Burwell grew up in Hinton, West Virginia. Her grandparents, Greek  immigrants. </p><p> BURWELL: There were two themes in the Matthews household. One was education  and the other was public service. </p><p> WALLACE: She followed both paths, going to Harvard and becoming a Rhodes  Scholar. Then interspersing government work with 11 years helping run the  Gates and Walmart Foundations. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): How does it feel to see so much of the Obama legacy,  including Obamacare, being rolled back by President Trump? </p><p> BURWELL: There will be people who don't receive treatment and actually die  because they can't afford the care, the preventative care, or the care  along the way. And so this has real-world consequences for individuals in  their lives. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): But Burwell embraces her new role as college  president, including one game as guest coach of the women's basketball  team. </p><p> BURWELL: I'm undefeated. It was terrific. It was wonderful. I loved it. </p><p> WALLACE: It's all part of seeing AU as a town, and she's the mayor. </p><p> BURWELL: Meeting these students who have so much energy, excitement and  passion, and that is an incredible gift every day. </p><p> But I hope I'll see you around campus.</p><p> Bye.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE: Burwell had no experience in academia as either a professor or  school administrator, but she's taken to being a university president like  a natural. </p><p> And that's it for today.

The State Department is monitoring reports of  a poison gas attack in a rebel-held town near Syria's capital of Damascus.   Video from Syrian activists claims to show victims, including children,  getting hosed down.  A human's rights group says dozens have been killed in  the attack.  And we'll stay on top of this story.  </p><p>Now to the face-off for trade between the U.S. and China, which has sent  tension soaring and market stumbling.  In the latest move, President Trump  threatened to impose tariffs on another $100 billion in Chinese exports,  something that nation has vowed to fight.  A trade war without serious  consequences for consumers and businesses and investors.  </p><p>Joining me now, President Trump's new top White House economic adviser,  Larry Kudlow.  </p><p>Larry, welcome to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER:  Thank you, Chris.   Thanks a lot.</p><p>WALLACE:  You keep saying that there is no trade war, that this is part of  negotiations between the U.S. and China.  But the Chinese history says  there are any talks and says, quote, China is fully prepared to hit back  forcefully and without hesitation.  </p><p>And here was Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Friday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We will continue to have discussions.   But there is the potential of a trade war.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Now, you're a market guy.  The markets dropped 572 points on  Friday.  Clearly, there are a lot of serious investors who think there's a  real chance of a trade war.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I suppose so.  I mean, I know there are some jitters out there.  I  don't think there's any trade or insight.  Just technically, we have taken  no actions, you understand that.  And even the Thursday announcement for  President Trump, he asked Ambassador Lighthizer to consider additional  actions.  </p><p>It's a long process.  Several months here.  We put our papers, we take  public comments.  We then review the public comments and then decisions  will be made.  </p><p>So far, no tariffs and no action has been enacted.  Point number two.  I  believe China's response to the U.S. actions, which is a complaint against  stealing intellectual property against forced technology transfers, I think  that's a legitimate complaint, so does the rest of the world.</p><p>But China's response was highly unsatisfactory and I think that's  unfortunate.  We do have constant communication with them, to be sure.  I  hope their side picks up on this.  But so far, stonewalling us is not the  answer.  </p><p>Listen -- </p><p>WALLACE:  And that's what they're doing is stonewalling?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Basically.  I mean, lots of rhetoric out there, like, you know,  old communist party type stuff.  The whole world, please, the whole world  knows China has been violating trade laws for many years and President  Trump is the guy calling them on it and he's right to do so.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Is the president -- you say he's calling them on it.  Is he  bluffing or will he impose tariffs if China doesn't change its trade  practice?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I -- he's not bluffing.  I mean, there are a number of tools  at his disposal.  </p><p>Just one thing there -- people are saying Trump, Trump, Trump.  This is a  problem caused by China, not a problem caused by President Trump, and I  would go so far as to say, Trump is there to fix the problem.  </p><p>If you talk to the president as I have, he regards himself as a free  trader, all right?  As do I.  But his argument, and it's a good one, you  can't have free trade, which is pro-growth around the world unless China  brings down its barriers, opens up its markets --  </p><p>WALLACE:  But, Larry --  </p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and stop this technology steal that they're doing.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Nobody is saying that China isn't to blame here.  The question  is, the president's response.  As you point out, you are a tree trader.  </p><p>Here is what you said just last month when President Trump announced his  first round of tariffs.  And this wasn't an announcement.  This was real  imposition of tariffs on aluminum and steel.  Here you are.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Tariff hikes are prosperity killers.  They always have been and  they always will be.  Tariffs are taxes and the ones who suffer most are  the users.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  So who should we believe, that Larry Kudlow or this one?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I thought you might run that.  I'm opposed to blanket tariffs and  that's where it first started.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But that's what the president is talking about?</p><p>KUDLOW:  No, he has changed his view, even on the national security action.   We've got a lot of exceptions and a lot of carve-outs.</p><p>WALLACE:  But you're not talking about carve-outs or exceptions for China.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, hang on.  So, I oppose the blanket tariffs, I always do.  </p><p>Now, with respect to China, I've always been a hard-liner on China, and  while I don't like tariffs, sometimes there is no substitution for putting  tariffs into the discussion, into the process.  That is part of the quiver  of arrows that the president has.  </p><p>Look, he's a great negotiator.  He has a whole history of that.  But in  this process, tariffs have to be part of it.  There's no two ways about it.   Then, hopefully, there will be discussions and hopefully, in just the next  two months, the Chinese will come seriously back to the table.  </p><p>President Trump has told me, we were together a long time on Thursday and  Friday.  He likes President Xi.  They get along.  He respects President Xi  as a negotiator, but they have not played by the rules, Chris.  This has  been going on.  </p><p>Technology is everything to this country, everything -- our  entrepreneurship, our innovation, our future growth, our productivity.  We  cut corporate tax rates precisely to unlock the animal spirits around  technology.  </p><p>We cannot let China willy-nilly steal our technology.  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK.  You said on Friday that you were going to announce a trade  coalition of the willing today, other countries that were going to join us  in taking on China.  Who are they?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't (ph) -- I didn't make this announcement.  I'm just  observing.  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, you set on Friday, between 24 and 48 hours I'm going to  announce the trade coalition of the willing.  Do you have them?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  They are coming to us.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Who are they?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Japan, Europe, Australia, Canada.  They have come to us.  The  president actually -- </p><p>WALLACE:  They are not talking about tariffs.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Sure they are.  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, they're not.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Sure they are.</p><p>WALLACE:  Japan said that they were going to join us in taking this issue  to the world trade organization and to object to Chinese trade practices  just as free traders have done for years.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  But if China maintains its third world status, as they have in the  WTO, then other countries are free to take whatever actions they want.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But -- if I just depress this, has any other country joined us in  threatening tariffs if China doesn't clean up its act?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I can't answer that.  I don't even want to answer that.  </p><p>All I'm saying is my trade coalition of the willing will put the whole  world behind the United States' actions against China, and this is going to  have a big effect on China.  China does not want to lose face, but China  does not want to be regarded as the enemy in trade for the entire world.  </p><p>The WTO, by the way, is one of the processes.  Ambassador Lighthizer has  that in his releases.  So, we'll work there.  We'll work directly with the  Chinese.  </p><p>But I want to make this clear: President Trump is a great negotiator.  The  tariffs, which none of us particularly want, may -- I say may -- have to be  part of this discussion and argument.  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK, I want to pick up on that because ever since I first met we  go back a ways.  And ever since I first met you in the Reagan White House,  you have been an apostle of growth.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  You say that growth cures income inequality.  Growth cures budget  deficits.  But if China and if -- let me just finish, if China and the U.S.  slapped tariffs on each other, even President Trump said that could hurt  the economy.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So, we may take a hit, and,  you know what, ultimately, we're going to be much stronger for it.  But  it's something we had to do.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  And here's a line from an article: Trump should also examine the  historical record on tariffs because they have almost never worked as  intended and almost always delivered an unhappy ending.  </p><p>Larry, I assume you agree with that because you wrote it.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I do.  I wrote it.  I agree with it.  It's still my position.  The  president knows that.  We had lots of conversations.  </p><p>But around this action, I'm going to stay with us -- the path to free-trade  has to include China acting in concert with first world nations, with  (INAUDIBLE) nations.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Even if we end up in trade were?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  We're not going to end up in a trade war.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, they aren't backing off.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, we haven't even enacted anything yet.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I understand.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  So, let's go easy on the trade war.  We got several months here.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But you say the president isn't bluffing.  You say tariffs have  to be part of the discussion.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I do.</p><p>WALLACE:  So, if they don't back off -- </p><p>KUDLOW:  We will see.  We will see.  </p><p>Remember this: the U.S. economy is doing very well now.  By the way, at the  time, you learned your lesson as well when we first spoke back in 1980.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I listened.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You've been very good on that, I'm proud of you.  </p><p>Now, having said all that, we are growing at over 3 percent annual rate for  the last three quarters.  This is investment spending, equipment spending  is booming.  Jobs are rising.  Consumer confidence is high.  Small business  confidence is high.  </p><p>All I'm saying is forget trade wars.  Why don't you just look at the  progress of the American economy?  </p><p>WALLACE:  I --  </p><p>KUDLOW:  We can take --  </p><p>WALLACE:  That's the concern though that people have is this is going to  put a brake on that --   </p><p>KUDLOW:  It cant -- it can't possibly.  It can't possibly.  The sums here  are too small.  But the principals are very strong.  Do you see what I'm  saying?  </p><p>WALLACE:  I understand that but as you well know trade war sometime  escalate.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I haven't seen a trade war since Smoot Hawley, of 1930s.   And even I was -- </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  I have to ask you to other questions and we've got  three other minutes to get them in.  </p><p>One of the drags on the market right now is the concern that Washington is  going to regulate big tech.  Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Facebook, is  going to testify before Congress this week.  </p><p>Does the president want to see Washington regulate how Facebook uses its  users' data, what it does with its users' data and also how it screens ads?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I think the president right now will be intently watching  the congressional hearings.  I think that's going to be step number one.  I  think he has his doubts whether Facebook has violated protocols, I don't  know.  We will see.  </p><p>I wish Mr. Zuckerberg -- I hope he comes to Congress wearing a nice  business suit and shirt and tie, so he will be taking more seriously.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Not a t-shirt?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Right, I'm tired of that t-shirt, hoody stuff.  He does run one of  the largest corporations of the world, for heaven's sakes.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  But we (INAUDIBLE) agree to regulate -- </p><p>KUDLOW:  We are waiting on Congress.  Let's see what comes out of that  before the administration takes any particular action.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Amazon -- the president keeps hitting the company for  failing to pay taxes, for its deal with the Post Office.  </p><p>Here he was on Air Force One.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, Amazon is just not on an even playing field.  You know, they  have a tremendous lobbying effort in addition to having \"The Washington  Post,\" which is, as far as I'm concerned, another lobbyist.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  In fact, the Post Office makes money off Amazon.  It doesn't lose  money.  And Amazon collects taxes in all 45 states.  </p><p>So, is this just talk or is the president seriously considering taking  action against Amazon?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  The president is asking that Amazon and all the Internet retailers  have a level playing field with respect to tax.  And while it's true -- </p><p>WALLACE:  But Amazon is one of the companies that does have a level playing  field.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  In recent years, they've done much better in collecting state  taxes, sales taxes.  However, they don't always connect local sales taxes,  and we've had too much protection in this area.  They are not a fledgling  industry anymore.  </p><p>So, what the president is saying is raising this issue for discussion.  I  don't think it's aimed at anybody.  We just need a level playing field and  you're going to have a court decision very soon, Chris, that's going to  make this more explicit.  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK, I've got a minute left.  There is talk this morning that the  president may ask Congress to undo part of the $1.3 trillion spending bill  to cut back some of the expenditures that were made.  Is that true and how  far along are you on that?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  It's playing in the White House.  My friend, OMB Director Mick  Mulvaney, he and I are on -- I'm an ex-OMB guy.  I feel his pain.  </p><p>We are looking at an enhanced rescission package.  I'm not going to use  numbers.  This is all around town.  </p><p>I think the Republican Party on the Hill has finally figured out.  It's  really not a bad idea to trim some spending because, after all, spending  can lead to deficits and spending interferes with the economy.  And  President Trump is a deregulator and a tax cutter.  So, we want and much  more modest government role.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Larry, thank you.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE:  Thanks for your time.  Always good to talk with you, and I keep  listening and learning.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  You've been great.  You've been absolutely one of the best people  down through the years.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE:  That's where I blew all of my credibility.  Thank you, Larry.   Always a pleasure.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  That was a joke and a compliment.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Thank you.</p><p>Up next, reaction from one of the top Democrats in the House, Congressman  Joe Crowley on his party's message for the 2018 midterms and talk he might  replace Nancy Pelosi as the next speaker of the House.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  A look at the cherry blossoms along the tidal basin here in D.C.,  which have peak bloom this week and were just beautiful.  </p><p>Washington always has its eye on the next election and as we get closer to  the 2018 midterms, many are predicting a blue wave with Democrats taking  back the House and possibly the Senate.  </p><p>Joining us now, New York Congressman Joe Crowley, chair of the House  Democratic Caucus and the subject of growing chatter among Democrats as a  possible replacement for Nancy Pelosi after the election.  He's not going  to like me saying that.  </p><p>Congressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. </p><p>REP. JOE CROWLEY (D-NY), HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIRMAN:  Thanks, Chris.   Good to be with you.  </p><p>WALLACE:  You just heard Larry Kudlow.  What do you think of his arguments  for potentially, potentially using tariffs against China?  And if not that,  how do you propose we stop their unfair trading practice?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, Chris, I'm also a member of the Ways and Means Committee  and so I do recognize there's a role for tariffs in the economy.  But I  think what really it has created is a great deal more chaos.  People really  don't know what the president's plans are or what Mr. Kudlow's plan is as  it relates to China, and the trade war that has now begun, or at least the  initial start of that has begun.  </p><p>I think that's left a lot of Americans with uncertainty about what this -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  What should they do?  If you are not going to use tariffs, how do  you stop behind the unfair trade practices, the theft of intellectual  property?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, first of all, let me just say for the record that when it  came to the issue of China, I did not vote for normal trade with China.  I  believe they were not economically nor politically mature enough to be  dealing with us on the same par.  And having said, I think that's panned  out to be true.  </p><p>But I do think we have to do this in a much more calculated way, and I --  with more of a plan.  Let's have an understanding of what the ultimate goal  is here.  Is the goal to raise the price of products here in the United  States or to lower the price of agricultural products in the United States?   That is the overall goal, because that's what some of the effect may very  well be if China retaliates in this war.  Where is ultimately going?   That's what we don't understand about this.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Donald Trump won the presidency because he convinced a lot of  voters, including a lot of Democratic voters in the industrial heartland  that he had a better idea for how to build the economy, how to get them  jobs than Hillary Clinton did.  Now, Democrats are going into the 2018  midterms with what they call a better deal.  </p><p>Here is Nancy Pelosi on that.  </p><p>(BEGN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Democrats are offering a  better deal, better jobs, better wages, a better future.  A better deal is  founded on strong values that we share.  Strong values fueled by fresh  ideas.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Forgive me, Congressman, but that sounds like standard Democratic  boilerplate.  So, give me one fresh idea that Democrats are offering voters  for November.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Fresh idea?  First of all, Chris, Donald Trump did not win by a  lot of Democratic votes in the Midwest.  It was fractions of a vote that  actually are responsible for him being president of the United States  today.  </p><p>But what I think one great fresh idea is a real infrastructure package for  the American people.  What the president has offered a 20-80 plan, 20  percent from the federal, 80 percent from local governments is not going to  wash.  It's not going to work.  What Democrats are proposing is really an  80-20 or 75-25 plan where the federal government comes up with the  resources for 80 percent and works with local governments to put America  back to work and invest in American infrastructure and invest in America.  </p><p>That's jobs.  That's a bridge to the new economy.  That's giving people the  opportunity to put their kids through college, to afford health care with a  real job.  That's the kind of message the Democrats are talking about.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But let's look at the Trump record on the economy, which  obviously you agree is going to be the key issue in November.  </p><p>Employers are adding an average of 202,000 jobs a month this year.  The  unemployment rate has been 4.1 percent for six straight months.  That's the  lowest level in 17 years.  And wages are up 2.7 percent, the highest rate  of almost nine years.  </p><p>Congressman, a solid majority of Americans, according to the polls, feel  good about the Trump economy.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Show me how any of those statistics the difference of any month  that President Obama was president of United States -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I just said that the 4.1 percent is the lowest level in 17  years.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  It's moving on a downward trend.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But it wasn't 4.1 percent.   Wage growth wasn't up.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Where was it when President Bush left office?  </p><p>WALLACE:  President Bush or President Obama?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  President Bush, when he left office, and President Obama came  from --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I understand, the world is in recession.</p><p>CROWLEY:  Right.  And so, we -- Democrats really moved us towards this job  growth through the sustained economy.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Are you saying the president deserves no -- </p><p>CROWLEY:  I didn't say that.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I'm asking.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  What I'm suggesting is that I believe what this is based on is a  false premise.  The notion of the tax cut is going to lead to somehow help  the American people along (ph) I think is a scam.  I think what they've  done is the desperate need to pass anything by the end of the year.  They  rammed through a bill without fully really understanding what was in the  bill.  </p><p>It was done in a very, very highly partisan way, and I think in the end,  it's the average worker, the middle class, in this going to suffer because  the result of the tax cut bill.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's turn to another subject, immigration.  The president has  ordered the deployment of up to 4,000 members of the National Guard to the  southern border and the fact is more people are attempting to cross the  border illegally.  Just take a look at these statistics.  </p><p>In March of 2017, 16,000 people were caught at the border.  That number  tripled last month, March of 2018, to more than 50,000.  </p><p>Don't we need to stop the surge?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  I think what we need is comprehensive immigration reform.  We've  been talking about this for decades and we just haven't seen it happen, not  since 1986.  What I think is interesting to go back to 1986 where you saw a  comprehensive immigration reform and comprehensive tax reform done in a  bipartisan way.  It was long-lasting because it was done both -- Democrats  and Republicans came together.  </p><p>Here we have a very partisan approach to this.  The president talks about  building a wall, but Mexico is going to pay for it.  Now, he's putting  troops down at the border, a very provocative move.  But at the same time,  it's not really solving the problem.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  You say it's a very provocative move.   Barack  Obama put 1,800 at the border.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  It was to some degree provocative, not in the same breath that  this president has done.  What the verbiage, the language that our  president has used towards immigrants in this nation is really -- it's  abhorrent to me, quite frankly.  It's not representative of who we are as a  nation.  </p><p>So, this president, making this move is different from any other president  doing it quite frankly.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's turn to the midterms.  President Trump says that your party  is vulnerable in November.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats haven't learned --  they still think the loyal citizens who care about jobs and borders and  security are deplorable.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  How confident are you the Democrats will win in November and take  back control of the House?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  We're a long way from November.  Let's be clear about that.  </p><p>But I'm confident that the American people want to bring balance back to  the United States government.  What they see right now is Republicans in  charge of the presidency, the Senate, the House and some would argue the  Supreme Court.  </p><p>Every branch of government seems to be controlled in some way or facet (ph)  by Republicans.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Forgive me.  That was what voters decided.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, look, they have an opportunity here to change course and  correction, that's the beauty of our democracy.  The House of  Representatives, every member of the House of Representatives is up for  election this year and a third of the Senate.  So, people have the  opportunity to bring that balance back.  </p><p>We know that the first midterm election of an incumbent president on  average sees 40 seats swing in the opposite direction.  It's not going to  happen on its own.  Democrats are not going to win that back just simply be  up against President Trump.  We need to be for, as I mentioned before, our  economic policies, our better deal and is a deal are become very clear to  the American people.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  In more than a third of House races, Republicans  running for those seats have run ads that go after Nancy Pelosi.  Here's an  example from the recent special election in Pennsylvania '18.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AD ANNOUNCER:  Conor Lamb is a Pelosi liberal.  His values aren't our  values.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Now, that Democrat, Conor Lamb, won, but one of the ways in which  he won was that he promised not to support Nancy Pelosi if Democrats take  the House and she's up for speaker again.  </p><p>Is Nancy Pelosi a liability for Democrats in this campaign?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  I think it was more reflective of the fact that Republicans are  bankrupt on the ideas.  They don't have anything else to offer except to go  after Nancy Pelosi to win elections.  That's -- if they think, that's a  winning strategy, they're completely mistaken and wrong.  It's not a  winning strategy.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I mean, forgive me, but Conor Lamb apparently thought it was an  issue because he dumped Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Conor Lamb won because he ran a local election.  He talked about  that the cuts that the Republicans were attempting to make and to privatize  Social Security.  He talked about what affect local -- what affect the  federal government has on local politics, on people's lives.  And that's  why he won that election, not because of Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p>WALLACE:  If Democrats win the House in November, will you run either to  replace Nancy Pelosi if she steps down or against her if she doesn't?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, on the first portion of that, I would wait and see just  what happened in terms of Nancy Pelosi deciding not to run.  But if Nancy  Pelosi stays, I don't -- I don't see a scenario by which I would challenge  her for that position.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do you want to be speaker?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Look, I'm focused right now on winning back the House of  Representatives, to be in the majority, to be the chair of the Democratic  Caucus in the majority.  I'm doing that job right now.  I want to be the  best chair of the Democratic Caucus I possibly can be, help my colleagues  get reelected and help when back seats for the House Democratic Caucus.  </p><p>That's my focus and goal.  That's the focus and goal of the entire  Democratic leadership.  We are one mind, Chris, and that is we want to win  back the house.  That's goal one and the only goal right now.  </p><p>WALLACE:  One last question in this.  On top Democrat was quoted as saying  that at age 56, which you are now, that you are a spring chicken by  congressional standards.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, I've had others say that I'm not such a spring chicken  after all.  Look, at the end of the day, we have a very vibrant Democratic  Caucus.  We have some incredibly talented young people.  </p><p>I think people running today like Mikie Sherrill.  She was a Navy grad.   She is running for office in New Jersey.  </p><p>I think of Joe Neguse who's running in Colorado.  I think of Brendan Kelly.   Some great people are running all around this country and we are becoming  more vibrant as a Democratic Caucus. </p><p>So, I think we have nothing to look forward to but good days ahead of us.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Congressman Crowley, thank you.  Thanks for coming in today.   Please come back, sir.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  I'm happy to come back.  Thank you.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the  escalating tariff threats between the U.S. and China.  </p><p>Plus, we'll discuss the president's Pruitt problem and growing ethical  concerns about the EPA chief.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Coming up, President Trump sends the National Guard to the  border.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have very bad laws for our border.  We're going to be doing  things militarily until we can have a wall and proper security.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel what the deployment means, next on FOX  NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But I think we're going to  have a fantastic relationship long-term with China, but we have to get this  straightened out. We have to have some balance. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: President Trump taking a hard line on China,  saying it's time to stop Beijing from taking advantage of the U.S. on  trade.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group. </p><p>GOP strategist Karl Rove. Columnist for \"The Hill,\" Juan Williams. Former  Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards. And the head of Heritage Action for  America, Michael Needham. </p><p>Well, Karl, there's no question that we have a problem with Chinese trade  practices, but is it the best solution to threaten them with tariffs? </p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think so. We have two problems  with them. The biggest problem is, they're stealing our intellectual  property. And in all this kerfuffle over tariffs, we've missed the fact  that on March 23rd the administration filed what it should have done, which  is an action with the WTO challenging from top to bottom the Chinese on  their intellectual property rights. That's where we can win and win big for  the American companies, the American consumer and for the concept of free  trade. </p><p>But tariffs, really problematic. The president said we're going to levy $60  billion in tariffs on the Chinese. Peter Navarro, his trade expert, came  out and said, and the Chinese are not going to retaliate. The Chinese said,  we're going to respond with $50 billion of tariffs. The president says,  this is unfair, I'm going to come with $100 billion worth of tariffs. $160  billion worth of tariffs would be paid by American taxpayers. This year the  value of the tax cut, as estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, is  $135 billion to American taxpayers. Next year, $280 billion. Economic  growth is happening because of pro-growth -- in part because of the pro- growth policies of the tax code. What happens if you take that away by  tariffs? </p><p>He's attacking a problem we don't need to really be worried about. We by  $500 billion from them. They buy $130 billion from us. Let's focus on  selling more to them and we're not going to get there by putting tariffs on  Chinese products. </p><p>WALLACE: Michael, are you as negative about the idea of tariffs and what  impact could it conceivably have on economic growth, which at this point  may be the best argument Republicans have going for them going into the  midterms? </p><p>MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Yes, look, large, broad  tariffs aren't the right way to go. Nobody wants a trade war. I agree with  what Larry Kudlow said, I don't think we're going to have a trade war. </p><p>At the same time, I think the strongest fact the president has going for  him is he's always been looking about for American interests, he's always  been looking out for American security. And for 20 years liberal elites  have promised us that if we just integrate China into the global trade  network, they will start acting like a responsible stakeholder in the  international community. They haven't. And it's been a lie. </p><p>And the president is right to take seriously the threat of China, their  irresponsibility on intellectual property, their requirements that American  companies when they come into China give up their intellectual property and  the vast irresponsibility of the Chinese government around the world,  integrating them into a trade framework had not worked. We need to be  tough. We just need to be smart about how we're being tough. We need to be  targeted. And I think some of what the president has laid out has not been  targeted and smart. </p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, look, I understand the concern about  tariffs. On the other hand, as Michael points out, China has continued with  unfair trade practices, stealing or threatening, pressuring to get our  intellectual property. I have to say, I asked Congressman Crowley that and  didn't get much of an answer. Do you have a specific idea of how we get  them to clean up their act? </p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, first of all, I  don't think tariffs are a trade policy. And one of the things that's  missing here I think in the Pacific region is a trade policy. We had an  opportunity, I think, under the Obama administration of a TPP that was  fairly negotiated. I mean I didn't support that because I thought that it  was missing in terms of protections for American workers, which would have  had a direct impact on our relationship -- our trade relationship with  China. And I think that what is happening now is this sort of ad hoc  imposition of tariffs that's really throwing the markets around. </p><p>Now, do I care about that for wealthy people? No, but I do care about that  for American workers and for retirements and for -- for farmers. And so --</p><p>WALLACE: So what should we do? </p><p>EDWARDS: You know, and so I think that, you know, what we should do is we  should actually have a trade policy for the region that allows us, with our  neighbors and our allies, to stack up against China. And right now we don't  have that. </p><p>WALLACE: If you go to the WTO and, as Michael has pointed out, it hasn't  worked. There was a ruling I just read this weekend that the WTO made about  certain Chinese trade practices. They have spent six years, and they still  are mulling how to comply. </p><p>EDWARDS: Well, I'm not really sure the WTO is necessarily the framework. It  may be -- it's one avenue. But the real framework is our European allies,  which are facing exactly the same problem with China, but we've done  nothing to coordinate a strategy with -- with Europe and with the Pacific  region in terms of dealing with China, particularly on intellectual  property. </p><p>WALLACE: All right, I want to switch to another big story this week, and  that is immigration and President Trump's decision to send up to 4,000  members of the National Guard to the southern border to guard that border.  He talked at one point about a caravan of about 1,000 people coming up  through Mexico to the United States. Here he is. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yesterday it came out where  this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody's ever seen  before. They don't want to mention that. So we have to change our laws. And  the Democrats, what they're doing is just -- it's insanity. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Juan, now under questioning, the white House ended up having to  cite reports of incidents of rate with another caravan back in 2014. But  what about the larger issue and what about the president's decision to send  border -- rather, National Guard to the border? </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, this is political theater  for a man who promised to build a wall that would be paid for by Mexico.  That hasn't happened and you've had some people in his base say, hey, what  happened to your pledge to build a wall? </p><p>The reality is, the border crossings are -- I think it's a 45 plus year  low. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, no, no, no, we --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, we saw the tick up that you illustrated earlier in the show  in the month of March. That's not representative of the long term here. And  the long term is in fact that in terms of border crossings from Mexico,  they too are at net zero migration. This is the reality. But what you have  is most illegals in this country have overstayed visas. They haven't run  through any wall or snuck under a wall or jumped over a wall. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, there's no wall.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There's a -- well, that are -- there are walls in places that we  think. I mean it's not as if we haven't done anything about border  security. But the caravan, the caravan's been coming up as an Easter ritual  for the last five plus years, Chris. And I think what you have here is an  attempt to trigger fear and hysteria over, oh, there's a horde coming at  the southern border and they're coming and they're going to invade America. </p><p>But I think it's all about this president trying to say to his base, hey, I  am putting a wall up, or if I'm not putting a wall up, I'm going to put  soldiers there. Soldiers who, by the way, have no authority to detain  anyone, arrest anyone, no bullets in their guns. I mean it's -- it's a  joke. </p><p>WALLACE: I -- I -- I can see both Michael and Karl with -- ready to come  out of their seats. </p><p>Karl, I'll --</p><p>ROVE: I want to briefly agree with one -- the only thing that Juan said  that was correct, which is the caravan has been going on for a long while  and the Mexicans were fully capable of taking care of them. But the rest of  what Juan said, bologna. </p><p>Look, we -- we have a problem on the border. If you look at -- if you look  at the crossings compared to a year ago, they have doubled. And we are  facing a surge. And the president was right to say to the states -- it was  on an impulse, but that doesn't make it a bad impulse, that the states need  help. </p><p>You noticed -- did you see with the first National Guard unit was from  Texas to be sent to the border immediately after the president's order, an  aviation unit because, what was the first unit to go from Arizona? A  construction unit. There are things along the border that the National  Guard can do in a moment like this when additional resources are needed  that is justified and ample. And I trust the secretary of Homeland Security  to arrive at it and so do the governors of most of the border states. </p><p>We have Jerry Brown wringing his hands in Sacramento as to what he ought to  do, but otherwise this is a useful thing. President Obama did it. President  Bush did it in a similar moment. It's not because of the caravan, but it's  because of a more secular trend that's troubling. The number of illegal  border crossings has doubled this year verses last year.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. I know we're not going to settle this. You can argue  during the commercial. </p><p>WILLIAMS: It's a deal.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, we have to take a break here. </p><p>When we come back, the Trump administration imposes new sanctions on  Russian oligarchs and businesses to punish the Kremlin for alleged meddling  in the 2016 election. </p><p>Plus, the fate of Scott Pruitt. What would you like to ask the panel about  whether the president should stand by or fire his EPA chief? Just go to  FaceBook or Twitter, at Fox News Sunday, and we may use your question on  the air. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Is draining the swamp renting an apartment from the  wife of a Washington lobbyist? </p><p>SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: I don't think that that's even remotely  fair to ask that question. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt pushing back on ethics  allegations against him, including renting a room in a Capitol Hill condo  for $50 a night. </p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Well, Michael, you're one of 10 leading conservatives who sent a letter to  President Trump yesterday urging him to keep Pruitt at EPA. And Saturday  night the president tweeted this, rent for this condo was about market  rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job. </p><p>Are you not troubled by the growing list of ethical concerns about Scott  Pruitt? </p><p>NEEDHAM: Yes, look, Scott Pruitt is taking on one of the sacred cows of the  extreme progressive left, which is that in the debate between job growth  and job creation and environmentalism there is no room for any belief in  terms of anything other than always siding with environmentalists. And  anyone who takes that side should be attacked in a mean-spirited manner.  And that's what's going on towards EPA administrator Pruitt right now. </p><p>In that environment, all of us who take on the left for some these things  should be squeaking clean because you give them fuel to create issues. And  I think Scott Pruitt should not have done many of the things that he's  done, which has allowed the left to sidetrack the discussion from policy  and take it towards the personnel -- the personal and the ad hominem. </p><p>If you compare what Scott Pruitt is going through, to what Obama --  President Obama's EPA administrators went through, Gina McCarthy deleted  5,000 tweets because she wanted to get around FOIA requirements. Gina  McCarthy spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on foreign travel.  Lisa Jackson, the administrator before Gina McCarthy, had a fake e-mail  account to get around FOIA requests. She spent $155,000 on a single trip to  China. And so there's a gigantic double standard. The reason the double  standard exists is because of the policies that Scott Pruitt is pursuing,  and he should be lauded for the -- for his noble efforts on those policies. </p><p>WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of Scott  Pruitt's behavior we got this tweet from 6152Tom. Is there any truth to it  that he is a target, as he is getting the most done? Has made some bad  expense decisions but his value-added seems to be the best of any cabinet  person. </p><p>Juan, how do you answer Tom? </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think there's a real situation here in terms of have --  President Trump having promised to drain the swamp and then you have Scott  Pruitt -- and let's just put aside the policy arguments because I think for  Michael -- </p><p>NEEDHAM: Shouldn't that be what matters, policy --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, not at the moment. </p><p>NEEDHAM: You don't think policy matters?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Let's just -- let's separated it for a second, Michael, because I  think conservative activists and conservative donors and people in  businesses that are affected by environmental regulations just say, well,  he's doing what we want, so let's leave it alone. But can you imagine if  this was any other president and you had a cabinet secretary who was  engaged in this kind of behavior, can't even answer a question from Ed  Henry of Fox News. I don't think he's a -- Fox News is not some liberal  organization out here trying to undercut a conservative. No. </p><p>But what you have is someone who has taken advantage of not only what is a  sweetheart deal, pennies for dollars in terms of that condo, but the condo  being rented from a lobbyist whose clients have business in front of the  EPA. That, on the face of it, Michael, is disqualifying. So we can talk  about policy and we can have arguments about --</p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>NEEDHAM: I am -- I am going to look forward to going back and finding Juan  Williams speaking out about Gina McCarthy deleting 5,000 text messages to  get around FOIA. I am sure Juan was outraged at the $150,000 -- </p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I don't think that's good behavior. But I'm just telling you,  I'm just -- it's shocking to me that you will make excuses for what is  inexcusable. </p><p>NEEDHAM: But you said they were disqualifying. Was Lisa Jackson's $155,000  trip to China disqualifying?</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's -- look, she spent, by the way, on security, much less.  Scott Pruitt spent three times as much. He has alarms and red flashing  things and added -- asking for more people just to get through D.C.  traffic. </p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's ridiculous. </p><p>WALLACE: I --</p><p>WILLIAMS: For a drain the swamp administration? </p><p>WALLACE: OK. </p><p>I want to -- we were going to talk about Russia. We may still get to it. </p><p>But I want to focus now on the breaking story today, and that is this --  what appears to be a poison gas attack on a rebel-held suburb outside of  Damascus. There are reports that dozens of people may have been killed and  even more were hit by this. </p><p>The president has begun to tweet on this subject today and I hope we'll put  up one tweet. Many dead including women and children in mindless chemical  attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian  army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin,  Russia and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad. Big price.</p><p>It's interesting, Karl. There has not been outside confirmation that this  was a poison attack, but it's interesting, one, the president is saying it,  and, two, not only condemning it, but also in maybe the strongest terms  I've never heard him, condemning President Putin's support for Assad. </p><p>ROVE: Yes. The president -- the president is not obligated to act. So  confirm if this was a poison gas attack, which it looks like it was. The  estimates now are at least 70 dead, maybe as many as 150, a number of them  children, all of them civilians. But now the United States will have to act  as the president acted in the aftermath of the sarin gas attack in early  2017. Otherwise, our credibility in the region is going to be greatly  diminished. </p><p>WALLACE: Yes, let me just pick up on that with you because in one of his  earlier tweets he said the reason that this has fallen apart is because  President Obama did not enforce the redline when he was president on --  when it came to gas attacks by Assad. He -- and when the president did  launch that attack, those -- I think it was 59 missiles -- back in the  spring of 2017, he said, if it happens again, I'll strike again. How much  is he on the line now (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>ROVE: Well, he's on the line. And, look, I think there's some -- I think  there is some -- you know, there's some reason why he said -- some evidence  that he was correct when he said President Obama should have acted. It's  unseemly for the president, however, to be reflecting on that, in my  opinion. </p><p>He ought to -- he ought to act. It was one of the most important moments in  the definition of his foreign policy last year that when this attack did  occur he reacted in 25 percent of the air capacity of the Syrian air force  disappeared in a matter of moments. He has to exact another price in order  to send a second signal that just because a year has passed, doesn't mean  you can engage in this behavior again.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to what appears -- and we  need to say it's not confirmed yet -- what appears to be an attack, and, if  so, what action President Trump is going to need to take? </p><p>EDWARDS: Well, the president is the president today. And I think that the  American people and the Congress actually have to engage in a discussion  about Syria that is a moral discussion when it comes to the use, if this is  true, of poison gas. I mean this is a human rights crisis and the president  has an obligation to act. </p><p>That said, over this last year and a half, our policy has actually allowed  Assad, with Russia's help, to consolidate his power. And that leaves open  the door to do these kinds -- to engage in these kind of atrocities because  we think we've rolled back the Islamic States. In fact, what we've done is  we've actually created an environment where it goes underground, it's not  consolidating land, but continues to engage in terrorist behavior and  activity. </p><p>WALLACE: Would you agree that President Obama is much more responsible for  the disaster and the humanitarian slaughter in Syria than President Trump  is? </p><p>EDWARDS: Well, let me just say, I -- at the time when I was in Congress, I  called on the president and supported the idea -- </p><p>WALLACE: President Obama. </p><p>EDWARDS: President Obama, and support of the idea that we should actually  be on the side of the Syrian people who were facing exactly the same kinds  of atrocities. And it's come to this point. </p><p>But the fact is that today in April 2018, President Trump is the president  and it's his obligation to act and not just reflect on what a bad job he  thinks that President Obama did. </p><p>WALLACE: We have less than a minute left. </p><p>Michael.</p><p>NEEDHAM: Yes, look, I think that -- that President Trump should act, as  Karl said. I think that President Trump needs to see things through in  Syria. And I think that we should give President Trump credit for having a  very muscular and strong American policy towards Syria. And, more  importantly, towards Russia, which is backing Syria in terms of getting  anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, the action he took earlier this year in  Syria, pushing forward to put small, tactical nuclear weapons into our  arsenal. And so I think President Trump has had a very strong foreign  policy and he needs to make sure that he continues that, following through  with Syria. </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, John Bolton comes on board tomorrow and we'll see what  happens. But I think Trump has been trying to pull troops out of Syria  without Pentagon approval. </p><p>WALLACE: Thanks, panel. See you next Sunday. </p><p>Up next our \"Power Player of the Week.\" How the president of a major  university here in Washington works the campus like a big city mayor. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Hang around Washington long enough and you see plenty of turnover.  Cabinet secretaries come and go and administrations, and -- and, as we've  seen recently, when presidents change their mind. So what happens to those  former big shots? Here is our \"Power Player of the week.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SYLVIA BURWELL, PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITY: I think the role is a  little more like a mayor than a CEO.</p><p>Hi. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Sylvia Matthews Burwell is president of American  University here in Washington. And she works the campus like a mayor. </p><p>BURWELL: Very nice to meet you both. Thank you both. </p><p>Right now we're passing the library. </p><p>WALLACE: Here was a video in her new job when the school year started last  summer. </p><p>BURWELL: Great to see some students on campus. </p><p>Oh, wait a minute, there's Claude (ph), the AU legend, out for a morning  run. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So I understand you insist everyone calls you Sylvia. </p><p>BURWELL: That's right. </p><p>WALLACE: Why? </p><p>BURWELL: Because I think it's part of being a part of the university and  having people feel like they can engage. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): If Burwell looks familiar, she was a member of  President Obama's cabinet. First his budget director, then secretary of  Health and Human Services, trying to fix Obamacare after the disastrous  rollout, and then dealing with the Ebola crisis. </p><p>BURWELL: So having very large critical issues made it a pretty challenging  time. </p><p>WALLACE: But running a university with 13,000 students and a tradition of  public service is also challenging. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): How much does it cost, tuition, room and board, to go  to AU for a year? </p><p>BURWELL: About $60,000. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Burwell says she's trying to cut cost and find new  ways to help students who can't afford it. </p><p>Then, there were several racist incidents last fall, including confederate  flag posters on bulletin boards. Burwell held a town hall. </p><p>BURWELL: We want to make sure that you know we're taking our steps. We need  your help and support too. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't feel safe here. I don't feel happy here. I  don't feel nicer. I feel worse.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Was that a tough meeting for you? </p><p>BURWELL: You know, it -- it was a tough meeting most of all because of the  pain that the incidents cause. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): One reform, every student must now take a course that  includes diversity training. </p><p>BURWELL: It is about learning to listen from others differing points of  view and differing experiences. </p><p>WALLACE: Burwell grew up in Hinton, West Virginia. Her grandparents, Greek  immigrants. </p><p>BURWELL: There were two themes in the Matthews household. One was education  and the other was public service. </p><p>WALLACE: She followed both paths, going to Harvard and becoming a Rhodes  Scholar. Then interspersing government work with 11 years helping run the  Gates and Walmart Foundations. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): How does it feel to see so much of the Obama legacy,  including Obamacare, being rolled back by President Trump? </p><p>BURWELL: There will be people who don't receive treatment and actually die  because they can't afford the care, the preventative care, or the care  along the way. And so this has real-world consequences for individuals in  their lives. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): But Burwell embraces her new role as college  president, including one game as guest coach of the women's basketball  team. </p><p>BURWELL: I'm undefeated. It was terrific. It was wonderful. I loved it. </p><p>WALLACE: It's all part of seeing AU as a town, and she's the mayor. </p><p>BURWELL: Meeting these students who have so much energy, excitement and  passion, and that is an incredible gift every day. </p><p>But I hope I'll see you around campus.</p><p>Bye.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: Burwell had no experience in academia as either a professor or  school administrator, but she's taken to being a university president like  a natural. </p><p>And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The State Department is monitoring reports of a poison gas attack in a rebel-held town near Syria's capital of Damascus. Video from Syrian activists claims to show victims, including children, getting hosed down. A human's rights group says dozens have been killed in the attack. And we'll stay on top of this story.</p><p>Now to the face-off for trade between the U.S. and China, which has sent tension soaring and market stumbling. In the latest move, President Trump threatened to impose tariffs on another $100 billion in Chinese exports, something that nation has vowed to fight. A trade war without serious consequences for consumers and businesses and investors.</p><p>Joining me now, President Trump's new top White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow.</p><p>Larry, welcome to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER: Thank you, Chris. Thanks a lot.</p><p>WALLACE: You keep saying that there is no trade war, that this is part of negotiations between the U.S. and China. But the Chinese history says there are any talks and says, quote, China is fully prepared to hit back forcefully and without hesitation.</p><p>And here was Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: We will continue to have discussions. But there is the potential of a trade war.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Now, you're a market guy. The markets dropped 572 points on Friday. Clearly, there are a lot of serious investors who think there's a real chance of a trade war.</p><p>KUDLOW: I suppose so. I mean, I know there are some jitters out there. I don't think there's any trade or insight. Just technically, we have taken no actions, you understand that. And even the Thursday announcement for President Trump, he asked Ambassador Lighthizer to consider additional actions.</p><p>It's a long process. Several months here. We put our papers, we take public comments. We then review the public comments and then decisions will be made.</p><p>So far, no tariffs and no action has been enacted. Point number two. I believe China's response to the U.S. actions, which is a complaint against stealing intellectual property against forced technology transfers, I think that's a legitimate complaint, so does the rest of the world.</p><p>But China's response was highly unsatisfactory and I think that's unfortunate. We do have constant communication with them, to be sure. I hope their side picks up on this. But so far, stonewalling us is not the answer.</p><p>Listen --</p><p>WALLACE: And that's what they're doing is stonewalling?</p><p>KUDLOW: Basically. I mean, lots of rhetoric out there, like, you know, old communist party type stuff. The whole world, please, the whole world knows China has been violating trade laws for many years and President Trump is the guy calling them on it and he's right to do so.</p><p>WALLACE: Is the president -- you say he's calling them on it. Is he bluffing or will he impose tariffs if China doesn't change its trade practice?</p><p>KUDLOW: Look, I -- he's not bluffing. I mean, there are a number of tools at his disposal.</p><p>Just one thing there -- people are saying Trump, Trump, Trump. This is a problem caused by China, not a problem caused by President Trump, and I would go so far as to say, Trump is there to fix the problem.</p><p>If you talk to the president as I have, he regards himself as a free trader, all right? As do I. But his argument, and it's a good one, you can't have free trade, which is pro-growth around the world unless China brings down its barriers, opens up its markets --</p><p>WALLACE: But, Larry --</p><p>KUDLOW: -- and stop this technology steal that they're doing.</p><p>WALLACE: Nobody is saying that China isn't to blame here. The question is, the president's response. As you point out, you are a tree trader.</p><p>Here is what you said just last month when President Trump announced his first round of tariffs. And this wasn't an announcement. This was real imposition of tariffs on aluminum and steel. Here you are.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KUDLOW: Tariff hikes are prosperity killers. They always have been and they always will be. Tariffs are taxes and the ones who suffer most are the users.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: So who should we believe, that Larry Kudlow or this one?</p><p>KUDLOW: I thought you might run that. I'm opposed to blanket tariffs and that's where it first started.</p><p>WALLACE: But that's what the president is talking about?</p><p>KUDLOW: No, he has changed his view, even on the national security action. We've got a lot of exceptions and a lot of carve-outs.</p><p>WALLACE: But you're not talking about carve-outs or exceptions for China.</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, hang on. So, I oppose the blanket tariffs, I always do.</p><p>Now, with respect to China, I've always been a hard-liner on China, and while I don't like tariffs, sometimes there is no substitution for putting tariffs into the discussion, into the process. That is part of the quiver of arrows that the president has.</p><p>Look, he's a great negotiator. He has a whole history of that. But in this process, tariffs have to be part of it. There's no two ways about it. Then, hopefully, there will be discussions and hopefully, in just the next two months, the Chinese will come seriously back to the table.</p><p>President Trump has told me, we were together a long time on Thursday and Friday. He likes President Xi. They get along. He respects President Xi as a negotiator, but they have not played by the rules, Chris. This has been going on.</p><p>Technology is everything to this country, everything -- our entrepreneurship, our innovation, our future growth, our productivity. We cut corporate tax rates precisely to unlock the animal spirits around technology.</p><p>We cannot let China willy-nilly steal our technology.</p><p>WALLACE: OK. You said on Friday that you were going to announce a trade coalition of the willing today, other countries that were going to join us in taking on China. Who are they?</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, I don't (ph) -- I didn't make this announcement. I'm just observing.</p><p>WALLACE: No, no, you set on Friday, between 24 and 48 hours I'm going to announce the trade coalition of the willing. Do you have them?</p><p>KUDLOW: They are coming to us.</p><p>WALLACE: Who are they?</p><p>KUDLOW: Japan, Europe, Australia, Canada. They have come to us. The president actually --</p><p>WALLACE: They are not talking about tariffs.</p><p>KUDLOW: Sure they are.</p><p>WALLACE: No, they're not.</p><p>KUDLOW: Sure they are.</p><p>WALLACE: Japan said that they were going to join us in taking this issue to the world trade organization and to object to Chinese trade practices just as free traders have done for years.</p><p>KUDLOW: But if China maintains its third world status, as they have in the WTO, then other countries are free to take whatever actions they want.</p><p>WALLACE: But -- if I just depress this, has any other country joined us in threatening tariffs if China doesn't clean up its act?</p><p>KUDLOW: I can't answer that. I don't even want to answer that.</p><p>All I'm saying is my trade coalition of the willing will put the whole world behind the United States' actions against China, and this is going to have a big effect on China. China does not want to lose face, but China does not want to be regarded as the enemy in trade for the entire world.</p><p>The WTO, by the way, is one of the processes. Ambassador Lighthizer has that in his releases. So, we'll work there. We'll work directly with the Chinese.</p><p>But I want to make this clear: President Trump is a great negotiator. The tariffs, which none of us particularly want, may -- I say may -- have to be part of this discussion and argument.</p><p>WALLACE: OK, I want to pick up on that because ever since I first met we go back a ways. And ever since I first met you in the Reagan White House, you have been an apostle of growth.</p><p>KUDLOW: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: You say that growth cures income inequality. Growth cures budget deficits. But if China and if -- let me just finish, if China and the U.S. slapped tariffs on each other, even President Trump said that could hurt the economy. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So, we may take a hit, and, you know what, ultimately, we're going to be much stronger for it. But it's something we had to do.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: And here's a line from an article: Trump should also examine the historical record on tariffs because they have almost never worked as intended and almost always delivered an unhappy ending.</p><p>Larry, I assume you agree with that because you wrote it.</p><p>KUDLOW: I do. I wrote it. I agree with it. It's still my position. The president knows that. We had lots of conversations.</p><p>But around this action, I'm going to stay with us -- the path to free-trade has to include China acting in concert with first world nations, with (INAUDIBLE) nations.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: Even if we end up in trade were?</p><p>KUDLOW: We're not going to end up in a trade war.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, they aren't backing off.</p><p>KUDLOW: Look, we haven't even enacted anything yet.</p><p>WALLACE: I understand.</p><p>KUDLOW: So, let's go easy on the trade war. We got several months here.</p><p>WALLACE: But you say the president isn't bluffing. You say tariffs have to be part of the discussion.</p><p>KUDLOW: I do.</p><p>WALLACE: So, if they don't back off --</p><p>KUDLOW: We will see. We will see.</p><p>Remember this: the U.S. economy is doing very well now. By the way, at the time, you learned your lesson as well when we first spoke back in 1980.</p><p>WALLACE: I listened.</p><p>KUDLOW: You've been very good on that, I'm proud of you.</p><p>Now, having said all that, we are growing at over 3 percent annual rate for the last three quarters. This is investment spending, equipment spending is booming. Jobs are rising. Consumer confidence is high. Small business confidence is high.</p><p>All I'm saying is forget trade wars. Why don't you just look at the progress of the American economy?</p><p>WALLACE: I --</p><p>KUDLOW: We can take --</p><p>WALLACE: That's the concern though that people have is this is going to put a brake on that --</p><p>KUDLOW: It cant -- it can't possibly. It can't possibly. The sums here are too small. But the principals are very strong. Do you see what I'm saying?</p><p>WALLACE: I understand that but as you well know trade war sometime escalate.</p><p>KUDLOW: Well, I haven't seen a trade war since Smoot Hawley, of 1930s. And even I was --</p><p>WALLACE: All right. I have to ask you to other questions and we've got three other minutes to get them in.</p><p>One of the drags on the market right now is the concern that Washington is going to regulate big tech. Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Facebook, is going to testify before Congress this week.</p><p>Does the president want to see Washington regulate how Facebook uses its users' data, what it does with its users' data and also how it screens ads?</p><p>KUDLOW: Look, I think the president right now will be intently watching the congressional hearings. I think that's going to be step number one. I think he has his doubts whether Facebook has violated protocols, I don't know. We will see.</p><p>I wish Mr. Zuckerberg -- I hope he comes to Congress wearing a nice business suit and shirt and tie, so he will be taking more seriously.</p><p>WALLACE: Not a t-shirt?</p><p>KUDLOW: Right, I'm tired of that t-shirt, hoody stuff. He does run one of the largest corporations of the world, for heaven's sakes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: But we (INAUDIBLE) agree to regulate --</p><p>KUDLOW: We are waiting on Congress. Let's see what comes out of that before the administration takes any particular action.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. Amazon -- the president keeps hitting the company for failing to pay taxes, for its deal with the Post Office.</p><p>Here he was on Air Force One.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Well, Amazon is just not on an even playing field. You know, they have a tremendous lobbying effort in addition to having \"The Washington Post,\" which is, as far as I'm concerned, another lobbyist.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: In fact, the Post Office makes money off Amazon. It doesn't lose money. And Amazon collects taxes in all 45 states.</p><p>So, is this just talk or is the president seriously considering taking action against Amazon?</p><p>KUDLOW: The president is asking that Amazon and all the Internet retailers have a level playing field with respect to tax. And while it's true --</p><p>WALLACE: But Amazon is one of the companies that does have a level playing field.</p><p>KUDLOW: In recent years, they've done much better in collecting state taxes, sales taxes. However, they don't always connect local sales taxes, and we've had too much protection in this area. They are not a fledgling industry anymore.</p><p>So, what the president is saying is raising this issue for discussion. I don't think it's aimed at anybody. We just need a level playing field and you're going to have a court decision very soon, Chris, that's going to make this more explicit.</p><p>WALLACE: OK, I've got a minute left. There is talk this morning that the president may ask Congress to undo part of the $1.3 trillion spending bill to cut back some of the expenditures that were made. Is that true and how far along are you on that?</p><p>KUDLOW: It's playing in the White House. My friend, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, he and I are on -- I'm an ex-OMB guy. I feel his pain.</p><p>We are looking at an enhanced rescission package. I'm not going to use numbers. This is all around town.</p><p>I think the Republican Party on the Hill has finally figured out. It's really not a bad idea to trim some spending because, after all, spending can lead to deficits and spending interferes with the economy. And President Trump is a deregulator and a tax cutter. So, we want and much more modest government role.</p><p>WALLACE: Larry, thank you.</p><p>KUDLOW: Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE: Thanks for your time. Always good to talk with you, and I keep listening and learning.</p><p>KUDLOW: You've been great. You've been absolutely one of the best people down through the years.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE: That's where I blew all of my credibility. Thank you, Larry. Always a pleasure.</p><p>KUDLOW: That was a joke and a compliment.</p><p>WALLACE: Thank you.</p><p>Up next, reaction from one of the top Democrats in the House, Congressman Joe Crowley on his party's message for the 2018 midterms and talk he might replace Nancy Pelosi as the next speaker of the House.</p><p>WALLACE: A look at the cherry blossoms along the tidal basin here in D.C., which have peak bloom this week and were just beautiful.</p><p>Washington always has its eye on the next election and as we get closer to the 2018 midterms, many are predicting a blue wave with Democrats taking back the House and possibly the Senate.</p><p>Joining us now, New York Congressman Joe Crowley, chair of the House Democratic Caucus and the subject of growing chatter among Democrats as a possible replacement for Nancy Pelosi after the election. He's not going to like me saying that.</p><p>Congressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>REP. JOE CROWLEY (D-NY), HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIRMAN: Thanks, Chris. Good to be with you.</p><p>WALLACE: You just heard Larry Kudlow. What do you think of his arguments for potentially, potentially using tariffs against China? And if not that, how do you propose we stop their unfair trading practice?</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, Chris, I'm also a member of the Ways and Means Committee and so I do recognize there's a role for tariffs in the economy. But I think what really it has created is a great deal more chaos. People really don't know what the president's plans are or what Mr. Kudlow's plan is as it relates to China, and the trade war that has now begun, or at least the initial start of that has begun.</p><p>I think that's left a lot of Americans with uncertainty about what this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: What should they do? If you are not going to use tariffs, how do you stop behind the unfair trade practices, the theft of intellectual property?</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, first of all, let me just say for the record that when it came to the issue of China, I did not vote for normal trade with China. I believe they were not economically nor politically mature enough to be dealing with us on the same par. And having said, I think that's panned out to be true.</p><p>But I do think we have to do this in a much more calculated way, and I -- with more of a plan. Let's have an understanding of what the ultimate goal is here. Is the goal to raise the price of products here in the United States or to lower the price of agricultural products in the United States? That is the overall goal, because that's what some of the effect may very well be if China retaliates in this war. Where is ultimately going? That's what we don't understand about this.</p><p>WALLACE: Donald Trump won the presidency because he convinced a lot of voters, including a lot of Democratic voters in the industrial heartland that he had a better idea for how to build the economy, how to get them jobs than Hillary Clinton did. Now, Democrats are going into the 2018 midterms with what they call a better deal.</p><p>Here is Nancy Pelosi on that.</p><p>(BEGN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Democrats are offering a better deal, better jobs, better wages, a better future. A better deal is founded on strong values that we share. Strong values fueled by fresh ideas.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Forgive me, Congressman, but that sounds like standard Democratic boilerplate. So, give me one fresh idea that Democrats are offering voters for November.</p><p>CROWLEY: Fresh idea? First of all, Chris, Donald Trump did not win by a lot of Democratic votes in the Midwest. It was fractions of a vote that actually are responsible for him being president of the United States today.</p><p>But what I think one great fresh idea is a real infrastructure package for the American people. What the president has offered a 20-80 plan, 20 percent from the federal, 80 percent from local governments is not going to wash. It's not going to work. What Democrats are proposing is really an 80-20 or 75-25 plan where the federal government comes up with the resources for 80 percent and works with local governments to put America back to work and invest in American infrastructure and invest in America.</p><p>That's jobs. That's a bridge to the new economy. That's giving people the opportunity to put their kids through college, to afford health care with a real job. That's the kind of message the Democrats are talking about.</p><p>WALLACE: But let's look at the Trump record on the economy, which obviously you agree is going to be the key issue in November.</p><p>Employers are adding an average of 202,000 jobs a month this year. The unemployment rate has been 4.1 percent for six straight months. That's the lowest level in 17 years. And wages are up 2.7 percent, the highest rate of almost nine years.</p><p>Congressman, a solid majority of Americans, according to the polls, feel good about the Trump economy.</p><p>CROWLEY: Show me how any of those statistics the difference of any month that President Obama was president of United States --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: Well, I just said that the 4.1 percent is the lowest level in 17 years.</p><p>CROWLEY: It's moving on a downward trend.</p><p>WALLACE: But it wasn't 4.1 percent. Wage growth wasn't up.</p><p>CROWLEY: Where was it when President Bush left office?</p><p>WALLACE: President Bush or President Obama?</p><p>CROWLEY: President Bush, when he left office, and President Obama came from --</p><p>WALLACE: Well, I understand, the world is in recession.</p><p>CROWLEY: Right. And so, we -- Democrats really moved us towards this job growth through the sustained economy.</p><p>WALLACE: Are you saying the president deserves no --</p><p>CROWLEY: I didn't say that.</p><p>WALLACE: I'm asking.</p><p>CROWLEY: What I'm suggesting is that I believe what this is based on is a false premise. The notion of the tax cut is going to lead to somehow help the American people along (ph) I think is a scam. I think what they've done is the desperate need to pass anything by the end of the year. They rammed through a bill without fully really understanding what was in the bill.</p><p>It was done in a very, very highly partisan way, and I think in the end, it's the average worker, the middle class, in this going to suffer because the result of the tax cut bill.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's turn to another subject, immigration. The president has ordered the deployment of up to 4,000 members of the National Guard to the southern border and the fact is more people are attempting to cross the border illegally. Just take a look at these statistics.</p><p>In March of 2017, 16,000 people were caught at the border. That number tripled last month, March of 2018, to more than 50,000.</p><p>Don't we need to stop the surge?</p><p>CROWLEY: I think what we need is comprehensive immigration reform. We've been talking about this for decades and we just haven't seen it happen, not since 1986. What I think is interesting to go back to 1986 where you saw a comprehensive immigration reform and comprehensive tax reform done in a bipartisan way. It was long-lasting because it was done both -- Democrats and Republicans came together.</p><p>Here we have a very partisan approach to this. The president talks about building a wall, but Mexico is going to pay for it. Now, he's putting troops down at the border, a very provocative move. But at the same time, it's not really solving the problem.</p><p>WALLACE: Wait a minute. You say it's a very provocative move. Barack Obama put 1,800 at the border.</p><p>CROWLEY: It was to some degree provocative, not in the same breath that this president has done. What the verbiage, the language that our president has used towards immigrants in this nation is really -- it's abhorrent to me, quite frankly. It's not representative of who we are as a nation.</p><p>So, this president, making this move is different from any other president doing it quite frankly.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's turn to the midterms. President Trump says that your party is vulnerable in November. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Democrats haven't learned -- they still think the loyal citizens who care about jobs and borders and security are deplorable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: How confident are you the Democrats will win in November and take back control of the House?</p><p>CROWLEY: We're a long way from November. Let's be clear about that.</p><p>But I'm confident that the American people want to bring balance back to the United States government. What they see right now is Republicans in charge of the presidency, the Senate, the House and some would argue the Supreme Court.</p><p>Every branch of government seems to be controlled in some way or facet (ph) by Republicans.</p><p>WALLACE: Forgive me. That was what voters decided.</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, look, they have an opportunity here to change course and correction, that's the beauty of our democracy. The House of Representatives, every member of the House of Representatives is up for election this year and a third of the Senate. So, people have the opportunity to bring that balance back.</p><p>We know that the first midterm election of an incumbent president on average sees 40 seats swing in the opposite direction. It's not going to happen on its own. Democrats are not going to win that back just simply be up against President Trump. We need to be for, as I mentioned before, our economic policies, our better deal and is a deal are become very clear to the American people.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. In more than a third of House races, Republicans running for those seats have run ads that go after Nancy Pelosi. Here's an example from the recent special election in Pennsylvania '18.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AD ANNOUNCER: Conor Lamb is a Pelosi liberal. His values aren't our values.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Now, that Democrat, Conor Lamb, won, but one of the ways in which he won was that he promised not to support Nancy Pelosi if Democrats take the House and she's up for speaker again.</p><p>Is Nancy Pelosi a liability for Democrats in this campaign?</p><p>CROWLEY: I think it was more reflective of the fact that Republicans are bankrupt on the ideas. They don't have anything else to offer except to go after Nancy Pelosi to win elections. That's -- if they think, that's a winning strategy, they're completely mistaken and wrong. It's not a winning strategy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: I mean, forgive me, but Conor Lamb apparently thought it was an issue because he dumped Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>CROWLEY: Conor Lamb won because he ran a local election. He talked about that the cuts that the Republicans were attempting to make and to privatize Social Security. He talked about what affect local -- what affect the federal government has on local politics, on people's lives. And that's why he won that election, not because of Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>WALLACE: If Democrats win the House in November, will you run either to replace Nancy Pelosi if she steps down or against her if she doesn't?</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, on the first portion of that, I would wait and see just what happened in terms of Nancy Pelosi deciding not to run. But if Nancy Pelosi stays, I don't -- I don't see a scenario by which I would challenge her for that position.</p><p>WALLACE: Do you want to be speaker?</p><p>CROWLEY: Look, I'm focused right now on winning back the House of Representatives, to be in the majority, to be the chair of the Democratic Caucus in the majority. I'm doing that job right now. I want to be the best chair of the Democratic Caucus I possibly can be, help my colleagues get reelected and help when back seats for the House Democratic Caucus.</p><p>That's my focus and goal. That's the focus and goal of the entire Democratic leadership. We are one mind, Chris, and that is we want to win back the house. That's goal one and the only goal right now.</p><p>WALLACE: One last question in this. On top Democrat was quoted as saying that at age 56, which you are now, that you are a spring chicken by congressional standards.</p><p>CROWLEY: Well, I've had others say that I'm not such a spring chicken after all. Look, at the end of the day, we have a very vibrant Democratic Caucus. We have some incredibly talented young people.</p><p>I think people running today like Mikie Sherrill. She was a Navy grad. She is running for office in New Jersey.</p><p>I think of Joe Neguse who's running in Colorado. I think of Brendan Kelly. Some great people are running all around this country and we are becoming more vibrant as a Democratic Caucus.</p><p>So, I think we have nothing to look forward to but good days ahead of us.</p><p>WALLACE: Congressman Crowley, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. Please come back, sir.</p><p>CROWLEY: I'm happy to come back. Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the escalating tariff threats between the U.S. and China.</p><p>Plus, we'll discuss the president's Pruitt problem and growing ethical concerns about the EPA chief.</p><p>WALLACE: Coming up, President Trump sends the National Guard to the border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have very bad laws for our border. We're going to be doing things militarily until we can have a wall and proper security.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel what the deployment means, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship long-term with China, but we have to get this straightened out. We have to have some balance.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: President Trump taking a hard line on China, saying it's time to stop Beijing from taking advantage of the U.S. on trade.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group.</p><p>GOP strategist Karl Rove. Columnist for \"The Hill,\" Juan Williams. Former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards. And the head of Heritage Action for America, Michael Needham.</p><p>Well, Karl, there's no question that we have a problem with Chinese trade practices, but is it the best solution to threaten them with tariffs?</p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think so. We have two problems with them. The biggest problem is, they're stealing our intellectual property. And in all this kerfuffle over tariffs, we've missed the fact that on March 23rd the administration filed what it should have done, which is an action with the WTO challenging from top to bottom the Chinese on their intellectual property rights. That's where we can win and win big for the American companies, the American consumer and for the concept of free trade.</p><p>But tariffs, really problematic. The president said we're going to levy $60 billion in tariffs on the Chinese. Peter Navarro, his trade expert, came out and said, and the Chinese are not going to retaliate. The Chinese said, we're going to respond with $50 billion of tariffs. The president says, this is unfair, I'm going to come with $100 billion worth of tariffs. $160 billion worth of tariffs would be paid by American taxpayers. This year the value of the tax cut, as estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, is $135 billion to American taxpayers. Next year, $280 billion. Economic growth is happening because of pro-growth -- in part because of the pro- growth policies of the tax code. What happens if you take that away by tariffs?</p><p>He's attacking a problem we don't need to really be worried about. We by $500 billion from them. They buy $130 billion from us. Let's focus on selling more to them and we're not going to get there by putting tariffs on Chinese products.</p><p>WALLACE: Michael, are you as negative about the idea of tariffs and what impact could it conceivably have on economic growth, which at this point may be the best argument Republicans have going for them going into the midterms?</p><p>MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Yes, look, large, broad tariffs aren't the right way to go. Nobody wants a trade war. I agree with what Larry Kudlow said, I don't think we're going to have a trade war.</p><p>At the same time, I think the strongest fact the president has going for him is he's always been looking about for American interests, he's always been looking out for American security. And for 20 years liberal elites have promised us that if we just integrate China into the global trade network, they will start acting like a responsible stakeholder in the international community. They haven't. And it's been a lie.</p><p>And the president is right to take seriously the threat of China, their irresponsibility on intellectual property, their requirements that American companies when they come into China give up their intellectual property and the vast irresponsibility of the Chinese government around the world, integrating them into a trade framework had not worked. We need to be tough. We just need to be smart about how we're being tough. We need to be targeted. And I think some of what the president has laid out has not been targeted and smart.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, look, I understand the concern about tariffs. On the other hand, as Michael points out, China has continued with unfair trade practices, stealing or threatening, pressuring to get our intellectual property. I have to say, I asked Congressman Crowley that and didn't get much of an answer. Do you have a specific idea of how we get them to clean up their act?</p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, first of all, I don't think tariffs are a trade policy. And one of the things that's missing here I think in the Pacific region is a trade policy. We had an opportunity, I think, under the Obama administration of a TPP that was fairly negotiated. I mean I didn't support that because I thought that it was missing in terms of protections for American workers, which would have had a direct impact on our relationship -- our trade relationship with China. And I think that what is happening now is this sort of ad hoc imposition of tariffs that's really throwing the markets around.</p><p>Now, do I care about that for wealthy people? No, but I do care about that for American workers and for retirements and for -- for farmers. And so --</p><p>WALLACE: So what should we do?</p><p>EDWARDS: You know, and so I think that, you know, what we should do is we should actually have a trade policy for the region that allows us, with our neighbors and our allies, to stack up against China. And right now we don't have that.</p><p>WALLACE: If you go to the WTO and, as Michael has pointed out, it hasn't worked. There was a ruling I just read this weekend that the WTO made about certain Chinese trade practices. They have spent six years, and they still are mulling how to comply.</p><p>EDWARDS: Well, I'm not really sure the WTO is necessarily the framework. It may be -- it's one avenue. But the real framework is our European allies, which are facing exactly the same problem with China, but we've done nothing to coordinate a strategy with -- with Europe and with the Pacific region in terms of dealing with China, particularly on intellectual property.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, I want to switch to another big story this week, and that is immigration and President Trump's decision to send up to 4,000 members of the National Guard to the southern border to guard that border. He talked at one point about a caravan of about 1,000 people coming up through Mexico to the United States. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yesterday it came out where this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody's ever seen before. They don't want to mention that. So we have to change our laws. And the Democrats, what they're doing is just -- it's insanity.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Juan, now under questioning, the white House ended up having to cite reports of incidents of rate with another caravan back in 2014. But what about the larger issue and what about the president's decision to send border -- rather, National Guard to the border?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, this is political theater for a man who promised to build a wall that would be paid for by Mexico. That hasn't happened and you've had some people in his base say, hey, what happened to your pledge to build a wall?</p><p>The reality is, the border crossings are -- I think it's a 45 plus year low.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, no, no, no, we --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, we saw the tick up that you illustrated earlier in the show in the month of March. That's not representative of the long term here. And the long term is in fact that in terms of border crossings from Mexico, they too are at net zero migration. This is the reality. But what you have is most illegals in this country have overstayed visas. They haven't run through any wall or snuck under a wall or jumped over a wall.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, there's no wall.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There's a -- well, that are -- there are walls in places that we think. I mean it's not as if we haven't done anything about border security. But the caravan, the caravan's been coming up as an Easter ritual for the last five plus years, Chris. And I think what you have here is an attempt to trigger fear and hysteria over, oh, there's a horde coming at the southern border and they're coming and they're going to invade America.</p><p>But I think it's all about this president trying to say to his base, hey, I am putting a wall up, or if I'm not putting a wall up, I'm going to put soldiers there. Soldiers who, by the way, have no authority to detain anyone, arrest anyone, no bullets in their guns. I mean it's -- it's a joke.</p><p>WALLACE: I -- I -- I can see both Michael and Karl with -- ready to come out of their seats.</p><p>Karl, I'll --</p><p>ROVE: I want to briefly agree with one -- the only thing that Juan said that was correct, which is the caravan has been going on for a long while and the Mexicans were fully capable of taking care of them. But the rest of what Juan said, bologna.</p><p>Look, we -- we have a problem on the border. If you look at -- if you look at the crossings compared to a year ago, they have doubled. And we are facing a surge. And the president was right to say to the states -- it was on an impulse, but that doesn't make it a bad impulse, that the states need help.</p><p>You noticed -- did you see with the first National Guard unit was from Texas to be sent to the border immediately after the president's order, an aviation unit because, what was the first unit to go from Arizona? A construction unit. There are things along the border that the National Guard can do in a moment like this when additional resources are needed that is justified and ample. And I trust the secretary of Homeland Security to arrive at it and so do the governors of most of the border states.</p><p>We have Jerry Brown wringing his hands in Sacramento as to what he ought to do, but otherwise this is a useful thing. President Obama did it. President Bush did it in a similar moment. It's not because of the caravan, but it's because of a more secular trend that's troubling. The number of illegal border crossings has doubled this year verses last year.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. I know we're not going to settle this. You can argue during the commercial.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's a deal.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, we have to take a break here.</p><p>When we come back, the Trump administration imposes new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and businesses to punish the Kremlin for alleged meddling in the 2016 election.</p><p>Plus, the fate of Scott Pruitt. What would you like to ask the panel about whether the president should stand by or fire his EPA chief? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter, at Fox News Sunday, and we may use your question on the air.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Is draining the swamp renting an apartment from the wife of a Washington lobbyist?</p><p>SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: I don't think that that's even remotely fair to ask that question.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt pushing back on ethics allegations against him, including renting a room in a Capitol Hill condo for $50 a night.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Well, Michael, you're one of 10 leading conservatives who sent a letter to President Trump yesterday urging him to keep Pruitt at EPA. And Saturday night the president tweeted this, rent for this condo was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job.</p><p>Are you not troubled by the growing list of ethical concerns about Scott Pruitt?</p><p>NEEDHAM: Yes, look, Scott Pruitt is taking on one of the sacred cows of the extreme progressive left, which is that in the debate between job growth and job creation and environmentalism there is no room for any belief in terms of anything other than always siding with environmentalists. And anyone who takes that side should be attacked in a mean-spirited manner. And that's what's going on towards EPA administrator Pruitt right now.</p><p>In that environment, all of us who take on the left for some these things should be squeaking clean because you give them fuel to create issues. And I think Scott Pruitt should not have done many of the things that he's done, which has allowed the left to sidetrack the discussion from policy and take it towards the personnel -- the personal and the ad hominem.</p><p>If you compare what Scott Pruitt is going through, to what Obama -- President Obama's EPA administrators went through, Gina McCarthy deleted 5,000 tweets because she wanted to get around FOIA requirements. Gina McCarthy spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on foreign travel. Lisa Jackson, the administrator before Gina McCarthy, had a fake e-mail account to get around FOIA requests. She spent $155,000 on a single trip to China. And so there's a gigantic double standard. The reason the double standard exists is because of the policies that Scott Pruitt is pursuing, and he should be lauded for the -- for his noble efforts on those policies.</p><p>WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of Scott Pruitt's behavior we got this tweet from 6152Tom. Is there any truth to it that he is a target, as he is getting the most done? Has made some bad expense decisions but his value-added seems to be the best of any cabinet person.</p><p>Juan, how do you answer Tom?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think there's a real situation here in terms of have -- President Trump having promised to drain the swamp and then you have Scott Pruitt -- and let's just put aside the policy arguments because I think for Michael --</p><p>NEEDHAM: Shouldn't that be what matters, policy --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, not at the moment.</p><p>NEEDHAM: You don't think policy matters?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Let's just -- let's separated it for a second, Michael, because I think conservative activists and conservative donors and people in businesses that are affected by environmental regulations just say, well, he's doing what we want, so let's leave it alone. But can you imagine if this was any other president and you had a cabinet secretary who was engaged in this kind of behavior, can't even answer a question from Ed Henry of Fox News. I don't think he's a -- Fox News is not some liberal organization out here trying to undercut a conservative. No.</p><p>But what you have is someone who has taken advantage of not only what is a sweetheart deal, pennies for dollars in terms of that condo, but the condo being rented from a lobbyist whose clients have business in front of the EPA. That, on the face of it, Michael, is disqualifying. So we can talk about policy and we can have arguments about --</p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>NEEDHAM: I am -- I am going to look forward to going back and finding Juan Williams speaking out about Gina McCarthy deleting 5,000 text messages to get around FOIA. I am sure Juan was outraged at the $150,000 --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I don't think that's good behavior. But I'm just telling you, I'm just -- it's shocking to me that you will make excuses for what is inexcusable.</p><p>NEEDHAM: But you said they were disqualifying. Was Lisa Jackson's $155,000 trip to China disqualifying?</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's -- look, she spent, by the way, on security, much less. Scott Pruitt spent three times as much. He has alarms and red flashing things and added -- asking for more people just to get through D.C. traffic.</p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's ridiculous.</p><p>WALLACE: I --</p><p>WILLIAMS: For a drain the swamp administration?</p><p>WALLACE: OK.</p><p>I want to -- we were going to talk about Russia. We may still get to it.</p><p>But I want to focus now on the breaking story today, and that is this -- what appears to be a poison gas attack on a rebel-held suburb outside of Damascus. There are reports that dozens of people may have been killed and even more were hit by this.</p><p>The president has begun to tweet on this subject today and I hope we'll put up one tweet. Many dead including women and children in mindless chemical attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad. Big price.</p><p>It's interesting, Karl. There has not been outside confirmation that this was a poison attack, but it's interesting, one, the president is saying it, and, two, not only condemning it, but also in maybe the strongest terms I've never heard him, condemning President Putin's support for Assad.</p><p>ROVE: Yes. The president -- the president is not obligated to act. So confirm if this was a poison gas attack, which it looks like it was. The estimates now are at least 70 dead, maybe as many as 150, a number of them children, all of them civilians. But now the United States will have to act as the president acted in the aftermath of the sarin gas attack in early 2017. Otherwise, our credibility in the region is going to be greatly diminished.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes, let me just pick up on that with you because in one of his earlier tweets he said the reason that this has fallen apart is because President Obama did not enforce the redline when he was president on -- when it came to gas attacks by Assad. He -- and when the president did launch that attack, those -- I think it was 59 missiles -- back in the spring of 2017, he said, if it happens again, I'll strike again. How much is he on the line now (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>ROVE: Well, he's on the line. And, look, I think there's some -- I think there is some -- you know, there's some reason why he said -- some evidence that he was correct when he said President Obama should have acted. It's unseemly for the president, however, to be reflecting on that, in my opinion.</p><p>He ought to -- he ought to act. It was one of the most important moments in the definition of his foreign policy last year that when this attack did occur he reacted in 25 percent of the air capacity of the Syrian air force disappeared in a matter of moments. He has to exact another price in order to send a second signal that just because a year has passed, doesn't mean you can engage in this behavior again.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to what appears -- and we need to say it's not confirmed yet -- what appears to be an attack, and, if so, what action President Trump is going to need to take?</p><p>EDWARDS: Well, the president is the president today. And I think that the American people and the Congress actually have to engage in a discussion about Syria that is a moral discussion when it comes to the use, if this is true, of poison gas. I mean this is a human rights crisis and the president has an obligation to act.</p><p>That said, over this last year and a half, our policy has actually allowed Assad, with Russia's help, to consolidate his power. And that leaves open the door to do these kinds -- to engage in these kind of atrocities because we think we've rolled back the Islamic States. In fact, what we've done is we've actually created an environment where it goes underground, it's not consolidating land, but continues to engage in terrorist behavior and activity.</p><p>WALLACE: Would you agree that President Obama is much more responsible for the disaster and the humanitarian slaughter in Syria than President Trump is?</p><p>EDWARDS: Well, let me just say, I -- at the time when I was in Congress, I called on the president and supported the idea --</p><p>WALLACE: President Obama.</p><p>EDWARDS: President Obama, and support of the idea that we should actually be on the side of the Syrian people who were facing exactly the same kinds of atrocities. And it's come to this point.</p><p>But the fact is that today in April 2018, President Trump is the president and it's his obligation to act and not just reflect on what a bad job he thinks that President Obama did.</p><p>WALLACE: We have less than a minute left.</p><p>Michael.</p><p>NEEDHAM: Yes, look, I think that -- that President Trump should act, as Karl said. I think that President Trump needs to see things through in Syria. And I think that we should give President Trump credit for having a very muscular and strong American policy towards Syria. And, more importantly, towards Russia, which is backing Syria in terms of getting anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, the action he took earlier this year in Syria, pushing forward to put small, tactical nuclear weapons into our arsenal. And so I think President Trump has had a very strong foreign policy and he needs to make sure that he continues that, following through with Syria.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, John Bolton comes on board tomorrow and we'll see what happens. But I think Trump has been trying to pull troops out of Syria without Pentagon approval.</p><p>WALLACE: Thanks, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p>Up next our \"Power Player of the Week.\" How the president of a major university here in Washington works the campus like a big city mayor.</p><p>WALLACE: Hang around Washington long enough and you see plenty of turnover. Cabinet secretaries come and go and administrations, and -- and, as we've seen recently, when presidents change their mind. So what happens to those former big shots? Here is our \"Power Player of the week.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SYLVIA BURWELL, PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITY: I think the role is a little more like a mayor than a CEO.</p><p>Hi.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Sylvia Matthews Burwell is president of American University here in Washington. And she works the campus like a mayor.</p><p>BURWELL: Very nice to meet you both. Thank you both.</p><p>Right now we're passing the library.</p><p>WALLACE: Here was a video in her new job when the school year started last summer.</p><p>BURWELL: Great to see some students on campus.</p><p>Oh, wait a minute, there's Claude (ph), the AU legend, out for a morning run.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So I understand you insist everyone calls you Sylvia.</p><p>BURWELL: That's right.</p><p>WALLACE: Why?</p><p>BURWELL: Because I think it's part of being a part of the university and having people feel like they can engage.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): If Burwell looks familiar, she was a member of President Obama's cabinet. First his budget director, then secretary of Health and Human Services, trying to fix Obamacare after the disastrous rollout, and then dealing with the Ebola crisis.</p><p>BURWELL: So having very large critical issues made it a pretty challenging time.</p><p>WALLACE: But running a university with 13,000 students and a tradition of public service is also challenging.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): How much does it cost, tuition, room and board, to go to AU for a year?</p><p>BURWELL: About $60,000.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Burwell says she's trying to cut cost and find new ways to help students who can't afford it.</p><p>Then, there were several racist incidents last fall, including confederate flag posters on bulletin boards. Burwell held a town hall.</p><p>BURWELL: We want to make sure that you know we're taking our steps. We need your help and support too.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't feel safe here. I don't feel happy here. I don't feel nicer. I feel worse.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Was that a tough meeting for you?</p><p>BURWELL: You know, it -- it was a tough meeting most of all because of the pain that the incidents cause.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): One reform, every student must now take a course that includes diversity training.</p><p>BURWELL: It is about learning to listen from others differing points of view and differing experiences.</p><p>WALLACE: Burwell grew up in Hinton, West Virginia. Her grandparents, Greek immigrants.</p><p>BURWELL: There were two themes in the Matthews household. One was education and the other was public service.</p><p>WALLACE: She followed both paths, going to Harvard and becoming a Rhodes Scholar. Then interspersing government work with 11 years helping run the Gates and Walmart Foundations.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): How does it feel to see so much of the Obama legacy, including Obamacare, being rolled back by President Trump?</p><p>BURWELL: There will be people who don't receive treatment and actually die because they can't afford the care, the preventative care, or the care along the way. And so this has real-world consequences for individuals in their lives.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): But Burwell embraces her new role as college president, including one game as guest coach of the women's basketball team.</p><p>BURWELL: I'm undefeated.

It's the fifth  largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.  The lender was not able to get its  bondholders to agree to a debt for equity offer but according to the Wall  Street Journal CIT does have support for a prepackaged bankruptcy plan  including funding from billionaire investor Carl Icahn.  That could allow  CIT to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of this year.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A big weekend for bank failures as fed sees nine more banks, the most ever  to be shed down one day since the financial crisis begin.  The banks will  reopen today as u.s.  Bank branches after the company stepped in and  aggress to assume their deposit.

The fed is looking to take information from the  meeting and get a look at the compensation trends and practices used by the  companies.  </p><p> We also have some breaking earnings news at this hour as well for Humana.   It looks like Humana is out with the -- it's earning $1.78 which would beat  expectations by a penny.  As far as revenue, it looks like revenue is a  little bit light, 7.72 which is below the expectation of 7.82.  So, keep an  eye and Humana today.

See how they're shaping up this  Monday morning.  And a quick look at futures as we show you Oil and Gold.   imus in the morning is up next.      </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS:  Based on the interview that he did yesterday on his program Chris  Christie -- if he doesn't get elected government in New Jersey, maybe there  is something is wrong.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> IMUS:  Politics -- but -- like Corzine is just a slimy, sleazy, Goldman  Sachs thief, and an arrogant idiot dirt bag.  All of that.  But why do we  need to get into this name calling, Bernie? </p><p> CHARLES MCCORD, HOST:  Well, don't hold back here I-man.  </p><p> IMUS:  Here's what I don't like about, when I got fired, you know, and when  I was coming back to work, this moron -- I wasn't going to talk about this  but I will.  He had some statement about what he thought that I ought to  have to do to come back to work.  And here's what he have to do -- he ought  to kiss my ass.  How does that sound? </p><p>  ANNOUNCER:  Ladies and Gentlemen, imus in the morning.  </p><p> IMUS:  Third day to my mind Charles.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  I will go down in history.  February 15, 2004, when the Yankees  traded for A-Rod.</p><p> MCCORD:  Right.</p><p> IMUS:  And of course, May 8, 2009, when it came back from a hit a home run.</p><p> MCCORD:  Just exploded.</p><p> IMUS:  There was never a doubt in my mind at any point that going back to  February 15th, 2004, at the Yankees for marching on their way to the 27th  world championship.  </p><p> BERNARD MCGUIRK, HOST:  May I just add rocket propelled to their 27th.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  So, way to go A-Rod.</p><p> WARNER WOLF, WARNER SPORT'S HOST:  The name of the law (ph).</p><p> IMUS:  What's the matter Warner?</p><p> (ALL TALKING AT ONCE)</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  The fat boy will be on with Cavuto.  The next governor of New  Jersey, kind of interesting.  Whether you like him or not, it's not a  decent job, and even if he hasn't, he is not a creep.  You know, he figured  out a way to put together $16 billion.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes, he did.</p><p> IMUS:  He said to Corzine that he is a moron.  And we know Corzine is a  creep.  And then I was watching the best of Imus, euphemistically speaking  of course, on Saturday morning on the Fox Business Network.  And half the  time when I'm talking to people, I'm checking my e-mail.</p><p> MCCORD:  I know its ugly reading his e-mail.</p><p> IMUS:  I mean, it's difficult to get me to listen anyway. </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes, sure because that's a God damn thing.</p><p> IMUS:  It is clear I am not listening to a word they are saying.  I was  talking to Laura Ingram when she was going out her notes word by word and  that's people I like.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Stunning that you are able to hold up your end of the  conversation.  </p><p> IMUS:  Anyway, coming up this morning, Big Kenny is here.  </p><p> MCCORD:  All right.</p><p> IMUS:  And he's got his love everybody.  And we will be playing that song  and we don't love anybody.  There is no one.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)  </p><p> MCCORD:  Not a knocked on .  </p><p> IMUS:  You know what is new CD Charles?</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  The quiet times of a rock and roll farm boy.  Which you can actually  plant this thing.</p><p> MCCORD:  No, you can't.</p><p> IMUS:  This is way over thinking.  No, no, no, it's fine, yes.</p><p> MCCORD:  Really?</p><p> IMUS:  But first we want to find out if we can listen to it which I would  think.  </p><p> MCCORD:  What happens when you plant it? </p><p> IMUS:  I don't know.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  You could smoke it afterward.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  Yes, it grows and you could smoke it, you know.</p><p> ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN HOST:  Hey, man.  This is really good.  </p><p> IMUS:  So happy birthday to Big Kenny.  It was his birthday yesterday.  And  his son's name, I think, is not Ford.  It is not Chevy.  It is Lincoln.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Lincoln, OK.</p><p> IMUS:  Or Jefferson.  No, it's Lincoln.  It is Lincoln's birthday today.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Great.</p><p> IMUS:  So, we got him a little cake.  And Cally (ph) said he's already up.   He is cranky but, you know, it is 6:00 in the morning in New York.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Sure.</p><p> IMUS:  Anyway, Jenna Lee is going to have some business news at CIT.  A  thing that I don't understand at all but who else is doing business stuff? </p><p> STAFF:  It's Dagen.</p><p> IMUS:  Dagen McDowell.  She will have some information about this as well.   Warner Wolf, it is not over, right Warner?</p><p> WOLF:  No, it's not over.  Cliff Lee will win tonight two to nothing.   Phillies will shoot out the Yankees two to nothing.  Game six in New York  on Wednesday.  </p><p> IMUS:  Then it's over.  </p><p> WOLF:  Good day.  No, I'm thinking to go seven.  </p><p> IMUS:  Are you down?</p><p> WOLF:  Yes.  This is hopefully at the Seven Game Series.</p><p> IMUS:  All right.</p><p> WOLF: And Charlie Manuel, I mean, I can't understand, he will going to get  second guess forever.  I don't care about three day's arrest.  Cliff Lee  had to pitch last night when you are down two games to one.  </p><p> IMUS:  Now you are down three to one.  </p><p> WOLF:  And now, you're down three to one.  He had to pitch last night.  </p><p> IMUS:  He's going to pitch tonight?</p><p> WOLF:  Yes, but if he wins you're still down now three-two.  He had to  pitch in the fourth game if you trail tow games to one.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, but he didn't do it.   </p><p> WOLF:  He didn't do it.  No.</p><p> IMUS:  He will going to pitch tonight?</p><p> WOLF:  Yes, that's right Imus.</p><p> IMUS:  OK.  Let's have to move on.</p><p> WOLF:  Oh, my God.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCCORD:  He didn't pitch last night so .</p><p> IMUS:  He's going first.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  All right.

I got  smacked in the head by my father a couple times and that attention deficit  was () -- you have got to control these kids by teaching them.

He  said I have short-term memory loss.</p><p> DEITL:  Who was the doctor who told him that?</p><p> IMUS:  I said you are not going to remember that and I just called you a  little moron, are you.</p><p> DEITL:  You wanna know -</p><p> IMUS:  And he laughed and then he did it right, didn't he?</p><p> DEITL:  You wanna know some of the problem a lot of people don't realize -</p><p> IMUS:  But, you can't strike the children.</p><p> DIETL: When you give children these drugs and when they're under doctors  care, they can't go into the United States military.  They will not accept  them and the doctors are not telling these kids and you want to know some -</p><p> IMUS: Military?

It  occurred today near a bank in a hotel in a neighborhood not far from the  army's main headquarters.  Rawalpindi just is a few miles from the capital  Islamabad.</p><p> Police say the explosives may have been planted in a car in a parking lot.   Suspected militants have struck Pakistan numerous times in recent weeks.   In all about 250 people have died in apparent retaliation for the Army  offensive in the Taliban stronghold in the northwest.</p><p> Meantime, the United Nations says spreading violence in the country has  forced it to suspend long term development work in the northwest regions  along the border with Afghanistan.</p><p> Health-care legislation provision would cap an employee's annual  contribution to tax free health care spending accounts running against  opposition now from an odd assortment of groups.  Bills in the House and  Senate would cut off employee contribution at $2,500 for the accounts and  help them all pay for dental work and insurance co-payments or over-the- counter drugs.  And a group called Save Flexible Spending Plans... </p><p> IMUS:  Right.</p><p> MCCORD:  ...backed by insurers and a powerful union now running a print ad  campaign against the cap calling it a definite tax on the middle-class,  particularly people who happened to be suffering with chronic illnesses.</p><p> IMUS:  There is no way to understand that news story.</p><p> MCCORD:  It's crazy.  Absolutely nuts. </p><p> IMUS:  I mean, you... </p><p> MCCORD:  You've got to get into it in a great more -- more detail than we  ever would have time to do.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, Lebron Levin (ph), you read the news to us... </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes sir.</p><p> IMUS:  ... and it's always bad.</p><p> MCCORD:  And it's never good.</p><p> IMUS:  But here is another -- but if you read the news to us... </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  And it's bad... </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  And we can't understand it... </p><p> MCCORD:  And its worst.</p><p> IMUS:  We just know it's bad.</p><p> MCCORD:  That is horrible.</p><p> IMUS:  That is bad.</p><p> MCCORD:  That is bad I-Man.</p><p> IMUS:  Did you have any good news?</p><p> MCCORD:  No.</p><p> IMUS:  Ok, so what else do you have?</p><p> MCCORD:  Man suspected in the fatal shootings of four men at a North  Carolina television shop captured in Virginia.  Police in Mount Airy, North  Carolina say Marcos Chavez Gonzalez was arrested early today at a motel in  Henry County about 50 miles northeast of Mount Airy near the state line.</p><p> Statements said authorities received information about this guy's  whereabouts around 2:30 in the morning and arrested without incident,  wanted in the slayings of four men who were shot late Sunday in the parking  lot of a little television shop in Mount Airy.  They don't believe the  shootings were random.  The men were at the store for some sort of reason  and further details on that one have not been released.</p><p> IMUS:  Who was at what?  Of course they were there for some reason.</p><p> MCCORD:  Well, they say they don't think it was random.  </p><p> IMUS:  But the four people work at the store.  </p><p> MCCORD:  They haven's -- further details have not been released.</p><p> IMUS:  They're not getting their TVs fixed.</p><p> MCCORD:  Who knows?</p><p> And U.N. Secretary General...</p><p> IMUS:  Another news item try to find any amusement in ...</p><p> MCCORD:  No, not at all.</p><p> IMUS:  So let's not.</p><p> MCCORD:  Four dead, now.</p><p> IMUS:  I know.  Ten minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  -- what?</p><p> MCCORD:  It's just that...</p><p> IMUS:  I wasn't going to.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes you were.  If you possibly could.</p><p> IMUS:  Lou, was I?</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> LOU:  You are laughing now for some reason.  </p><p> IMUS:  I am thinking about something else.</p><p> LOU:  Timing then.</p><p> IMUS:  Ten minutes after the hour on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  The  business report sponsored by the Fox -- that's not a funny report because  it (INAUDIBLE) in a TV shop.</p><p> LOU:  That's why I wondered why you were laughing.</p><p> MCCORD:  Just curious.  </p><p> IMUS:  It wouldn't be funny unless it were... </p><p> MCCORD:  No, it wouldn't be funny under any circumstances.</p><p> IMUS:  It wouldn't be funny at all.  Not on some other network like the one  that fired me.</p><p> The business report is sponsored by the Fox Business Network.</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> IMUS:  Time Warner... </p><p> MCCORD:  You might want to hand me the shovel...</p><p> IMUS:  I am just -- I'm kidding.

I'm fine.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Fabulous.</p><p> IMUS:  What does this CIT thing mean?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  CIT bankruptcy means that $2 billion have been lost to the  American taxpayer.  It is not coming back.  We're never going to get it  back.</p><p> This is the first recorded loss of the financial bailout last year.  But I  want to point CIT is going to keep operating so it's going to try and hang  on to all of those borrowers -- those borrower customers; a lot retailers,  a lot of vendors out there.  </p><p> So it is going to keep operation.</p><p> IMUS:  Goldman Sachs stands to make a billion doing what?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Trading, investment banking.  You name it, it's making money  doing it.</p><p> You know what?  You know this morning -- you know who made money?   Surprisingly Ford.  Ford turned in a $1 billion profit for the quarter;  made money in North America for the first time since the beginning of 2005.</p><p> Again, it's really winning out because it didn't take government money.  It  didn't take a bailout like GM and Chrysler.</p><p> IMUS:  Best pickup ever made.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hallelujah, amen on that.</p><p> IMUS:  The Ford F150.  I have three or four of them.  I have three of them  out at the ranch.  That is all we have out there, are Ford pickups.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I took my driver's test in a Ford F150.  </p><p> IMUS:  They made them then?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Might not have been an F150...</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> IMUS:  Just kidding around.  Just a little joke.</p><p> Why was the market down 250 points on Friday?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, concerns about the consumer; about people not going out  there and spending.  We have numbers that people were not going out there  and spending in September.  That is about three quarters of the economy is  the consumers.</p><p> By the way, you have to tee-up that video of Ron Newman, that accident  yesterday.  That was something.  </p><p> IMUS:  I am sure it was Dagen.  Did you watch that race?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I watched the whole thing in my bathrobe with the dogs.   Look  at that.  That was with 5 laps left.  It was a snore, the whole thing.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, for more than 10 minutes I've been listing to the radio.   We're watching a car wreck on.</p><p> Well, let's restrict her plate racing, not to get into a lot -- but the  cars, they can't get out of each other's way.  They race from four  (INAUDIBLE); they're going 200 miles an hour and this was going to continue  to happen until they stop doing that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Beyond that, the race executives -- the Nascar executives came  out before the race and said no pushing in the turns, no bump drafting.  </p><p> IMUS:  You are listening to car talk, girl.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is important stuff.  </p><p> IMUS:  Dagen McDowell on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, talking Nascar.   Business report sponsored by the Fox Business Network -- can you see her  sitting at home in her bathrobe and get gravy all over?</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.  Absolutely.</p><p> IMUS:  Do you smoke, Dagen?  I hope you don't.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can't ask anybody that.  That is like asking if they VD.  </p><p> IMUS:  Do you?  Smoke not ...</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> IMUS:  Well, let's hope not.  What floor are you on?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I am on 12.</p><p> IMUS:  And we're on 3; so we are okay.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm coming down there.</p><p> IMUS:  Get away.  Get away.</p><p> Anyway, the business report sponsored by the Fox Business Network; Time  Warner's Channel 43 here in New York City.</p><p> I don't think this is what Roger had in mind.</p><p> MCCORD:  No.</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> IMUS:  Maybe it was.  Anyway, check out the Fox Business Network.</p><p> It's a quarter after the hour. </p><p> Warner is going to do sports and then Big Kenny is going to sing again.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.

Now the CFO sayings the results prove that the company's  turnaround program is on track and Ford says its near-term outlook does  remain uncertain but by 2011 it says it expects the economy to be  improving.</p><p> Stocks certainly improving this morning; it's up in the pre-market as you  see there on the news.  The CEO, Alan Mulally is going to discuss those  results on the Fox Business Network live in the noon hour.

If you  look at what Mark Teixeira and have done in this World Series it's not  much.  </p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> WOLF:  That's right.  A-Rod 2 for 14, Teixeira 1 for 14.  Game 5 tonight in  Philadelphia, 8:00 on Fox.</p><p> Cliff Lee (ph) with a 0.54 ERA in the postseason against A.J. Burnett (ph).  </p><p> IMUS:  You think they're going to win tonight?  </p><p> WOLF:  Tonight, yes.  2-0; he shuts them out.</p><p> IMUS:  Ok.</p><p> WOLF:  NFL Brett Favre returned to Green Bay.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Brett Favre comes out of the quarterback of the  Minnesota Vikings and you hear the chorus of boos.</p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> WOLF:  Well, when the booing stopped Favre drew four touchdown passes and  the Vikings beat the Packers, 38 - 26.</p><p> Eagles rolled over the Giants' 40-17.  Romo, three touchdowns; so the  Cowboys tie the Eagles for first.</p><p> Dolphins' Ted Ginn Jr. returned two kickoffs, 100 yards and 101 yards in  the third quarter.</p><p> Miami beat the Jets 30-25.  Here was Jets' the losing coach, Rex Ryan.  </p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> REX RYAN, COACH, JETS:  You know my back is on the wall and I am punching - - I'm punching somebody.  I am bringing everything I got.</p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> IMUS:  That is horrible.  The Raider coach admitted it's his wife -- come  on.  </p><p> WOLF:  That was bad.  His ex-wife accused him.  His ex-girlfriend accused  him.  Both for beating them up.</p><p> IMUS:  Road rage, that's what that is, Warner.</p><p> WOLF:  It is.  How about Roger Goodell?  What's the double standard here,  right?  One for the players...</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> WOLF:  No, I'm saying you can never tell if you have the players do it.</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> IMUS:  Oh, gosh.  We're out of time.  Anyway, anything else Warner?</p><p> WOLF:  Well, tonight, the unbeaten Saints will beat the Falcons 31 to 24.</p><p> IMUS:  Ok.

It's time for your \"FOX Business Minute.\"</p><p>Bank of America's list of candidates to take the place of Ken Lewis as  the CEO is looking shorter and shorter after another prospect has  reportedly told the bank no thanks.  \"Wall Street Journal\" says B of A  approached the Bank of New York Mellon CEO Robert Kelly.  He's been  approached before about succeeding Lewis but is showing no interest at all  in the job.</p><p> Bernie Madoff's auditor expected to be pleading guilty.  Prosecutors  say that David Friehling reached a deal with the government and now will  enter this plea tomorrow.</p><p> Meanwhile, in a jailhouse interview, Madoff himself told the  Securities and Exchange Commission that he considers the current SEC Chair  Mary Schapiro to be a \"dear friend\" and that she \"probably thinks I wish I  never knew this guy.\"</p><p> And big news this morning out of Ford.

I just can't get to -- what were you  saying now?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p> IMUS:  Forty-five percent tax break --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> MCCORD:  That's what she was saying, for God's sake.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Your taxes are going up.</p><p> IMUS:  Why are you hollering at me?

Big Kenny says love everybody.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  Of course we don't love anybody.</p><p> MCCORD:  No indeed.</p><p> IMUS:  But maybe he can turn us around.  Please welcome to the IMUS IN  THE MORNING program now from \"Rolling Stone\" magazine Matt Taibbi.</p><p> Good morning, Mr. Taibbi.</p><p> MATT TAIBBI, \"ROLLING STONE\" CONTRIBUTING EDITOR:  Good morning, I- Man.</p><p> IMUS:  How are you?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Good morning, Charles.  Good.  Yourself?</p><p> IMUS:  We're going to have a discussion about Mr. Taibbi's goatee  which we like, right?</p><p> MCCORD:  The vote is in.</p><p> TAIBBI:  You're all making me uncomfortable.</p><p> MCCORD:  Really?</p><p> IMUS:  Well, you've got to be comfortable enough.  We are.</p><p> MCCORD:  Accept the compliment.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  All right.</p><p> IMUS:  We're not coming on to you.</p><p> MCCORD:  No.</p><p> TAIBBI:  That comes later, right?</p><p> IMUS:  He's trying to get you in the limo.</p><p> MCCORD:  Except you do look awfully good.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  Trick-or-treat.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> Anyway, so they've cancelled the elections in Afghanistan.  I know you  and I were talking about that.  We can talk about anything.</p><p> TAIBBI:  I'm happy to talk about Afghanistan.</p><p> IMUS:  I don't know what that means, do you?</p><p> TAIBBI:  I have no idea.</p><p> IMUS:  Do you know what it means, Charles?</p><p> MCCORD:  Just the Independent Election Commission has cancelled it and  declared Karzai the victor during a news conference in Kabul today.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, Duran Duran -- what was the guy's name?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Abdullah Abdullah.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> MCCORD:  Dr. Duran Duran, you're right.</p><p> IMUS:  He bailed out because it was so phony.  And the Secretary of  State said what now?  She said this is just an affirmation that, you know,  the process is -- I don't know, she read something into it.  It sounds to  me.</p><p> MCCORD:  It was a bit positive.</p><p> TAIBBI:  That's his name Abdullah, Abdullah?</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> MCCORD:  Dr. Abdullah Abdullah.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Any gulf statesmen should have at least one double name like  Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  It's a good, you know, Barack Barack Obama.  I mean, it would  work well.</p><p> IMUS:  So in the current issue of \"Rolling Stone,\" you write about  sports logos?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right.  It's actually \"Men's Journal.\"</p><p> IMUS:  \"Men's Journal.\"</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes, yes.  No, it's just sort of event, the commercialization  phenomenon, you know, about how, you know, it's gotten to the point I think  the economy is so bad now that they're trying so desperately to rescue  profits in the sports business that I think they've really gone too far and  they've basically sucked the life out of, you know, the sports watching  process.</p><p> I don't know about you.  I mean, I spent all last year trying to get  that $5 foot long, you know, theme song out of my head.  Every time I hear  it, I want to drive a fork into my eardrum.  I just can't take it anymore.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, here's the -- and the names of these -- be helpful, by  the way, if I did some research prior to Mr. Taibbi coming in and knew  which magazine he wrote in.  \"Men's Journal\" is the one with Tim McGraw on  the cover, by the way.  And he reveals I'm not sure what, something.</p><p> Here's the thing about people like Tim McGraw and these others.  I  guess that's how they get on the magazines but they reveal stuff about  themselves that we don't want to know.  I mean, I just -- it's like Andre  Agassi have you heard about his new book?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Oh, yes, with the whole meth -- doing meth.  And actually he  talks about how meth is really, really, you know, great.  You know, it kind  of resold me on the experience, you know.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> I thought man, I forgot how good that was.  I read those excerpts.</p><p> IMUS:  But there's another excerpt, it's coming in here.  When is he  coming in, Bernie, next week or so?</p><p> BERNIE MCGUIRK:  November 12th.</p><p> IMUS:  OK.  Apparently, remember when he had great looking hair.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right, and then he went bald and yes --</p><p> IMUS:  Well, it was a rug there in the latter stages of --</p><p> MCCORD:  Really?</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Was it like extensions or was the whole thing a rug?</p><p> IMUS:  Well, I'm not sure.  But it was a rug to the degree that he was  afraid it would fall off.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Wow.</p><p> IMUS:  So he says that he in the 1990 French Open finals.</p><p> TAIBBI:  OK.</p><p> IMUS:  There's a reason he lost.  It was his first Grand Slam final.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right.</p><p> IMUS:  The reason he lost is because he was worried about his rug  falling off.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Losing his rug.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Wow, that would have been one of the great ESPN moments of  all time.  Don't you think?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  Top ten deal, it would have been number one forever.  Big clump  of hair there flying on the clay in rolling hills or wherever.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Did you see that Manu Ginobili actually killed a bat in the  middle of a game.</p><p> MCCORD:  I saw that.</p><p> TAIBBI:  The basketball game last week?</p><p> IMUS:  No.  Where did this happen?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Sacramento.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Bat flew under -- and the guy actually -- you wax it with his  hand, and the bat falls on the ground and it's like twitching and dying and  he reaches down and grabs it, no hesitation whatsoever.</p><p> MCCORD:  He walked over and handed it to somebody.</p><p> TAIBBI:  It was the cool -- it was like he knew who to hand it to.</p><p> MCCORD:  Exactly.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Where's the guy you hand the bat to after?  You know what I  mean?</p><p> IMUS:  The bat is in the stadium there or in the arena at Sacramento?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  It starts flying around in the middle of the game.  It was  the weirdest thing ever.</p><p> MCCORD:  It's Halloween.</p><p> TAIBBI:  But not as weird as Andre Agassi's hair falling off in the  middle of the French Open.</p><p> IMUS:  What I'm thinking, how did he -- was he worried about it  falling off in the semifinals.  Great.  Or the quarterfinals?</p><p> MCCORD:  When did he start -- when did it become an issue, a  distraction?</p><p> IMUS:  Yes, you can't --</p><p> TAIBBI:  Well, maybe -- I mean, you've got to think about the fact  that he really only surged as a player after he committed to the whole bald  look.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right?  I mean --</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Maybe -- I mean, that wasn't until like eight years later.   But I mean, still, maybe that was when he stopped worrying about it.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, he never used to be able to finish five set matches, that  whole thing.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Well, it's hard to do after you've been, you know, taking  meth for three days straight, you know.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, I don't think he did for fun -- didn't do it for a lot of  years, did he?</p><p> MCCORD:  One year I think.</p><p> IMUS:  One year.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Oh, OK.</p><p> IMUS:  Now Martina Navratilova wants him to give back all of his --  all of his Grand Slam trophies and so on.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Because he was wearing a wig?</p><p> IMUS:  No, because he was doing crystal meth.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> Will it make you play better or just make you want to clean the  stadium?</p><p> MCCORD:  Swat a bat.</p><p> TAIBBI:  I'm not sure taking meth would make you play better.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes, me either.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  Talking with Matt Taibbi from Rolling Stone.  We're talking  about sports logos.  I was going to mention here at 21 until the hour, when  I watch basketball which is more than I like to admit, I was watching  Shaquille O'Neal and Lebron James, they were playing somebody, I forget --</p><p> TAIBBI:  Celtics probably.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  And Quicken Loans Arena.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  I mean, it's like it's named after a pawnshop.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Oh, yes, I know especially all the different companies that  went out of business in the last, you know, ten years, they're in business  for, you know, a year, long enough to rip off five million people.  They  get their name on the stadium and then they go out of business.  Like Enron  Field and all that.</p><p> IMUS:  And Citi Field.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right.</p><p> IMUS:  Because you know a lot about digressing wildly here, a lot  about Wall Street and that whole --</p><p> TAIBBI:  They should call it bailout field is what they should call  it.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.  I thought -- my wife told me about CIT last night.  And I  thought that was Citigroup, but it's not.  It's different.  CIT is who?</p><p> TAIBBI:  CIT?  That's the business that Goldman got involved with, but  Citi Field is Citigroup.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  So that's not the office.</p><p> MCCORD:  No.</p><p> IMUS:  . that claimed bankruptcy, right, Charles?</p><p> MCCORD:  No.  No.</p><p> IMUS:  That's CIT.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right, right.</p><p> IMUS:  And how is Goldman --</p><p> TAIBBI:  Well, Goldman is getting preferential treatment in the  bankruptcy.  I forget how that all works, but that was like the last time I  was on the show.  So that was weeks ago.  I've been doing so much meth in  the meantime, I've forgotten what that was all about.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> So, I really don't know.</p><p> IMUS:  As long as we're at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, how  is the football coach of the Browns doing?  You wrote about -- you wrote  about it.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.  I took a lot of heat in Cleveland because I compared  Eric Mangini to Augustus Gloop.  You know, remember the fat kid in the  Willy Wonka movie?</p><p> IMUS:  No.</p><p> TAIBBI:  You know, he falls into the chocolate river, right?</p><p> IMUS:  Oh, yes.  OK.</p><p> TAIBBI:  You know, because he's too greedy and Gene Wilder is like oh,  help, you know, save him.  Right?  So I wrote a column because we have a  football column in \"Rolling Stone\" now where I compared Mangini to that's  where Augustus Gloop has been all these years.  He resurfaces, you know.</p><p> And I've been getting like death threats from Cleveland ever since --  they've quieted down since the Bears recent losing streak because people  are turning their anger towards Mangini now.  But --</p><p> IMUS:  Well, the Browns are like one of seven, right?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.  I mean, you know, Mangini comes in and he's like fining  guys $1,700 for not paying for a bottle of water in their hotel room and  that kind of stuff and you do this before even winning a game.  Of course,  you're going to lose.  I mean, these guys are, you know, doing more land  down on TV than Paris Hilton, you know.  I mean, the Browns.  So, it's been  a rough year for Cleveland.  I hate to pick on that city, but yes, there's  nothing you can do.</p><p> IMUS:  How do these guys like Mangini who didn't do all that great a  job -- I guess he had one good year with the Jets, right?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes, he had one good year.  What I thought was interesting  though is that he got his head coaching job after he took over the Patriots  defense for one year which had been one of the best defenses in the league  for years and years and years.  And then he takes it over and it's like  15th or 16th in the league and he gets a head coaching job.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  You know, it's like the Peter Principle.  People get promoted  to their level of incompetence and in the NFL it just seems to happen more  quickly than in other places.</p><p> IMUS:  Why does it happen?  Why would he be blown out of a job with  the Jets?  Why would Cleveland think he's the answer?</p><p> TAIBBI:  I think Cleveland has been trying to, you know, make up for  their mistake of having let Bill Belichick go too early for the last, you  know, five or six years.  So they've, you know, now hired two successive  Bill Belichick lieutenants and Mangini is, you know, he even physically  resembles Belichick in a lot of ways.  He obviously tries to take after  him.  And, you know, he's bad with the media the same way that Belichick  is.  You know, he's a disciplinarian.</p><p> I think they were trying to recapture that magic.  I don't know what  it is.  And then, you know, I think they're probably also trying to stick  it to Belichick by hiring him.  So, but it just didn't work out.  This has  been --</p><p> IMUS:  How long was --</p><p> TAIBBI:  He's cursed, you know.</p><p> IMUS:  How long was Belichick there?</p><p> TAIBBI:  He was there for five years.  He had one winning season but,  you know, he didn't figure it out until of course he left Cleveland which  is what happens to everybody who lives in Cleveland.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> You know what that is?  It's like Buffalo.  You know, nobody who  actually is from Buffalo actually succeeds at life.  It never happens to  them while they're in Buffalo.  You know what I mean?</p><p> IMUS:  It's 17 until the hour.  We're talking with Matt Taibbi from  the \"Rolling Stone\" here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program and \"Men's  Journal.\"</p><p> Where are you on Brett Favre?</p><p> TAIBBI:  I actually wrote a sports column earlier this year calling  for Brett Favre to be chained to a rock in the middle of the ocean so that  he could have his liver pecked out by sea birds for the rest of eternity.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCCORD:  Come on, man.  Don't hold back.</p><p> TAIBBI:  I don't know.  I mean, I'm sure I'm not alone.  I'm just kind  of sick of the whole phenomenon.  Are you?  I mean, every time I turn on  the television the guy is staring back at me.  I thought he gets the mirror  in the house.  You know --</p><p> IMUS:  I was talking to Mike Lupica.  I said who do you want to win  the Packers/Vikings game?  It's got to be the Packers.  This guy can't go  up there and win.  I mean --</p><p> TAIBBI:  But he did, you know.  Yes.</p><p> And actually it's turning into what could have been kind of a really,  really boring and overdone media story.  The only way they could have saved  this is by Brett Favre actually playing out of his mind and having actually  a great year to warrant all the hype and he's doing it.  So I think it's  turning out to be a great thing for the NFL.</p><p> If he had come back and they were four and three and he was throwing a  bunch of picks, you know, it would have been a nightmare because we'd still  be hearing about it just as much but it wouldn't be, you know, worthwhile.   So --</p><p> IMUS:  And one of the strangest resumes of anyone I've ever read, Mr.  Taibbi played professional basketball in Mongolia?</p><p> TAIBBI:  That's right.  Right.</p><p> IMUS:  Professional baseball in Russia.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.  I played for the Red Army.  Yes, yes.</p><p> I actually I tried to play -- the Russians briefly had a professional  football league too.</p><p> IMUS:  Right.</p><p> TAIBBI:  And I tried to get in on that action for a team in St.  Petersburg but it was all these ex-hockey players who didn't really  understand the rules all that well, so I got two.  I got a couple of  helmets in the back in the practices and I thought to myself I'm not going  to do this too much.</p><p> IMUS:  How good did you have to be to be on the Russian army baseball  team?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Not that good.  You know, I mean --</p><p> IMUS:  You have to be able to play.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.  I mean, you had to be like, you know, a good high  school player basically.  I mean, yes, there were three guys that I played  with over in Russia who ended up in the minors in the states.</p><p> IMUS:  What position did you play?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Well, I was a catcher in high school really but I played --  in Russia I ended up having to play center field because one of the guys  who ended up being a prospect in the states was a catcher.  So, you know,  he got the catcher spot.</p><p> IMUS:  And then the basketball in Mongolia, how did that happen?</p><p> TAIBBI:  I was playing basketball in the street in Moscow and I met a  Mongolian guy who told me they had this thing called the MBA, the Mongolian  Basketball Association.  So I went into work the next day and quit my job,  got on the Trans-Siberian railroad and went to Mongolia and found a team.   Got a tryout.</p><p> And I was playing for a team called the Mountain Eagles in the MBA  which is the only league in the world that has MBA rules, by the way.  It  has a 24-second shot clock and a three-point line and everything.  I played  for them for about a year until I got pneumonia and almost died and had to  leave the country.</p><p> IMUS:  You were obviously doing meth then, right?</p><p> TAIBBI:  That was actually pre-meth, believe it or not.  Yes, that was  like in -- that was in my healthy period.</p><p> IMUS:  I got to quit my job here in Moscow and go to Mongolia and play  basketball.</p><p> MCCORD:  Get on the train.</p><p> IMUS:  Are you going to do a book on this Wall Street thing, by the  way?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes, I'm working on it right now.</p><p> IMUS:  Good.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes, yes.</p><p> IMUS:  People still -- Frank Rich, if you can believe this, quoting  your Goldman Sachs line.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right.</p><p> IMUS:  . in a Frank Rich \"New York Times\" column.  So all of the stuff  you did and all the stuff you learned is certainly worth a book.</p><p> TAIBBI:  I hope so.  You know, one of the problems I'm finding though  is that the public has a very, very limited appetite for the Wall Street  story.  They're interested in it just long enough to get upset about it but  --</p><p> IMUS:  Here's why they'll like yours.  I'm telling you I'm being  serious, why we like you, why I like you.  Because you're willing to say  awful things about these people and you're willing to call them awful  names.</p><p> MCCORD:  Like people getting their liver pecked out on a remote  island.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.  And you're a great writer and you're willing to resort to  physical humor.  And that appeals to me and my 11-year-old son.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> All right, Matt, thank you very much.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Thanks a lot, I-Man.</p><p> IMUS:  Matt Taibbi, \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Men's Journal.\" It's 13 until  the hour.</p><p> MUSIC:  IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time now for a  business update from the FOX Business Network.  Here's Connell McShane.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Time for your \"FOX Business Minute.\" AIG dropping its plans  to sell some Japanese units.  According to this morning's \"Wall Street  Journal,\" AIG is now going to keep two of the three life insurance units it  initially had tried to sell.  And this fits in with the plan set forward by  the CEO, Robert Benmosche, when he took over in August.  AIG still owes the  government, remember, some 85 billion dollars.</p><p> The liquidation of Lehman Brothers continues with the sale of more  than a million dollars worth of art.  Two hundred eighty-three lots brought  in a total $1.35 million.  Nearly twice the expectations that some had for  this art work, which once hung in the walls of Lehman's corporate offices  right here in New York City.  The money hardly puts a dent in the 250  billion that Lehman still owes to its creditors</p><p> And this morning in case you missed it, Ford is already out with its  third quarter results way above expectations.  They earned 26 cents a share  when they were expected to have lost money.  $30.9 billion in revenue, also  better than expected.</p><p> Stock up in pre-market.  Ford with its turnaround plan on track  according to the company.  And in the next hour, we'll have more earnings  coming out.

It's his birthday yesterday.  And his son,  adorable little child, 4 years old.  Lincoln it's his birthday today.  It  was Kinky Friedman's birthday yesterday as well.</p><p> Rob and Tony are here.  How are you guys?</p><p> ROB BARTLETT:  We're fine.</p><p> TONY POWELL:  Good.</p><p> IMUS:  What's on your mind, Tony.</p><p> POWELL:  Well, now, this little girl, Abigail Breslin, the child that  played in \"Little Miss Sunshine\" has been cast in the Broadway revival of  \"The Miracle Worker,\" the Helen Keller Story.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> POWELL:  That little blind, deaf Helen Keller.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> POWELL:  Well, there's a little problem because the Alliance for  Inclusion, a group that advocates for disabled actors wants them to cast a  blind deaf actress to play little Helen Keller.  And I'm just thinking  they've lost their minds.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> POWELL:  Can you imagine how much money that cost in rehearsal just  the rehearsal time alone?</p><p> IMUS:  No, Tony.</p><p> POWELL:  How many times would the director have to yell cut is my  point?</p><p> IMUS:  Well, there's a way -- isn't there a way they do that?</p><p> POWELL:  I don't know.  I can't even imagine it.  First of all, think  about Broadway.  You've been to Broadway.  Have a blackout, you know, at  the end of a scene.  That girl is still standing there.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> She wouldn't know.</p><p> IMUS:  This is not that funny, Tony.</p><p> POWELL:  It is.  I mean --</p><p> IMUS:  I'm happy this is not racial this time.</p><p> POWELL:  Well, no.</p><p> IMUS:  Whining about something -- blaming me and Rob for something.</p><p> POWELL:  I don't blame Rob.  I advocate for all people with all kinds  of issues.</p><p> IMUS:  No, you don't.</p><p> POWELL:  Yes, I do.</p><p> IMUS:  Most of the time you don't.</p><p> POWELL:  I mean I understand.  I mean, again, I just have a problem  with this.  I mean, you know, when you cast a play, you cast the best actor  available.  I mean, you wouldn't cast a stutterer to play Hamlet.  That's a  long show.</p><p> You go for a Sunday matinee, you don't leave until Tuesday.  That's  just stupid.</p><p> IMUS:  Right.</p><p> POWELL:  I'm just saying.  Man, that's all.  That's my only point.   That's it.</p><p> IMUS:  Be a convoy of news trucks out here today.  Because you know  what I'd be happy?  For once they won't be here for me.</p><p> POWELL:  I'm not.</p><p> IMUS:  They'll be here for you.</p><p> MUSIC:  Imus, Imus, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p> IMUS:  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hey there.</p><p> IMUS:  Did you get --</p><p> IMUS:  Go ahead.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Did you get your hair fixed and everything?</p><p> IMUS:  Well, I think I did.  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It looks good.</p><p> MCCORD:  Oh, God.</p><p> IMUS:  I have a little mirror here that Cavuto got me so I can check  it every once in a while.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Curtains on the Titanic.  Oh, man.</p><p> IMUS:  I don't need those kinds of comments from you, Bernard.  You  look like Casper the ghost grandfather.  I mean, just butt out.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCGUIRK:  What?</p><p> IMUS:  What's the big business news this morning?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're going to be -- we're going to be watching personal  spending and income.  It comes out at the bottom of the hour.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> How do I follow up?  Well, speaking of Casper, at least Bernie doesn't  need to buy a costume for tomorrow, right?</p><p> IMUS:  No, he doesn't.  But don't start in on him.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Wait a minute.  You're in trouble.</p><p> IMUS:  You're in trouble.  Hold down a second.  It's just better if  you just don't say anything to him.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  I wonder above the fence line.  I wonder what's happening  here.</p><p> IMUS:  It's just like poking a -- it's just like taking a sharp stick  and poking a lion.  Right, Charles?</p><p> MCCORD:  Exactly.  God almighty.</p><p> IMUS:  Digressing like a drunk at a Christmas party.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p> IMUS:  Where's your husband from?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Born and raised in New York City.</p><p> IMUS:  Really?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  So --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  His parents are artists.  Now they live up in the woods in  Massachusetts on a dirt road, and they are as left as they come.  Nancy  Pelosi is not liberal enough for them.</p><p> IMUS:  What -- what do they -- how was that when he brought you home?</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Hey, look, Morticia Adams is here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Here we go.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's actually pretty good.  That's pretty good.  I've  gone as Morticia because I don't have a buy a costume.  I got a closet full  of black clothes.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  There you go.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I've got the complexion of a flounder.  There you go.</p><p> IMUS:  You're firing me.  Thank you very much, Dagen.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DON IMUS, HOST: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time now for a  business update.  From the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.  </p><p> JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, everybody.  Coming up on IMUS  IN THE MORNING, Big Kenny, of Big and Rich fame, will be back with Imus  this morning to play some music and talk a little bit to us.  So we're  looking forward to that.  Let's talk a little bit about some business news  now with your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p> CIT Group filing for bankruptcy.  It's the fifth largest bankruptcy in U.S.  history.  The lender was unable to get its bondholders to agree to a debt  for equity offer.  But according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" CIT does  have support for a prepackaged bankruptcy plan, including funding from  billionaire investor Carl Icahn.  This could allow CIT to emerge from  bankruptcy by the end of the year.  </p><p> It was certainly a big weekend for bank failures as feds seized nine more  banks.  The most ever to be shut down in one day since the financial crisis  began.  The banks will reopen today as U.S. bank branches after the company  steps in and agrees to assume their deposits.  They have and they will.   This brings the total of bank failures so far this year to 115.  </p><p> In other banking news, executives from the country's 28 largest banks are  meeting with Federal Reserve officials today to discuss compensation, as  well as regulation.  The Fed is looking to take information from the  meeting and get a look at the compensation trends, as well as practices  used by the companies.  </p><p> We also have some breaking earnings news at this hour.  Sysco, which is  Sysco with an s, the food company, not Cisco the big tech company.  It  looks like 55 cents are their earnings coming in.  That would be a dime  better than expectations.  We're going to continue to look through and see  if we have a revenue call here, which looks like we do, $9.08.  That's  slightly, just slightly, below the expectation of $9.1 billion.  So it  looks like a beat for earnings per share.  A little bit miss or a little  bit light on revenue.  </p><p> That's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"  When you log on this morning, go  download the new Fox Business app.  It's the only app that notifies you  when your stock hits the target price you want.

You have more IMUS IN THE  MORNING coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> IMUS: By the way, about Chris Christie, politics aside, because I don't  believe any of them, I mean, look what Obama said he was going to do when  he got -- and he doesn't -- now he hasn't got any intention of doing any of  it.  But it's good he's there.  It's good for this country.  It's good for  the world.  Same with that fat boy from New Jersey.  I mean that boy got a  great sense of humor.  Got a good answer on vaccinations.  And, I mean, you  know, the other guy is just a creep.  I can -- but here's what I don't --  and Christie's right.  If I'm fat, man up and call me fat, bitch, you know.   I mean, what is that about? </p><p> CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS SHOW: Let's go.  Bring it on.  </p><p> BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS SHOW: Don't beat around the bagel or whatever.  </p><p> IMUS: Jon Corzine is a slimy, thieving, Goldman Sachs, gutless, paying his  girlfriend on the side weasel.  </p><p> MCGUIRK: A proven failure.  </p><p> IMUS: Yes, exactly.  Bernie is it for politics.  I'm in it for the fat boy.   How bad could the fat boy be? </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p> IMUS: Five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program,  on the radio all over the country and on the Fox Business Network.  Jenna  Lee, Dagen McDowell, Warner Wolf, Chuck, Bernie, Lou, and then Big Kenny  all coming up.  </p><p> MCCORD: Great.  </p><p> IMUS: What do the numbers show in the race in New Jersey, Charles? </p><p> MCCORD: Still within the statistical margin of error, I-man.  Very close.   A dead heat.  </p><p> IMUS: Bernie?  </p><p> MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p> IMUS: Any hopeful signs? </p><p> MCGUIRK: Well, yes, Obama was there yesterday and he's not exactly helping  out.  Carries around a lot of baggage.  That's hopeful.  </p><p> IMUS: Why would the president -- whether you approve of his policies or  not, is a decent moral guy -- why would he campaign for some dirt bag like  Jon Corzine?  Or was he? </p><p> MCGUIRK: It would just -- it's going to reflect poorly on the president if  the three national races -- if he loses all three.  If the Democrats lose  all three at this particular time.  So he needs one victory here and he  thinks he can get it in New Jersey.  And that's why he's going all out for  the Goldman Sachs thug.  </p><p> IMUS: Well, we know that Corzine doesn't know what he's doing.  And here's  how you know -- here's how you know he doesn't know what he's doing.  </p><p> MCCORD: Break it down.  </p><p> IMUS: Read \"The New York Times\" yesterday and Mayor Bloomberg, whether you  like him or not, is one, not a creep, and, two, not a dummy.  But you know  who he said was a dummy.  </p><p> MCCORD: Who? </p><p> IMUS: Corzine.  The boy is stupid.</p><p> MCGUIRK: He said that? </p><p> IMUS: Essentially.  Implied that.  Did you read it? </p><p> MCGUIRK: No.  </p><p> IMUS: Well, no, he said he was a moron.  </p><p> MCGUIRK: It just sounds -- it just sounds like something you would say.   Corzine's a moron.  It doesn't sound like something Bloomberg would say.  </p><p> IMUS: I'm paraphrasing the mayor.  </p><p> MCGUIRK: Oh.</p><p> IMUS: But he said he didn't -- they didn't -- he didn't appear to know --  he didn't appear to know what he was doing.  </p><p> MCGUIRK: And essentially they're both doing the same thing, which is buying  the election, or trying to, using their own money.  </p><p> IMUS: Well, but you could make a case that Bloomberg has done a much better  job in New York City than Corzine has done in New Jersey, couldn't you? </p><p> MCGUIRK: No question.  Without a doubt.  </p><p> IMUS: Well, that's Bloomberg's point.  I know you don't like Bloomberg, and  that's fine, but he's not a creep.  That's why -- he doesn't creep you out.   And . . .</p><p> MCGUIRK: No ethical stains on his record (ph).</p><p> IMUS: Right, and he's done -- he's done a decent job and he's . . .</p><p> MCGUIRK: And he made his money legitimately, not . . .</p><p> IMUS: He's not a criminal and a gangster.  </p><p> MCGUIRK: Right.</p><p> IMUS: Maybe we're going too far, huh? </p><p> MCCORD: No.  No, you haven't gone too far at all.  </p><p> IMUS: And a thug like Corzine.</p><p> MCCORD: No.  Go farther.</p><p> IMUS: So we're for the fat boy . . .</p><p> MCCORD: Further.</p><p> IMUS: Who, by the way, the fat boy we're just hoping, at least he's -- he  appears to be OK.  And what I liked about him, he has a decent sense of  humor.  He didn't appear to be a complete, total phony.  He's not going to  cut taxes and he's not going to clean up corruption in New Jersey.  And  here's -- one, we don't want it cleaned up.  </p><p> MCCORD: It's Jersey for God's sakes.  </p><p> IMUS: It's New Jersey.  Leave it.  It's working fine.  That part of it is  working fine.  </p><p> MCCORD: Badabing.</p><p> MCGUIRK: Atmosphere.  </p><p> IMUS: And the tax thing, just don't raise taxes and we'll be happy with  you.  So -- and plus it will make me look great.  I mean, I'll be leading  Jeff Greenfield around the studio here with a wire coat hanger around his  neck.  You know what I'm saying?</p><p> MCCORD: Exactly.  </p><p> IMUS: Will that little lupica (ph) be in here tomorrow.  That little  liberal panty waste.  We'll be slapping him around too.</p><p> So, all right, time for a little news now.  And here with that is Charles  McCord.  </p><p> Good morning, Chuck.</p><p> MCCORD: Good morning, I-man.</p><p> Suicide bomber aboard a motorbike has killed 30 people, injured 45 today  outside a bank near Pakistan's capital.  This reporter's on the scene there  in the city of Rawalpindi.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Security is generally very, very tight in this area, but  police officials on the site said that it is very difficult to stop suicide  bombers.  This motorcycle rider just happened -- came up to the bank and  blew himself up.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCCORD: And now the continuing violence in Pakistan, some 250 people killed  in recent attacks, is prompting the United Nations to suspend long-term  development work in the northwestern regions along the border with  Afghanistan.  </p><p> Afghanistan's election commission says Saturday's presidential runoff  cancelled now that Dr.  Abdullah Abdullah . . .</p><p> IMUS: What?  What?  What?</p><p> MCCORD: They've called off the runoff now that Abdullah Abdullah has  dropped out of the race.  Abdullah says that he decided to get out because  he believes there just will be massive voter fraud again and he wants the  Afghani people to move on.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABDULLAH ABDULLAH, FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER OF AFGHANISTAN: Only and purely  to the interest of the people of Afghanistan and to give the people of  Afghanistan a chance to -- to move on.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCCORD: So that's it.  There won't be a runoff.  And Afghanistan's election  commission has cancelled the vote and proclaimed President Hamid Karzai  victor of the nation's tumultuous ballot.  Karzai's challenger Abdullah  Abdullah having dropped out and they say that's it.  </p><p> IMUS: Looks like Pat Cadel (ph), doesn't he? </p><p> LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: Yes.  Separated at birth.  </p><p> IMUS: Uh-huh.</p><p> MCGUIRK: That's a Halloween picture right there.</p><p> IMUS: Wasn't Pat Cadel a Hollywood guy I always said his nose always  stuffed up every time he was on TV.  But, yes.  Is that Abdullah Abdullah  or Pat Cadel? </p><p> MCGUIRK: That's Abdullah, but it's tough to tell the difference.  </p><p> IMUS: Yes.  Don't they look almost like separated at birth?  Like Cavuto  and that -- well, that's unfair.  And Cavuto will be on this program  tomorrow, by the way.  </p><p> MCCORD: OK.  Good.</p><p> MCGUIRK: Like you and Betty White, how about that? </p><p> IMUS: I don't think it's helpful . . .  </p><p> MCGUIRK: I'm just sticking up for my man Neil.  </p><p> IMUS: To say hurtful things to a cancer patient, do you? </p><p> MCGUIRK: No, it's not.  </p><p> IMUS: OK.</p><p> MCCORD: Oh, God.</p><p> IMUS: Chuck continues.  </p><p> MCCORD: Independent health advisors will begin monitoring the safety of the  swine flu vaccine today.  Specialists are not expecting problems -- doesn't  mean that -- because the vaccine is made the same way as the regular winter  flu vaccine.  </p><p> IMUS: Oh, come on.  Come on here.  </p><p> MCCORD: But the government is now taking these extra steps, I-man, to track  the health of millions who are going to get the shot in order to spot any  problems quickly and also to explain anything that crops up, like a false  alarm when common disorders coincide with having gotten the inoculation.  </p><p> IMUS: Guess who's not going to get one of these? </p><p> MCCORD: Who's that? </p><p> IMUS: Me.  </p><p> MCCORD: Meanwhile, White House Senior Advisor David Axelrod says there will  be 10 more million doses of the vaccine available by the end of this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID AXELROD, SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: We have 28 -- I'm sorry,  40 million doses.  We had 28 million as of last week.  It's growing every  day.  We expect to get 10 million this week.  And we're catching up  quickly.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> IMUS: I don't know if it works, one.  Don't know -- one, don't know if it  works.  And, two, don't even know if the vaccine is safe, do they?  Do  they? </p><p> MCCORD: Well . . .</p><p> IMUS: And then here's an e-mail I got from Deirdre Imus.  You know here,  right?</p><p> MCCORD: Yes, I do.</p><p> IMUS: OK.  She says -- now this is great.  When did I received this, 6:49  a.m.  And she writes, Bo is right.  Well, now you can't win that argument,  can you? </p><p> MCCORD: With her?  What argument can you win with her? </p><p> IMUS: Well, no, but . . .</p><p> MCCORD: Good Lord.</p><p> IMUS: Eight million kids are all -- well, he was talking about this medical  child abuse.  </p><p> MCCORD: Yes.</p><p> IMUS: Where almost every kid who comes to the ranch -- there have been a  thousand through there -- almost every kid is on something.  Some kind of  mood altering deal.  Ritalin or some other nonsense.  And they put them on  it.  And do you know why they put them on it, Charles? </p><p> MCCORD: How come? </p><p> IMUS: Because nobody wants to spend any time with them to help them deal  with it.  </p><p> MCCORD: Yes.</p><p> IMUS: So it's a lot easier rather than to find some sort of cure or to --  or to -- or spend time with them or get them on a decent diet, or get them  some exercise, or whatever, I mean, obviously there are cases where it is  needed, but almost 90 percent of the cases is not.  So it's just easier to  give them a drug, isn't it? </p><p> MCCORD: Over medicate them.  </p><p> IMUS: That's right.  </p><p> MCCORD: Shoot 'em up and ship 'em out.  Basically what it is.</p><p> IMUS: I like that.  But, I mean, I don't like that, but I like the phrase.</p><p> MCCORD: All right.</p><p> IMUS: OK.  Time now for the Fox Business Network business report.  And here  with that is Dagen McDowell.  </p><p> Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.  </p><p> IMUS: How are you? </p><p> MCDOWELL: Fabulous.  </p><p> IMUS: So I said to Jenna Lee earlier this morning, off the air, I said, I  wouldn't want to be at a party with Liz Claman and Dagen McDowell.  I think  that could be dangerous.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: Why? </p><p> IMUS: I don't know.  I just think three drinks, you both are on the table.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: Liz is a tea totaller (ph).</p><p> IMUS: She is?</p><p> MCDOWELL: But she's a -- she is fun, though.  She is fun.  </p><p> IMUS: She's a nice woman.  I like her.  And we like you, too, by the way.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: Well, thank you.  </p><p> IMUS: What's going on in -- well, wherever?</p><p> MCDOWELL: Well, where I am . . .</p><p> IMUS: Wall Street or main street or . . .</p><p> MCDOWELL: Where I'm locked in.</p><p> IMUS: Hey, wouldn't you read a Wall Street book by Matt Taibbi? </p><p> MCDOWELL: Yes, I would.  </p><p> IMUS: Not me.  And why?  Because he drops the f-bomb a lot.  And, two, he  will say horrible things personally about everybody on Wall Street.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: What was it . . .</p><p> IMUS: Fat, unattractive people.</p><p> MCDOWELL: What did he say about Favre?  Having his liver eaten out by  piranhas?  What was it? </p><p> MCCORD: Pecked out by birds on a . . .</p><p> IMUS: Oh, well, he wanted Brett Favre tied to a rock in the middle of the  ocean and wanted his liver pecked out by seagulls or -- well, it was  something, yes.  Oh, yes, I mean, that's what we want.  That's a Wall  Street book we will read.  </p><p> Anyway, what's going on? </p><p> MCDOWELL: Absolutely.</p><p> Speaking of Liz Claman, she's going to be interviewing the CEO of Ford,  Alan Mulally, coming up in the noon hour today.  And that's -- there's  going to be a lot to talk about because Ford . . .</p><p> IMUS: How does she get all these interviews, I wonder?  Like Warren --  well, Warren Buffett's got the hots for her, I know that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: Because she works her you know what off.  She stays in contact  with them.  She stays on top of the news.  She is one of the hardest  working woman I know.  </p><p> IMUS: Kind of like a Barbara Walters deal.  Except with Barbara Walters,  Barbara slept with all of them.  And I can say that because Barbara's my  friend.  So . . .</p><p> MCGUIRK: Was your friend.</p><p> MCDOWELL: Liz . . .</p><p> IMUS: What did you say?</p><p> MCGUIRK: Was your friend.</p><p> IMUS: Well, no, she even -- Barbara, she understands what she did.</p><p> MCGUIRK: Is that how you got on the show?  Please.</p><p> IMUS: Yes.  </p><p> Anyway, what were you going to say now, Dagen? </p><p> MCDOWELL: Liz is going to be talking with the CEO of ford.  She's going to  have a lot to talk about because Ford produced almost a $1 billion profit  in the most recent quarter.  Nobody expected that.  Incredible turnaround  for the company.  And didn't take taxpayer dollars.  Didn't go bankrupt  like General Motors and Chrysler.  So there's going to be -- but that's  hurting Ford actually because the unions turned down these wage cuts.  The  union, the UAW at Ford said no way to more concessions, which they gave to  GM and Chrysler.  </p><p> IMUS: Charles and I are rolling our eyes.  </p><p> MCCORD: No we're not.  </p><p> IMUS: Yes, we are.</p><p> MCCORD: Don't include me.  I think that's interesting.</p><p> IMUS: No, no, she was talking.  You're lying.  </p><p> MCCORD: For God's sake.</p><p> IMUS: You are lying.</p><p> MCCORD: I am absolutely not.  </p><p> IMUS: She was talking and you were rolling your eyes.  </p><p> MCCORD: That is wrong.</p><p> MCDOWELL: Why were you rolling your eyes?</p><p> MCCORD: I wasn't.</p><p> IMUS: Because it's too much information for us.  </p><p> MCCORD: Not enough.</p><p> IMUS: We can't -- we just can't . . .</p><p> MCCORD: I want to know about the unions.  </p><p> IMUS: No, you don't.</p><p> MCCORD: I want to know why they didn't turn . . .</p><p> IMUS: You don't care anything about it.  </p><p> MCCORD: Absolutely I do.</p><p> IMUS: He's lying, Dagen.</p><p> MCCORD: I want to know why Ford didn't go bankrupt.  </p><p> IMUS: He's just lying.</p><p> MCCORD: And why they were able to get by without any of our money.</p><p> MCDOWELL: I can tell you -- I can tell you that.</p><p> IMUS: Ford F-150.  Ford F-150, right Dagen? </p><p> MCDOWELL: That's right.  And I -- yes, I can tell you that too because Ford  -- Alan Mulally came in and borrowed money way ahead.  He planned in  advance.  He even mortgaged the logo.  </p><p> MCCORD: There you go.  </p><p> IMUS: There you go.</p><p> MCCORD: There you go.</p><p> MCDOWELL: There you go.</p><p> IMUS: He's our guy.  </p><p> All right, Dagen, thank you.  </p><p> MCCORD: Foresight instead of hindsight.  </p><p> IMUS: Dagen McDowell, who will be on later with business news that make  sense as opposed to our ruining her report and we apologize for that.  I  do.  </p><p> It's 16 after the hour, we're talking with Big Kenny coming up and Warner.   From the Imus Ranch record, this is Big &amp; Rich.  They did a good job of it.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time now for a business  update.

This continuing violence in  Pakistan.  A payday in that country turning deadly.  Suicide bomber killed  30 people outside a bank near Pakistan's capital today.  The United Nations  now says that the spreading trouble has forced it to pull out some staff  and suspend long-term development work it had been doing in areas along the  Afghan border.  </p><p> A handful of elections in this country tomorrow could provide hints about  what you guys are thinking out there.  The country's state of mind a year  before pivotal 2010 midterm balloting. Tomorrow's results could shed light  on President Obama's political stock.  </p><p> And there won't ben any runoff election come Saturday in Afghanistan.

And just not trying to do too much.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WOLF: A-Rod now two for 14 to share a 1 for 14.

Please  welcome to the program now Big Kenny.  </p><p> Good morning, Big Kenny.</p><p> BIG ALPHIN: Thank you, Don.  Very good to be here.</p><p> IMUS: Happy birthday.  </p><p> ALPHIN: Thank you, thank you, thank you.  And happy birthday to my little  one.  Yes, Lincoln.</p><p> IMUS: Little Lincoln is four years old there, right?</p><p> ALPHIN: Yes, Lincoln's four years old.</p><p> IMUS: We got him a cake.  It has instructions (ph).</p><p> ALPHIN: Awesome.  Awesome.  Good.  And everything's going to be great.  He  loves the celebration.  </p><p> IMUS: Oh, he does.</p><p> ALPHIN: He's a celebrating kid.</p><p> IMUS: What does he think?  Does he tell you what he thinks when he watches  you sing?</p><p> ALPHIN: Yes.  Yes.</p><p> IMUS: What does he think?</p><p> ALPHIN: He likes it.  He likes it.</p><p> IMUS: He does?</p><p> ALPHIN: He loves being around the instruments and he loves singing and  playing music and he's always dressing up like some character.  I mean he  knows he's Captain America.  He knows he's Captain America and he's a rock  star.  He knows that right now, yes.  </p><p> IMUS: So how do you like being out here on your own? </p><p> ALPHIN: I love -- oh, I'm having a blast, man.  I love it all.  You know, I  love the -- having -- being able to play music in every fashion that I have  with John and Big &amp; Rich and with all my other friends that I've made music  with over the years.  I just -- I love what I do.  I'm excited now that  we're doing -- that I'm doing something different.  It lets me speak of  where I'm at in my life right now.  </p><p> You know, I was a bust (ph) just like Lord knows everybody else here in the  early '90s when that first crippling recession came through and I had 75  employees and a construction business.  And within three months, every bank  that was around went out of business, was taken over by the Comptroller of  the Currency, and that was when the savings and loan scandal came through.  </p><p> And then I was trying to build my way out of it.  I was always singing or  humming around on a job site.  A buddy comes up one day and says, hey,  Kenny, you sing pretty good.  You ought to go to Nashville.  You know they  pay people to write songs down there.  And I set my framing hammer down and  I look at him and I said, you've got to be kidding.  I've been farming and  slamming nails all this time and, you know, just, you know, hard work.   Making hay.  You know, it's hard work.</p><p> And, you know what, over the past 15 years, since I've moved to Nashville,  I've found out that song writing is hard work too.  Meaning, you have to  put a lot of time into it to do something great.</p><p> IMUS: Yes.</p><p> ALPHIN: But now I've not only gotten to a point where I've had some success  in music, but I've got a family, I've got a son.  As of this past year, we  were able -- me and my wife work with a group called My Sister's Keeper and  have a -- got a school built over the past three years right in the middle  of Sudan.  Got 550 young girls registered in there, having their first  chance at education 45 kilometers outside of a war zone.  We've got  doctors, we're giving away scholarships in the Appellation now because the  water's so blooming contaminated and all this area that I call home, you  know, we've got to let people know that the water can be killing their  kids, like lead paint was back in the '70s, you know.  </p><p> IMUS: Please don't turn into my wife.  </p><p> ALPHIN: Well, I'm not.  But -- and the way to do that is to plant -- have  music that's gross.  </p><p> IMUS: How does this work?  We're talking with Big Kenny here on the IMUS IN  THE MORNING program.  The album's called \"The Quite Times of a Rock and  Roll Farm Boy.\"  How does this -- how do you plant this?  I mean it's an  unusual packaging.  </p><p> ALPHIN: Well, my -- yes.  We had to come up with that.</p><p> IMUS: Remember, a lot of the people are listening to the radio.</p><p> ALPHIN: Yes, we had to come up with that packaging.  Instead of using a  plastic jewel case, which I just got tired of seeing them stacked around  everywhere. </p><p> IMUS: Sure.</p><p> ALPHIN: You know, I figure, what, there's hundreds of millions of records  made every week.  If we could just get rid of those one plastic jewel  cases, that could be a pile as big as the Empire State Building.  Huge.  So  we made a package that just -- it's a cardboard folder that folds up and  you can put your CD, take it out or put it back in or you can take the  package and it's plantable.   Meaning we put in the cardboard 26 different  varieties of my favorite perennial wildflower seeds. So you can just wet  the stuff and break it up into pieces and put it in flower pot and plant it  or you could just throw it out in your backyard and it's biodegradable,  it's compostable.  It will just wither to nothing.  So worst thing is, if  these -- if there are packages everywhere, our way will be paved in  flowers.  </p><p> IMUS: What's this business about loving everybody, because we don't love  anybody.  </p><p> ALPHIN: Oh, I don't believe that for a minute.</p><p> IMUS: Well, we don't love everybody.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> ALPHIN:  Well -- and it just struck me like a lightning bolt.  I guess, you  know, having gone through a business bust and a lot of other things in my  life, and having the time as a writer to spend time a lot of time thinking  and writing my thoughts down in all these crazy songs -- and this album of  songs that I've written now, it really does describe my life -- I just  decided that that was the best way to look at everything, every question  that I had, all the things that were consuming my mind that I saw as issues  throughout the world, or things that were right around me, with people that  were just around me.  I said the best thing I can do is just follow one  rule, and that's, well, I just love everybody, no matter what.  </p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> ALPHIN:  I know it's not the easiest thing in the world, but it can be  done.</p><p> IMUS:  You have a white aura around you.</p><p> ALPHIN:  A white aura?</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> MCCORD:  That's positive.  That's good.</p><p> IMUS:  That's good.</p><p> MCCORD:  That is good.</p><p> IMUS:  Let me ask you a question you have never been asked.  </p><p> ALPHIN:  OK.</p><p> IMUS:  Are you and John going to record again?  </p><p> ALPHIN:  I hope so, yes.  I would think so.</p><p> We've put a lot of energy into building what we've built so far.  John is  getting ready to be a daddy, I understand, and so a lot of things are  changing in his world right now.  </p><p> I had to hang upside down last year like a bat.  I was trying to get my  neck fixed naturally, without having to do what my daddy had been telling  me all my life, and that was, \"Son, sooner or later, you're going to have  to get your head screwed on straight.\"  So this doctor in Nashville finally  went in after this injury I sustained in 2002 from being hit by a drunk  driver.  He went into my throat and my spine.</p><p> He screwed a metal plate.  So I am now bionic Big Kenny.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, when John was here, he told us you were doing that.  I just  assumed that he was lying and that you all couldn't get along.</p><p> ALPHIN:  No.</p><p> IMUS:  Because look at Brooks &amp; Dunn after all these years.  Well, Ronnie  Dunn finally figured out -- it took him 20 years -- that he is the only one  who could sing in that group.  So -- I mean, the other guy is fine, but...</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> ALPHIN:  Well, I think it's -- as musicians, it's good for us.  John wanted  to express a lot of songs that I wouldn't -- that wouldn't naturally come  from me.  And these songs that make up all of Big Kenny, \"The Quiet Times  of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy,\"  these are the songs of my life right now.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, you all toured this summer, didn't you?</p><p> ALPHIN:  Yes, we toured this summer and did all the Big and Rich classics.   And then he played a couple, I played a couple.  We had a blast.  We did  most of the country this summer.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, people like you individually.  They love -- and they may wind  up loving both of you individually.  </p><p> ALPHIN:  Yes, I would hope so.  They call me the Jack White of country  music, or the...</p><p> IMUS:  Jack White?</p><p> ALPHIN:  Yes.  He's recorded with Loretta Lynn.  </p><p> IMUS:  I love Jack White.</p><p> ALPHIN:  He's recorded with...</p><p> IMUS:  Well, that record he made with Loretta Lynn was great.  That was a  great record.  </p><p> ALPHIN:  Yes.  I want to make more records just -- I've got a studio built  in my back yard now.  It didn't necessarily start out like that.</p><p> It started out because I was working so much, touring so much.  And we were  -- we tried to move across the street because we could park the bus off the  street and make our neighbors happier.  And then my wife's going to work,  and \"All the time you're building the house, you're not going to church  enough, honey.\"  </p><p> So, to solve that, I had a friend come over.  We sketched up a nice little  building that looked kind of like a church, and we started building that in  the back yard.  And then my buddies are coming back going, \"Wow, this would  make a great studio.\"</p><p> So now every time at home I've solved all the issues.  I'm right there for  my kid.  He'd come running in just like I could run into the shop when my  dad was working on the farm.</p><p> I've got music in a studio around me all the time so I can get quiet, think  and write.  And, hey, I'm in church too.</p><p> IMUS:  Praise the lord.  Praise Jesus.</p><p> Big Kenny is going to sing for us in just a little bit here.</p><p> ALPHIN:  Amen.  </p><p> IMUS:  It's 33 after the hour.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p> Time now for our business update from the Fox Business Network.  </p><p> Here's Jenna Lee.  </p><p> LEE:  Good morning, everybody.  Here's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Bank of America's list of candidates to replace CEO Ken Lewis is looking  even shorter after another prospect reportedly told the bank no thanks.   \"The Wall Street Journal\" says Bank of America approached Bank of New York  Mellon CEO Robert Kelly.  Kelly has been approached before for succeeding  Ken Lewis, but is showing no interest in the job as of yet.  </p><p> Bernie Madoff's auditors expected to plead guilty.  Prosecutors say David  Friehling reached a deal with the government and will enter his plea  tomorrow.  </p><p> In the meantime, in a jailhouse interview, Bernie Madoff telling the  Securities and Exchange Commission he considers current SEC chair Mary  Schapiro \"a dear friend,\" and that she \"... probably thinks I wish I never  knew this guy.\"</p><p> Moving on to a different story here, winter came early in Beijing.  The  city waking up to snow on Sunday, to the earliest snowfall in 10 years.  </p><p> Meteorologists seated (ph) clouds with silver iodide, forcing the snow to  fall.  Beijing's city offices said because it's suffering from a drought,  it won't miss an opportunity for artificial precipitation.  </p><p> There's a look at it.  It looks like a lot of snow.</p><p> Quick earnings news for you.  Clorox saying H1N1, the flu, actually helping  out sales.  They had a big beat here.  Adjusted earnings, $1.18, versus the  expectation of 95 cents.  Revenue right in line with expectations, $1.37  billion.  </p><p> That's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p> If you're on the move this morning or at a computer, check us out for all  the latest business headlines -- FoxBusiness.com/livemorningedition,  streaming on your iPhone and online.  </p><p> Here's a quick look at the futures.  We have more IMUS IN THE MORNING  coming up.</p><p> MCCORD:  The House plan includes a government-run public run option and is  expected to cost less than $900 billion over 10 years.  House Republican  Mike Pence of Indiana, though, fears it goes way too far and calls it, in  fact, a freight train. </p><p> IMUS:  I mean, at some point, don't you have to say to grandma, look,  that's enough?  </p><p> MCCORD:  No.  What are you talking about?  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  Well, maybe, but coming from the government is a little...</p><p> MCCORD:  Why would you say that to grandma under any circumstances?  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, grandma is sitting there with the food falling out of her  mouth, staring at the TV, and the TV is not on.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> IMUS:  I mean...</p><p> MCCORD:  That's just great.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, I'm just saying.  </p><p> MCCORD:  So you slip over behind grandma...</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Be careful what you wish for.</p><p> IMUS:  You can tell he's a sweet guy.</p><p> MCCORD:  Oh, he's a lovely man.</p><p> IMUS:  He just looks at me and he says, \"Why do you hate everybody?\"  I  said no, it's a joke.  We don't hate everybody, we just hate you.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> IMUS:  No, we don't hate anybody.  Well, we hate -- do we hate -- no, we  don't hate anybody.  We just don't love everybody.  </p><p> All right.  Well, an album you can plant, that's reason enough to buy it,  \"The Quiet Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy.\"</p><p> Once again, please welcome Big Kenny.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> IMUS:  Oh, man, that's a great song.

Good morning to you.</p><p> And coming up just moments from now on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" I will be in for  Alexis, and I'll be joined by a couple of former senators -- Bob Graham and  Jim Talent.  They're on different sides of the aisle, but both men agree  that investing in vaccines is important to the nation's security.  We're  talking H1N1.</p><p> We'll find out why on \"THE OPENING BELL.\"</p><p> All right.  Let's get to your \"Fox Business Minute\" now, with AIG dropping  its plans to sell some Japanese units.  </p><p> According to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" AIG is going to keep two of the  three life insurance units initially it had tried to sell.  Now, this fits  with the plan set forward by the CEO, Robert Benmosche, when he took over  back in August.  AIG, by the way, still owes the government some $85  billion.  </p><p> The liquidation of Lehman Brothers continues with a sale of more than $1  million worth of art.  The 283 lots brought in a total of $1.35 million,  nearly twice the expectations.  Now, the artwork once hung on the walls of  Lehman's corporate offices here in New York, and the money hardly puts a  dent on the $250 billion that Lehman still owes its creditors.  </p><p> Now, the big news this morning from Ford, For Motor Company reporting third  quarter earnings results that blew past analysts' estimates.  They reported  a profit of 26 cents a share, $30.9 billion in revenue, when they were  expected to have lost money.  </p><p>Ford says its turnaround plan is on track for the time frame they've  targeted.  You see the stock.  It's higher in pre-market trading.  </p><p> That is your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p> Speaking of higher, let's take a look at the futures this morning.

God Almighty.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, that would be Mrs. Imus.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes, boy.  What does she want?</p><p> IMUS:  She says, regarding Big Kenny, \"What a great guy he is.  His glasses  look like yours.\"</p><p> OK.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> IMUS:  \"We should be planting every CD cover.  When we buy plastic CD  covers,\" according to my wife, who is to the right of Sean Hannity, she  says, \"the terrorists win.\"  </p><p> Well, all right.  </p><p> Neil Cavuto will have the fat boy on tonight, our guy, Chris Christie.  And  -- now I'm not sure they will be in the same studio.  I'm not sure that  that's possible, actually.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCGUIRK:  That ain't right.</p><p> IMUS:  They'll be a two-shot, those two boys.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  You got your wide screen.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> Coming up next hour, Matt Taibbi from \"Rolling Stone.\"</p><p> Tomorrow, Mike Lupica.

So that kind of situation.</p><p> All right, time for one more here.  You all please welcome once again,  singing something from -- that last song, that was a great song.  This is  from -- oh, how about this one, Imus?  Maybe this would be great, too --  \"The Quite Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy,\" Big Kenny.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> IMUS:  Big Kenny.  </p><p> ALPHIN:  Thank you.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> IMUS:  Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program from Fox News,  actually, and his own syndicated national radio program that is doing  splendid, our old friend Alan Colmes.</p><p> Good morning, Mr. Colmes.  </p><p> ALAN COLMES, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Hello, Mr. Imus.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, how about all the stuff President Obama promised he was going  to do and he's done none of it?  None of it.  </p><p> COLMES:  The guy's been in office a few minutes.</p><p> IMUS:  None of it.  He's been in office almost a year.  He has done nof it.  </p><p> COLMES:  OK.  That justifies Lieberman.  </p><p> IMUS:  He has done none of it.</p><p> COLMES:  He's getting out of Iraq in 22 months.</p><p> IMUS:  He was the agent of change.  He's not going to get out of Iraq in  anything.</p><p> COLMES:  Sure he is.</p><p> IMUS:  How about \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell?\"  How about Guantanamo?  </p><p> COLMES:  I'd like to see him move faster on some things.  He inherited a  nightmare from the previous administration.</p><p> IMUS:  Oh, well, you can't spend the rest of your life blaming that  incompetent buffoon who was the president before this guy.  </p><p> COLMES:  You've got to sweep up the mess that was left.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, yes, but grab a mop and get busy then, as he said.</p><p> COLMES:  What do you think he's doing?  He was just praised for going to  Dover Air Force Base.  That's change you can believe.</p><p> IMUS:  That's one thing he did that was good.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Symbolic.</p><p> IMUS:  I like the guy, by the way.  I mean, Sean Hannity, it makes him  insane when I say that, but I do like him.  But I don't think he has any  idea what he's doing, and he's more interested in being president...</p><p> COLMES:  Oh, that's just ridiculous.</p><p> IMUS:  ... spending five hours playing golf with that dope Tom Friedman.  </p><p> COLMES:  I'm with O'Reilly on this one.  The guy's not allowed to have a  golf game?</p><p> IMUS:  No, not to...</p><p> COLMES:  The guy can't go enjoy himself for a few hours?</p><p> IMUS:  No, no, not to -- no, come on.  Do you have five hours to go play --  you probably do, but I don't have five hours to go do anything.  </p><p> COLMES:  Wait a minute.  So, when George W. Bush said, \"I'm playing  through\" after he was talking about the tragedy of 9/11, that was OK,  right?</p><p> IMUS:  Well, I didn't say it was OK.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> IMUS:  I didn't vote for him.  I didn't vote for him either time.  What are  you talking about?  </p><p> COLMES:  Well, I'm just pointing out to your audience the hypocrisy there.</p><p> IMUS:  Pardon me?  </p><p> COLMES:  I'm pointing out the hypocrisy in the situation.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, it's completely lost on me, and now you've irritated me.   So...</p><p> COLMES:  Oh, I'm really sorry.</p><p> IMUS:  No you're not.  You don't care at all.</p><p> COLMES:  I don't know how I can make it up to you.</p><p> IMUS:  You don't care about me.  </p><p> COLMES:  Yes, I do.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> IMUS:  Tonight at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Fox Business Network, Neil  Cavuto will interview our new favorite fat boy, New Jersey gubernatorial  candidate Chris Christie.  </p><p> And speaking of -- well, not fat boys, but Cavuto -- but then we could make  a case for -- well, whatever.  He'll be on this program tomorrow morning,  along with Mike Lupica.  He'll be talking about his new book, \"Million- Dollar Throw.\"</p><p> Right now, time for \"THE OPENING BELL.\"    </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC.

See how they're shaping up this Monday morning. And a quick look at futures as we show you Oil and Gold. imus in the morning is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: Based on the interview that he did yesterday on his program Chris Christie -- if he doesn't get elected government in New Jersey, maybe there is something is wrong.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Politics -- but -- like Corzine is just a slimy, sleazy, Goldman Sachs thief, and an arrogant idiot dirt bag. All of that. But why do we need to get into this name calling, Bernie?</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, HOST: Well, don't hold back here I-man.</p><p>IMUS: Here's what I don't like about, when I got fired, you know, and when I was coming back to work, this moron -- I wasn't going to talk about this but I will. He had some statement about what he thought that I ought to have to do to come back to work. And here's what he have to do -- he ought to kiss my ass. How does that sound?</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentlemen, imus in the morning.</p><p>IMUS: Third day to my mind Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I will go down in history. February 15, 2004, when the Yankees traded for A-Rod.</p><p>MCCORD: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And of course, May 8, 2009, when it came back from a hit a home run.</p><p>MCCORD: Just exploded.</p><p>IMUS: There was never a doubt in my mind at any point that going back to February 15th, 2004, at the Yankees for marching on their way to the 27th world championship.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, HOST: May I just add rocket propelled to their 27th.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: So, way to go A-Rod.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, WARNER SPORT'S HOST: The name of the law (ph).</p><p>IMUS: What's the matter Warner?</p><p>(ALL TALKING AT ONCE)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: The fat boy will be on with Cavuto. The next governor of New Jersey, kind of interesting. Whether you like him or not, it's not a decent job, and even if he hasn't, he is not a creep. You know, he figured out a way to put together $16 billion.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, he did.</p><p>IMUS: He said to Corzine that he is a moron. And we know Corzine is a creep. And then I was watching the best of Imus, euphemistically speaking of course, on Saturday morning on the Fox Business Network. And half the time when I'm talking to people, I'm checking my e-mail.</p><p>MCCORD: I know its ugly reading his e-mail.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, it's difficult to get me to listen anyway.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, sure because that's a God damn thing.</p><p>IMUS: It is clear I am not listening to a word they are saying. I was talking to Laura Ingram when she was going out her notes word by word and that's people I like.</p><p>MCCORD: Stunning that you are able to hold up your end of the conversation.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, coming up this morning, Big Kenny is here.</p><p>MCCORD: All right.</p><p>IMUS: And he's got his love everybody. And we will be playing that song and we don't love anybody. There is no one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: Not a knocked on .</p><p>IMUS: You know what is new CD Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: The quiet times of a rock and roll farm boy.

If you look at what Mark Teixeira and have done in this World Series it's not much.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: That's right. A-Rod 2 for 14, Teixeira 1 for 14.

His ex-wife accused him. His ex-girlfriend accused him. Both for beating them up.</p><p>IMUS: Road rage, that's what that is, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: It is. How about Roger Goodell?

It's time for your \"FOX Business Minute.\"</p><p>Bank of America's list of candidates to take the place of Ken Lewis as the CEO is looking shorter and shorter after another prospect has reportedly told the bank no thanks. \"Wall Street Journal\" says B of A approached the Bank of New York Mellon CEO Robert Kelly.

Prosecutors say that David Friehling reached a deal with the government and now will enter this plea tomorrow.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a jailhouse interview, Madoff himself told the Securities and Exchange Commission that he considers the current SEC Chair Mary Schapiro to be a \"dear friend\" and that she \"probably thinks I wish I never knew this guy.\"</p><p>And big news this morning out of Ford.

I just can't get to -- what were you saying now?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No.</p><p>IMUS: Forty-five percent tax break --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: That's what she was saying, for God's sake.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Your taxes are going up.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you hollering at me?

Big Kenny says love everybody.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Of course we don't love anybody.</p><p>MCCORD: No indeed.</p><p>IMUS: But maybe he can turn us around. Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program now from \"Rolling Stone\" magazine Matt Taibbi.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Taibbi.</p><p>MATT TAIBBI, \"ROLLING STONE\" CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: Good morning, I- Man.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>TAIBBI: Good morning, Charles. Good. Yourself?</p><p>IMUS: We're going to have a discussion about Mr. Taibbi's goatee which we like, right?</p><p>MCCORD: The vote is in.</p><p>TAIBBI: You're all making me uncomfortable.</p><p>MCCORD: Really?</p><p>IMUS: Well, you've got to be comfortable enough. We are.</p><p>MCCORD: Accept the compliment.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: All right.</p><p>IMUS: We're not coming on to you.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>TAIBBI: That comes later, right?</p><p>IMUS: He's trying to get you in the limo.</p><p>MCCORD: Except you do look awfully good.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Trick-or-treat.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Anyway, so they've cancelled the elections in Afghanistan. I know you and I were talking about that. We can talk about anything.</p><p>TAIBBI: I'm happy to talk about Afghanistan.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know what that means, do you?</p><p>TAIBBI: I have no idea.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know what it means, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Just the Independent Election Commission has cancelled it and declared Karzai the victor during a news conference in Kabul today.</p><p>IMUS: Well, Duran Duran -- what was the guy's name?</p><p>TAIBBI: Abdullah Abdullah.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: Dr. Duran Duran, you're right.</p><p>IMUS: He bailed out because it was so phony. And the Secretary of State said what now? She said this is just an affirmation that, you know, the process is -- I don't know, she read something into it. It sounds to me.</p><p>MCCORD: It was a bit positive.</p><p>TAIBBI: That's his name Abdullah, Abdullah?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: Dr. Abdullah Abdullah.</p><p>TAIBBI: Any gulf statesmen should have at least one double name like Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: It's a good, you know, Barack Barack Obama. I mean, it would work well.</p><p>IMUS: So in the current issue of \"Rolling Stone,\" you write about sports logos?</p><p>TAIBBI: Right. It's actually \"Men's Journal.\"</p><p>IMUS: \"Men's Journal.\"</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes, yes. No, it's just sort of event, the commercialization phenomenon, you know, about how, you know, it's gotten to the point I think the economy is so bad now that they're trying so desperately to rescue profits in the sports business that I think they've really gone too far and they've basically sucked the life out of, you know, the sports watching process.</p><p>I don't know about you. I mean, I spent all last year trying to get that $5 foot long, you know, theme song out of my head. Every time I hear it, I want to drive a fork into my eardrum. I just can't take it anymore.</p><p>IMUS: Well, here's the -- and the names of these -- be helpful, by the way, if I did some research prior to Mr. Taibbi coming in and knew which magazine he wrote in. \"Men's Journal\" is the one with Tim McGraw on the cover, by the way. And he reveals I'm not sure what, something.</p><p>Here's the thing about people like Tim McGraw and these others. I guess that's how they get on the magazines but they reveal stuff about themselves that we don't want to know. I mean, I just -- it's like Andre Agassi have you heard about his new book?</p><p>TAIBBI: Oh, yes, with the whole meth -- doing meth. And actually he talks about how meth is really, really, you know, great. You know, it kind of resold me on the experience, you know.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I thought man, I forgot how good that was. I read those excerpts.</p><p>IMUS: But there's another excerpt, it's coming in here. When is he coming in, Bernie, next week or so?</p><p>BERNIE MCGUIRK: November 12th.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Apparently, remember when he had great looking hair.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right, and then he went bald and yes --</p><p>IMUS: Well, it was a rug there in the latter stages of --</p><p>MCCORD: Really?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Was it like extensions or was the whole thing a rug?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm not sure. But it was a rug to the degree that he was afraid it would fall off.</p><p>TAIBBI: Wow.</p><p>IMUS: So he says that he in the 1990 French Open finals.</p><p>TAIBBI: OK.</p><p>IMUS: There's a reason he lost. It was his first Grand Slam final.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right.</p><p>IMUS: The reason he lost is because he was worried about his rug falling off.</p><p>TAIBBI: Losing his rug.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Wow, that would have been one of the great ESPN moments of all time. Don't you think?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Top ten deal, it would have been number one forever. Big clump of hair there flying on the clay in rolling hills or wherever.</p><p>TAIBBI: Did you see that Manu Ginobili actually killed a bat in the middle of a game.</p><p>MCCORD: I saw that.</p><p>TAIBBI: The basketball game last week?</p><p>IMUS: No. Where did this happen?</p><p>TAIBBI: Sacramento.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Bat flew under -- and the guy actually -- you wax it with his hand, and the bat falls on the ground and it's like twitching and dying and he reaches down and grabs it, no hesitation whatsoever.</p><p>MCCORD: He walked over and handed it to somebody.</p><p>TAIBBI: It was the cool -- it was like he knew who to hand it to.</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly.</p><p>TAIBBI: Where's the guy you hand the bat to after? You know what I mean?</p><p>IMUS: The bat is in the stadium there or in the arena at Sacramento?</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: It starts flying around in the middle of the game. It was the weirdest thing ever.</p><p>MCCORD: It's Halloween.</p><p>TAIBBI: But not as weird as Andre Agassi's hair falling off in the middle of the French Open.</p><p>IMUS: What I'm thinking, how did he -- was he worried about it falling off in the semifinals. Great. Or the quarterfinals?</p><p>MCCORD: When did he start -- when did it become an issue, a distraction?</p><p>IMUS: Yes, you can't --</p><p>TAIBBI: Well, maybe -- I mean, you've got to think about the fact that he really only surged as a player after he committed to the whole bald look.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right? I mean --</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Maybe -- I mean, that wasn't until like eight years later. But I mean, still, maybe that was when he stopped worrying about it.</p><p>IMUS: Well, he never used to be able to finish five set matches, that whole thing.</p><p>TAIBBI: Well, it's hard to do after you've been, you know, taking meth for three days straight, you know.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't think he did for fun -- didn't do it for a lot of years, did he?</p><p>MCCORD: One year I think.</p><p>IMUS: One year.</p><p>TAIBBI: Oh, OK.</p><p>IMUS: Now Martina Navratilova wants him to give back all of his -- all of his Grand Slam trophies and so on.</p><p>TAIBBI: Because he was wearing a wig?</p><p>IMUS: No, because he was doing crystal meth.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Will it make you play better or just make you want to clean the stadium?</p><p>MCCORD: Swat a bat.</p><p>TAIBBI: I'm not sure taking meth would make you play better.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, me either.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Talking with Matt Taibbi from Rolling Stone. We're talking about sports logos. I was going to mention here at 21 until the hour, when I watch basketball which is more than I like to admit, I was watching Shaquille O'Neal and Lebron James, they were playing somebody, I forget --</p><p>TAIBBI: Celtics probably.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And Quicken Loans Arena.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, it's like it's named after a pawnshop.</p><p>TAIBBI: Oh, yes, I know especially all the different companies that went out of business in the last, you know, ten years, they're in business for, you know, a year, long enough to rip off five million people. They get their name on the stadium and then they go out of business. Like Enron Field and all that.</p><p>IMUS: And Citi Field.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right.</p><p>IMUS: Because you know a lot about digressing wildly here, a lot about Wall Street and that whole --</p><p>TAIBBI: They should call it bailout field is what they should call it.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. I thought -- my wife told me about CIT last night. And I thought that was Citigroup, but it's not. It's different. CIT is who?</p><p>TAIBBI: CIT? That's the business that Goldman got involved with, but Citi Field is Citigroup.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So that's not the office.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: . that claimed bankruptcy, right, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: No. No.</p><p>IMUS: That's CIT.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right, right.</p><p>IMUS: And how is Goldman --</p><p>TAIBBI: Well, Goldman is getting preferential treatment in the bankruptcy. I forget how that all works, but that was like the last time I was on the show. So that was weeks ago. I've been doing so much meth in the meantime, I've forgotten what that was all about.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>So, I really don't know.</p><p>IMUS: As long as we're at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, how is the football coach of the Browns doing? You wrote about -- you wrote about it.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes. I took a lot of heat in Cleveland because I compared Eric Mangini to Augustus Gloop. You know, remember the fat kid in the Willy Wonka movie?</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>TAIBBI: You know, he falls into the chocolate river, right?</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes. OK.</p><p>TAIBBI: You know, because he's too greedy and Gene Wilder is like oh, help, you know, save him. Right? So I wrote a column because we have a football column in \"Rolling Stone\" now where I compared Mangini to that's where Augustus Gloop has been all these years. He resurfaces, you know.</p><p>And I've been getting like death threats from Cleveland ever since -- they've quieted down since the Bears recent losing streak because people are turning their anger towards Mangini now. But --</p><p>IMUS: Well, the Browns are like one of seven, right?</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes. I mean, you know, Mangini comes in and he's like fining guys $1,700 for not paying for a bottle of water in their hotel room and that kind of stuff and you do this before even winning a game. Of course, you're going to lose. I mean, these guys are, you know, doing more land down on TV than Paris Hilton, you know. I mean, the Browns. So, it's been a rough year for Cleveland. I hate to pick on that city, but yes, there's nothing you can do.</p><p>IMUS: How do these guys like Mangini who didn't do all that great a job -- I guess he had one good year with the Jets, right?</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes, he had one good year. What I thought was interesting though is that he got his head coaching job after he took over the Patriots defense for one year which had been one of the best defenses in the league for years and years and years. And then he takes it over and it's like 15th or 16th in the league and he gets a head coaching job.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: You know, it's like the Peter Principle. People get promoted to their level of incompetence and in the NFL it just seems to happen more quickly than in other places.</p><p>IMUS: Why does it happen? Why would he be blown out of a job with the Jets? Why would Cleveland think he's the answer?</p><p>TAIBBI: I think Cleveland has been trying to, you know, make up for their mistake of having let Bill Belichick go too early for the last, you know, five or six years. So they've, you know, now hired two successive Bill Belichick lieutenants and Mangini is, you know, he even physically resembles Belichick in a lot of ways. He obviously tries to take after him. And, you know, he's bad with the media the same way that Belichick is. You know, he's a disciplinarian.</p><p>I think they were trying to recapture that magic. I don't know what it is. And then, you know, I think they're probably also trying to stick it to Belichick by hiring him. So, but it just didn't work out. This has been --</p><p>IMUS: How long was --</p><p>TAIBBI: He's cursed, you know.</p><p>IMUS: How long was Belichick there?</p><p>TAIBBI: He was there for five years. He had one winning season but, you know, he didn't figure it out until of course he left Cleveland which is what happens to everybody who lives in Cleveland.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You know what that is? It's like Buffalo. You know, nobody who actually is from Buffalo actually succeeds at life. It never happens to them while they're in Buffalo. You know what I mean?</p><p>IMUS: It's 17 until the hour. We're talking with Matt Taibbi from the \"Rolling Stone\" here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program and \"Men's Journal.\"</p><p>Where are you on Brett Favre?</p><p>TAIBBI: I actually wrote a sports column earlier this year calling for Brett Favre to be chained to a rock in the middle of the ocean so that he could have his liver pecked out by sea birds for the rest of eternity.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: Come on, man. Don't hold back.</p><p>TAIBBI: I don't know. I mean, I'm sure I'm not alone. I'm just kind of sick of the whole phenomenon. Are you? I mean, every time I turn on the television the guy is staring back at me. I thought he gets the mirror in the house. You know --</p><p>IMUS: I was talking to Mike Lupica. I said who do you want to win the Packers/Vikings game? It's got to be the Packers. This guy can't go up there and win. I mean --</p><p>TAIBBI: But he did, you know. Yes.</p><p>And actually it's turning into what could have been kind of a really, really boring and overdone media story. The only way they could have saved this is by Brett Favre actually playing out of his mind and having actually a great year to warrant all the hype and he's doing it. So I think it's turning out to be a great thing for the NFL.</p><p>If he had come back and they were four and three and he was throwing a bunch of picks, you know, it would have been a nightmare because we'd still be hearing about it just as much but it wouldn't be, you know, worthwhile. So --</p><p>IMUS: And one of the strangest resumes of anyone I've ever read, Mr. Taibbi played professional basketball in Mongolia?</p><p>TAIBBI: That's right. Right.</p><p>IMUS: Professional baseball in Russia.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes. I played for the Red Army. Yes, yes.</p><p>I actually I tried to play -- the Russians briefly had a professional football league too.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>TAIBBI: And I tried to get in on that action for a team in St. Petersburg but it was all these ex-hockey players who didn't really understand the rules all that well, so I got two. I got a couple of helmets in the back in the practices and I thought to myself I'm not going to do this too much.</p><p>IMUS: How good did you have to be to be on the Russian army baseball team?</p><p>TAIBBI: Not that good. You know, I mean --</p><p>IMUS: You have to be able to play.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes. I mean, you had to be like, you know, a good high school player basically. I mean, yes, there were three guys that I played with over in Russia who ended up in the minors in the states.</p><p>IMUS: What position did you play?</p><p>TAIBBI: Well, I was a catcher in high school really but I played -- in Russia I ended up having to play center field because one of the guys who ended up being a prospect in the states was a catcher. So, you know, he got the catcher spot.</p><p>IMUS: And then the basketball in Mongolia, how did that happen?</p><p>TAIBBI: I was playing basketball in the street in Moscow and I met a Mongolian guy who told me they had this thing called the MBA, the Mongolian Basketball Association. So I went into work the next day and quit my job, got on the Trans-Siberian railroad and went to Mongolia and found a team. Got a tryout.</p><p>And I was playing for a team called the Mountain Eagles in the MBA which is the only league in the world that has MBA rules, by the way. It has a 24-second shot clock and a three-point line and everything. I played for them for about a year until I got pneumonia and almost died and had to leave the country.</p><p>IMUS: You were obviously doing meth then, right?</p><p>TAIBBI: That was actually pre-meth, believe it or not. Yes, that was like in -- that was in my healthy period.</p><p>IMUS: I got to quit my job here in Moscow and go to Mongolia and play basketball.</p><p>MCCORD: Get on the train.</p><p>IMUS: Are you going to do a book on this Wall Street thing, by the way?</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes, I'm working on it right now.</p><p>IMUS: Good.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes, yes.</p><p>IMUS: People still -- Frank Rich, if you can believe this, quoting your Goldman Sachs line.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right.</p><p>IMUS: . in a Frank Rich \"New York Times\" column. So all of the stuff you did and all the stuff you learned is certainly worth a book.</p><p>TAIBBI: I hope so. You know, one of the problems I'm finding though is that the public has a very, very limited appetite for the Wall Street story. They're interested in it just long enough to get upset about it but --</p><p>IMUS: Here's why they'll like yours. I'm telling you I'm being serious, why we like you, why I like you. Because you're willing to say awful things about these people and you're willing to call them awful names.</p><p>MCCORD: Like people getting their liver pecked out on a remote island.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Yes. And you're a great writer and you're willing to resort to physical humor. And that appeals to me and my 11-year-old son.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>All right, Matt, thank you very much.</p><p>TAIBBI: Thanks a lot, I-Man.</p><p>IMUS: Matt Taibbi, \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Men's Journal.\" It's 13 until the hour.</p><p>MUSIC: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the FOX Business Network. Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: Time for your \"FOX Business Minute.\" AIG dropping its plans to sell some Japanese units. According to this morning's \"Wall Street Journal,\" AIG is now going to keep two of the three life insurance units it initially had tried to sell. And this fits in with the plan set forward by the CEO, Robert Benmosche, when he took over in August. AIG still owes the government, remember, some 85 billion dollars.</p><p>The liquidation of Lehman Brothers continues with the sale of more than a million dollars worth of art. Two hundred eighty-three lots brought in a total $1.35 million. Nearly twice the expectations that some had for this art work, which once hung in the walls of Lehman's corporate offices right here in New York City. The money hardly puts a dent in the 250 billion that Lehman still owes to its creditors</p><p>And this morning in case you missed it, Ford is already out with its third quarter results way above expectations. They earned 26 cents a share when they were expected to have lost money. $30.9 billion in revenue, also better than expected.</p><p>Stock up in pre-market. Ford with its turnaround plan on track according to the company. And in the next hour, we'll have more earnings coming out. Sysco, the food company, and Clorox set to be reporting their results.</p><p>That's your \"FOX Business Minute.\" When you log on this morning, go download that new FOX Business iPhone app. It's great.

How are you guys?</p><p>ROB BARTLETT: We're fine.</p><p>TONY POWELL: Good.</p><p>IMUS: What's on your mind, Tony.</p><p>POWELL: Well, now, this little girl, Abigail Breslin, the child that played in \"Little Miss Sunshine\" has been cast in the Broadway revival of \"The Miracle Worker,\" the Helen Keller Story.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>POWELL: That little blind, deaf Helen Keller.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>POWELL: Well, there's a little problem because the Alliance for Inclusion, a group that advocates for disabled actors wants them to cast a blind deaf actress to play little Helen Keller. And I'm just thinking they've lost their minds.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>POWELL: Can you imagine how much money that cost in rehearsal just the rehearsal time alone?</p><p>IMUS: No, Tony.</p><p>POWELL: How many times would the director have to yell cut is my point?</p><p>IMUS: Well, there's a way -- isn't there a way they do that?</p><p>POWELL: I don't know. I can't even imagine it. First of all, think about Broadway. You've been to Broadway. Have a blackout, you know, at the end of a scene. That girl is still standing there.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>She wouldn't know.</p><p>IMUS: This is not that funny, Tony.</p><p>POWELL: It is. I mean --</p><p>IMUS: I'm happy this is not racial this time.</p><p>POWELL: Well, no.</p><p>IMUS: Whining about something -- blaming me and Rob for something.</p><p>POWELL: I don't blame Rob. I advocate for all people with all kinds of issues.</p><p>IMUS: No, you don't.</p><p>POWELL: Yes, I do.</p><p>IMUS: Most of the time you don't.</p><p>POWELL: I mean I understand. I mean, again, I just have a problem with this. I mean, you know, when you cast a play, you cast the best actor available. I mean, you wouldn't cast a stutterer to play Hamlet. That's a long show.</p><p>You go for a Sunday matinee, you don't leave until Tuesday. That's just stupid.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>POWELL: I'm just saying. Man, that's all. That's my only point. That's it.</p><p>IMUS: Be a convoy of news trucks out here today. Because you know what I'd be happy? For once they won't be here for me.</p><p>POWELL: I'm not.</p><p>IMUS: They'll be here for you.</p><p>MUSIC: Imus, Imus, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hey there.</p><p>IMUS: Did you get --</p><p>IMUS: Go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Did you get your hair fixed and everything?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I think I did. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It looks good.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, God.</p><p>IMUS: I have a little mirror here that Cavuto got me so I can check it every once in a while.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Curtains on the Titanic. Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: I don't need those kinds of comments from you, Bernard. You look like Casper the ghost grandfather. I mean, just butt out.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCGUIRK: What?</p><p>IMUS: What's the big business news this morning?</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're going to be -- we're going to be watching personal spending and income. It comes out at the bottom of the hour.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>How do I follow up? Well, speaking of Casper, at least Bernie doesn't need to buy a costume for tomorrow, right?</p><p>IMUS: No, he doesn't. But don't start in on him.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Wait a minute. You're in trouble.</p><p>IMUS: You're in trouble. Hold down a second. It's just better if you just don't say anything to him.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I wonder above the fence line. I wonder what's happening here.</p><p>IMUS: It's just like poking a -- it's just like taking a sharp stick and poking a lion. Right, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly. God almighty.</p><p>IMUS: Digressing like a drunk at a Christmas party.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: Where's your husband from?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Born and raised in New York City.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So --</p><p>MCDOWELL: His parents are artists. Now they live up in the woods in Massachusetts on a dirt road, and they are as left as they come. Nancy Pelosi is not liberal enough for them.</p><p>IMUS: What -- what do they -- how was that when he brought you home?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Hey, look, Morticia Adams is here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Here we go.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's actually pretty good. That's pretty good. I've gone as Morticia because I don't have a buy a costume. I got a closet full of black clothes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I've got the complexion of a flounder. There you go.</p><p>IMUS: You're firing me. Thank you very much, Dagen.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DON IMUS, HOST: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update. From the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, everybody. Coming up on IMUS IN THE MORNING, Big Kenny, of Big and Rich fame, will be back with Imus this morning to play some music and talk a little bit to us. So we're looking forward to that. Let's talk a little bit about some business news now with your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>CIT Group filing for bankruptcy. It's the fifth largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. The lender was unable to get its bondholders to agree to a debt for equity offer. But according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" CIT does have support for a prepackaged bankruptcy plan, including funding from billionaire investor Carl Icahn. This could allow CIT to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of the year.</p><p>It was certainly a big weekend for bank failures as feds seized nine more banks. The most ever to be shut down in one day since the financial crisis began. The banks will reopen today as U.S. bank branches after the company steps in and agrees to assume their deposits. They have and they will. This brings the total of bank failures so far this year to 115.</p><p>In other banking news, executives from the country's 28 largest banks are meeting with Federal Reserve officials today to discuss compensation, as well as regulation. The Fed is looking to take information from the meeting and get a look at the compensation trends, as well as practices used by the companies.</p><p>We also have some breaking earnings news at this hour. Sysco, which is Sysco with an s, the food company, not Cisco the big tech company. It looks like 55 cents are their earnings coming in. That would be a dime better than expectations. We're going to continue to look through and see if we have a revenue call here, which looks like we do, $9.08. That's slightly, just slightly, below the expectation of $9.1 billion. So it looks like a beat for earnings per share. A little bit miss or a little bit light on revenue.</p><p>That's your \"Fox Business Minute.\" When you log on this morning, go download the new Fox Business app. It's the only app that notifies you when your stock hits the target price you want. And you can do this while you're watching the best business television on the web, foxbusiness.com Live. We're online right now, so be sure to check us, foxbusiness.com.</p><p>A quick look at the markets as we head to break. You have more IMUS IN THE MORNING coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: By the way, about Chris Christie, politics aside, because I don't believe any of them, I mean, look what Obama said he was going to do when he got -- and he doesn't -- now he hasn't got any intention of doing any of it. But it's good he's there. It's good for this country. It's good for the world. Same with that fat boy from New Jersey. I mean that boy got a great sense of humor. Got a good answer on vaccinations. And, I mean, you know, the other guy is just a creep. I can -- but here's what I don't -- and Christie's right. If I'm fat, man up and call me fat, bitch, you know. I mean, what is that about?</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS SHOW: Let's go. Bring it on.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS SHOW: Don't beat around the bagel or whatever.</p><p>IMUS: Jon Corzine is a slimy, thieving, Goldman Sachs, gutless, paying his girlfriend on the side weasel.</p><p>MCGUIRK: A proven failure.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, exactly. Bernie is it for politics. I'm in it for the fat boy. How bad could the fat boy be?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: Five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country and on the Fox Business Network. Jenna Lee, Dagen McDowell, Warner Wolf, Chuck, Bernie, Lou, and then Big Kenny all coming up.</p><p>MCCORD: Great.</p><p>IMUS: What do the numbers show in the race in New Jersey, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Still within the statistical margin of error, I-man. Very close. A dead heat.</p><p>IMUS: Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Any hopeful signs?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, yes, Obama was there yesterday and he's not exactly helping out. Carries around a lot of baggage. That's hopeful.</p><p>IMUS: Why would the president -- whether you approve of his policies or not, is a decent moral guy -- why would he campaign for some dirt bag like Jon Corzine? Or was he?</p><p>MCGUIRK: It would just -- it's going to reflect poorly on the president if the three national races -- if he loses all three. If the Democrats lose all three at this particular time. So he needs one victory here and he thinks he can get it in New Jersey. And that's why he's going all out for the Goldman Sachs thug.</p><p>IMUS: Well, we know that Corzine doesn't know what he's doing. And here's how you know -- here's how you know he doesn't know what he's doing.</p><p>MCCORD: Break it down.</p><p>IMUS: Read \"The New York Times\" yesterday and Mayor Bloomberg, whether you like him or not, is one, not a creep, and, two, not a dummy. But you know who he said was a dummy.</p><p>MCCORD: Who?</p><p>IMUS: Corzine. The boy is stupid.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He said that?</p><p>IMUS: Essentially. Implied that. Did you read it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, he said he was a moron.</p><p>MCGUIRK: It just sounds -- it just sounds like something you would say. Corzine's a moron. It doesn't sound like something Bloomberg would say.</p><p>IMUS: I'm paraphrasing the mayor.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: But he said he didn't -- they didn't -- he didn't appear to know -- he didn't appear to know what he was doing.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And essentially they're both doing the same thing, which is buying the election, or trying to, using their own money.</p><p>IMUS: Well, but you could make a case that Bloomberg has done a much better job in New York City than Corzine has done in New Jersey, couldn't you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No question. Without a doubt.</p><p>IMUS: Well, that's Bloomberg's point. I know you don't like Bloomberg, and that's fine, but he's not a creep. That's why -- he doesn't creep you out. And . . .</p><p>MCGUIRK: No ethical stains on his record (ph).</p><p>IMUS: Right, and he's done -- he's done a decent job and he's . . .</p><p>MCGUIRK: And he made his money legitimately, not . . .</p><p>IMUS: He's not a criminal and a gangster.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe we're going too far, huh?</p><p>MCCORD: No. No, you haven't gone too far at all.</p><p>IMUS: And a thug like Corzine.</p><p>MCCORD: No. Go farther.</p><p>IMUS: So we're for the fat boy . . .</p><p>MCCORD: Further.</p><p>IMUS: Who, by the way, the fat boy we're just hoping, at least he's -- he appears to be OK. And what I liked about him, he has a decent sense of humor. He didn't appear to be a complete, total phony. He's not going to cut taxes and he's not going to clean up corruption in New Jersey. And here's -- one, we don't want it cleaned up.</p><p>MCCORD: It's Jersey for God's sakes.</p><p>IMUS: It's New Jersey. Leave it. It's working fine. That part of it is working fine.</p><p>MCCORD: Badabing.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Atmosphere.</p><p>IMUS: And the tax thing, just don't raise taxes and we'll be happy with you. So -- and plus it will make me look great. I mean, I'll be leading Jeff Greenfield around the studio here with a wire coat hanger around his neck. You know what I'm saying?</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: Will that little lupica (ph) be in here tomorrow. That little liberal panty waste. We'll be slapping him around too.</p><p>So, all right, time for a little news now. And here with that is Charles McCord.</p><p>Good morning, Chuck.</p><p>MCCORD: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Suicide bomber aboard a motorbike has killed 30 people, injured 45 today outside a bank near Pakistan's capital. This reporter's on the scene there in the city of Rawalpindi.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Security is generally very, very tight in this area, but police officials on the site said that it is very difficult to stop suicide bombers. This motorcycle rider just happened -- came up to the bank and blew himself up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: And now the continuing violence in Pakistan, some 250 people killed in recent attacks, is prompting the United Nations to suspend long-term development work in the northwestern regions along the border with Afghanistan.</p><p>Afghanistan's election commission says Saturday's presidential runoff cancelled now that Dr. Abdullah Abdullah . . .</p><p>IMUS: What? What? What?</p><p>MCCORD: They've called off the runoff now that Abdullah Abdullah has dropped out of the race. Abdullah says that he decided to get out because he believes there just will be massive voter fraud again and he wants the Afghani people to move on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ABDULLAH ABDULLAH, FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER OF AFGHANISTAN: Only and purely to the interest of the people of Afghanistan and to give the people of Afghanistan a chance to -- to move on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: So that's it. There won't be a runoff. And Afghanistan's election commission has cancelled the vote and proclaimed President Hamid Karzai victor of the nation's tumultuous ballot. Karzai's challenger Abdullah Abdullah having dropped out and they say that's it.</p><p>IMUS: Looks like Pat Cadel (ph), doesn't he?</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: Yes. Separated at birth.</p><p>IMUS: Uh-huh.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's a Halloween picture right there.</p><p>IMUS: Wasn't Pat Cadel a Hollywood guy I always said his nose always stuffed up every time he was on TV. But, yes. Is that Abdullah Abdullah or Pat Cadel?</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's Abdullah, but it's tough to tell the difference.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Don't they look almost like separated at birth? Like Cavuto and that -- well, that's unfair. And Cavuto will be on this program tomorrow, by the way.</p><p>MCCORD: OK. Good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Like you and Betty White, how about that?</p><p>IMUS: I don't think it's helpful . . .</p><p>MCGUIRK: I'm just sticking up for my man Neil.</p><p>IMUS: To say hurtful things to a cancer patient, do you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, it's not.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, God.</p><p>IMUS: Chuck continues.</p><p>MCCORD: Independent health advisors will begin monitoring the safety of the swine flu vaccine today. Specialists are not expecting problems -- doesn't mean that -- because the vaccine is made the same way as the regular winter flu vaccine.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, come on. Come on here.</p><p>MCCORD: But the government is now taking these extra steps, I-man, to track the health of millions who are going to get the shot in order to spot any problems quickly and also to explain anything that crops up, like a false alarm when common disorders coincide with having gotten the inoculation.</p><p>IMUS: Guess who's not going to get one of these?</p><p>MCCORD: Who's that?</p><p>IMUS: Me.</p><p>MCCORD: Meanwhile, White House Senior Advisor David Axelrod says there will be 10 more million doses of the vaccine available by the end of this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: We have 28 -- I'm sorry, 40 million doses. We had 28 million as of last week. It's growing every day. We expect to get 10 million this week. And we're catching up quickly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: I don't know if it works, one. Don't know -- one, don't know if it works. And, two, don't even know if the vaccine is safe, do they? Do they?</p><p>MCCORD: Well . . .</p><p>IMUS: And then here's an e-mail I got from Deirdre Imus. You know here, right?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, I do.</p><p>IMUS: OK. She says -- now this is great. When did I received this, 6:49 a.m. And she writes, Bo is right. Well, now you can't win that argument, can you?</p><p>MCCORD: With her? What argument can you win with her?</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, but . . .</p><p>MCCORD: Good Lord.</p><p>IMUS: Eight million kids are all -- well, he was talking about this medical child abuse.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Where almost every kid who comes to the ranch -- there have been a thousand through there -- almost every kid is on something. Some kind of mood altering deal. Ritalin or some other nonsense. And they put them on it. And do you know why they put them on it, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: How come?</p><p>IMUS: Because nobody wants to spend any time with them to help them deal with it.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So it's a lot easier rather than to find some sort of cure or to -- or to -- or spend time with them or get them on a decent diet, or get them some exercise, or whatever, I mean, obviously there are cases where it is needed, but almost 90 percent of the cases is not. So it's just easier to give them a drug, isn't it?</p><p>MCCORD: Over medicate them.</p><p>IMUS: That's right.</p><p>MCCORD: Shoot 'em up and ship 'em out. Basically what it is.</p><p>IMUS: I like that. But, I mean, I don't like that, but I like the phrase.</p><p>MCCORD: All right.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Time now for the Fox Business Network business report. And here with that is Dagen McDowell.</p><p>Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Fabulous.</p><p>IMUS: So I said to Jenna Lee earlier this morning, off the air, I said, I wouldn't want to be at a party with Liz Claman and Dagen McDowell. I think that could be dangerous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why?</p><p>IMUS: I don't know. I just think three drinks, you both are on the table.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Liz is a tea totaller (ph).</p><p>IMUS: She is?</p><p>MCDOWELL: But she's a -- she is fun, though. She is fun.</p><p>IMUS: She's a nice woman. I like her. And we like you, too, by the way.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, thank you.</p><p>IMUS: What's going on in -- well, wherever?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, where I am . . .</p><p>IMUS: Wall Street or main street or . . .</p><p>MCDOWELL: Where I'm locked in.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, wouldn't you read a Wall Street book by Matt Taibbi?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I would.</p><p>IMUS: Not me. And why? Because he drops the f-bomb a lot. And, two, he will say horrible things personally about everybody on Wall Street.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What was it . . .</p><p>IMUS: Fat, unattractive people.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What did he say about Favre? Having his liver eaten out by piranhas? What was it?</p><p>MCCORD: Pecked out by birds on a . . .</p><p>IMUS: Oh, well, he wanted Brett Favre tied to a rock in the middle of the ocean and wanted his liver pecked out by seagulls or -- well, it was something, yes. Oh, yes, I mean, that's what we want. That's a Wall Street book we will read.</p><p>Anyway, what's going on?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Absolutely.</p><p>Speaking of Liz Claman, she's going to be interviewing the CEO of Ford, Alan Mulally, coming up in the noon hour today. And that's -- there's going to be a lot to talk about because Ford . . .</p><p>IMUS: How does she get all these interviews, I wonder? Like Warren -- well, Warren Buffett's got the hots for her, I know that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because she works her you know what off. She stays in contact with them. She stays on top of the news. She is one of the hardest working woman I know.</p><p>IMUS: Kind of like a Barbara Walters deal. Except with Barbara Walters, Barbara slept with all of them. And I can say that because Barbara's my friend. So . . .</p><p>MCGUIRK: Was your friend.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Liz . . .</p><p>IMUS: What did you say?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Was your friend.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, she even -- Barbara, she understands what she did.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Is that how you got on the show? Please.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>Anyway, what were you going to say now, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Liz is going to be talking with the CEO of ford. She's going to have a lot to talk about because Ford produced almost a $1 billion profit in the most recent quarter. Nobody expected that. Incredible turnaround for the company. And didn't take taxpayer dollars. Didn't go bankrupt like General Motors and Chrysler. So there's going to be -- but that's hurting Ford actually because the unions turned down these wage cuts. The union, the UAW at Ford said no way to more concessions, which they gave to GM and Chrysler.</p><p>IMUS: Charles and I are rolling our eyes.</p><p>MCCORD: No we're not.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, we are.</p><p>MCCORD: Don't include me. I think that's interesting.</p><p>IMUS: No, no, she was talking. You're lying.</p><p>MCCORD: For God's sake.</p><p>IMUS: You are lying.</p><p>MCCORD: I am absolutely not.</p><p>IMUS: She was talking and you were rolling your eyes.</p><p>MCCORD: That is wrong.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why were you rolling your eyes?</p><p>MCCORD: I wasn't.</p><p>IMUS: Because it's too much information for us.</p><p>MCCORD: Not enough.</p><p>IMUS: We can't -- we just can't . . .</p><p>MCCORD: I want to know about the unions.</p><p>IMUS: No, you don't.</p><p>MCCORD: I want to know why they didn't turn . . .</p><p>IMUS: You don't care anything about it.</p><p>MCCORD: Absolutely I do.</p><p>IMUS: He's lying, Dagen.</p><p>MCCORD: I want to know why Ford didn't go bankrupt.</p><p>IMUS: He's just lying.</p><p>MCCORD: And why they were able to get by without any of our money.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can tell you -- I can tell you that.</p><p>IMUS: Ford F-150. Ford F-150, right Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's right. And I -- yes, I can tell you that too because Ford -- Alan Mulally came in and borrowed money way ahead. He planned in advance. He even mortgaged the logo.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: There you go.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: He's our guy.</p><p>All right, Dagen, thank you.</p><p>MCCORD: Foresight instead of hindsight.</p><p>IMUS: Dagen McDowell, who will be on later with business news that make sense as opposed to our ruining her report and we apologize for that. I do.</p><p>It's 16 after the hour, we're talking with Big Kenny coming up and Warner. From the Imus Ranch record, this is Big &amp; Rich. They did a good job of it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update.

We have some earnings reports to tell you about this morning, starting with Sysco, the food company. Sysco with an s, that is. When you take out one-time items, Sysco earning 46 cents a share. That's a penny better than the expectation. Sales, though, slightly lower than what the street was looking for. There's a look at the stock in the pre-market.</p><p>Also, Ford reporting much better than expected results. Earnings coming in at 26 cents a share. Analysts expecting a loss of 12 cents. Revenue of nearly $31 billion, also much better than expected. The company's CFO says the results prove the company's turnaround program is on track. That stock rising in the pre-market as well.

I've only faced, you know, Brad Lidge once or twice, I think, in my whole career. And just not trying to do too much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: A-Rod now two for 14 to share a 1 for 14. Johnny Damon stole second, got up and stole third because no one covered the bag during the over shift for Tashara. Tonight, game five, Philadelphia, 8:00 on Fox. Cliff Lee with a zero point, 54 ERA in the post season against AJ Burnett.</p><p>IMUS: How much rest? Regular rest?</p><p>WOLF: This is regular rest.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, OK.</p><p>WOLF: Yes. Keep in mind, after the series, he has all winter to rest. All winter.</p><p>IMUS: That will be fine.</p><p>WOLF: NFL, Brett Favre return to Green Bay. Four touchdown passes. The Vikings beat the Packers 38-26. Here was Favre on his return to Green Bay.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRETT FAVRE, MINNESOTA VIKINGS: All the Packer fans were there and, I mean, there was some purple. And I saw just a mixture of everything. Cheers. A couple fingers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Eagles rolled over the Giants 40-17. Cowboys win. Dolphin's Ted Ginn Jr. returned two kickoffs for 100 yards and 101 yards. Come on, how about not kicking to him the second time. Here was Jets losing coach Rex Ryan, who has a bye next week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REX RYAN, JETS COACH: You know, we're at 500 and the only way to get out is we've got to come out with our hair on fire.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: Oh, well that will do it.</p><p>The Colts stayed unbeaten.

When ushers asked for Marberry's ticket, he was in the wrong row. He was asked to move, but instead he left when they asked him for his bag.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Oh, no, that's it. You're suspended. Get it.</p><p>Twenty-five after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Please welcome to the program now Big Kenny.</p><p>Good morning, Big Kenny.</p><p>BIG ALPHIN: Thank you, Don. Very good to be here.</p><p>IMUS: Happy birthday.</p><p>ALPHIN: Thank you, thank you, thank you. And happy birthday to my little one. Yes, Lincoln.</p><p>IMUS: Little Lincoln is four years old there, right?</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes, Lincoln's four years old.</p><p>IMUS: We got him a cake. It has instructions (ph).</p><p>ALPHIN: Awesome. Awesome. Good. And everything's going to be great. He loves the celebration.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, he does.</p><p>ALPHIN: He's a celebrating kid.</p><p>IMUS: What does he think? Does he tell you what he thinks when he watches you sing?</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: What does he think?</p><p>ALPHIN: He likes it. He likes it.</p><p>IMUS: He does?</p><p>ALPHIN: He loves being around the instruments and he loves singing and playing music and he's always dressing up like some character. I mean he knows he's Captain America. He knows he's Captain America and he's a rock star. He knows that right now, yes.</p><p>IMUS: So how do you like being out here on your own?</p><p>ALPHIN: I love -- oh, I'm having a blast, man. I love it all. You know, I love the -- having -- being able to play music in every fashion that I have with John and Big &amp; Rich and with all my other friends that I've made music with over the years. I just -- I love what I do. I'm excited now that we're doing -- that I'm doing something different. It lets me speak of where I'm at in my life right now.</p><p>You know, I was a bust (ph) just like Lord knows everybody else here in the early '90s when that first crippling recession came through and I had 75 employees and a construction business. And within three months, every bank that was around went out of business, was taken over by the Comptroller of the Currency, and that was when the savings and loan scandal came through.</p><p>And then I was trying to build my way out of it. I was always singing or humming around on a job site. A buddy comes up one day and says, hey, Kenny, you sing pretty good. You ought to go to Nashville. You know they pay people to write songs down there. And I set my framing hammer down and I look at him and I said, you've got to be kidding. I've been farming and slamming nails all this time and, you know, just, you know, hard work. Making hay. You know, it's hard work.</p><p>And, you know what, over the past 15 years, since I've moved to Nashville, I've found out that song writing is hard work too. Meaning, you have to put a lot of time into it to do something great.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>ALPHIN: But now I've not only gotten to a point where I've had some success in music, but I've got a family, I've got a son. As of this past year, we were able -- me and my wife work with a group called My Sister's Keeper and have a -- got a school built over the past three years right in the middle of Sudan. Got 550 young girls registered in there, having their first chance at education 45 kilometers outside of a war zone. We've got doctors, we're giving away scholarships in the Appellation now because the water's so blooming contaminated and all this area that I call home, you know, we've got to let people know that the water can be killing their kids, like lead paint was back in the '70s, you know.</p><p>IMUS: Please don't turn into my wife.</p><p>ALPHIN: Well, I'm not. But -- and the way to do that is to plant -- have music that's gross.</p><p>IMUS: How does this work? We're talking with Big Kenny here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. The album's called \"The Quite Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy.\" How does this -- how do you plant this? I mean it's an unusual packaging.</p><p>ALPHIN: Well, my -- yes. We had to come up with that.</p><p>IMUS: Remember, a lot of the people are listening to the radio.</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes, we had to come up with that packaging. Instead of using a plastic jewel case, which I just got tired of seeing them stacked around everywhere.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>ALPHIN: You know, I figure, what, there's hundreds of millions of records made every week. If we could just get rid of those one plastic jewel cases, that could be a pile as big as the Empire State Building. Huge. So we made a package that just -- it's a cardboard folder that folds up and you can put your CD, take it out or put it back in or you can take the package and it's plantable. Meaning we put in the cardboard 26 different varieties of my favorite perennial wildflower seeds. So you can just wet the stuff and break it up into pieces and put it in flower pot and plant it or you could just throw it out in your backyard and it's biodegradable, it's compostable. It will just wither to nothing. So worst thing is, if these -- if there are packages everywhere, our way will be paved in flowers.</p><p>IMUS: What's this business about loving everybody, because we don't love anybody.</p><p>ALPHIN: Oh, I don't believe that for a minute.</p><p>IMUS: Well, we don't love everybody.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ALPHIN: Well -- and it just struck me like a lightning bolt. I guess, you know, having gone through a business bust and a lot of other things in my life, and having the time as a writer to spend time a lot of time thinking and writing my thoughts down in all these crazy songs -- and this album of songs that I've written now, it really does describe my life -- I just decided that that was the best way to look at everything, every question that I had, all the things that were consuming my mind that I saw as issues throughout the world, or things that were right around me, with people that were just around me. I said the best thing I can do is just follow one rule, and that's, well, I just love everybody, no matter what.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>ALPHIN: I know it's not the easiest thing in the world, but it can be done.</p><p>IMUS: You have a white aura around you.</p><p>ALPHIN: A white aura?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: That's positive. That's good.</p><p>IMUS: That's good.</p><p>MCCORD: That is good.</p><p>IMUS: Let me ask you a question you have never been asked.</p><p>ALPHIN: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Are you and John going to record again?</p><p>ALPHIN: I hope so, yes. I would think so.</p><p>We've put a lot of energy into building what we've built so far. John is getting ready to be a daddy, I understand, and so a lot of things are changing in his world right now.</p><p>I had to hang upside down last year like a bat. I was trying to get my neck fixed naturally, without having to do what my daddy had been telling me all my life, and that was, \"Son, sooner or later, you're going to have to get your head screwed on straight.\" So this doctor in Nashville finally went in after this injury I sustained in 2002 from being hit by a drunk driver. He went into my throat and my spine.</p><p>He screwed a metal plate. So I am now bionic Big Kenny.</p><p>IMUS: Well, when John was here, he told us you were doing that. I just assumed that he was lying and that you all couldn't get along.</p><p>ALPHIN: No.</p><p>IMUS: Because look at Brooks &amp; Dunn after all these years. Well, Ronnie Dunn finally figured out -- it took him 20 years -- that he is the only one who could sing in that group. So -- I mean, the other guy is fine, but...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ALPHIN: Well, I think it's -- as musicians, it's good for us. John wanted to express a lot of songs that I wouldn't -- that wouldn't naturally come from me. And these songs that make up all of Big Kenny, \"The Quiet Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy,\" these are the songs of my life right now.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you all toured this summer, didn't you?</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes, we toured this summer and did all the Big and Rich classics. And then he played a couple, I played a couple. We had a blast. We did most of the country this summer.</p><p>IMUS: Well, people like you individually. They love -- and they may wind up loving both of you individually.</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes, I would hope so. They call me the Jack White of country music, or the...</p><p>IMUS: Jack White?</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes. He's recorded with Loretta Lynn.</p><p>IMUS: I love Jack White.</p><p>ALPHIN: He's recorded with...</p><p>IMUS: Well, that record he made with Loretta Lynn was great. That was a great record.</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes. I want to make more records just -- I've got a studio built in my back yard now. It didn't necessarily start out like that.</p><p>It started out because I was working so much, touring so much. And we were -- we tried to move across the street because we could park the bus off the street and make our neighbors happier. And then my wife's going to work, and \"All the time you're building the house, you're not going to church enough, honey.\"</p><p>So, to solve that, I had a friend come over. We sketched up a nice little building that looked kind of like a church, and we started building that in the back yard. And then my buddies are coming back going, \"Wow, this would make a great studio.\"</p><p>So now every time at home I've solved all the issues. I'm right there for my kid. He'd come running in just like I could run into the shop when my dad was working on the farm.</p><p>I've got music in a studio around me all the time so I can get quiet, think and write. And, hey, I'm in church too.</p><p>IMUS: Praise the lord. Praise Jesus.</p><p>Big Kenny is going to sing for us in just a little bit here.</p><p>ALPHIN: Amen.</p><p>IMUS: It's 33 after the hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Time now for our business update from the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Here's Jenna Lee.</p><p>LEE: Good morning, everybody. Here's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Bank of America's list of candidates to replace CEO Ken Lewis is looking even shorter after another prospect reportedly told the bank no thanks. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says Bank of America approached Bank of New York Mellon CEO Robert Kelly. Kelly has been approached before for succeeding Ken Lewis, but is showing no interest in the job as of yet.</p><p>Bernie Madoff's auditors expected to plead guilty. Prosecutors say David Friehling reached a deal with the government and will enter his plea tomorrow.</p><p>In the meantime, in a jailhouse interview, Bernie Madoff telling the Securities and Exchange Commission he considers current SEC chair Mary Schapiro \"a dear friend,\" and that she \"... probably thinks I wish I never knew this guy.\"</p><p>Moving on to a different story here, winter came early in Beijing. The city waking up to snow on Sunday, to the earliest snowfall in 10 years.</p><p>Meteorologists seated (ph) clouds with silver iodide, forcing the snow to fall. Beijing's city offices said because it's suffering from a drought, it won't miss an opportunity for artificial precipitation.</p><p>There's a look at it. It looks like a lot of snow.</p><p>Quick earnings news for you. Clorox saying H1N1, the flu, actually helping out sales. They had a big beat here. Adjusted earnings, $1.18, versus the expectation of 95 cents. Revenue right in line with expectations, $1.37 billion.</p><p>That's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>If you're on the move this morning or at a computer, check us out for all the latest business headlines -- FoxBusiness.com/livemorningedition, streaming on your iPhone and online.</p><p>Here's a quick look at the futures. We have more IMUS IN THE MORNING coming up.</p><p>MCCORD: The House plan includes a government-run public run option and is expected to cost less than $900 billion over 10 years. House Republican Mike Pence of Indiana, though, fears it goes way too far and calls it, in fact, a freight train.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, at some point, don't you have to say to grandma, look, that's enough?</p><p>MCCORD: No. What are you talking about?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, maybe, but coming from the government is a little...</p><p>MCCORD: Why would you say that to grandma under any circumstances?</p><p>IMUS: Well, grandma is sitting there with the food falling out of her mouth, staring at the TV, and the TV is not on.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: I mean...</p><p>MCCORD: That's just great.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm just saying.</p><p>MCCORD: So you slip over behind grandma...</p><p>MCGUIRK: Be careful what you wish for.</p><p>IMUS: You can tell he's a sweet guy.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, he's a lovely man.</p><p>IMUS: He just looks at me and he says, \"Why do you hate everybody?\" I said no, it's a joke. We don't hate everybody, we just hate you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: No, we don't hate anybody. Well, we hate -- do we hate -- no, we don't hate anybody. We just don't love everybody.</p><p>All right. Well, an album you can plant, that's reason enough to buy it, \"The Quiet Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy.\"</p><p>Once again, please welcome Big Kenny.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man, that's a great song. That's a great song.</p><p>Big Kenny, he'll be back with one more.</p><p>It's 17 until the hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Time now for a business update from the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: Hi. Good morning to you.</p><p>And coming up just moments from now on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" I will be in for Alexis, and I'll be joined by a couple of former senators -- Bob Graham and Jim Talent. They're on different sides of the aisle, but both men agree that investing in vaccines is important to the nation's security. We're talking H1N1.</p><p>We'll find out why on \"THE OPENING BELL.\"</p><p>All right. Let's get to your \"Fox Business Minute\" now, with AIG dropping its plans to sell some Japanese units.</p><p>According to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" AIG is going to keep two of the three life insurance units initially it had tried to sell. Now, this fits with the plan set forward by the CEO, Robert Benmosche, when he took over back in August. AIG, by the way, still owes the government some $85 billion.</p><p>The liquidation of Lehman Brothers continues with a sale of more than $1 million worth of art. The 283 lots brought in a total of $1.35 million, nearly twice the expectations. Now, the artwork once hung on the walls of Lehman's corporate offices here in New York, and the money hardly puts a dent on the $250 billion that Lehman still owes its creditors.</p><p>Now, the big news this morning from Ford, For Motor Company reporting third quarter earnings results that blew past analysts' estimates. They reported a profit of 26 cents a share, $30.9 billion in revenue, when they were expected to have lost money.</p><p>Ford says its turnaround plan is on track for the time frame they've targeted. You see the stock. It's higher in pre-market trading.</p><p>That is your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Speaking of higher, let's take a look at the futures this morning. They are also pointing to the possibility of a higher open on Wall Street.</p><p>We'll be covering it all on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" which is coming up at the top of the hour. I will be in for Alexis on that.</p><p>More IMUS IN THE MORNING right now on Fox Business.</p><p>IMUS: Eleven minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all the country and on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>I just got an e-mail from the ayatollah, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: What's this one? God Almighty.</p><p>IMUS: Well, that would be Mrs. Imus.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, boy. What does she want?</p><p>IMUS: She says, regarding Big Kenny, \"What a great guy he is. His glasses look like yours.\"</p><p>OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: \"We should be planting every CD cover. When we buy plastic CD covers,\" according to my wife, who is to the right of Sean Hannity, she says, \"the terrorists win.\"</p><p>Well, all right.</p><p>Neil Cavuto will have the fat boy on tonight, our guy, Chris Christie. And -- now I'm not sure they will be in the same studio. I'm not sure that that's possible, actually.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCGUIRK: That ain't right.</p><p>IMUS: They'll be a two-shot, those two boys.</p><p>MCGUIRK: You got your wide screen.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>Coming up next hour, Matt Taibbi from \"Rolling Stone.\"</p><p>Tomorrow, Mike Lupica. His new book, \"Million-Dollar Throw,\" Wyatt Imus read and loved. And, of course, Lupica has written four or five of them, \"The New York Times\" number one bestsellers.</p><p>And then on Wednesday, Jeff Greenfield from CBS and Monica Crowley from way out there where the buses don't run. So that kind of situation.</p><p>All right, time for one more here. You all please welcome once again, singing something from -- that last song, that was a great song. This is from -- oh, how about this one, Imus? Maybe this would be great, too -- \"The Quite Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy,\" Big Kenny.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Big Kenny.</p><p>ALPHIN: Thank you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IMUS: Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program from Fox News, actually, and his own syndicated national radio program that is doing splendid, our old friend Alan Colmes.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Colmes.</p><p>ALAN COLMES, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Hello, Mr. Imus.</p><p>IMUS: Well, how about all the stuff President Obama promised he was going to do and he's done none of it? None of it.</p><p>COLMES: The guy's been in office a few minutes.</p><p>IMUS: None of it. He's been in office almost a year. He has done nof it.</p><p>COLMES: OK. That justifies Lieberman.</p><p>IMUS: He has done none of it.</p><p>COLMES: He's getting out of Iraq in 22 months.</p><p>IMUS: He was the agent of change. He's not going to get out of Iraq in anything.</p><p>COLMES: Sure he is.</p><p>IMUS: How about \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell?\" How about Guantanamo?</p><p>COLMES: I'd like to see him move faster on some things. He inherited a nightmare from the previous administration.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, well, you can't spend the rest of your life blaming that incompetent buffoon who was the president before this guy.</p><p>COLMES: You've got to sweep up the mess that was left.</p><p>IMUS: Well, yes, but grab a mop and get busy then, as he said.</p><p>COLMES: What do you think he's doing? He was just praised for going to Dover Air Force Base. That's change you can believe.</p><p>IMUS: That's one thing he did that was good.</p><p>MCCORD: Symbolic.</p><p>IMUS: I like the guy, by the way. I mean, Sean Hannity, it makes him insane when I say that, but I do like him. But I don't think he has any idea what he's doing, and he's more interested in being president...</p><p>COLMES: Oh, that's just ridiculous.</p><p>IMUS: ... spending five hours playing golf with that dope Tom Friedman.</p><p>COLMES: I'm with O'Reilly on this one. The guy's not allowed to have a golf game?</p><p>IMUS: No, not to...</p><p>COLMES: The guy can't go enjoy himself for a few hours?</p><p>IMUS: No, no, not to -- no, come on. Do you have five hours to go play -- you probably do, but I don't have five hours to go do anything.</p><p>COLMES: Wait a minute. So, when George W. Bush said, \"I'm playing through\" after he was talking about the tragedy of 9/11, that was OK, right?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I didn't say it was OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: I didn't vote for him. I didn't vote for him either time. What are you talking about?</p><p>COLMES: Well, I'm just pointing out to your audience the hypocrisy there.</p><p>IMUS: Pardon me?</p><p>COLMES: I'm pointing out the hypocrisy in the situation.</p><p>IMUS: Well, it's completely lost on me, and now you've irritated me. So...</p><p>COLMES: Oh, I'm really sorry.</p><p>IMUS: No you're not. You don't care at all.</p><p>COLMES: I don't know how I can make it up to you.</p><p>IMUS: You don't care about me.</p><p>COLMES: Yes, I do.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IMUS: Tonight at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Fox Business Network, Neil Cavuto will interview our new favorite fat boy, New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Chris Christie.</p><p>And speaking of -- well, not fat boys, but Cavuto -- but then we could make a case for -- well, whatever. He'll be on this program tomorrow morning, along with Mike Lupica. He'll be talking about his new book, \"Million- Dollar Throw.\"</p><p>Right now, time for \"THE OPENING BELL.\"</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox NewsNetwork, LLC.

And a quick look at futures as we show you Oil and Gold. imus in the morning is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: Based on the interview that he did yesterday on his program Chris Christie -- if he doesn't get elected government in New Jersey, maybe there is something is wrong.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Politics -- but -- like Corzine is just a slimy, sleazy, Goldman Sachs thief, and an arrogant idiot dirt bag. All of that. But why do we need to get into this name calling, Bernie?</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, HOST: Well, don't hold back here I-man.</p><p>IMUS: Here's what I don't like about, when I got fired, you know, and when I was coming back to work, this moron -- I wasn't going to talk about this but I will. He had some statement about what he thought that I ought to have to do to come back to work. And here's what he have to do -- he ought to kiss my ass. How does that sound?</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentlemen, imus in the morning.</p><p>IMUS: Third day to my mind Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I will go down in history. February 15, 2004, when the Yankees traded for A-Rod.</p><p>MCCORD: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And of course, May 8, 2009, when it came back from a hit a home run.</p><p>MCCORD: Just exploded.</p><p>IMUS: There was never a doubt in my mind at any point that going back to February 15th, 2004, at the Yankees for marching on their way to the 27th world championship.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, HOST: May I just add rocket propelled to their 27th.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: So, way to go A-Rod.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, WARNER SPORT'S HOST: The name of the law (ph).</p><p>IMUS: What's the matter Warner?</p><p>(ALL TALKING AT ONCE)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: The fat boy will be on with Cavuto.

You know, he figured out a way to put together $16 billion.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, he did.</p><p>IMUS: He said to Corzine that he is a moron. And we know Corzine is a creep. And then I was watching the best of Imus, euphemistically speaking of course, on Saturday morning on the Fox Business Network. And half the time when I'm talking to people, I'm checking my e-mail.</p><p>MCCORD: I know its ugly reading his e-mail.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, it's difficult to get me to listen anyway.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, sure because that's a God damn thing.</p><p>IMUS: It is clear I am not listening to a word they are saying.

This is really good.</p><p>IMUS: So happy birthday to Big Kenny. It was his birthday yesterday. And his son's name, I think, is not Ford. It is not Chevy. It is Lincoln.</p><p>MCCORD: Lincoln, OK.</p><p>IMUS: Or Jefferson. No, it's Lincoln. It is Lincoln's birthday today.</p><p>MCCORD: Great.</p><p>IMUS: So, we got him a little cake.

This is hopefully at the Seven Game Series.</p><p>IMUS: All right.</p><p>WOLF: And Charlie Manuel, I mean, I can't understand, he will going to get second guess forever. I don't care about three day's arrest. Cliff Lee had to pitch last night when you are down two games to one.</p><p>IMUS: Now you are down three to one.</p><p>WOLF: And now, you're down three to one. He had to pitch last night.</p><p>IMUS: He's going to pitch tonight?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, but if he wins you're still down now three-two. He had to pitch in the fourth game if you trail tow games to one.</p><p>IMUS: Well, but he didn't do it.</p><p>WOLF: He didn't do it. No.</p><p>IMUS: He will going to pitch tonight?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, that's right Imus.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Let's have to move on.</p><p>WOLF: Oh, my God.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: He didn't pitch last night so .</p><p>IMUS: He's going first.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: All right.

Suspected militants have struck Pakistan numerous times in recent weeks.

I'm fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Fabulous.</p><p>IMUS: What does this CIT thing mean?</p><p>MCDOWELL: CIT bankruptcy means that $2 billion have been lost to the American taxpayer. It is not coming back. We're never going to get it back.</p><p>This is the first recorded loss of the financial bailout last year.

You name it, it's making money doing it.</p><p>You know what? You know this morning -- you know who made money? Surprisingly Ford. Ford turned in a $1 billion profit for the quarter; made money in North America for the first time since the beginning of 2005.</p><p>Again, it's really winning out because it didn't take government money.

That is about three quarters of the economy is the consumers.</p><p>By the way, you have to tee-up that video of Ron Newman, that accident yesterday. That was something.</p><p>IMUS: I am sure it was Dagen. Did you watch that race?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I watched the whole thing in my bathrobe with the dogs. Look at that. That was with 5 laps left. It was a snore, the whole thing.</p><p>IMUS: Well, for more than 10 minutes I've been listing to the radio. We're watching a car wreck on.</p><p>Well, let's restrict her plate racing, not to get into a lot -- but the cars, they can't get out of each other's way.

I just can't get to -- what were you saying now?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No.</p><p>IMUS: Forty-five percent tax break --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: That's what she was saying, for God's sake.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Your taxes are going up.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you hollering at me? I'm a cancer patient.</p><p>MCCORD: Pay attention.</p><p>IMUS: I'm battling cancer here.</p><p>MCCORD: Your country is going to hell. Come on.

I want a second opinion. It's like Warner Wolf's predictions.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Yes, come on.</p><p>It is 33 minutes past the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the radio all over the country and on the FOX Business Network. Big Kenny will be back next hour. We're going to talk to him. Get to the bottom of a number of issues, right, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: It's a complicated life.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Big Kenny says love everybody.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Of course we don't love anybody.</p><p>MCCORD: No indeed.</p><p>IMUS: But maybe he can turn us around. Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program now from \"Rolling Stone\" magazine Matt Taibbi.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Taibbi.</p><p>MATT TAIBBI, \"ROLLING STONE\" CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: Good morning, I- Man.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>TAIBBI: Good morning, Charles. Good. Yourself?</p><p>IMUS: We're going to have a discussion about Mr. Taibbi's goatee which we like, right?</p><p>MCCORD: The vote is in.</p><p>TAIBBI: You're all making me uncomfortable.</p><p>MCCORD: Really?</p><p>IMUS: Well, you've got to be comfortable enough. We are.</p><p>MCCORD: Accept the compliment.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: All right.</p><p>IMUS: We're not coming on to you.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>TAIBBI: That comes later, right?</p><p>IMUS: He's trying to get you in the limo.</p><p>MCCORD: Except you do look awfully good.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Trick-or-treat.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Anyway, so they've cancelled the elections in Afghanistan. I know you and I were talking about that. We can talk about anything.</p><p>TAIBBI: I'm happy to talk about Afghanistan.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know what that means, do you?</p><p>TAIBBI: I have no idea.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know what it means, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Just the Independent Election Commission has cancelled it and declared Karzai the victor during a news conference in Kabul today.</p><p>IMUS: Well, Duran Duran -- what was the guy's name?</p><p>TAIBBI: Abdullah Abdullah.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: Dr. Duran Duran, you're right.</p><p>IMUS: He bailed out because it was so phony. And the Secretary of State said what now? She said this is just an affirmation that, you know, the process is -- I don't know, she read something into it. It sounds to me.</p><p>MCCORD: It was a bit positive.</p><p>TAIBBI: That's his name Abdullah, Abdullah?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: Dr. Abdullah Abdullah.</p><p>TAIBBI: Any gulf statesmen should have at least one double name like Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: It's a good, you know, Barack Barack Obama. I mean, it would work well.</p><p>IMUS: So in the current issue of \"Rolling Stone,\" you write about sports logos?</p><p>TAIBBI: Right. It's actually \"Men's Journal.\"</p><p>IMUS: \"Men's Journal.\"</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes, yes. No, it's just sort of event, the commercialization phenomenon, you know, about how, you know, it's gotten to the point I think the economy is so bad now that they're trying so desperately to rescue profits in the sports business that I think they've really gone too far and they've basically sucked the life out of, you know, the sports watching process.</p><p>I don't know about you. I mean, I spent all last year trying to get that $5 foot long, you know, theme song out of my head. Every time I hear it, I want to drive a fork into my eardrum. I just can't take it anymore.</p><p>IMUS: Well, here's the -- and the names of these -- be helpful, by the way, if I did some research prior to Mr. Taibbi coming in and knew which magazine he wrote in. \"Men's Journal\" is the one with Tim McGraw on the cover, by the way. And he reveals I'm not sure what, something.</p><p>Here's the thing about people like Tim McGraw and these others. I guess that's how they get on the magazines but they reveal stuff about themselves that we don't want to know. I mean, I just -- it's like Andre Agassi have you heard about his new book?</p><p>TAIBBI: Oh, yes, with the whole meth -- doing meth. And actually he talks about how meth is really, really, you know, great. You know, it kind of resold me on the experience, you know.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I thought man, I forgot how good that was. I read those excerpts.</p><p>IMUS: But there's another excerpt, it's coming in here. When is he coming in, Bernie, next week or so?</p><p>BERNIE MCGUIRK: November 12th.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Apparently, remember when he had great looking hair.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right, and then he went bald and yes --</p><p>IMUS: Well, it was a rug there in the latter stages of --</p><p>MCCORD: Really?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Was it like extensions or was the whole thing a rug?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm not sure. But it was a rug to the degree that he was afraid it would fall off.</p><p>TAIBBI: Wow.</p><p>IMUS: So he says that he in the 1990 French Open finals.</p><p>TAIBBI: OK.</p><p>IMUS: There's a reason he lost. It was his first Grand Slam final.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right.</p><p>IMUS: The reason he lost is because he was worried about his rug falling off.</p><p>TAIBBI: Losing his rug.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Wow, that would have been one of the great ESPN moments of all time. Don't you think?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Top ten deal, it would have been number one forever. Big clump of hair there flying on the clay in rolling hills or wherever.</p><p>TAIBBI: Did you see that Manu Ginobili actually killed a bat in the middle of a game.</p><p>MCCORD: I saw that.</p><p>TAIBBI: The basketball game last week?</p><p>IMUS: No. Where did this happen?</p><p>TAIBBI: Sacramento.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Bat flew under -- and the guy actually -- you wax it with his hand, and the bat falls on the ground and it's like twitching and dying and he reaches down and grabs it, no hesitation whatsoever.</p><p>MCCORD: He walked over and handed it to somebody.</p><p>TAIBBI: It was the cool -- it was like he knew who to hand it to.</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly.</p><p>TAIBBI: Where's the guy you hand the bat to after? You know what I mean?</p><p>IMUS: The bat is in the stadium there or in the arena at Sacramento?</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: It starts flying around in the middle of the game. It was the weirdest thing ever.</p><p>MCCORD: It's Halloween.</p><p>TAIBBI: But not as weird as Andre Agassi's hair falling off in the middle of the French Open.</p><p>IMUS: What I'm thinking, how did he -- was he worried about it falling off in the semifinals. Great. Or the quarterfinals?</p><p>MCCORD: When did he start -- when did it become an issue, a distraction?</p><p>IMUS: Yes, you can't --</p><p>TAIBBI: Well, maybe -- I mean, you've got to think about the fact that he really only surged as a player after he committed to the whole bald look.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right? I mean --</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Maybe -- I mean, that wasn't until like eight years later. But I mean, still, maybe that was when he stopped worrying about it.</p><p>IMUS: Well, he never used to be able to finish five set matches, that whole thing.</p><p>TAIBBI: Well, it's hard to do after you've been, you know, taking meth for three days straight, you know.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't think he did for fun -- didn't do it for a lot of years, did he?</p><p>MCCORD: One year I think.</p><p>IMUS: One year.</p><p>TAIBBI: Oh, OK.</p><p>IMUS: Now Martina Navratilova wants him to give back all of his -- all of his Grand Slam trophies and so on.</p><p>TAIBBI: Because he was wearing a wig?</p><p>IMUS: No, because he was doing crystal meth.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Will it make you play better or just make you want to clean the stadium?</p><p>MCCORD: Swat a bat.</p><p>TAIBBI: I'm not sure taking meth would make you play better.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, me either.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Talking with Matt Taibbi from Rolling Stone. We're talking about sports logos. I was going to mention here at 21 until the hour, when I watch basketball which is more than I like to admit, I was watching Shaquille O'Neal and Lebron James, they were playing somebody, I forget --</p><p>TAIBBI: Celtics probably.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And Quicken Loans Arena.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, it's like it's named after a pawnshop.</p><p>TAIBBI: Oh, yes, I know especially all the different companies that went out of business in the last, you know, ten years, they're in business for, you know, a year, long enough to rip off five million people. They get their name on the stadium and then they go out of business. Like Enron Field and all that.</p><p>IMUS: And Citi Field.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right.</p><p>IMUS: Because you know a lot about digressing wildly here, a lot about Wall Street and that whole --</p><p>TAIBBI: They should call it bailout field is what they should call it.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. I thought -- my wife told me about CIT last night. And I thought that was Citigroup, but it's not. It's different. CIT is who?</p><p>TAIBBI: CIT? That's the business that Goldman got involved with, but Citi Field is Citigroup.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So that's not the office.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: . that claimed bankruptcy, right, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: No. No.</p><p>IMUS: That's CIT.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right, right.</p><p>IMUS: And how is Goldman --</p><p>TAIBBI: Well, Goldman is getting preferential treatment in the bankruptcy. I forget how that all works, but that was like the last time I was on the show. So that was weeks ago. I've been doing so much meth in the meantime, I've forgotten what that was all about.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>So, I really don't know.</p><p>IMUS: As long as we're at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, how is the football coach of the Browns doing? You wrote about -- you wrote about it.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes. I took a lot of heat in Cleveland because I compared Eric Mangini to Augustus Gloop. You know, remember the fat kid in the Willy Wonka movie?</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>TAIBBI: You know, he falls into the chocolate river, right?</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes. OK.</p><p>TAIBBI: You know, because he's too greedy and Gene Wilder is like oh, help, you know, save him. Right? So I wrote a column because we have a football column in \"Rolling Stone\" now where I compared Mangini to that's where Augustus Gloop has been all these years. He resurfaces, you know.</p><p>And I've been getting like death threats from Cleveland ever since -- they've quieted down since the Bears recent losing streak because people are turning their anger towards Mangini now. But --</p><p>IMUS: Well, the Browns are like one of seven, right?</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes. I mean, you know, Mangini comes in and he's like fining guys $1,700 for not paying for a bottle of water in their hotel room and that kind of stuff and you do this before even winning a game. Of course, you're going to lose. I mean, these guys are, you know, doing more land down on TV than Paris Hilton, you know. I mean, the Browns. So, it's been a rough year for Cleveland. I hate to pick on that city, but yes, there's nothing you can do.</p><p>IMUS: How do these guys like Mangini who didn't do all that great a job -- I guess he had one good year with the Jets, right?</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes, he had one good year. What I thought was interesting though is that he got his head coaching job after he took over the Patriots defense for one year which had been one of the best defenses in the league for years and years and years. And then he takes it over and it's like 15th or 16th in the league and he gets a head coaching job.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: You know, it's like the Peter Principle. People get promoted to their level of incompetence and in the NFL it just seems to happen more quickly than in other places.</p><p>IMUS: Why does it happen? Why would he be blown out of a job with the Jets? Why would Cleveland think he's the answer?</p><p>TAIBBI: I think Cleveland has been trying to, you know, make up for their mistake of having let Bill Belichick go too early for the last, you know, five or six years. So they've, you know, now hired two successive Bill Belichick lieutenants and Mangini is, you know, he even physically resembles Belichick in a lot of ways. He obviously tries to take after him. And, you know, he's bad with the media the same way that Belichick is. You know, he's a disciplinarian.</p><p>I think they were trying to recapture that magic. I don't know what it is. And then, you know, I think they're probably also trying to stick it to Belichick by hiring him. So, but it just didn't work out. This has been --</p><p>IMUS: How long was --</p><p>TAIBBI: He's cursed, you know.</p><p>IMUS: How long was Belichick there?</p><p>TAIBBI: He was there for five years. He had one winning season but, you know, he didn't figure it out until of course he left Cleveland which is what happens to everybody who lives in Cleveland.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You know what that is? It's like Buffalo. You know, nobody who actually is from Buffalo actually succeeds at life. It never happens to them while they're in Buffalo. You know what I mean?</p><p>IMUS: It's 17 until the hour. We're talking with Matt Taibbi from the \"Rolling Stone\" here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program and \"Men's Journal.\"</p><p>Where are you on Brett Favre?</p><p>TAIBBI: I actually wrote a sports column earlier this year calling for Brett Favre to be chained to a rock in the middle of the ocean so that he could have his liver pecked out by sea birds for the rest of eternity.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: Come on, man. Don't hold back.</p><p>TAIBBI: I don't know. I mean, I'm sure I'm not alone. I'm just kind of sick of the whole phenomenon. Are you? I mean, every time I turn on the television the guy is staring back at me. I thought he gets the mirror in the house. You know --</p><p>IMUS: I was talking to Mike Lupica. I said who do you want to win the Packers/Vikings game? It's got to be the Packers. This guy can't go up there and win. I mean --</p><p>TAIBBI: But he did, you know. Yes.</p><p>And actually it's turning into what could have been kind of a really, really boring and overdone media story. The only way they could have saved this is by Brett Favre actually playing out of his mind and having actually a great year to warrant all the hype and he's doing it. So I think it's turning out to be a great thing for the NFL.</p><p>If he had come back and they were four and three and he was throwing a bunch of picks, you know, it would have been a nightmare because we'd still be hearing about it just as much but it wouldn't be, you know, worthwhile. So --</p><p>IMUS: And one of the strangest resumes of anyone I've ever read, Mr. Taibbi played professional basketball in Mongolia?</p><p>TAIBBI: That's right. Right.</p><p>IMUS: Professional baseball in Russia.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes. I played for the Red Army. Yes, yes.</p><p>I actually I tried to play -- the Russians briefly had a professional football league too.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>TAIBBI: And I tried to get in on that action for a team in St. Petersburg but it was all these ex-hockey players who didn't really understand the rules all that well, so I got two. I got a couple of helmets in the back in the practices and I thought to myself I'm not going to do this too much.</p><p>IMUS: How good did you have to be to be on the Russian army baseball team?</p><p>TAIBBI: Not that good. You know, I mean --</p><p>IMUS: You have to be able to play.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes. I mean, you had to be like, you know, a good high school player basically. I mean, yes, there were three guys that I played with over in Russia who ended up in the minors in the states.</p><p>IMUS: What position did you play?</p><p>TAIBBI: Well, I was a catcher in high school really but I played -- in Russia I ended up having to play center field because one of the guys who ended up being a prospect in the states was a catcher. So, you know, he got the catcher spot.</p><p>IMUS: And then the basketball in Mongolia, how did that happen?</p><p>TAIBBI: I was playing basketball in the street in Moscow and I met a Mongolian guy who told me they had this thing called the MBA, the Mongolian Basketball Association. So I went into work the next day and quit my job, got on the Trans-Siberian railroad and went to Mongolia and found a team. Got a tryout.</p><p>And I was playing for a team called the Mountain Eagles in the MBA which is the only league in the world that has MBA rules, by the way. It has a 24-second shot clock and a three-point line and everything. I played for them for about a year until I got pneumonia and almost died and had to leave the country.</p><p>IMUS: You were obviously doing meth then, right?</p><p>TAIBBI: That was actually pre-meth, believe it or not. Yes, that was like in -- that was in my healthy period.</p><p>IMUS: I got to quit my job here in Moscow and go to Mongolia and play basketball.</p><p>MCCORD: Get on the train.</p><p>IMUS: Are you going to do a book on this Wall Street thing, by the way?</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes, I'm working on it right now.</p><p>IMUS: Good.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes, yes.</p><p>IMUS: People still -- Frank Rich, if you can believe this, quoting your Goldman Sachs line.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right.</p><p>IMUS: . in a Frank Rich \"New York Times\" column. So all of the stuff you did and all the stuff you learned is certainly worth a book.</p><p>TAIBBI: I hope so. You know, one of the problems I'm finding though is that the public has a very, very limited appetite for the Wall Street story. They're interested in it just long enough to get upset about it but --</p><p>IMUS: Here's why they'll like yours. I'm telling you I'm being serious, why we like you, why I like you. Because you're willing to say awful things about these people and you're willing to call them awful names.</p><p>MCCORD: Like people getting their liver pecked out on a remote island.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Yes. And you're a great writer and you're willing to resort to physical humor. And that appeals to me and my 11-year-old son.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>All right, Matt, thank you very much.</p><p>TAIBBI: Thanks a lot, I-Man.</p><p>IMUS: Matt Taibbi, \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Men's Journal.\" It's 13 until the hour.</p><p>MUSIC: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the FOX Business Network. Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: Time for your \"FOX Business Minute.\" AIG dropping its plans to sell some Japanese units. According to this morning's \"Wall Street Journal,\" AIG is now going to keep two of the three life insurance units it initially had tried to sell. And this fits in with the plan set forward by the CEO, Robert Benmosche, when he took over in August. AIG still owes the government, remember, some 85 billion dollars.</p><p>The liquidation of Lehman Brothers continues with the sale of more than a million dollars worth of art. Two hundred eighty-three lots brought in a total $1.35 million. Nearly twice the expectations that some had for this art work, which once hung in the walls of Lehman's corporate offices right here in New York City. The money hardly puts a dent in the 250 billion that Lehman still owes to its creditors</p><p>And this morning in case you missed it, Ford is already out with its third quarter results way above expectations. They earned 26 cents a share when they were expected to have lost money. $30.9 billion in revenue, also better than expected.</p><p>Stock up in pre-market. Ford with its turnaround plan on track according to the company. And in the next hour, we'll have more earnings coming out. Sysco, the food company, and Clorox set to be reporting their results.</p><p>That's your \"FOX Business Minute.\" When you log on this morning, go download that new FOX Business iPhone app. It's great.

Here we are, up 37 on the Dow.</p><p>More IMUS IN THE MORNING right now.</p><p>IMUS: Taibbi pretty much on automatic.</p><p>MCCORD: He sure is.</p><p>IMUS: Coming up next hour, we're going to talk with Big Kenny, get to the bottom of a number of things for Big Kenny.</p><p>Happy birthday to the boy. It's his birthday yesterday. And his son, adorable little child, 4 years old. Lincoln it's his birthday today. It was Kinky Friedman's birthday yesterday as well.</p><p>Rob and Tony are here. How are you guys?</p><p>ROB BARTLETT: We're fine.</p><p>TONY POWELL: Good.</p><p>IMUS: What's on your mind, Tony.</p><p>POWELL: Well, now, this little girl, Abigail Breslin, the child that played in \"Little Miss Sunshine\" has been cast in the Broadway revival of \"The Miracle Worker,\" the Helen Keller Story.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>POWELL: That little blind, deaf Helen Keller.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>POWELL: Well, there's a little problem because the Alliance for Inclusion, a group that advocates for disabled actors wants them to cast a blind deaf actress to play little Helen Keller. And I'm just thinking they've lost their minds.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>POWELL: Can you imagine how much money that cost in rehearsal just the rehearsal time alone?</p><p>IMUS: No, Tony.</p><p>POWELL: How many times would the director have to yell cut is my point?</p><p>IMUS: Well, there's a way -- isn't there a way they do that?</p><p>POWELL: I don't know. I can't even imagine it. First of all, think about Broadway. You've been to Broadway. Have a blackout, you know, at the end of a scene. That girl is still standing there.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>She wouldn't know.</p><p>IMUS: This is not that funny, Tony.</p><p>POWELL: It is. I mean --</p><p>IMUS: I'm happy this is not racial this time.</p><p>POWELL: Well, no.</p><p>IMUS: Whining about something -- blaming me and Rob for something.</p><p>POWELL: I don't blame Rob. I advocate for all people with all kinds of issues.</p><p>IMUS: No, you don't.</p><p>POWELL: Yes, I do.</p><p>IMUS: Most of the time you don't.</p><p>POWELL: I mean I understand. I mean, again, I just have a problem with this. I mean, you know, when you cast a play, you cast the best actor available. I mean, you wouldn't cast a stutterer to play Hamlet. That's a long show.</p><p>You go for a Sunday matinee, you don't leave until Tuesday. That's just stupid.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>POWELL: I'm just saying. Man, that's all. That's my only point. That's it.</p><p>IMUS: Be a convoy of news trucks out here today. Because you know what I'd be happy? For once they won't be here for me.</p><p>POWELL: I'm not.</p><p>IMUS: They'll be here for you.</p><p>MUSIC: Imus, Imus, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hey there.</p><p>IMUS: Did you get --</p><p>IMUS: Go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Did you get your hair fixed and everything?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I think I did. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It looks good.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, God.</p><p>IMUS: I have a little mirror here that Cavuto got me so I can check it every once in a while.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Curtains on the Titanic. Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: I don't need those kinds of comments from you, Bernard. You look like Casper the ghost grandfather. I mean, just butt out.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCGUIRK: What?</p><p>IMUS: What's the big business news this morning?</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're going to be -- we're going to be watching personal spending and income. It comes out at the bottom of the hour.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>How do I follow up? Well, speaking of Casper, at least Bernie doesn't need to buy a costume for tomorrow, right?</p><p>IMUS: No, he doesn't. But don't start in on him.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Wait a minute. You're in trouble.</p><p>IMUS: You're in trouble. Hold down a second. It's just better if you just don't say anything to him.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I wonder above the fence line. I wonder what's happening here.</p><p>IMUS: It's just like poking a -- it's just like taking a sharp stick and poking a lion. Right, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly. God almighty.</p><p>IMUS: Digressing like a drunk at a Christmas party.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: Where's your husband from?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Born and raised in New York City.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So --</p><p>MCDOWELL: His parents are artists. Now they live up in the woods in Massachusetts on a dirt road, and they are as left as they come. Nancy Pelosi is not liberal enough for them.</p><p>IMUS: What -- what do they -- how was that when he brought you home?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Hey, look, Morticia Adams is here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Here we go.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's actually pretty good. That's pretty good. I've gone as Morticia because I don't have a buy a costume. I got a closet full of black clothes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I've got the complexion of a flounder. There you go.</p><p>IMUS: You're firing me. Thank you very much, Dagen.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DON IMUS, HOST: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update. From the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, everybody. Coming up on IMUS IN THE MORNING, Big Kenny, of Big and Rich fame, will be back with Imus this morning to play some music and talk a little bit to us. So we're looking forward to that. Let's talk a little bit about some business news now with your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>CIT Group filing for bankruptcy. It's the fifth largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. The lender was unable to get its bondholders to agree to a debt for equity offer. But according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" CIT does have support for a prepackaged bankruptcy plan, including funding from billionaire investor Carl Icahn. This could allow CIT to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of the year.</p><p>It was certainly a big weekend for bank failures as feds seized nine more banks. The most ever to be shut down in one day since the financial crisis began. The banks will reopen today as U.S. bank branches after the company steps in and agrees to assume their deposits. They have and they will. This brings the total of bank failures so far this year to 115.</p><p>In other banking news, executives from the country's 28 largest banks are meeting with Federal Reserve officials today to discuss compensation, as well as regulation. The Fed is looking to take information from the meeting and get a look at the compensation trends, as well as practices used by the companies.</p><p>We also have some breaking earnings news at this hour. Sysco, which is Sysco with an s, the food company, not Cisco the big tech company. It looks like 55 cents are their earnings coming in. That would be a dime better than expectations. We're going to continue to look through and see if we have a revenue call here, which looks like we do, $9.08. That's slightly, just slightly, below the expectation of $9.1 billion. So it looks like a beat for earnings per share. A little bit miss or a little bit light on revenue.</p><p>That's your \"Fox Business Minute.\" When you log on this morning, go download the new Fox Business app. It's the only app that notifies you when your stock hits the target price you want.

You have more IMUS IN THE MORNING coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: By the way, about Chris Christie, politics aside, because I don't believe any of them, I mean, look what Obama said he was going to do when he got -- and he doesn't -- now he hasn't got any intention of doing any of it. But it's good he's there. It's good for this country. It's good for the world. Same with that fat boy from New Jersey. I mean that boy got a great sense of humor. Got a good answer on vaccinations. And, I mean, you know, the other guy is just a creep. I can -- but here's what I don't -- and Christie's right. If I'm fat, man up and call me fat, bitch, you know. I mean, what is that about?</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS SHOW: Let's go. Bring it on.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS SHOW: Don't beat around the bagel or whatever.</p><p>IMUS: Jon Corzine is a slimy, thieving, Goldman Sachs, gutless, paying his girlfriend on the side weasel.</p><p>MCGUIRK: A proven failure.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, exactly. Bernie is it for politics. I'm in it for the fat boy. How bad could the fat boy be?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: Five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country and on the Fox Business Network. Jenna Lee, Dagen McDowell, Warner Wolf, Chuck, Bernie, Lou, and then Big Kenny all coming up.</p><p>MCCORD: Great.</p><p>IMUS: What do the numbers show in the race in New Jersey, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Still within the statistical margin of error, I-man. Very close. A dead heat.</p><p>IMUS: Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Any hopeful signs?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, yes, Obama was there yesterday and he's not exactly helping out. Carries around a lot of baggage. That's hopeful.</p><p>IMUS: Why would the president -- whether you approve of his policies or not, is a decent moral guy -- why would he campaign for some dirt bag like Jon Corzine? Or was he?</p><p>MCGUIRK: It would just -- it's going to reflect poorly on the president if the three national races -- if he loses all three. If the Democrats lose all three at this particular time. So he needs one victory here and he thinks he can get it in New Jersey. And that's why he's going all out for the Goldman Sachs thug.</p><p>IMUS: Well, we know that Corzine doesn't know what he's doing. And here's how you know -- here's how you know he doesn't know what he's doing.</p><p>MCCORD: Break it down.</p><p>IMUS: Read \"The New York Times\" yesterday and Mayor Bloomberg, whether you like him or not, is one, not a creep, and, two, not a dummy. But you know who he said was a dummy.</p><p>MCCORD: Who?</p><p>IMUS: Corzine. The boy is stupid.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He said that?</p><p>IMUS: Essentially. Implied that. Did you read it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, he said he was a moron.</p><p>MCGUIRK: It just sounds -- it just sounds like something you would say. Corzine's a moron. It doesn't sound like something Bloomberg would say.</p><p>IMUS: I'm paraphrasing the mayor.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: But he said he didn't -- they didn't -- he didn't appear to know -- he didn't appear to know what he was doing.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And essentially they're both doing the same thing, which is buying the election, or trying to, using their own money.</p><p>IMUS: Well, but you could make a case that Bloomberg has done a much better job in New York City than Corzine has done in New Jersey, couldn't you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No question. Without a doubt.</p><p>IMUS: Well, that's Bloomberg's point. I know you don't like Bloomberg, and that's fine, but he's not a creep. That's why -- he doesn't creep you out. And . . .</p><p>MCGUIRK: No ethical stains on his record (ph).</p><p>IMUS: Right, and he's done -- he's done a decent job and he's . . .</p><p>MCGUIRK: And he made his money legitimately, not . . .</p><p>IMUS: He's not a criminal and a gangster.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe we're going too far, huh?</p><p>MCCORD: No. No, you haven't gone too far at all.</p><p>IMUS: And a thug like Corzine.</p><p>MCCORD: No. Go farther.</p><p>IMUS: So we're for the fat boy . . .</p><p>MCCORD: Further.</p><p>IMUS: Who, by the way, the fat boy we're just hoping, at least he's -- he appears to be OK. And what I liked about him, he has a decent sense of humor. He didn't appear to be a complete, total phony. He's not going to cut taxes and he's not going to clean up corruption in New Jersey. And here's -- one, we don't want it cleaned up.</p><p>MCCORD: It's Jersey for God's sakes.</p><p>IMUS: It's New Jersey. Leave it. It's working fine. That part of it is working fine.</p><p>MCCORD: Badabing.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Atmosphere.</p><p>IMUS: And the tax thing, just don't raise taxes and we'll be happy with you. So -- and plus it will make me look great. I mean, I'll be leading Jeff Greenfield around the studio here with a wire coat hanger around his neck. You know what I'm saying?</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: Will that little lupica (ph) be in here tomorrow. That little liberal panty waste. We'll be slapping him around too.</p><p>So, all right, time for a little news now. And here with that is Charles McCord.</p><p>Good morning, Chuck.</p><p>MCCORD: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Suicide bomber aboard a motorbike has killed 30 people, injured 45 today outside a bank near Pakistan's capital. This reporter's on the scene there in the city of Rawalpindi.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Security is generally very, very tight in this area, but police officials on the site said that it is very difficult to stop suicide bombers. This motorcycle rider just happened -- came up to the bank and blew himself up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: And now the continuing violence in Pakistan, some 250 people killed in recent attacks, is prompting the United Nations to suspend long-term development work in the northwestern regions along the border with Afghanistan.</p><p>Afghanistan's election commission says Saturday's presidential runoff cancelled now that Dr. Abdullah Abdullah . . .</p><p>IMUS: What? What? What?</p><p>MCCORD: They've called off the runoff now that Abdullah Abdullah has dropped out of the race. Abdullah says that he decided to get out because he believes there just will be massive voter fraud again and he wants the Afghani people to move on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ABDULLAH ABDULLAH, FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER OF AFGHANISTAN: Only and purely to the interest of the people of Afghanistan and to give the people of Afghanistan a chance to -- to move on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: So that's it. There won't be a runoff. And Afghanistan's election commission has cancelled the vote and proclaimed President Hamid Karzai victor of the nation's tumultuous ballot. Karzai's challenger Abdullah Abdullah having dropped out and they say that's it.</p><p>IMUS: Looks like Pat Cadel (ph), doesn't he?</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: Yes. Separated at birth.</p><p>IMUS: Uh-huh.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's a Halloween picture right there.</p><p>IMUS: Wasn't Pat Cadel a Hollywood guy I always said his nose always stuffed up every time he was on TV. But, yes. Is that Abdullah Abdullah or Pat Cadel?</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's Abdullah, but it's tough to tell the difference.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Don't they look almost like separated at birth? Like Cavuto and that -- well, that's unfair. And Cavuto will be on this program tomorrow, by the way.</p><p>MCCORD: OK. Good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Like you and Betty White, how about that?</p><p>IMUS: I don't think it's helpful . . .</p><p>MCGUIRK: I'm just sticking up for my man Neil.</p><p>IMUS: To say hurtful things to a cancer patient, do you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, it's not.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, God.</p><p>IMUS: Chuck continues.</p><p>MCCORD: Independent health advisors will begin monitoring the safety of the swine flu vaccine today. Specialists are not expecting problems -- doesn't mean that -- because the vaccine is made the same way as the regular winter flu vaccine.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, come on. Come on here.</p><p>MCCORD: But the government is now taking these extra steps, I-man, to track the health of millions who are going to get the shot in order to spot any problems quickly and also to explain anything that crops up, like a false alarm when common disorders coincide with having gotten the inoculation.</p><p>IMUS: Guess who's not going to get one of these?</p><p>MCCORD: Who's that?</p><p>IMUS: Me.</p><p>MCCORD: Meanwhile, White House Senior Advisor David Axelrod says there will be 10 more million doses of the vaccine available by the end of this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: We have 28 -- I'm sorry, 40 million doses. We had 28 million as of last week. It's growing every day. We expect to get 10 million this week. And we're catching up quickly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: I don't know if it works, one. Don't know -- one, don't know if it works. And, two, don't even know if the vaccine is safe, do they? Do they?</p><p>MCCORD: Well . . .</p><p>IMUS: And then here's an e-mail I got from Deirdre Imus. You know here, right?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, I do.</p><p>IMUS: OK. She says -- now this is great. When did I received this, 6:49 a.m. And she writes, Bo is right. Well, now you can't win that argument, can you?</p><p>MCCORD: With her? What argument can you win with her?</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, but . . .</p><p>MCCORD: Good Lord.</p><p>IMUS: Eight million kids are all -- well, he was talking about this medical child abuse.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Where almost every kid who comes to the ranch -- there have been a thousand through there -- almost every kid is on something. Some kind of mood altering deal. Ritalin or some other nonsense. And they put them on it. And do you know why they put them on it, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: How come?</p><p>IMUS: Because nobody wants to spend any time with them to help them deal with it.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So it's a lot easier rather than to find some sort of cure or to -- or to -- or spend time with them or get them on a decent diet, or get them some exercise, or whatever, I mean, obviously there are cases where it is needed, but almost 90 percent of the cases is not. So it's just easier to give them a drug, isn't it?</p><p>MCCORD: Over medicate them.</p><p>IMUS: That's right.</p><p>MCCORD: Shoot 'em up and ship 'em out. Basically what it is.</p><p>IMUS: I like that. But, I mean, I don't like that, but I like the phrase.</p><p>MCCORD: All right.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Time now for the Fox Business Network business report. And here with that is Dagen McDowell.</p><p>Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Fabulous.</p><p>IMUS: So I said to Jenna Lee earlier this morning, off the air, I said, I wouldn't want to be at a party with Liz Claman and Dagen McDowell. I think that could be dangerous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why?</p><p>IMUS: I don't know. I just think three drinks, you both are on the table.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Liz is a tea totaller (ph).</p><p>IMUS: She is?</p><p>MCDOWELL: But she's a -- she is fun, though. She is fun.</p><p>IMUS: She's a nice woman. I like her. And we like you, too, by the way.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, thank you.</p><p>IMUS: What's going on in -- well, wherever?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, where I am . . .</p><p>IMUS: Wall Street or main street or . . .</p><p>MCDOWELL: Where I'm locked in.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, wouldn't you read a Wall Street book by Matt Taibbi?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I would.</p><p>IMUS: Not me. And why? Because he drops the f-bomb a lot. And, two, he will say horrible things personally about everybody on Wall Street.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What was it . . .</p><p>IMUS: Fat, unattractive people.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What did he say about Favre? Having his liver eaten out by piranhas? What was it?</p><p>MCCORD: Pecked out by birds on a . . .</p><p>IMUS: Oh, well, he wanted Brett Favre tied to a rock in the middle of the ocean and wanted his liver pecked out by seagulls or -- well, it was something, yes. Oh, yes, I mean, that's what we want. That's a Wall Street book we will read.</p><p>Anyway, what's going on?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Absolutely.</p><p>Speaking of Liz Claman, she's going to be interviewing the CEO of Ford, Alan Mulally, coming up in the noon hour today. And that's -- there's going to be a lot to talk about because Ford . . .</p><p>IMUS: How does she get all these interviews, I wonder? Like Warren -- well, Warren Buffett's got the hots for her, I know that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because she works her you know what off. She stays in contact with them. She stays on top of the news. She is one of the hardest working woman I know.</p><p>IMUS: Kind of like a Barbara Walters deal. Except with Barbara Walters, Barbara slept with all of them. And I can say that because Barbara's my friend. So . . .</p><p>MCGUIRK: Was your friend.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Liz . . .</p><p>IMUS: What did you say?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Was your friend.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, she even -- Barbara, she understands what she did.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Is that how you got on the show? Please.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>Anyway, what were you going to say now, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Liz is going to be talking with the CEO of ford. She's going to have a lot to talk about because Ford produced almost a $1 billion profit in the most recent quarter. Nobody expected that. Incredible turnaround for the company. And didn't take taxpayer dollars. Didn't go bankrupt like General Motors and Chrysler. So there's going to be -- but that's hurting Ford actually because the unions turned down these wage cuts. The union, the UAW at Ford said no way to more concessions, which they gave to GM and Chrysler.</p><p>IMUS: Charles and I are rolling our eyes.</p><p>MCCORD: No we're not.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, we are.</p><p>MCCORD: Don't include me. I think that's interesting.</p><p>IMUS: No, no, she was talking. You're lying.</p><p>MCCORD: For God's sake.</p><p>IMUS: You are lying.</p><p>MCCORD: I am absolutely not.</p><p>IMUS: She was talking and you were rolling your eyes.</p><p>MCCORD: That is wrong.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why were you rolling your eyes?</p><p>MCCORD: I wasn't.</p><p>IMUS: Because it's too much information for us.</p><p>MCCORD: Not enough.</p><p>IMUS: We can't -- we just can't . . .</p><p>MCCORD: I want to know about the unions.</p><p>IMUS: No, you don't.</p><p>MCCORD: I want to know why they didn't turn . . .</p><p>IMUS: You don't care anything about it.</p><p>MCCORD: Absolutely I do.</p><p>IMUS: He's lying, Dagen.</p><p>MCCORD: I want to know why Ford didn't go bankrupt.</p><p>IMUS: He's just lying.</p><p>MCCORD: And why they were able to get by without any of our money.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can tell you -- I can tell you that.</p><p>IMUS: Ford F-150. Ford F-150, right Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's right. And I -- yes, I can tell you that too because Ford -- Alan Mulally came in and borrowed money way ahead. He planned in advance. He even mortgaged the logo.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: There you go.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: He's our guy.</p><p>All right, Dagen, thank you.</p><p>MCCORD: Foresight instead of hindsight.</p><p>IMUS: Dagen McDowell, who will be on later with business news that make sense as opposed to our ruining her report and we apologize for that. I do.</p><p>It's 16 after the hour, we're talking with Big Kenny coming up and Warner. From the Imus Ranch record, this is Big &amp; Rich. They did a good job of it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update.

We have some earnings reports to tell you about this morning, starting with Sysco, the food company. Sysco with an s, that is. When you take out one-time items, Sysco earning 46 cents a share. That's a penny better than the expectation. Sales, though, slightly lower than what the street was looking for. There's a look at the stock in the pre-market.</p><p>Also, Ford reporting much better than expected results. Earnings coming in at 26 cents a share. Analysts expecting a loss of 12 cents. Revenue of nearly $31 billion, also much better than expected. The company's CFO says the results prove the company's turnaround program is on track. That stock rising in the pre-market as well. It's the biggest gainer among the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>And \"This Is It\" dancing its way right to the top of the weekend box office.

You know, I love the -- having -- being able to play music in every fashion that I have with John and Big &amp; Rich and with all my other friends that I've made music with over the years. I just -- I love what I do. I'm excited now that we're doing -- that I'm doing something different. It lets me speak of where I'm at in my life right now.</p><p>You know, I was a bust (ph) just like Lord knows everybody else here in the early '90s when that first crippling recession came through and I had 75 employees and a construction business. And within three months, every bank that was around went out of business, was taken over by the Comptroller of the Currency, and that was when the savings and loan scandal came through.</p><p>And then I was trying to build my way out of it. I was always singing or humming around on a job site. A buddy comes up one day and says, hey, Kenny, you sing pretty good. You ought to go to Nashville. You know they pay people to write songs down there. And I set my framing hammer down and I look at him and I said, you've got to be kidding. I've been farming and slamming nails all this time and, you know, just, you know, hard work. Making hay. You know, it's hard work.</p><p>And, you know what, over the past 15 years, since I've moved to Nashville, I've found out that song writing is hard work too. Meaning, you have to put a lot of time into it to do something great.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>ALPHIN: But now I've not only gotten to a point where I've had some success in music, but I've got a family, I've got a son. As of this past year, we were able -- me and my wife work with a group called My Sister's Keeper and have a -- got a school built over the past three years right in the middle of Sudan. Got 550 young girls registered in there, having their first chance at education 45 kilometers outside of a war zone. We've got doctors, we're giving away scholarships in the Appellation now because the water's so blooming contaminated and all this area that I call home, you know, we've got to let people know that the water can be killing their kids, like lead paint was back in the '70s, you know.</p><p>IMUS: Please don't turn into my wife.</p><p>ALPHIN: Well, I'm not. But -- and the way to do that is to plant -- have music that's gross.</p><p>IMUS: How does this work? We're talking with Big Kenny here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. The album's called \"The Quite Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy.\" How does this -- how do you plant this? I mean it's an unusual packaging.</p><p>ALPHIN: Well, my -- yes. We had to come up with that.</p><p>IMUS: Remember, a lot of the people are listening to the radio.</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes, we had to come up with that packaging. Instead of using a plastic jewel case, which I just got tired of seeing them stacked around everywhere.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>ALPHIN: You know, I figure, what, there's hundreds of millions of records made every week. If we could just get rid of those one plastic jewel cases, that could be a pile as big as the Empire State Building. Huge. So we made a package that just -- it's a cardboard folder that folds up and you can put your CD, take it out or put it back in or you can take the package and it's plantable. Meaning we put in the cardboard 26 different varieties of my favorite perennial wildflower seeds. So you can just wet the stuff and break it up into pieces and put it in flower pot and plant it or you could just throw it out in your backyard and it's biodegradable, it's compostable. It will just wither to nothing. So worst thing is, if these -- if there are packages everywhere, our way will be paved in flowers.</p><p>IMUS: What's this business about loving everybody, because we don't love anybody.</p><p>ALPHIN: Oh, I don't believe that for a minute.</p><p>IMUS: Well, we don't love everybody.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ALPHIN: Well -- and it just struck me like a lightning bolt. I guess, you know, having gone through a business bust and a lot of other things in my life, and having the time as a writer to spend time a lot of time thinking and writing my thoughts down in all these crazy songs -- and this album of songs that I've written now, it really does describe my life -- I just decided that that was the best way to look at everything, every question that I had, all the things that were consuming my mind that I saw as issues throughout the world, or things that were right around me, with people that were just around me. I said the best thing I can do is just follow one rule, and that's, well, I just love everybody, no matter what.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>ALPHIN: I know it's not the easiest thing in the world, but it can be done.</p><p>IMUS: You have a white aura around you.</p><p>ALPHIN: A white aura?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: That's positive. That's good.</p><p>IMUS: That's good.</p><p>MCCORD: That is good.</p><p>IMUS: Let me ask you a question you have never been asked.</p><p>ALPHIN: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Are you and John going to record again?</p><p>ALPHIN: I hope so, yes. I would think so.</p><p>We've put a lot of energy into building what we've built so far. John is getting ready to be a daddy, I understand, and so a lot of things are changing in his world right now.</p><p>I had to hang upside down last year like a bat. I was trying to get my neck fixed naturally, without having to do what my daddy had been telling me all my life, and that was, \"Son, sooner or later, you're going to have to get your head screwed on straight.\" So this doctor in Nashville finally went in after this injury I sustained in 2002 from being hit by a drunk driver. He went into my throat and my spine.</p><p>He screwed a metal plate. So I am now bionic Big Kenny.</p><p>IMUS: Well, when John was here, he told us you were doing that. I just assumed that he was lying and that you all couldn't get along.</p><p>ALPHIN: No.</p><p>IMUS: Because look at Brooks &amp; Dunn after all these years. Well, Ronnie Dunn finally figured out -- it took him 20 years -- that he is the only one who could sing in that group. So -- I mean, the other guy is fine, but...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ALPHIN: Well, I think it's -- as musicians, it's good for us. John wanted to express a lot of songs that I wouldn't -- that wouldn't naturally come from me. And these songs that make up all of Big Kenny, \"The Quiet Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy,\" these are the songs of my life right now.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you all toured this summer, didn't you?</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes, we toured this summer and did all the Big and Rich classics. And then he played a couple, I played a couple. We had a blast. We did most of the country this summer.</p><p>IMUS: Well, people like you individually. They love -- and they may wind up loving both of you individually.</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes, I would hope so. They call me the Jack White of country music, or the...</p><p>IMUS: Jack White?</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes. He's recorded with Loretta Lynn.</p><p>IMUS: I love Jack White.</p><p>ALPHIN: He's recorded with...</p><p>IMUS: Well, that record he made with Loretta Lynn was great. That was a great record.</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes. I want to make more records just -- I've got a studio built in my back yard now. It didn't necessarily start out like that.</p><p>It started out because I was working so much, touring so much. And we were -- we tried to move across the street because we could park the bus off the street and make our neighbors happier. And then my wife's going to work, and \"All the time you're building the house, you're not going to church enough, honey.\"</p><p>So, to solve that, I had a friend come over. We sketched up a nice little building that looked kind of like a church, and we started building that in the back yard. And then my buddies are coming back going, \"Wow, this would make a great studio.\"</p><p>So now every time at home I've solved all the issues. I'm right there for my kid. He'd come running in just like I could run into the shop when my dad was working on the farm.</p><p>I've got music in a studio around me all the time so I can get quiet, think and write. And, hey, I'm in church too.</p><p>IMUS: Praise the lord. Praise Jesus.</p><p>Big Kenny is going to sing for us in just a little bit here.</p><p>ALPHIN: Amen.</p><p>IMUS: It's 33 after the hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Time now for our business update from the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Here's Jenna Lee.</p><p>LEE: Good morning, everybody. Here's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Bank of America's list of candidates to replace CEO Ken Lewis is looking even shorter after another prospect reportedly told the bank no thanks. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says Bank of America approached Bank of New York Mellon CEO Robert Kelly. Kelly has been approached before for succeeding Ken Lewis, but is showing no interest in the job as of yet.</p><p>Bernie Madoff's auditors expected to plead guilty. Prosecutors say David Friehling reached a deal with the government and will enter his plea tomorrow.</p><p>In the meantime, in a jailhouse interview, Bernie Madoff telling the Securities and Exchange Commission he considers current SEC chair Mary Schapiro \"a dear friend,\" and that she \"... probably thinks I wish I never knew this guy.\"</p><p>Moving on to a different story here, winter came early in Beijing. The city waking up to snow on Sunday, to the earliest snowfall in 10 years.</p><p>Meteorologists seated (ph) clouds with silver iodide, forcing the snow to fall. Beijing's city offices said because it's suffering from a drought, it won't miss an opportunity for artificial precipitation.</p><p>There's a look at it. It looks like a lot of snow.</p><p>Quick earnings news for you. Clorox saying H1N1, the flu, actually helping out sales. They had a big beat here. Adjusted earnings, $1.18, versus the expectation of 95 cents. Revenue right in line with expectations, $1.37 billion.</p><p>That's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>If you're on the move this morning or at a computer, check us out for all the latest business headlines -- FoxBusiness.com/livemorningedition, streaming on your iPhone and online.</p><p>Here's a quick look at the futures. We have more IMUS IN THE MORNING coming up.</p><p>MCCORD: The House plan includes a government-run public run option and is expected to cost less than $900 billion over 10 years. House Republican Mike Pence of Indiana, though, fears it goes way too far and calls it, in fact, a freight train.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, at some point, don't you have to say to grandma, look, that's enough?</p><p>MCCORD: No. What are you talking about?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, maybe, but coming from the government is a little...</p><p>MCCORD: Why would you say that to grandma under any circumstances?</p><p>IMUS: Well, grandma is sitting there with the food falling out of her mouth, staring at the TV, and the TV is not on.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: I mean...</p><p>MCCORD: That's just great.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm just saying.</p><p>MCCORD: So you slip over behind grandma...</p><p>MCGUIRK: Be careful what you wish for.</p><p>IMUS: You can tell he's a sweet guy.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, he's a lovely man.</p><p>IMUS: He just looks at me and he says, \"Why do you hate everybody?\" I said no, it's a joke. We don't hate everybody, we just hate you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: No, we don't hate anybody. Well, we hate -- do we hate -- no, we don't hate anybody. We just don't love everybody.</p><p>All right. Well, an album you can plant, that's reason enough to buy it, \"The Quiet Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy.\"</p><p>Once again, please welcome Big Kenny.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man, that's a great song. That's a great song.</p><p>Big Kenny, he'll be back with one more.</p><p>It's 17 until the hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Time now for a business update from the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: Hi. Good morning to you.</p><p>And coming up just moments from now on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" I will be in for Alexis, and I'll be joined by a couple of former senators -- Bob Graham and Jim Talent. They're on different sides of the aisle, but both men agree that investing in vaccines is important to the nation's security. We're talking H1N1.</p><p>We'll find out why on \"THE OPENING BELL.\"</p><p>All right. Let's get to your \"Fox Business Minute\" now, with AIG dropping its plans to sell some Japanese units.</p><p>According to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" AIG is going to keep two of the three life insurance units initially it had tried to sell. Now, this fits with the plan set forward by the CEO, Robert Benmosche, when he took over back in August. AIG, by the way, still owes the government some $85 billion.</p><p>The liquidation of Lehman Brothers continues with a sale of more than $1 million worth of art. The 283 lots brought in a total of $1.35 million, nearly twice the expectations. Now, the artwork once hung on the walls of Lehman's corporate offices here in New York, and the money hardly puts a dent on the $250 billion that Lehman still owes its creditors.</p><p>Now, the big news this morning from Ford, For Motor Company reporting third quarter earnings results that blew past analysts' estimates. They reported a profit of 26 cents a share, $30.9 billion in revenue, when they were expected to have lost money.</p><p>Ford says its turnaround plan is on track for the time frame they've targeted. You see the stock. It's higher in pre-market trading.</p><p>That is your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Speaking of higher, let's take a look at the futures this morning. They are also pointing to the possibility of a higher open on Wall Street.</p><p>We'll be covering it all on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" which is coming up at the top of the hour. I will be in for Alexis on that.</p><p>More IMUS IN THE MORNING right now on Fox Business.</p><p>IMUS: Eleven minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all the country and on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>I just got an e-mail from the ayatollah, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: What's this one? God Almighty.</p><p>IMUS: Well, that would be Mrs. Imus.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, boy. What does she want?</p><p>IMUS: She says, regarding Big Kenny, \"What a great guy he is. His glasses look like yours.\"</p><p>OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: \"We should be planting every CD cover. When we buy plastic CD covers,\" according to my wife, who is to the right of Sean Hannity, she says, \"the terrorists win.\"</p><p>Well, all right.</p><p>Neil Cavuto will have the fat boy on tonight, our guy, Chris Christie. And -- now I'm not sure they will be in the same studio. I'm not sure that that's possible, actually.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCGUIRK: That ain't right.</p><p>IMUS: They'll be a two-shot, those two boys.</p><p>MCGUIRK: You got your wide screen.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>Coming up next hour, Matt Taibbi from \"Rolling Stone.\"</p><p>Tomorrow, Mike Lupica. His new book, \"Million-Dollar Throw,\" Wyatt Imus read and loved. And, of course, Lupica has written four or five of them, \"The New York Times\" number one bestsellers.</p><p>And then on Wednesday, Jeff Greenfield from CBS and Monica Crowley from way out there where the buses don't run. So that kind of situation.</p><p>All right, time for one more here. You all please welcome once again, singing something from -- that last song, that was a great song. This is from -- oh, how about this one, Imus? Maybe this would be great, too -- \"The Quite Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy,\" Big Kenny.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Big Kenny.</p><p>ALPHIN: Thank you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IMUS: Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program from Fox News, actually, and his own syndicated national radio program that is doing splendid, our old friend Alan Colmes.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Colmes.</p><p>ALAN COLMES, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Hello, Mr. Imus.</p><p>IMUS: Well, how about all the stuff President Obama promised he was going to do and he's done none of it? None of it.</p><p>COLMES: The guy's been in office a few minutes.</p><p>IMUS: None of it. He's been in office almost a year. He has done nof it.</p><p>COLMES: OK. That justifies Lieberman.</p><p>IMUS: He has done none of it.</p><p>COLMES: He's getting out of Iraq in 22 months.</p><p>IMUS: He was the agent of change. He's not going to get out of Iraq in anything.</p><p>COLMES: Sure he is.</p><p>IMUS: How about \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell?\" How about Guantanamo?</p><p>COLMES: I'd like to see him move faster on some things. He inherited a nightmare from the previous administration.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, well, you can't spend the rest of your life blaming that incompetent buffoon who was the president before this guy.</p><p>COLMES: You've got to sweep up the mess that was left.</p><p>IMUS: Well, yes, but grab a mop and get busy then, as he said.</p><p>COLMES: What do you think he's doing? He was just praised for going to Dover Air Force Base. That's change you can believe.</p><p>IMUS: That's one thing he did that was good.</p><p>MCCORD: Symbolic.</p><p>IMUS: I like the guy, by the way. I mean, Sean Hannity, it makes him insane when I say that, but I do like him. But I don't think he has any idea what he's doing, and he's more interested in being president...</p><p>COLMES: Oh, that's just ridiculous.</p><p>IMUS: ... spending five hours playing golf with that dope Tom Friedman.</p><p>COLMES: I'm with O'Reilly on this one. The guy's not allowed to have a golf game?</p><p>IMUS: No, not to...</p><p>COLMES: The guy can't go enjoy himself for a few hours?</p><p>IMUS: No, no, not to -- no, come on. Do you have five hours to go play -- you probably do, but I don't have five hours to go do anything.</p><p>COLMES: Wait a minute. So, when George W. Bush said, \"I'm playing through\" after he was talking about the tragedy of 9/11, that was OK, right?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I didn't say it was OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: I didn't vote for him. I didn't vote for him either time. What are you talking about?</p><p>COLMES: Well, I'm just pointing out to your audience the hypocrisy there.</p><p>IMUS: Pardon me?</p><p>COLMES: I'm pointing out the hypocrisy in the situation.</p><p>IMUS: Well, it's completely lost on me, and now you've irritated me. So...</p><p>COLMES: Oh, I'm really sorry.</p><p>IMUS: No you're not. You don't care at all.</p><p>COLMES: I don't know how I can make it up to you.</p><p>IMUS: You don't care about me.</p><p>COLMES: Yes, I do.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IMUS: Tonight at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Fox Business Network, Neil Cavuto will interview our new favorite fat boy, New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Chris Christie.</p><p>And speaking of -- well, not fat boys, but Cavuto -- but then we could make a case for -- well, whatever. He'll be on this program tomorrow morning, along with Mike Lupica. He'll be talking about his new book, \"Million- Dollar Throw.\"</p><p>Right now, time for \"THE OPENING BELL.\"</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox NewsNetwork, LLC.

The lender was not able to get its  bondholders to agree to a debt for equity offer but according to the Wall  Street Journal CIT does have support for a prepackaged bankruptcy plan  including funding from billionaire investor Carl Icahn.

It looks like Humana is out with the -- it's earning $1.78 which would beat  expectations by a penny.  As far as revenue, it looks like revenue is a  little bit light, 7.72 which is below the expectation of 7.82.  So, keep an  eye and Humana today.

See how they're shaping up this  Monday morning.  And a quick look at futures as we show you Oil and Gold.   imus in the morning is up next.      </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS:  Based on the interview that he did yesterday on his program Chris  Christie -- if he doesn't get elected government in New Jersey, maybe there  is something is wrong.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> IMUS:  Politics -- but -- like Corzine is just a slimy, sleazy, Goldman  Sachs thief, and an arrogant idiot dirt bag.  All of that.  But why do we  need to get into this name calling, Bernie? </p><p> CHARLES MCCORD, HOST:  Well, don't hold back here I-man.  </p><p> IMUS:  Here's what I don't like about, when I got fired, you know, and when  I was coming back to work, this moron -- I wasn't going to talk about this  but I will.  He had some statement about what he thought that I ought to  have to do to come back to work.  And here's what he have to do -- he ought  to kiss my ass.  How does that sound? </p><p>  ANNOUNCER:  Ladies and Gentlemen, imus in the morning.  </p><p> IMUS:  Third day to my mind Charles.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  I will go down in history.  February 15, 2004, when the Yankees  traded for A-Rod.</p><p> MCCORD:  Right.</p><p> IMUS:  And of course, May 8, 2009, when it came back from a hit a home run.</p><p> MCCORD:  Just exploded.</p><p> IMUS:  There was never a doubt in my mind at any point that going back to  February 15th, 2004, at the Yankees for marching on their way to the 27th  world championship.  </p><p> BERNARD MCGUIRK, HOST:  May I just add rocket propelled to their 27th.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  So, way to go A-Rod.</p><p> WARNER WOLF, WARNER SPORT'S HOST:  The name of the law (ph).</p><p> IMUS:  What's the matter Warner?</p><p> (ALL TALKING AT ONCE)</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  The fat boy will be on with Cavuto.  The next governor of New  Jersey, kind of interesting.  Whether you like him or not, it's not a  decent job, and even if he hasn't, he is not a creep.  You know, he figured  out a way to put together $16 billion.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes, he did.</p><p> IMUS:  He said to Corzine that he is a moron.  And we know Corzine is a  creep.  And then I was watching the best of Imus, euphemistically speaking  of course, on Saturday morning on the Fox Business Network.  And half the  time when I'm talking to people, I'm checking my e-mail.</p><p> MCCORD:  I know its ugly reading his e-mail.</p><p> IMUS:  I mean, it's difficult to get me to listen anyway. </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes, sure because that's a God damn thing.</p><p> IMUS:  It is clear I am not listening to a word they are saying.  I was  talking to Laura Ingram when she was going out her notes word by word and  that's people I like.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Stunning that you are able to hold up your end of the  conversation.  </p><p> IMUS:  Anyway, coming up this morning, Big Kenny is here.  </p><p> MCCORD:  All right.</p><p> IMUS:  And he's got his love everybody.  And we will be playing that song  and we don't love anybody.  There is no one.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)  </p><p> MCCORD:  Not a knocked on .  </p><p> IMUS:  You know what is new CD Charles?</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  The quiet times of a rock and roll farm boy.  Which you can actually  plant this thing.</p><p> MCCORD:  No, you can't.</p><p> IMUS:  This is way over thinking.  No, no, no, it's fine, yes.</p><p> MCCORD:  Really?</p><p> IMUS:  But first we want to find out if we can listen to it which I would  think.  </p><p> MCCORD:  What happens when you plant it? </p><p> IMUS:  I don't know.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  You could smoke it afterward.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  Yes, it grows and you could smoke it, you know.</p><p> ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN HOST:  Hey, man.  This is really good.  </p><p> IMUS:  So happy birthday to Big Kenny.  It was his birthday yesterday.  And  his son's name, I think, is not Ford.  It is not Chevy.  It is Lincoln.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Lincoln, OK.</p><p> IMUS:  Or Jefferson.  No, it's Lincoln.  It is Lincoln's birthday today.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Great.</p><p> IMUS:  So, we got him a little cake.  And Cally (ph) said he's already up.   He is cranky but, you know, it is 6:00 in the morning in New York.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Sure.</p><p> IMUS:  Anyway, Jenna Lee is going to have some business news at CIT.  A  thing that I don't understand at all but who else is doing business stuff? </p><p> STAFF:  It's Dagen.</p><p> IMUS:  Dagen McDowell.  She will have some information about this as well.   Warner Wolf, it is not over, right Warner?</p><p> WOLF:  No, it's not over.  Cliff Lee will win tonight two to nothing.   Phillies will shoot out the Yankees two to nothing.  Game six in New York  on Wednesday.  </p><p> IMUS:  Then it's over.  </p><p> WOLF:  Good day.  No, I'm thinking to go seven.  </p><p> IMUS:  Are you down?</p><p> WOLF:  Yes.  This is hopefully at the Seven Game Series.</p><p> IMUS:  All right.</p><p> WOLF: And Charlie Manuel, I mean, I can't understand, he will going to get  second guess forever.  I don't care about three day's arrest.  Cliff Lee  had to pitch last night when you are down two games to one.  </p><p> IMUS:  Now you are down three to one.  </p><p> WOLF:  And now, you're down three to one.  He had to pitch last night.  </p><p> IMUS:  He's going to pitch tonight?</p><p> WOLF:  Yes, but if he wins you're still down now three-two.  He had to  pitch in the fourth game if you trail tow games to one.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, but he didn't do it.   </p><p> WOLF:  He didn't do it.  No.</p><p> IMUS:  He will going to pitch tonight?</p><p> WOLF:  Yes, that's right Imus.</p><p> IMUS:  OK.

What did the  Billy (ph) say?  I thought the whole thing was a scam and a shame.  </p><p> MCCORD:  And would be again.</p><p> IMUS:  And would be again, he just .</p><p> MCCORD:  If he was down in the polls too.  </p><p> IMUS:  Yes, he was.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  He was reading the -- I got lady and upstate New York who would  be humiliated again.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, I don't know.

Time for the Fox Business Network, business report.  Here with us  is Dagen McDowell.  Good morning Dagen.  </p><p>  DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning sir.  </p><p> IMUS:  How are you?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I am fantastic.  </p><p> IMUS:  So, CIT is what?  There going bankrupt but -- it's critical, right?  </p><p>  MCDOWELL:  All right.  No but still a critical part.  A lending in  this country, it is a 100-year-old lender to small and medium-size  businesses and it does this specialty lending and specialty financing in  particular retail.  So, there are literally hundreds of thousands of  retailers and vendors.  People have made everything from close to hats that  use CIT.  Here is what you need to do.  The American taxpayer with this  bankruptcy just lost $2.3 billion.  That's what you need to know.  The  first lost related to those financial bail-outs last year.</p><p> IMUS:  You know, I was talking to Bernie while you're talking, so I don't  know what you said.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK.  You want me to repeat it?</p><p> IMUS:  No.  Do you know what she said Charles?</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.  I do.</p><p> IMUS:  What is she saying?</p><p> MCCORD:  That this thing is the leading provider of financing to retailers  and their vendors and Dagen said that the bottom line, we were losing $2.3  billion with this thing going down.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Bottom line, American taxpayers just lost $2.3 billion with this  bankruptcy.  </p><p> IMUS:  How so?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And, because we put money, we the American taxpayer's part of  the financial bail out put that money in the CIT last year with the  bankruptcy filing the taxpayers lost and this is the first lost, recorded  lost from those bail outs that, you know,  400 billion plus bail outs to  the financial firm.  </p><p> IMUS:  So, you mean that, they don't have to pay us back? </p><p>  MCDOWELL:  They are not going to pay us back.  Right.  They do not  have to.  </p><p> IMUS:  That was not good.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, that's not good.  By the way, you know what?  Big Kenny's  from my neck of the wood.  He's from Virginia.</p><p> IMUS:  That's great.  It's too bad you can't come in the green room, you  guys will love all the time.</p><p> MCCORD:  Oh, that's true.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'll try to stay away from the guest in the green room  especially if I they had their make up on.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> IMUS:  No make on? You look fine.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK.</p><p> IMUS:  Have you come down with -- Van Morrison was there the whole day. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCCORD:  Another reason to stay away with guests in the green room.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes, anyway, thanks Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you sir.</p><p> IMUS:  The stock market by the way was off 250 points on Friday.  They  trade $97 and change this morning and the Michael Jackson movie did what  Bernie? </p><p> MCGUIRK:  $101 million in one week.  Number one at the Box office over the  weekend. </p><p> IMUS:  And Jamie McMurray won the Talladega, Warner?</p><p>  WOLF:  Yes, he did.  He had won the race in, I guess 85 tries.  At least  85 years even.  </p><p> IMUS:  But they couldn't finish, I mean, but a couple of time -- they just  -- they would go around a couple times and then they wreck. </p><p> WOLF:  Oh, yes, Ryan Newman, he crashed with the -- 5 lapse to go. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> IMUS:  That was horrible.  He was lucky to walk away with that one.  </p><p> WOL:  Yes.  They had to caught him out of the car.  </p><p> IMUS:  I saw that.  We should talk more about him or show some of that.  It  is a quarter after the hour here on the imus in the morning program.  </p><p> Big Kenny is coming up and he is going to sing.  This is from his record.   The quiet time of a rock and roll farm boy.    </p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p> IMUS IN THE MORNING</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time now for a business  update from the Fox Business Network.  Here is Jenna Lee.  </p><p> LEE:  Good morning everybody.  Here is your Fox Business minute.  We had  earnings news just breaking at the top of the hour from Humana.  The health  insurance earning a $1.78 as the penny better than the estimate.  Revenue  however was a little lighter than expectations, $7.7 billion.  Also, the  company's 2010 earnings guidance is lower than the current analyst  forecast.  Keep an eye on that stocks this morning.</p><p> Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs is trying to buy tax credits from Fannie Mae.   According to the Wall Street Journal, a deal would provide much-needed cash  to Fannie while saving Goldman millions of dollars on its taxes.

Just in this morning a profit of  26 cents a share excluding certain items for Ford which was expected to  have lost money the last quarter but instead was able to turn a profit.   That's the stock in pre-market trading up to $7.40 up big percentage wise  from the $7 even that it closed out on Friday.</p><p> Revenue of $30.9 billion last quarter also better than the $28.3 billion  that was expected; and Ford out with some comments on the economy saying  that confidence in the global economy is now returning although there is  some uncertainty still in the near-term.  The company is saying it remains  on track to exceed or achieve or exceed all of its '09 financial targets  and most, almost all of its operational metrics.</p><p> Again, Ford out with better than expected numbers.  The company, the only  one of the big three in Detroit not to take government money was expected  to have lost money and instead it turned a profit and the stock is higher  in pre-market trading.

That could allow it  to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of the year.</p><p> A big weekend as well for bank failures unfortunately as the Feds were able  to seize nine more banks, the most ever to be shut down in one day since  the financial crisis began.  The banks will reopen today as U.S. bank  branches after the company stepped in and agreed to assume their deposits.

It  occurred today near a bank in a hotel in a neighborhood not far from the  army's main headquarters.  Rawalpindi just is a few miles from the capital  Islamabad.</p><p> Police say the explosives may have been planted in a car in a parking lot.   Suspected militants have struck Pakistan numerous times in recent weeks.   In all about 250 people have died in apparent retaliation for the Army  offensive in the Taliban stronghold in the northwest.</p><p> Meantime, the United Nations says spreading violence in the country has  forced it to suspend long term development work in the northwest regions  along the border with Afghanistan.</p><p> Health-care legislation provision would cap an employee's annual  contribution to tax free health care spending accounts running against  opposition now from an odd assortment of groups.  Bills in the House and  Senate would cut off employee contribution at $2,500 for the accounts and  help them all pay for dental work and insurance co-payments or over-the- counter drugs.  And a group called Save Flexible Spending Plans... </p><p> IMUS:  Right.</p><p> MCCORD:  ...backed by insurers and a powerful union now running a print ad  campaign against the cap calling it a definite tax on the middle-class,  particularly people who happened to be suffering with chronic illnesses.</p><p> IMUS:  There is no way to understand that news story.</p><p> MCCORD:  It's crazy.  Absolutely nuts. </p><p> IMUS:  I mean, you... </p><p> MCCORD:  You've got to get into it in a great more -- more detail than we  ever would have time to do.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, Lebron Levin (ph), you read the news to us... </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes sir.</p><p> IMUS:  ... and it's always bad.</p><p> MCCORD:  And it's never good.</p><p> IMUS:  But here is another -- but if you read the news to us... </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  And it's bad... </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  And we can't understand it... </p><p> MCCORD:  And its worst.</p><p> IMUS:  We just know it's bad.</p><p> MCCORD:  That is horrible.</p><p> IMUS:  That is bad.</p><p> MCCORD:  That is bad I-Man.</p><p> IMUS:  Did you have any good news?</p><p> MCCORD:  No.</p><p> IMUS:  Ok, so what else do you have?</p><p> MCCORD:  Man suspected in the fatal shootings of four men at a North  Carolina television shop captured in Virginia.  Police in Mount Airy, North  Carolina say Marcos Chavez Gonzalez was arrested early today at a motel in  Henry County about 50 miles northeast of Mount Airy near the state line.</p><p> Statements said authorities received information about this guy's  whereabouts around 2:30 in the morning and arrested without incident,  wanted in the slayings of four men who were shot late Sunday in the parking  lot of a little television shop in Mount Airy.  They don't believe the  shootings were random.  The men were at the store for some sort of reason  and further details on that one have not been released.</p><p> IMUS:  Who was at what?  Of course they were there for some reason.</p><p> MCCORD:  Well, they say they don't think it was random.  </p><p> IMUS:  But the four people work at the store.  </p><p> MCCORD:  They haven's -- further details have not been released.</p><p> IMUS:  They're not getting their TVs fixed.</p><p> MCCORD:  Who knows?</p><p> And U.N. Secretary General...</p><p> IMUS:  Another news item try to find any amusement in ...</p><p> MCCORD:  No, not at all.</p><p> IMUS:  So let's not.</p><p> MCCORD:  Four dead, now.</p><p> IMUS:  I know.  Ten minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  -- what?</p><p> MCCORD:  It's just that...</p><p> IMUS:  I wasn't going to.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Yes you were.  If you possibly could.</p><p> IMUS:  Lou, was I?</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> LOU:  You are laughing now for some reason.  </p><p> IMUS:  I am thinking about something else.</p><p> LOU:  Timing then.</p><p> IMUS:  Ten minutes after the hour on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  The  business report sponsored by the Fox -- that's not a funny report because  it (INAUDIBLE) in a TV shop.</p><p> LOU:  That's why I wondered why you were laughing.</p><p> MCCORD:  Just curious.  </p><p> IMUS:  It wouldn't be funny unless it were... </p><p> MCCORD:  No, it wouldn't be funny under any circumstances.</p><p> IMUS:  It wouldn't be funny at all.  Not on some other network like the one  that fired me.</p><p> The business report is sponsored by the Fox Business Network.</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> IMUS:  Time Warner... </p><p> MCCORD:  You might want to hand me the shovel...</p><p> IMUS:  I am just -- I'm kidding.  Just a little joke.  Can't anybody take a  joke?</p><p> Time Warner Channel 43 here in New York City; tough financial times call  for the best, the best is at Fox Business Network.

Good morning  Dagen.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, sir.  How are you?  </p><p> IMUS:  How are you?  I'm fine.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Fabulous.</p><p> IMUS:  What does this CIT thing mean?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  CIT bankruptcy means that $2 billion have been lost to the  American taxpayer.  It is not coming back.  We're never going to get it  back.</p><p> This is the first recorded loss of the financial bailout last year.  But I  want to point CIT is going to keep operating so it's going to try and hang  on to all of those borrowers -- those borrower customers; a lot retailers,  a lot of vendors out there.  </p><p> So it is going to keep operation.</p><p> IMUS:  Goldman Sachs stands to make a billion doing what?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Trading, investment banking.  You name it, it's making money  doing it.</p><p> You know what?  You know this morning -- you know who made money?   Surprisingly Ford.  Ford turned in a $1 billion profit for the quarter;  made money in North America for the first time since the beginning of 2005.</p><p> Again, it's really winning out because it didn't take government money.  It  didn't take a bailout like GM and Chrysler.</p><p> IMUS:  Best pickup ever made.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hallelujah, amen on that.</p><p> IMUS:  The Ford F150.  I have three or four of them.  I have three of them  out at the ranch.  That is all we have out there, are Ford pickups.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I took my driver's test in a Ford F150.  </p><p> IMUS:  They made them then?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Might not have been an F150...</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> IMUS:  Just kidding around.  Just a little joke.</p><p> Why was the market down 250 points on Friday?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, concerns about the consumer; about people not going out  there and spending.  We have numbers that people were not going out there  and spending in September.  That is about three quarters of the economy is  the consumers.</p><p> By the way, you have to tee-up that video of Ron Newman, that accident  yesterday.  That was something.  </p><p> IMUS:  I am sure it was Dagen.  Did you watch that race?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I watched the whole thing in my bathrobe with the dogs.   Look  at that.  That was with 5 laps left.  It was a snore, the whole thing.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, for more than 10 minutes I've been listing to the radio.   We're watching a car wreck on.</p><p> Well, let's restrict her plate racing, not to get into a lot -- but the  cars, they can't get out of each other's way.  They race from four  (INAUDIBLE); they're going 200 miles an hour and this was going to continue  to happen until they stop doing that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Beyond that, the race executives -- the Nascar executives came  out before the race and said no pushing in the turns, no bump drafting.  </p><p> IMUS:  You are listening to car talk, girl.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is important stuff.  </p><p> IMUS:  Dagen McDowell on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, talking Nascar.   Business report sponsored by the Fox Business Network -- can you see her  sitting at home in her bathrobe and get gravy all over?</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.  Absolutely.</p><p> IMUS:  Do you smoke, Dagen?  I hope you don't.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can't ask anybody that.  That is like asking if they VD.  </p><p> IMUS:  Do you?  Smoke not ...</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> IMUS:  Well, let's hope not.  What floor are you on?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I am on 12.</p><p> IMUS:  And we're on 3; so we are okay.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm coming down there.</p><p> IMUS:  Get away.  Get away.</p><p> Anyway, the business report sponsored by the Fox Business Network; Time  Warner's Channel 43 here in New York City.</p><p> I don't think this is what Roger had in mind.</p><p> MCCORD:  No.</p><p> (CROSS TALK)</p><p> IMUS:  Maybe it was.  Anyway, check out the Fox Business Network.</p><p> It's a quarter after the hour. </p><p> Warner is going to do sports and then Big Kenny is going to sing again.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time for a business update  from the Fox Business Network, here is Connell McShane.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  All right.  We have your Fox Business Minute for you.</p><p> And the big news coming out this morning, at least so far is coming out of  Ford; much better than expected results from the company.</p><p> Earnings came in at 26 cents a share.  The analysts were expecting a loss  of $0.12.  Revenue nearly $31 billion last quarter; also better than  expected.  Now the CFO sayings the results prove that the company's  turnaround program is on track and Ford says its near-term outlook does  remain uncertain but by 2011 it says it expects the economy to be  improving.</p><p> Stocks certainly improving this morning; it's up in the pre-market as you  see there on the news.  The CEO, Alan Mulally is going to discuss those  results on the Fox Business Network live in the noon hour.  Alan Mulally on  Fox Business.</p><p> Earnings news as well this morning from Humana, the health insurer;  earnings of $1.78, a penny better than expected.

I just can't get to -- what were you  saying now?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p> IMUS:  Forty-five percent tax break --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> MCCORD:  That's what she was saying, for God's sake.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Your taxes are going up.</p><p> IMUS:  Why are you hollering at me?  I'm a cancer patient.</p><p> MCCORD:  Pay attention.</p><p> IMUS:  I'm battling cancer here.</p><p> MCCORD:  Your country is going to hell.  Come on.

I want a second opinion.  It's like  Warner Wolf's predictions.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> Yes, come on.</p><p> It is 33 minutes past the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program  on the radio all over the country and on the FOX Business Network.  Big  Kenny will be back next hour.  We're going to talk to him.  Get to the  bottom of a number of issues, right, Charles?</p><p> MCCORD:  It's a complicated life.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.  Big Kenny says love everybody.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  Of course we don't love anybody.</p><p> MCCORD:  No indeed.</p><p> IMUS:  But maybe he can turn us around.  Please welcome to the IMUS IN  THE MORNING program now from \"Rolling Stone\" magazine Matt Taibbi.</p><p> Good morning, Mr. Taibbi.</p><p> MATT TAIBBI, \"ROLLING STONE\" CONTRIBUTING EDITOR:  Good morning, I- Man.</p><p> IMUS:  How are you?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Good morning, Charles.  Good.  Yourself?</p><p> IMUS:  We're going to have a discussion about Mr. Taibbi's goatee  which we like, right?</p><p> MCCORD:  The vote is in.</p><p> TAIBBI:  You're all making me uncomfortable.</p><p> MCCORD:  Really?</p><p> IMUS:  Well, you've got to be comfortable enough.  We are.</p><p> MCCORD:  Accept the compliment.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  All right.</p><p> IMUS:  We're not coming on to you.</p><p> MCCORD:  No.</p><p> TAIBBI:  That comes later, right?</p><p> IMUS:  He's trying to get you in the limo.</p><p> MCCORD:  Except you do look awfully good.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  Trick-or-treat.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> Anyway, so they've cancelled the elections in Afghanistan.  I know you  and I were talking about that.  We can talk about anything.</p><p> TAIBBI:  I'm happy to talk about Afghanistan.</p><p> IMUS:  I don't know what that means, do you?</p><p> TAIBBI:  I have no idea.</p><p> IMUS:  Do you know what it means, Charles?</p><p> MCCORD:  Just the Independent Election Commission has cancelled it and  declared Karzai the victor during a news conference in Kabul today.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, Duran Duran -- what was the guy's name?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Abdullah Abdullah.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> MCCORD:  Dr. Duran Duran, you're right.</p><p> IMUS:  He bailed out because it was so phony.  And the Secretary of  State said what now?  She said this is just an affirmation that, you know,  the process is -- I don't know, she read something into it.  It sounds to  me.</p><p> MCCORD:  It was a bit positive.</p><p> TAIBBI:  That's his name Abdullah, Abdullah?</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> MCCORD:  Dr. Abdullah Abdullah.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Any gulf statesmen should have at least one double name like  Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  It's a good, you know, Barack Barack Obama.  I mean, it would  work well.</p><p> IMUS:  So in the current issue of \"Rolling Stone,\" you write about  sports logos?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right.  It's actually \"Men's Journal.\"</p><p> IMUS:  \"Men's Journal.\"</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes, yes.  No, it's just sort of event, the commercialization  phenomenon, you know, about how, you know, it's gotten to the point I think  the economy is so bad now that they're trying so desperately to rescue  profits in the sports business that I think they've really gone too far and  they've basically sucked the life out of, you know, the sports watching  process.</p><p> I don't know about you.  I mean, I spent all last year trying to get  that $5 foot long, you know, theme song out of my head.  Every time I hear  it, I want to drive a fork into my eardrum.  I just can't take it anymore.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, here's the -- and the names of these -- be helpful, by  the way, if I did some research prior to Mr. Taibbi coming in and knew  which magazine he wrote in.  \"Men's Journal\" is the one with Tim McGraw on  the cover, by the way.  And he reveals I'm not sure what, something.</p><p> Here's the thing about people like Tim McGraw and these others.  I  guess that's how they get on the magazines but they reveal stuff about  themselves that we don't want to know.  I mean, I just -- it's like Andre  Agassi have you heard about his new book?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Oh, yes, with the whole meth -- doing meth.  And actually he  talks about how meth is really, really, you know, great.  You know, it kind  of resold me on the experience, you know.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> I thought man, I forgot how good that was.  I read those excerpts.</p><p> IMUS:  But there's another excerpt, it's coming in here.  When is he  coming in, Bernie, next week or so?</p><p> BERNIE MCGUIRK:  November 12th.</p><p> IMUS:  OK.  Apparently, remember when he had great looking hair.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right, and then he went bald and yes --</p><p> IMUS:  Well, it was a rug there in the latter stages of --</p><p> MCCORD:  Really?</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Was it like extensions or was the whole thing a rug?</p><p> IMUS:  Well, I'm not sure.  But it was a rug to the degree that he was  afraid it would fall off.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Wow.</p><p> IMUS:  So he says that he in the 1990 French Open finals.</p><p> TAIBBI:  OK.</p><p> IMUS:  There's a reason he lost.  It was his first Grand Slam final.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right.</p><p> IMUS:  The reason he lost is because he was worried about his rug  falling off.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Losing his rug.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Wow, that would have been one of the great ESPN moments of  all time.  Don't you think?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  Top ten deal, it would have been number one forever.  Big clump  of hair there flying on the clay in rolling hills or wherever.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Did you see that Manu Ginobili actually killed a bat in the  middle of a game.</p><p> MCCORD:  I saw that.</p><p> TAIBBI:  The basketball game last week?</p><p> IMUS:  No.  Where did this happen?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Sacramento.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Bat flew under -- and the guy actually -- you wax it with his  hand, and the bat falls on the ground and it's like twitching and dying and  he reaches down and grabs it, no hesitation whatsoever.</p><p> MCCORD:  He walked over and handed it to somebody.</p><p> TAIBBI:  It was the cool -- it was like he knew who to hand it to.</p><p> MCCORD:  Exactly.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Where's the guy you hand the bat to after?  You know what I  mean?</p><p> IMUS:  The bat is in the stadium there or in the arena at Sacramento?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  It starts flying around in the middle of the game.  It was  the weirdest thing ever.</p><p> MCCORD:  It's Halloween.</p><p> TAIBBI:  But not as weird as Andre Agassi's hair falling off in the  middle of the French Open.</p><p> IMUS:  What I'm thinking, how did he -- was he worried about it  falling off in the semifinals.  Great.  Or the quarterfinals?</p><p> MCCORD:  When did he start -- when did it become an issue, a  distraction?</p><p> IMUS:  Yes, you can't --</p><p> TAIBBI:  Well, maybe -- I mean, you've got to think about the fact  that he really only surged as a player after he committed to the whole bald  look.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right?  I mean --</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Maybe -- I mean, that wasn't until like eight years later.   But I mean, still, maybe that was when he stopped worrying about it.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, he never used to be able to finish five set matches, that  whole thing.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Well, it's hard to do after you've been, you know, taking  meth for three days straight, you know.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, I don't think he did for fun -- didn't do it for a lot of  years, did he?</p><p> MCCORD:  One year I think.</p><p> IMUS:  One year.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Oh, OK.</p><p> IMUS:  Now Martina Navratilova wants him to give back all of his --  all of his Grand Slam trophies and so on.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Because he was wearing a wig?</p><p> IMUS:  No, because he was doing crystal meth.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> Will it make you play better or just make you want to clean the  stadium?</p><p> MCCORD:  Swat a bat.</p><p> TAIBBI:  I'm not sure taking meth would make you play better.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes, me either.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  Talking with Matt Taibbi from Rolling Stone.  We're talking  about sports logos.  I was going to mention here at 21 until the hour, when  I watch basketball which is more than I like to admit, I was watching  Shaquille O'Neal and Lebron James, they were playing somebody, I forget --</p><p> TAIBBI:  Celtics probably.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  And Quicken Loans Arena.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  I mean, it's like it's named after a pawnshop.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Oh, yes, I know especially all the different companies that  went out of business in the last, you know, ten years, they're in business  for, you know, a year, long enough to rip off five million people.  They  get their name on the stadium and then they go out of business.  Like Enron  Field and all that.</p><p> IMUS:  And Citi Field.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right.</p><p> IMUS:  Because you know a lot about digressing wildly here, a lot  about Wall Street and that whole --</p><p> TAIBBI:  They should call it bailout field is what they should call  it.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.  I thought -- my wife told me about CIT last night.  And I  thought that was Citigroup, but it's not.  It's different.  CIT is who?</p><p> TAIBBI:  CIT?  That's the business that Goldman got involved with, but  Citi Field is Citigroup.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  So that's not the office.</p><p> MCCORD:  No.</p><p> IMUS:  . that claimed bankruptcy, right, Charles?</p><p> MCCORD:  No.  No.</p><p> IMUS:  That's CIT.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right, right.</p><p> IMUS:  And how is Goldman --</p><p> TAIBBI:  Well, Goldman is getting preferential treatment in the  bankruptcy.  I forget how that all works, but that was like the last time I  was on the show.  So that was weeks ago.  I've been doing so much meth in  the meantime, I've forgotten what that was all about.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> So, I really don't know.</p><p> IMUS:  As long as we're at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, how  is the football coach of the Browns doing?  You wrote about -- you wrote  about it.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.  I took a lot of heat in Cleveland because I compared  Eric Mangini to Augustus Gloop.  You know, remember the fat kid in the  Willy Wonka movie?</p><p> IMUS:  No.</p><p> TAIBBI:  You know, he falls into the chocolate river, right?</p><p> IMUS:  Oh, yes.  OK.</p><p> TAIBBI:  You know, because he's too greedy and Gene Wilder is like oh,  help, you know, save him.  Right?  So I wrote a column because we have a  football column in \"Rolling Stone\" now where I compared Mangini to that's  where Augustus Gloop has been all these years.  He resurfaces, you know.</p><p> And I've been getting like death threats from Cleveland ever since --  they've quieted down since the Bears recent losing streak because people  are turning their anger towards Mangini now.  But --</p><p> IMUS:  Well, the Browns are like one of seven, right?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.  I mean, you know, Mangini comes in and he's like fining  guys $1,700 for not paying for a bottle of water in their hotel room and  that kind of stuff and you do this before even winning a game.  Of course,  you're going to lose.  I mean, these guys are, you know, doing more land  down on TV than Paris Hilton, you know.  I mean, the Browns.  So, it's been  a rough year for Cleveland.  I hate to pick on that city, but yes, there's  nothing you can do.</p><p> IMUS:  How do these guys like Mangini who didn't do all that great a  job -- I guess he had one good year with the Jets, right?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes, he had one good year.  What I thought was interesting  though is that he got his head coaching job after he took over the Patriots  defense for one year which had been one of the best defenses in the league  for years and years and years.  And then he takes it over and it's like  15th or 16th in the league and he gets a head coaching job.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> TAIBBI:  You know, it's like the Peter Principle.  People get promoted  to their level of incompetence and in the NFL it just seems to happen more  quickly than in other places.</p><p> IMUS:  Why does it happen?  Why would he be blown out of a job with  the Jets?  Why would Cleveland think he's the answer?</p><p> TAIBBI:  I think Cleveland has been trying to, you know, make up for  their mistake of having let Bill Belichick go too early for the last, you  know, five or six years.  So they've, you know, now hired two successive  Bill Belichick lieutenants and Mangini is, you know, he even physically  resembles Belichick in a lot of ways.  He obviously tries to take after  him.  And, you know, he's bad with the media the same way that Belichick  is.  You know, he's a disciplinarian.</p><p> I think they were trying to recapture that magic.  I don't know what  it is.  And then, you know, I think they're probably also trying to stick  it to Belichick by hiring him.  So, but it just didn't work out.  This has  been --</p><p> IMUS:  How long was --</p><p> TAIBBI:  He's cursed, you know.</p><p> IMUS:  How long was Belichick there?</p><p> TAIBBI:  He was there for five years.  He had one winning season but,  you know, he didn't figure it out until of course he left Cleveland which  is what happens to everybody who lives in Cleveland.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> You know what that is?  It's like Buffalo.  You know, nobody who  actually is from Buffalo actually succeeds at life.  It never happens to  them while they're in Buffalo.  You know what I mean?</p><p> IMUS:  It's 17 until the hour.  We're talking with Matt Taibbi from  the \"Rolling Stone\" here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program and \"Men's  Journal.\"</p><p> Where are you on Brett Favre?</p><p> TAIBBI:  I actually wrote a sports column earlier this year calling  for Brett Favre to be chained to a rock in the middle of the ocean so that  he could have his liver pecked out by sea birds for the rest of eternity.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCCORD:  Come on, man.  Don't hold back.</p><p> TAIBBI:  I don't know.  I mean, I'm sure I'm not alone.  I'm just kind  of sick of the whole phenomenon.  Are you?  I mean, every time I turn on  the television the guy is staring back at me.  I thought he gets the mirror  in the house.  You know --</p><p> IMUS:  I was talking to Mike Lupica.  I said who do you want to win  the Packers/Vikings game?  It's got to be the Packers.  This guy can't go  up there and win.  I mean --</p><p> TAIBBI:  But he did, you know.  Yes.</p><p> And actually it's turning into what could have been kind of a really,  really boring and overdone media story.  The only way they could have saved  this is by Brett Favre actually playing out of his mind and having actually  a great year to warrant all the hype and he's doing it.  So I think it's  turning out to be a great thing for the NFL.</p><p> If he had come back and they were four and three and he was throwing a  bunch of picks, you know, it would have been a nightmare because we'd still  be hearing about it just as much but it wouldn't be, you know, worthwhile.   So --</p><p> IMUS:  And one of the strangest resumes of anyone I've ever read, Mr.  Taibbi played professional basketball in Mongolia?</p><p> TAIBBI:  That's right.  Right.</p><p> IMUS:  Professional baseball in Russia.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.  I played for the Red Army.  Yes, yes.</p><p> I actually I tried to play -- the Russians briefly had a professional  football league too.</p><p> IMUS:  Right.</p><p> TAIBBI:  And I tried to get in on that action for a team in St.  Petersburg but it was all these ex-hockey players who didn't really  understand the rules all that well, so I got two.  I got a couple of  helmets in the back in the practices and I thought to myself I'm not going  to do this too much.</p><p> IMUS:  How good did you have to be to be on the Russian army baseball  team?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Not that good.  You know, I mean --</p><p> IMUS:  You have to be able to play.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes.  I mean, you had to be like, you know, a good high  school player basically.  I mean, yes, there were three guys that I played  with over in Russia who ended up in the minors in the states.</p><p> IMUS:  What position did you play?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Well, I was a catcher in high school really but I played --  in Russia I ended up having to play center field because one of the guys  who ended up being a prospect in the states was a catcher.  So, you know,  he got the catcher spot.</p><p> IMUS:  And then the basketball in Mongolia, how did that happen?</p><p> TAIBBI:  I was playing basketball in the street in Moscow and I met a  Mongolian guy who told me they had this thing called the MBA, the Mongolian  Basketball Association.  So I went into work the next day and quit my job,  got on the Trans-Siberian railroad and went to Mongolia and found a team.   Got a tryout.</p><p> And I was playing for a team called the Mountain Eagles in the MBA  which is the only league in the world that has MBA rules, by the way.  It  has a 24-second shot clock and a three-point line and everything.  I played  for them for about a year until I got pneumonia and almost died and had to  leave the country.</p><p> IMUS:  You were obviously doing meth then, right?</p><p> TAIBBI:  That was actually pre-meth, believe it or not.  Yes, that was  like in -- that was in my healthy period.</p><p> IMUS:  I got to quit my job here in Moscow and go to Mongolia and play  basketball.</p><p> MCCORD:  Get on the train.</p><p> IMUS:  Are you going to do a book on this Wall Street thing, by the  way?</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes, I'm working on it right now.</p><p> IMUS:  Good.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Yes, yes.</p><p> IMUS:  People still -- Frank Rich, if you can believe this, quoting  your Goldman Sachs line.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Right.</p><p> IMUS:  . in a Frank Rich \"New York Times\" column.  So all of the stuff  you did and all the stuff you learned is certainly worth a book.</p><p> TAIBBI:  I hope so.  You know, one of the problems I'm finding though  is that the public has a very, very limited appetite for the Wall Street  story.  They're interested in it just long enough to get upset about it but  --</p><p> IMUS:  Here's why they'll like yours.  I'm telling you I'm being  serious, why we like you, why I like you.  Because you're willing to say  awful things about these people and you're willing to call them awful  names.</p><p> MCCORD:  Like people getting their liver pecked out on a remote  island.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.  And you're a great writer and you're willing to resort to  physical humor.  And that appeals to me and my 11-year-old son.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> All right, Matt, thank you very much.</p><p> TAIBBI:  Thanks a lot, I-Man.</p><p> IMUS:  Matt Taibbi, \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Men's Journal.\" It's 13 until  the hour.</p><p> MUSIC:  IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time now for a  business update from the FOX Business Network.  Here's Connell McShane.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Time for your \"FOX Business Minute.\" AIG dropping its plans  to sell some Japanese units.  According to this morning's \"Wall Street  Journal,\" AIG is now going to keep two of the three life insurance units it  initially had tried to sell.  And this fits in with the plan set forward by  the CEO, Robert Benmosche, when he took over in August.  AIG still owes the  government, remember, some 85 billion dollars.</p><p> The liquidation of Lehman Brothers continues with the sale of more  than a million dollars worth of art.  Two hundred eighty-three lots brought  in a total $1.35 million.  Nearly twice the expectations that some had for  this art work, which once hung in the walls of Lehman's corporate offices  right here in New York City.  The money hardly puts a dent in the 250  billion that Lehman still owes to its creditors</p><p> And this morning in case you missed it, Ford is already out with its  third quarter results way above expectations.  They earned 26 cents a share  when they were expected to have lost money.  $30.9 billion in revenue, also  better than expected.</p><p> Stock up in pre-market.  Ford with its turnaround plan on track  according to the company.  And in the next hour, we'll have more earnings  coming out.  Sysco, the food company, and Clorox set to be reporting their  results.</p><p> That's your \"FOX Business Minute.\" When you log on this morning, go  download that new FOX Business iPhone app.  It's great.

Here we are, up 37 on the  Dow.</p><p> More IMUS IN THE MORNING right now.</p><p> IMUS:  Taibbi pretty much on automatic.</p><p> MCCORD:  He sure is.</p><p> IMUS:  Coming up next hour, we're going to talk with Big Kenny, get to  the bottom of a number of things for Big Kenny.</p><p> Happy birthday to the boy.  It's his birthday yesterday.  And his son,  adorable little child, 4 years old.  Lincoln it's his birthday today.  It  was Kinky Friedman's birthday yesterday as well.</p><p> Rob and Tony are here.  How are you guys?</p><p> ROB BARTLETT:  We're fine.</p><p> TONY POWELL:  Good.</p><p> IMUS:  What's on your mind, Tony.</p><p> POWELL:  Well, now, this little girl, Abigail Breslin, the child that  played in \"Little Miss Sunshine\" has been cast in the Broadway revival of  \"The Miracle Worker,\" the Helen Keller Story.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> POWELL:  That little blind, deaf Helen Keller.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> POWELL:  Well, there's a little problem because the Alliance for  Inclusion, a group that advocates for disabled actors wants them to cast a  blind deaf actress to play little Helen Keller.  And I'm just thinking  they've lost their minds.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> POWELL:  Can you imagine how much money that cost in rehearsal just  the rehearsal time alone?</p><p> IMUS:  No, Tony.</p><p> POWELL:  How many times would the director have to yell cut is my  point?</p><p> IMUS:  Well, there's a way -- isn't there a way they do that?</p><p> POWELL:  I don't know.  I can't even imagine it.  First of all, think  about Broadway.  You've been to Broadway.  Have a blackout, you know, at  the end of a scene.  That girl is still standing there.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> She wouldn't know.</p><p> IMUS:  This is not that funny, Tony.</p><p> POWELL:  It is.  I mean --</p><p> IMUS:  I'm happy this is not racial this time.</p><p> POWELL:  Well, no.</p><p> IMUS:  Whining about something -- blaming me and Rob for something.</p><p> POWELL:  I don't blame Rob.  I advocate for all people with all kinds  of issues.</p><p> IMUS:  No, you don't.</p><p> POWELL:  Yes, I do.</p><p> IMUS:  Most of the time you don't.</p><p> POWELL:  I mean I understand.  I mean, again, I just have a problem  with this.  I mean, you know, when you cast a play, you cast the best actor  available.  I mean, you wouldn't cast a stutterer to play Hamlet.  That's a  long show.</p><p> You go for a Sunday matinee, you don't leave until Tuesday.  That's  just stupid.</p><p> IMUS:  Right.</p><p> POWELL:  I'm just saying.  Man, that's all.  That's my only point.   That's it.</p><p> IMUS:  Be a convoy of news trucks out here today.  Because you know  what I'd be happy?  For once they won't be here for me.</p><p> POWELL:  I'm not.</p><p> IMUS:  They'll be here for you.</p><p> MUSIC:  Imus, Imus, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p> IMUS:  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hey there.</p><p> IMUS:  Did you get --</p><p> IMUS:  Go ahead.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Did you get your hair fixed and everything?</p><p> IMUS:  Well, I think I did.  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It looks good.</p><p> MCCORD:  Oh, God.</p><p> IMUS:  I have a little mirror here that Cavuto got me so I can check  it every once in a while.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Curtains on the Titanic.  Oh, man.</p><p> IMUS:  I don't need those kinds of comments from you, Bernard.  You  look like Casper the ghost grandfather.  I mean, just butt out.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCGUIRK:  What?</p><p> IMUS:  What's the big business news this morning?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're going to be -- we're going to be watching personal  spending and income.  It comes out at the bottom of the hour.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> How do I follow up?  Well, speaking of Casper, at least Bernie doesn't  need to buy a costume for tomorrow, right?</p><p> IMUS:  No, he doesn't.  But don't start in on him.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Wait a minute.  You're in trouble.</p><p> IMUS:  You're in trouble.  Hold down a second.  It's just better if  you just don't say anything to him.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  I wonder above the fence line.  I wonder what's happening  here.</p><p> IMUS:  It's just like poking a -- it's just like taking a sharp stick  and poking a lion.  Right, Charles?</p><p> MCCORD:  Exactly.  God almighty.</p><p> IMUS:  Digressing like a drunk at a Christmas party.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p> IMUS:  Where's your husband from?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Born and raised in New York City.</p><p> IMUS:  Really?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> IMUS:  So --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  His parents are artists.  Now they live up in the woods in  Massachusetts on a dirt road, and they are as left as they come.  Nancy  Pelosi is not liberal enough for them.</p><p> IMUS:  What -- what do they -- how was that when he brought you home?</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Hey, look, Morticia Adams is here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Here we go.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's actually pretty good.  That's pretty good.  I've  gone as Morticia because I don't have a buy a costume.  I got a closet full  of black clothes.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  There you go.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I've got the complexion of a flounder.  There you go.</p><p> IMUS:  You're firing me.  Thank you very much, Dagen.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DON IMUS, HOST: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time now for a  business update.  From the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.  </p><p> JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, everybody.  Coming up on IMUS  IN THE MORNING, Big Kenny, of Big and Rich fame, will be back with Imus  this morning to play some music and talk a little bit to us.  So we're  looking forward to that.  Let's talk a little bit about some business news  now with your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p> CIT Group filing for bankruptcy.  It's the fifth largest bankruptcy in U.S.  history.  The lender was unable to get its bondholders to agree to a debt  for equity offer.  But according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" CIT does  have support for a prepackaged bankruptcy plan, including funding from  billionaire investor Carl Icahn.  This could allow CIT to emerge from  bankruptcy by the end of the year.  </p><p> It was certainly a big weekend for bank failures as feds seized nine more  banks.  The most ever to be shut down in one day since the financial crisis  began.  The banks will reopen today as U.S. bank branches after the company  steps in and agrees to assume their deposits.  They have and they will.   This brings the total of bank failures so far this year to 115.  </p><p> In other banking news, executives from the country's 28 largest banks are  meeting with Federal Reserve officials today to discuss compensation, as  well as regulation.  The Fed is looking to take information from the  meeting and get a look at the compensation trends, as well as practices  used by the companies.  </p><p> We also have some breaking earnings news at this hour.  Sysco, which is  Sysco with an s, the food company, not Cisco the big tech company.  It  looks like 55 cents are their earnings coming in.  That would be a dime  better than expectations.  We're going to continue to look through and see  if we have a revenue call here, which looks like we do, $9.08.  That's  slightly, just slightly, below the expectation of $9.1 billion.  So it  looks like a beat for earnings per share.  A little bit miss or a little  bit light on revenue.  </p><p> That's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"  When you log on this morning, go  download the new Fox Business app.  It's the only app that notifies you  when your stock hits the target price you want.

You have more IMUS IN THE  MORNING coming up.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> IMUS: By the way, about Chris Christie, politics aside, because I don't  believe any of them, I mean, look what Obama said he was going to do when  he got -- and he doesn't -- now he hasn't got any intention of doing any of  it.  But it's good he's there.  It's good for this country.  It's good for  the world.  Same with that fat boy from New Jersey.  I mean that boy got a  great sense of humor.  Got a good answer on vaccinations.  And, I mean, you  know, the other guy is just a creep.  I can -- but here's what I don't --  and Christie's right.  If I'm fat, man up and call me fat, bitch, you know.   I mean, what is that about? </p><p> CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS SHOW: Let's go.  Bring it on.  </p><p> BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS SHOW: Don't beat around the bagel or whatever.  </p><p> IMUS: Jon Corzine is a slimy, thieving, Goldman Sachs, gutless, paying his  girlfriend on the side weasel.  </p><p> MCGUIRK: A proven failure.  </p><p> IMUS: Yes, exactly.  Bernie is it for politics.  I'm in it for the fat boy.   How bad could the fat boy be? </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p> IMUS: Five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program,  on the radio all over the country and on the Fox Business Network.  Jenna  Lee, Dagen McDowell, Warner Wolf, Chuck, Bernie, Lou, and then Big Kenny  all coming up.  </p><p> MCCORD: Great.  </p><p> IMUS: What do the numbers show in the race in New Jersey, Charles? </p><p> MCCORD: Still within the statistical margin of error, I-man.  Very close.   A dead heat.  </p><p> IMUS: Bernie?  </p><p> MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p> IMUS: Any hopeful signs? </p><p> MCGUIRK: Well, yes, Obama was there yesterday and he's not exactly helping  out.  Carries around a lot of baggage.  That's hopeful.  </p><p> IMUS: Why would the president -- whether you approve of his policies or  not, is a decent moral guy -- why would he campaign for some dirt bag like  Jon Corzine?  Or was he? </p><p> MCGUIRK: It would just -- it's going to reflect poorly on the president if  the three national races -- if he loses all three.  If the Democrats lose  all three at this particular time.  So he needs one victory here and he  thinks he can get it in New Jersey.  And that's why he's going all out for  the Goldman Sachs thug.  </p><p> IMUS: Well, we know that Corzine doesn't know what he's doing.  And here's  how you know -- here's how you know he doesn't know what he's doing.  </p><p> MCCORD: Break it down.  </p><p> IMUS: Read \"The New York Times\" yesterday and Mayor Bloomberg, whether you  like him or not, is one, not a creep, and, two, not a dummy.  But you know  who he said was a dummy.  </p><p> MCCORD: Who? </p><p> IMUS: Corzine.  The boy is stupid.</p><p> MCGUIRK: He said that? </p><p> IMUS: Essentially.  Implied that.  Did you read it? </p><p> MCGUIRK: No.  </p><p> IMUS: Well, no, he said he was a moron.  </p><p> MCGUIRK: It just sounds -- it just sounds like something you would say.   Corzine's a moron.  It doesn't sound like something Bloomberg would say.  </p><p> IMUS: I'm paraphrasing the mayor.  </p><p> MCGUIRK: Oh.</p><p> IMUS: But he said he didn't -- they didn't -- he didn't appear to know --  he didn't appear to know what he was doing.  </p><p> MCGUIRK: And essentially they're both doing the same thing, which is buying  the election, or trying to, using their own money.  </p><p> IMUS: Well, but you could make a case that Bloomberg has done a much better  job in New York City than Corzine has done in New Jersey, couldn't you? </p><p> MCGUIRK: No question.  Without a doubt.  </p><p> IMUS: Well, that's Bloomberg's point.  I know you don't like Bloomberg, and  that's fine, but he's not a creep.  That's why -- he doesn't creep you out.   And . . .</p><p> MCGUIRK: No ethical stains on his record (ph).</p><p> IMUS: Right, and he's done -- he's done a decent job and he's . . .</p><p> MCGUIRK: And he made his money legitimately, not . . .</p><p> IMUS: He's not a criminal and a gangster.  </p><p> MCGUIRK: Right.</p><p> IMUS: Maybe we're going too far, huh? </p><p> MCCORD: No.  No, you haven't gone too far at all.  </p><p> IMUS: And a thug like Corzine.</p><p> MCCORD: No.  Go farther.</p><p> IMUS: So we're for the fat boy . . .</p><p> MCCORD: Further.</p><p> IMUS: Who, by the way, the fat boy we're just hoping, at least he's -- he  appears to be OK.  And what I liked about him, he has a decent sense of  humor.  He didn't appear to be a complete, total phony.  He's not going to  cut taxes and he's not going to clean up corruption in New Jersey.  And  here's -- one, we don't want it cleaned up.  </p><p> MCCORD: It's Jersey for God's sakes.  </p><p> IMUS: It's New Jersey.  Leave it.  It's working fine.  That part of it is  working fine.  </p><p> MCCORD: Badabing.</p><p> MCGUIRK: Atmosphere.  </p><p> IMUS: And the tax thing, just don't raise taxes and we'll be happy with  you.  So -- and plus it will make me look great.  I mean, I'll be leading  Jeff Greenfield around the studio here with a wire coat hanger around his  neck.  You know what I'm saying?</p><p> MCCORD: Exactly.  </p><p> IMUS: Will that little lupica (ph) be in here tomorrow.  That little  liberal panty waste.  We'll be slapping him around too.</p><p> So, all right, time for a little news now.  And here with that is Charles  McCord.  </p><p> Good morning, Chuck.</p><p> MCCORD: Good morning, I-man.</p><p> Suicide bomber aboard a motorbike has killed 30 people, injured 45 today  outside a bank near Pakistan's capital.  This reporter's on the scene there  in the city of Rawalpindi.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Security is generally very, very tight in this area, but  police officials on the site said that it is very difficult to stop suicide  bombers.  This motorcycle rider just happened -- came up to the bank and  blew himself up.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCCORD: And now the continuing violence in Pakistan, some 250 people killed  in recent attacks, is prompting the United Nations to suspend long-term  development work in the northwestern regions along the border with  Afghanistan.  </p><p> Afghanistan's election commission says Saturday's presidential runoff  cancelled now that Dr.  Abdullah Abdullah . . .</p><p> IMUS: What?  What?  What?</p><p> MCCORD: They've called off the runoff now that Abdullah Abdullah has  dropped out of the race.  Abdullah says that he decided to get out because  he believes there just will be massive voter fraud again and he wants the  Afghani people to move on.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABDULLAH ABDULLAH, FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER OF AFGHANISTAN: Only and purely  to the interest of the people of Afghanistan and to give the people of  Afghanistan a chance to -- to move on.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCCORD: So that's it.  There won't be a runoff.  And Afghanistan's election  commission has cancelled the vote and proclaimed President Hamid Karzai  victor of the nation's tumultuous ballot.  Karzai's challenger Abdullah  Abdullah having dropped out and they say that's it.  </p><p> IMUS: Looks like Pat Cadel (ph), doesn't he? </p><p> LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: Yes.  Separated at birth.  </p><p> IMUS: Uh-huh.</p><p> MCGUIRK: That's a Halloween picture right there.</p><p> IMUS: Wasn't Pat Cadel a Hollywood guy I always said his nose always  stuffed up every time he was on TV.  But, yes.  Is that Abdullah Abdullah  or Pat Cadel? </p><p> MCGUIRK: That's Abdullah, but it's tough to tell the difference.  </p><p> IMUS: Yes.  Don't they look almost like separated at birth?  Like Cavuto  and that -- well, that's unfair.  And Cavuto will be on this program  tomorrow, by the way.  </p><p> MCCORD: OK.  Good.</p><p> MCGUIRK: Like you and Betty White, how about that? </p><p> IMUS: I don't think it's helpful . . .  </p><p> MCGUIRK: I'm just sticking up for my man Neil.  </p><p> IMUS: To say hurtful things to a cancer patient, do you? </p><p> MCGUIRK: No, it's not.  </p><p> IMUS: OK.</p><p> MCCORD: Oh, God.</p><p> IMUS: Chuck continues.  </p><p> MCCORD: Independent health advisors will begin monitoring the safety of the  swine flu vaccine today.  Specialists are not expecting problems -- doesn't  mean that -- because the vaccine is made the same way as the regular winter  flu vaccine.  </p><p> IMUS: Oh, come on.  Come on here.  </p><p> MCCORD: But the government is now taking these extra steps, I-man, to track  the health of millions who are going to get the shot in order to spot any  problems quickly and also to explain anything that crops up, like a false  alarm when common disorders coincide with having gotten the inoculation.  </p><p> IMUS: Guess who's not going to get one of these? </p><p> MCCORD: Who's that? </p><p> IMUS: Me.  </p><p> MCCORD: Meanwhile, White House Senior Advisor David Axelrod says there will  be 10 more million doses of the vaccine available by the end of this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID AXELROD, SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: We have 28 -- I'm sorry,  40 million doses.  We had 28 million as of last week.  It's growing every  day.  We expect to get 10 million this week.  And we're catching up  quickly.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> IMUS: I don't know if it works, one.  Don't know -- one, don't know if it  works.  And, two, don't even know if the vaccine is safe, do they?  Do  they? </p><p> MCCORD: Well . . .</p><p> IMUS: And then here's an e-mail I got from Deirdre Imus.  You know here,  right?</p><p> MCCORD: Yes, I do.</p><p> IMUS: OK.  She says -- now this is great.  When did I received this, 6:49  a.m.  And she writes, Bo is right.  Well, now you can't win that argument,  can you? </p><p> MCCORD: With her?  What argument can you win with her? </p><p> IMUS: Well, no, but . . .</p><p> MCCORD: Good Lord.</p><p> IMUS: Eight million kids are all -- well, he was talking about this medical  child abuse.  </p><p> MCCORD: Yes.</p><p> IMUS: Where almost every kid who comes to the ranch -- there have been a  thousand through there -- almost every kid is on something.  Some kind of  mood altering deal.  Ritalin or some other nonsense.  And they put them on  it.  And do you know why they put them on it, Charles? </p><p> MCCORD: How come? </p><p> IMUS: Because nobody wants to spend any time with them to help them deal  with it.  </p><p> MCCORD: Yes.</p><p> IMUS: So it's a lot easier rather than to find some sort of cure or to --  or to -- or spend time with them or get them on a decent diet, or get them  some exercise, or whatever, I mean, obviously there are cases where it is  needed, but almost 90 percent of the cases is not.  So it's just easier to  give them a drug, isn't it? </p><p> MCCORD: Over medicate them.  </p><p> IMUS: That's right.  </p><p> MCCORD: Shoot 'em up and ship 'em out.  Basically what it is.</p><p> IMUS: I like that.  But, I mean, I don't like that, but I like the phrase.</p><p> MCCORD: All right.</p><p> IMUS: OK.  Time now for the Fox Business Network business report.  And here  with that is Dagen McDowell.  </p><p> Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.  </p><p> IMUS: How are you? </p><p> MCDOWELL: Fabulous.  </p><p> IMUS: So I said to Jenna Lee earlier this morning, off the air, I said, I  wouldn't want to be at a party with Liz Claman and Dagen McDowell.  I think  that could be dangerous.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: Why? </p><p> IMUS: I don't know.  I just think three drinks, you both are on the table.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: Liz is a tea totaller (ph).</p><p> IMUS: She is?</p><p> MCDOWELL: But she's a -- she is fun, though.  She is fun.  </p><p> IMUS: She's a nice woman.  I like her.  And we like you, too, by the way.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: Well, thank you.  </p><p> IMUS: What's going on in -- well, wherever?</p><p> MCDOWELL: Well, where I am . . .</p><p> IMUS: Wall Street or main street or . . .</p><p> MCDOWELL: Where I'm locked in.</p><p> IMUS: Hey, wouldn't you read a Wall Street book by Matt Taibbi? </p><p> MCDOWELL: Yes, I would.  </p><p> IMUS: Not me.  And why?  Because he drops the f-bomb a lot.  And, two, he  will say horrible things personally about everybody on Wall Street.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: What was it . . .</p><p> IMUS: Fat, unattractive people.</p><p> MCDOWELL: What did he say about Favre?  Having his liver eaten out by  piranhas?  What was it? </p><p> MCCORD: Pecked out by birds on a . . .</p><p> IMUS: Oh, well, he wanted Brett Favre tied to a rock in the middle of the  ocean and wanted his liver pecked out by seagulls or -- well, it was  something, yes.  Oh, yes, I mean, that's what we want.  That's a Wall  Street book we will read.  </p><p> Anyway, what's going on? </p><p> MCDOWELL: Absolutely.</p><p> Speaking of Liz Claman, she's going to be interviewing the CEO of Ford,  Alan Mulally, coming up in the noon hour today.  And that's -- there's  going to be a lot to talk about because Ford . . .</p><p> IMUS: How does she get all these interviews, I wonder?  Like Warren --  well, Warren Buffett's got the hots for her, I know that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: Because she works her you know what off.  She stays in contact  with them.  She stays on top of the news.  She is one of the hardest  working woman I know.  </p><p> IMUS: Kind of like a Barbara Walters deal.  Except with Barbara Walters,  Barbara slept with all of them.  And I can say that because Barbara's my  friend.  So . . .</p><p> MCGUIRK: Was your friend.</p><p> MCDOWELL: Liz . . .</p><p> IMUS: What did you say?</p><p> MCGUIRK: Was your friend.</p><p> IMUS: Well, no, she even -- Barbara, she understands what she did.</p><p> MCGUIRK: Is that how you got on the show?  Please.</p><p> IMUS: Yes.  </p><p> Anyway, what were you going to say now, Dagen? </p><p> MCDOWELL: Liz is going to be talking with the CEO of ford.  She's going to  have a lot to talk about because Ford produced almost a $1 billion profit  in the most recent quarter.  Nobody expected that.  Incredible turnaround  for the company.  And didn't take taxpayer dollars.  Didn't go bankrupt  like General Motors and Chrysler.  So there's going to be -- but that's  hurting Ford actually because the unions turned down these wage cuts.  The  union, the UAW at Ford said no way to more concessions, which they gave to  GM and Chrysler.  </p><p> IMUS: Charles and I are rolling our eyes.  </p><p> MCCORD: No we're not.  </p><p> IMUS: Yes, we are.</p><p> MCCORD: Don't include me.  I think that's interesting.</p><p> IMUS: No, no, she was talking.  You're lying.  </p><p> MCCORD: For God's sake.</p><p> IMUS: You are lying.</p><p> MCCORD: I am absolutely not.  </p><p> IMUS: She was talking and you were rolling your eyes.  </p><p> MCCORD: That is wrong.</p><p> MCDOWELL: Why were you rolling your eyes?</p><p> MCCORD: I wasn't.</p><p> IMUS: Because it's too much information for us.  </p><p> MCCORD: Not enough.</p><p> IMUS: We can't -- we just can't . . .</p><p> MCCORD: I want to know about the unions.  </p><p> IMUS: No, you don't.</p><p> MCCORD: I want to know why they didn't turn . . .</p><p> IMUS: You don't care anything about it.  </p><p> MCCORD: Absolutely I do.</p><p> IMUS: He's lying, Dagen.</p><p> MCCORD: I want to know why Ford didn't go bankrupt.  </p><p> IMUS: He's just lying.</p><p> MCCORD: And why they were able to get by without any of our money.</p><p> MCDOWELL: I can tell you -- I can tell you that.</p><p> IMUS: Ford F-150.  Ford F-150, right Dagen? </p><p> MCDOWELL: That's right.  And I -- yes, I can tell you that too because Ford  -- Alan Mulally came in and borrowed money way ahead.  He planned in  advance.  He even mortgaged the logo.  </p><p> MCCORD: There you go.  </p><p> IMUS: There you go.</p><p> MCCORD: There you go.</p><p> MCDOWELL: There you go.</p><p> IMUS: He's our guy.  </p><p> All right, Dagen, thank you.  </p><p> MCCORD: Foresight instead of hindsight.  </p><p> IMUS: Dagen McDowell, who will be on later with business news that make  sense as opposed to our ruining her report and we apologize for that.  I  do.  </p><p> It's 16 after the hour, we're talking with Big Kenny coming up and Warner.   From the Imus Ranch record, this is Big &amp; Rich.  They did a good job of it.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time now for a business  update.  From the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.  </p><p> LEE: Good morning, everybody.  Let's get straight to your Fox Business  minute.

That's a penny  better than the expectation.  Sales, though, slightly lower than what the  street was looking for.  There's a look at the stock in the pre-market.  </p><p> Also, Ford reporting much better than expected results.  Earnings coming in  at 26 cents a share.  Analysts expecting a loss of 12 cents.  Revenue of  nearly $31 billion, also much better than expected.  The company's CFO says  the results prove the company's turnaround program is on track.

This continuing violence in  Pakistan.  A payday in that country turning deadly.  Suicide bomber killed  30 people outside a bank near Pakistan's capital today.  The United Nations  now says that the spreading trouble has forced it to pull out some staff  and suspend long-term development work it had been doing in areas along the  Afghan border.  </p><p> A handful of elections in this country tomorrow could provide hints about  what you guys are thinking out there.  The country's state of mind a year  before pivotal 2010 midterm balloting. Tomorrow's results could shed light  on President Obama's political stock.  </p><p> And there won't ben any runoff election come Saturday in Afghanistan.

The  Vikings beat the Packers 38-26.  Here was Favre on his return to Green Bay.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRETT FAVRE, MINNESOTA VIKINGS: All the Packer fans were there and, I mean,  there was some purple.  And I saw just a mixture of everything.  Cheers.  A  couple fingers.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WOLF: Eagles rolled over the Giants 40-17.  Cowboys win.  Dolphin's Ted  Ginn Jr. returned two kickoffs for 100 yards and 101 yards.  Come on, how  about not kicking to him the second time.  Here was Jets losing coach Rex  Ryan, who has a bye next week.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REX RYAN, JETS COACH: You know, we're at 500 and the only way to get out is  we've got to come out with our hair on fire.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WOLF: Oh, well that will do it.  </p><p> The Colts stayed unbeaten.  Beat the 49ers 18-14.  Fourth-quarter touchdown  pass from Joseph Addai.  No relation to Joseph Abud (ph).  Stephane  Marberry (ph) showed up . . .</p><p> IMUS: Oh, stop.  You're about to get suspended.</p><p> MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p> WOLF: Stephane Marberry showed up at the Knicks home opener Saturday night,  I-man.</p><p> IMUS: Do you drink wine before we start or during.</p><p> WOLF: No, after.</p><p> IMUS: Oh, OK.</p><p> WOLF: He stood up taking video tape of the game, blocking the view of fans  behind him.  When ushers asked for Marberry's ticket, he was in the wrong  row.  He was asked to move, but instead he left when they asked him for his  bag.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> IMUS: Oh, no, that's it.  You're suspended.  Get it.</p><p> Twenty-five after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Please  welcome to the program now Big Kenny.  </p><p> Good morning, Big Kenny.</p><p> BIG ALPHIN: Thank you, Don.  Very good to be here.</p><p> IMUS: Happy birthday.  </p><p> ALPHIN: Thank you, thank you, thank you.  And happy birthday to my little  one.  Yes, Lincoln.</p><p> IMUS: Little Lincoln is four years old there, right?</p><p> ALPHIN: Yes, Lincoln's four years old.</p><p> IMUS: We got him a cake.  It has instructions (ph).</p><p> ALPHIN: Awesome.  Awesome.  Good.  And everything's going to be great.  He  loves the celebration.  </p><p> IMUS: Oh, he does.</p><p> ALPHIN: He's a celebrating kid.</p><p> IMUS: What does he think?  Does he tell you what he thinks when he watches  you sing?</p><p> ALPHIN: Yes.  Yes.</p><p> IMUS: What does he think?</p><p> ALPHIN: He likes it.  He likes it.</p><p> IMUS: He does?</p><p> ALPHIN: He loves being around the instruments and he loves singing and  playing music and he's always dressing up like some character.  I mean he  knows he's Captain America.  He knows he's Captain America and he's a rock  star.  He knows that right now, yes.  </p><p> IMUS: So how do you like being out here on your own? </p><p> ALPHIN: I love -- oh, I'm having a blast, man.  I love it all.  You know, I  love the -- having -- being able to play music in every fashion that I have  with John and Big &amp; Rich and with all my other friends that I've made music  with over the years.  I just -- I love what I do.  I'm excited now that  we're doing -- that I'm doing something different.  It lets me speak of  where I'm at in my life right now.  </p><p> You know, I was a bust (ph) just like Lord knows everybody else here in the  early '90s when that first crippling recession came through and I had 75  employees and a construction business.  And within three months, every bank  that was around went out of business, was taken over by the Comptroller of  the Currency, and that was when the savings and loan scandal came through.  </p><p> And then I was trying to build my way out of it.  I was always singing or  humming around on a job site.  A buddy comes up one day and says, hey,  Kenny, you sing pretty good.  You ought to go to Nashville.  You know they  pay people to write songs down there.  And I set my framing hammer down and  I look at him and I said, you've got to be kidding.  I've been farming and  slamming nails all this time and, you know, just, you know, hard work.   Making hay.  You know, it's hard work.</p><p> And, you know what, over the past 15 years, since I've moved to Nashville,  I've found out that song writing is hard work too.  Meaning, you have to  put a lot of time into it to do something great.</p><p> IMUS: Yes.</p><p> ALPHIN: But now I've not only gotten to a point where I've had some success  in music, but I've got a family, I've got a son.  As of this past year, we  were able -- me and my wife work with a group called My Sister's Keeper and  have a -- got a school built over the past three years right in the middle  of Sudan.  Got 550 young girls registered in there, having their first  chance at education 45 kilometers outside of a war zone.  We've got  doctors, we're giving away scholarships in the Appellation now because the  water's so blooming contaminated and all this area that I call home, you  know, we've got to let people know that the water can be killing their  kids, like lead paint was back in the '70s, you know.  </p><p> IMUS: Please don't turn into my wife.  </p><p> ALPHIN: Well, I'm not.  But -- and the way to do that is to plant -- have  music that's gross.  </p><p> IMUS: How does this work?  We're talking with Big Kenny here on the IMUS IN  THE MORNING program.  The album's called \"The Quite Times of a Rock and  Roll Farm Boy.\"  How does this -- how do you plant this?  I mean it's an  unusual packaging.  </p><p> ALPHIN: Well, my -- yes.  We had to come up with that.</p><p> IMUS: Remember, a lot of the people are listening to the radio.</p><p> ALPHIN: Yes, we had to come up with that packaging.  Instead of using a  plastic jewel case, which I just got tired of seeing them stacked around  everywhere. </p><p> IMUS: Sure.</p><p> ALPHIN: You know, I figure, what, there's hundreds of millions of records  made every week.  If we could just get rid of those one plastic jewel  cases, that could be a pile as big as the Empire State Building.  Huge.  So  we made a package that just -- it's a cardboard folder that folds up and  you can put your CD, take it out or put it back in or you can take the  package and it's plantable.   Meaning we put in the cardboard 26 different  varieties of my favorite perennial wildflower seeds. So you can just wet  the stuff and break it up into pieces and put it in flower pot and plant it  or you could just throw it out in your backyard and it's biodegradable,  it's compostable.  It will just wither to nothing.  So worst thing is, if  these -- if there are packages everywhere, our way will be paved in  flowers.  </p><p> IMUS: What's this business about loving everybody, because we don't love  anybody.  </p><p> ALPHIN: Oh, I don't believe that for a minute.</p><p> IMUS: Well, we don't love everybody.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> ALPHIN:  Well -- and it just struck me like a lightning bolt.  I guess, you  know, having gone through a business bust and a lot of other things in my  life, and having the time as a writer to spend time a lot of time thinking  and writing my thoughts down in all these crazy songs -- and this album of  songs that I've written now, it really does describe my life -- I just  decided that that was the best way to look at everything, every question  that I had, all the things that were consuming my mind that I saw as issues  throughout the world, or things that were right around me, with people that  were just around me.  I said the best thing I can do is just follow one  rule, and that's, well, I just love everybody, no matter what.  </p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> ALPHIN:  I know it's not the easiest thing in the world, but it can be  done.</p><p> IMUS:  You have a white aura around you.</p><p> ALPHIN:  A white aura?</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> MCCORD:  That's positive.  That's good.</p><p> IMUS:  That's good.</p><p> MCCORD:  That is good.</p><p> IMUS:  Let me ask you a question you have never been asked.  </p><p> ALPHIN:  OK.</p><p> IMUS:  Are you and John going to record again?  </p><p> ALPHIN:  I hope so, yes.  I would think so.</p><p> We've put a lot of energy into building what we've built so far.  John is  getting ready to be a daddy, I understand, and so a lot of things are  changing in his world right now.  </p><p> I had to hang upside down last year like a bat.  I was trying to get my  neck fixed naturally, without having to do what my daddy had been telling  me all my life, and that was, \"Son, sooner or later, you're going to have  to get your head screwed on straight.\"  So this doctor in Nashville finally  went in after this injury I sustained in 2002 from being hit by a drunk  driver.  He went into my throat and my spine.</p><p> He screwed a metal plate.  So I am now bionic Big Kenny.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, when John was here, he told us you were doing that.  I just  assumed that he was lying and that you all couldn't get along.</p><p> ALPHIN:  No.</p><p> IMUS:  Because look at Brooks &amp; Dunn after all these years.  Well, Ronnie  Dunn finally figured out -- it took him 20 years -- that he is the only one  who could sing in that group.  So -- I mean, the other guy is fine, but...</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> ALPHIN:  Well, I think it's -- as musicians, it's good for us.  John wanted  to express a lot of songs that I wouldn't -- that wouldn't naturally come  from me.  And these songs that make up all of Big Kenny, \"The Quiet Times  of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy,\"  these are the songs of my life right now.  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, you all toured this summer, didn't you?</p><p> ALPHIN:  Yes, we toured this summer and did all the Big and Rich classics.   And then he played a couple, I played a couple.  We had a blast.  We did  most of the country this summer.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, people like you individually.  They love -- and they may wind  up loving both of you individually.  </p><p> ALPHIN:  Yes, I would hope so.  They call me the Jack White of country  music, or the...</p><p> IMUS:  Jack White?</p><p> ALPHIN:  Yes.  He's recorded with Loretta Lynn.  </p><p> IMUS:  I love Jack White.</p><p> ALPHIN:  He's recorded with...</p><p> IMUS:  Well, that record he made with Loretta Lynn was great.  That was a  great record.  </p><p> ALPHIN:  Yes.  I want to make more records just -- I've got a studio built  in my back yard now.  It didn't necessarily start out like that.</p><p> It started out because I was working so much, touring so much.  And we were  -- we tried to move across the street because we could park the bus off the  street and make our neighbors happier.  And then my wife's going to work,  and \"All the time you're building the house, you're not going to church  enough, honey.\"  </p><p> So, to solve that, I had a friend come over.  We sketched up a nice little  building that looked kind of like a church, and we started building that in  the back yard.  And then my buddies are coming back going, \"Wow, this would  make a great studio.\"</p><p> So now every time at home I've solved all the issues.  I'm right there for  my kid.  He'd come running in just like I could run into the shop when my  dad was working on the farm.</p><p> I've got music in a studio around me all the time so I can get quiet, think  and write.  And, hey, I'm in church too.</p><p> IMUS:  Praise the lord.  Praise Jesus.</p><p> Big Kenny is going to sing for us in just a little bit here.</p><p> ALPHIN:  Amen.  </p><p> IMUS:  It's 33 after the hour.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p> Time now for our business update from the Fox Business Network.  </p><p> Here's Jenna Lee.  </p><p> LEE:  Good morning, everybody.  Here's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Bank of America's list of candidates to replace CEO Ken Lewis is looking  even shorter after another prospect reportedly told the bank no thanks.   \"The Wall Street Journal\" says Bank of America approached Bank of New York  Mellon CEO Robert Kelly.  Kelly has been approached before for succeeding  Ken Lewis, but is showing no interest in the job as of yet.  </p><p> Bernie Madoff's auditors expected to plead guilty.  Prosecutors say David  Friehling reached a deal with the government and will enter his plea  tomorrow.  </p><p> In the meantime, in a jailhouse interview, Bernie Madoff telling the  Securities and Exchange Commission he considers current SEC chair Mary  Schapiro \"a dear friend,\" and that she \"... probably thinks I wish I never  knew this guy.\"</p><p> Moving on to a different story here, winter came early in Beijing.  The  city waking up to snow on Sunday, to the earliest snowfall in 10 years.  </p><p> Meteorologists seated (ph) clouds with silver iodide, forcing the snow to  fall.  Beijing's city offices said because it's suffering from a drought,  it won't miss an opportunity for artificial precipitation.  </p><p> There's a look at it.  It looks like a lot of snow.</p><p> Quick earnings news for you.  Clorox saying H1N1, the flu, actually helping  out sales.  They had a big beat here.  Adjusted earnings, $1.18, versus the  expectation of 95 cents.  Revenue right in line with expectations, $1.37  billion.  </p><p> That's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p> If you're on the move this morning or at a computer, check us out for all  the latest business headlines -- FoxBusiness.com/livemorningedition,  streaming on your iPhone and online.  </p><p> Here's a quick look at the futures.  We have more IMUS IN THE MORNING  coming up.</p><p> MCCORD:  The House plan includes a government-run public run option and is  expected to cost less than $900 billion over 10 years.  House Republican  Mike Pence of Indiana, though, fears it goes way too far and calls it, in  fact, a freight train. </p><p> IMUS:  I mean, at some point, don't you have to say to grandma, look,  that's enough?  </p><p> MCCORD:  No.  What are you talking about?  </p><p> MCGUIRK:  Well, maybe, but coming from the government is a little...</p><p> MCCORD:  Why would you say that to grandma under any circumstances?  </p><p> IMUS:  Well, grandma is sitting there with the food falling out of her  mouth, staring at the TV, and the TV is not on.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> IMUS:  I mean...</p><p> MCCORD:  That's just great.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, I'm just saying.  </p><p> MCCORD:  So you slip over behind grandma...</p><p> MCGUIRK:  Be careful what you wish for.</p><p> IMUS:  You can tell he's a sweet guy.</p><p> MCCORD:  Oh, he's a lovely man.</p><p> IMUS:  He just looks at me and he says, \"Why do you hate everybody?\"  I  said no, it's a joke.  We don't hate everybody, we just hate you.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> IMUS:  No, we don't hate anybody.  Well, we hate -- do we hate -- no, we  don't hate anybody.  We just don't love everybody.  </p><p> All right.  Well, an album you can plant, that's reason enough to buy it,  \"The Quiet Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy.\"</p><p> Once again, please welcome Big Kenny.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> IMUS:  Oh, man, that's a great song.  That's a great song.  </p><p> Big Kenny, he'll be back with one more.  </p><p> It's 17 until the hour.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> IMUS:  This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  </p><p> Time now for a business update from the Fox Business Network.  </p><p> Here's Connell McShane.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Hi.  Good morning to you.</p><p> And coming up just moments from now on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" I will be in for  Alexis, and I'll be joined by a couple of former senators -- Bob Graham and  Jim Talent.  They're on different sides of the aisle, but both men agree  that investing in vaccines is important to the nation's security.  We're  talking H1N1.</p><p> We'll find out why on \"THE OPENING BELL.\"</p><p> All right.  Let's get to your \"Fox Business Minute\" now, with AIG dropping  its plans to sell some Japanese units.  </p><p> According to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" AIG is going to keep two of the  three life insurance units initially it had tried to sell.  Now, this fits  with the plan set forward by the CEO, Robert Benmosche, when he took over  back in August.  AIG, by the way, still owes the government some $85  billion.  </p><p> The liquidation of Lehman Brothers continues with a sale of more than $1  million worth of art.  The 283 lots brought in a total of $1.35 million,  nearly twice the expectations.  Now, the artwork once hung on the walls of  Lehman's corporate offices here in New York, and the money hardly puts a  dent on the $250 billion that Lehman still owes its creditors.  </p><p> Now, the big news this morning from Ford, For Motor Company reporting third  quarter earnings results that blew past analysts' estimates.  They reported  a profit of 26 cents a share, $30.9 billion in revenue, when they were  expected to have lost money.  </p><p>Ford says its turnaround plan is on track for the time frame they've  targeted.  You see the stock.  It's higher in pre-market trading.  </p><p> That is your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p> Speaking of higher, let's take a look at the futures this morning.  They  are also pointing to the possibility of a higher open on Wall Street.  </p><p> We'll be covering it all on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" which is coming up at the  top of the hour.  I will be in for Alexis on that.</p><p> More IMUS IN THE MORNING right now on Fox Business.</p><p> IMUS:  Eleven minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program, on the radio all the country and on the Fox Business Network.  </p><p> I just got an e-mail from the ayatollah, Charles.  </p><p> MCCORD:  What's this one?  God Almighty.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, that would be Mrs. Imus.</p><p> MCCORD:  Yes, boy.  What does she want?</p><p> IMUS:  She says, regarding Big Kenny, \"What a great guy he is.  His glasses  look like yours.\"</p><p> OK.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> IMUS:  \"We should be planting every CD cover.  When we buy plastic CD  covers,\" according to my wife, who is to the right of Sean Hannity, she  says, \"the terrorists win.\"  </p><p> Well, all right.  </p><p> Neil Cavuto will have the fat boy on tonight, our guy, Chris Christie.  And  -- now I'm not sure they will be in the same studio.  I'm not sure that  that's possible, actually.</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MCGUIRK:  That ain't right.</p><p> IMUS:  They'll be a two-shot, those two boys.</p><p> MCGUIRK:  You got your wide screen.</p><p> IMUS:  Yes.</p><p> Coming up next hour, Matt Taibbi from \"Rolling Stone.\"</p><p> Tomorrow, Mike Lupica.  His new book, \"Million-Dollar Throw,\" Wyatt Imus  read and loved.  And, of course, Lupica has written four or five of them,  \"The New York Times\" number one bestsellers.</p><p> And then on Wednesday, Jeff Greenfield from CBS and Monica Crowley from way  out there where the buses don't run.  So that kind of situation.</p><p> All right, time for one more here.  You all please welcome once again,  singing something from -- that last song, that was a great song.  This is  from -- oh, how about this one, Imus?  Maybe this would be great, too --  \"The Quite Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy,\" Big Kenny.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> IMUS:  Big Kenny.  </p><p> ALPHIN:  Thank you.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> IMUS:  Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program from Fox News,  actually, and his own syndicated national radio program that is doing  splendid, our old friend Alan Colmes.</p><p> Good morning, Mr. Colmes.  </p><p> ALAN COLMES, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Hello, Mr. Imus.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, how about all the stuff President Obama promised he was going  to do and he's done none of it?  None of it.  </p><p> COLMES:  The guy's been in office a few minutes.</p><p> IMUS:  None of it.  He's been in office almost a year.  He has done nof it.  </p><p> COLMES:  OK.  That justifies Lieberman.  </p><p> IMUS:  He has done none of it.</p><p> COLMES:  He's getting out of Iraq in 22 months.</p><p> IMUS:  He was the agent of change.  He's not going to get out of Iraq in  anything.</p><p> COLMES:  Sure he is.</p><p> IMUS:  How about \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell?\"  How about Guantanamo?  </p><p> COLMES:  I'd like to see him move faster on some things.  He inherited a  nightmare from the previous administration.</p><p> IMUS:  Oh, well, you can't spend the rest of your life blaming that  incompetent buffoon who was the president before this guy.  </p><p> COLMES:  You've got to sweep up the mess that was left.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, yes, but grab a mop and get busy then, as he said.</p><p> COLMES:  What do you think he's doing?  He was just praised for going to  Dover Air Force Base.  That's change you can believe.</p><p> IMUS:  That's one thing he did that was good.  </p><p> MCCORD:  Symbolic.</p><p> IMUS:  I like the guy, by the way.  I mean, Sean Hannity, it makes him  insane when I say that, but I do like him.  But I don't think he has any  idea what he's doing, and he's more interested in being president...</p><p> COLMES:  Oh, that's just ridiculous.</p><p> IMUS:  ... spending five hours playing golf with that dope Tom Friedman.  </p><p> COLMES:  I'm with O'Reilly on this one.  The guy's not allowed to have a  golf game?</p><p> IMUS:  No, not to...</p><p> COLMES:  The guy can't go enjoy himself for a few hours?</p><p> IMUS:  No, no, not to -- no, come on.  Do you have five hours to go play --  you probably do, but I don't have five hours to go do anything.  </p><p> COLMES:  Wait a minute.  So, when George W. Bush said, \"I'm playing  through\" after he was talking about the tragedy of 9/11, that was OK,  right?</p><p> IMUS:  Well, I didn't say it was OK.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> IMUS:  I didn't vote for him.  I didn't vote for him either time.  What are  you talking about?  </p><p> COLMES:  Well, I'm just pointing out to your audience the hypocrisy there.</p><p> IMUS:  Pardon me?  </p><p> COLMES:  I'm pointing out the hypocrisy in the situation.</p><p> IMUS:  Well, it's completely lost on me, and now you've irritated me.   So...</p><p> COLMES:  Oh, I'm really sorry.</p><p> IMUS:  No you're not.  You don't care at all.</p><p> COLMES:  I don't know how I can make it up to you.</p><p> IMUS:  You don't care about me.  </p><p> COLMES:  Yes, I do.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> IMUS:  Tonight at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Fox Business Network, Neil  Cavuto will interview our new favorite fat boy, New Jersey gubernatorial  candidate Chris Christie.  </p><p> And speaking of -- well, not fat boys, but Cavuto -- but then we could make  a case for -- well, whatever.  He'll be on this program tomorrow morning,  along with Mike Lupica.  He'll be talking about his new book, \"Million- Dollar Throw.\"</p><p> Right now, time for \"THE OPENING BELL.\"    </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC.

See how they're shaping up this Monday morning. And a quick look at futures as we show you Oil and Gold. imus in the morning is up next.</p><p>IMUS: Based on the interview that he did yesterday on his program <person><nameText>Chris Christie </nameText></person>-- if he doesn't get elected government in New Jersey, maybe there is something is wrong.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Politics -- but -- like Corzine is just a slimy, sleazy, Goldman Sachs thief, and an arrogant idiot dirt bag. All of that. But why do we need to get into this name calling, Bernie?</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, HOST: Well, don't hold back here I-man.</p><p>IMUS: Here's what I don't like about, when I got fired, you know, and when I was coming back to work, this moron -- I wasn't going to talk about this but I will. He had some statement about what he thought that I ought to have to do to come back to work. And here's what he have to do -- he ought to kiss my ass. How does that sound?</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentlemen, imus in the morning.</p><p>IMUS: Third day to my mind Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I will go down in history. February 15, 2004, when the Yankees traded for A-Rod.</p><p>MCCORD: Right.</p><p>IMUS: And of course, May 8, 2009, when it came back from a hit a home run.</p><p>MCCORD: Just exploded.</p><p>IMUS: There was never a doubt in my mind at any point that going back to February 15th, 2004, at the Yankees for marching on their way to the 27th world championship.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, HOST: May I just add rocket propelled to their 27th.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: So, way to go A-Rod.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, WARNER SPORT'S HOST: The name of the law (ph).</p><p>IMUS: What's the matter Warner?</p><p>(ALL TALKING AT ONCE)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: The fat boy will be on with Cavuto. The next governor of New Jersey, kind of interesting. Whether you like him or not, it's not a decent job, and even if he hasn't, he is not a creep. You know, he figured out a way to put together $16 billion.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, he did.</p><p>IMUS: He said to Corzine that he is a moron. And we know Corzine is a creep. And then I was watching the best of Imus, euphemistically speaking of course, on Saturday morning on the Fox Business Network. And half the time when I'm talking to people, I'm checking my e-mail.</p><p>MCCORD: I know its ugly reading his e-mail.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, it's difficult to get me to listen anyway.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, sure because that's a God damn thing.</p><p>IMUS: It is clear I am not listening to a word they are saying. I was talking to Laura Ingram when she was going out her notes word by word and that's people I like.</p><p>MCCORD: Stunning that you are able to hold up your end of the conversation.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, coming up this morning, Big Kenny is here.</p><p>MCCORD: All right.</p><p>IMUS: And he's got his love everybody. And we will be playing that song and we don't love anybody. There is no one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: Not a knocked on .</p><p>IMUS: You know what is new CD Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: The quiet times of a rock and roll farm boy. Which you can actually plant this thing.</p><p>MCCORD: No, you can't.</p><p>IMUS: This is way over thinking. No, no, no, it's fine, yes.</p><p>MCCORD: Really?</p><p>IMUS: But first we want to find out if we can listen to it which I would think.</p><p>MCCORD: What happens when you plant it?</p><p>IMUS: I don't know.</p><p>MCGUIRK: You could smoke it afterward.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Yes, it grows and you could smoke it, you know.</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN HOST: Hey, man. This is really good.</p><p>IMUS: So happy birthday to Big Kenny. It was his birthday yesterday. And his son's name, I think, is not Ford. It is not Chevy. It is Lincoln.</p><p>MCCORD: Lincoln, OK.</p><p>IMUS: Or Jefferson. No, it's Lincoln. It is Lincoln's birthday today.</p><p>MCCORD: Great.</p><p>IMUS: So, we got him a little cake. And Cally (ph) said he's already up. He is cranky but, you know, it is 6:00 in the morning in New York.</p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, Jenna Lee is going to have some business news at CIT. A thing that I don't understand at all but who else is doing business stuff?</p><p>STAFF: It's Dagen.</p><p>IMUS: Dagen McDowell. She will have some information about this as well. Warner Wolf, it is not over, right Warner?</p><p>WOLF: No, it's not over. Cliff Lee will win tonight two to nothing. Phillies will shoot out the Yankees two to nothing. Game six in New York on Wednesday.</p><p>IMUS: Then it's over.</p><p>WOLF: Good day. No, I'm thinking to go seven.</p><p>IMUS: Are you down?</p><p>WOLF: Yes. This is hopefully at the Seven Game Series.</p><p>IMUS: All right.</p><p>WOLF: And Charlie Manuel, I mean, I can't understand, he will going to get second guess forever. I don't care about three day's arrest. Cliff Lee had to pitch last night when you are down two games to one.</p><p>IMUS: Now you are down three to one.</p><p>WOLF: And now, you're down three to one. He had to pitch last night.</p><p>IMUS: He's going to pitch tonight?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, but if he wins you're still down now three-two. He had to pitch in the fourth game if you trail tow games to one.</p><p>IMUS: Well, but he didn't do it.</p><p>WOLF: He didn't do it. No.</p><p>IMUS: He will going to pitch tonight?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, that's right Imus.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Let's have to move on.</p><p>WOLF: Oh, my God.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: He didn't pitch last night so .</p><p>IMUS: He's going first.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: All right.

Rawalpindi just is a few miles from the capital Islamabad.</p><p>Police say the explosives may have been planted in a car in a parking lot. Suspected militants have struck Pakistan numerous times in recent weeks. In all about 250 people have died in apparent retaliation for the Army offensive in the Taliban stronghold in the northwest.</p><p>Meantime, the United Nations says spreading violence in the country has forced it to suspend long term development work in the northwest regions along the border with Afghanistan.</p><p>Health-care legislation provision would cap an employee's annual contribution to tax free health care spending accounts running against opposition now from an odd assortment of groups.

And a group called Save Flexible Spending Plans...</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>MCCORD: ...backed by insurers and a powerful union now running a print ad campaign against the cap calling it a definite tax on the middle-class, particularly people who happened to be suffering with chronic illnesses.</p><p>IMUS: There is no way to understand that news story.</p><p>MCCORD: It's crazy.

I'm fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Fabulous.</p><p>IMUS: What does this CIT thing mean?</p><p>MCDOWELL: CIT bankruptcy means that $2 billion have been lost to the American taxpayer. It is not coming back. We're never going to get it back.</p><p>This is the first recorded loss of the financial bailout last year. But I want to point CIT is going to keep operating so it's going to try and hang on to all of those borrowers -- those borrower customers; a lot retailers, a lot of vendors out there.</p><p>So it is going to keep operation.</p><p>IMUS: Goldman Sachs stands to make a billion doing what?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Trading, investment banking. You name it, it's making money doing it.</p><p>You know what? You know this morning -- you know who made money? Surprisingly Ford. Ford turned in a $1 billion profit for the quarter; made money in North America for the first time since the beginning of 2005.</p><p>Again, it's really winning out because it didn't take government money. It didn't take a bailout like GM and Chrysler.</p><p>IMUS: Best pickup ever made.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hallelujah, amen on that.</p><p>IMUS: The Ford F150. I have three or four of them.

Just a little joke.</p><p>Why was the market down 250 points on Friday?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, concerns about the consumer; about people not going out there and spending. We have numbers that people were not going out there and spending in September. That is about three quarters of the economy is the consumers.</p><p>By the way, you have to tee-up that video of Ron Newman, that accident yesterday. That was something.</p><p>IMUS: I am sure it was Dagen. Did you watch that race?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I watched the whole thing in my bathrobe with the dogs. Look at that. That was with 5 laps left. It was a snore, the whole thing.</p><p>IMUS: Well, for more than 10 minutes I've been listing to the radio. We're watching a car wreck on.</p><p>Well, let's restrict her plate racing, not to get into a lot -- but the cars, they can't get out of each other's way.

It's time for your \"FOX Business Minute.\"</p><p>Bank of America's list of candidates to take the place of Ken Lewis as the CEO is looking shorter and shorter after another prospect has reportedly told the bank no thanks. \"Wall Street Journal\" says B of A approached the Bank of New York Mellon CEO Robert Kelly. He's been approached before about succeeding Lewis but is showing no interest at all in the job.</p><p>Bernie Madoff's auditor expected to be pleading guilty. Prosecutors say that David Friehling reached a deal with the government and now will enter this plea tomorrow.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a jailhouse interview, Madoff himself told the Securities and Exchange Commission that he considers the current SEC Chair Mary Schapiro to be a \"dear friend\" and that she \"probably thinks I wish I never knew this guy.\"</p><p>And big news this morning out of Ford. We've been talking about this. Much better than expected earnings. Twenty-six cents a share in profit. Analysts were expecting a loss. Revenue nearly 31 billion.

I just can't get to -- what were you saying now?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No.</p><p>IMUS: Forty-five percent tax break --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: That's what she was saying, for God's sake.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Your taxes are going up.</p><p>IMUS: Why are you hollering at me? I'm a cancer patient.</p><p>MCCORD: Pay attention.</p><p>IMUS: I'm battling cancer here.</p><p>MCCORD: Your country is going to hell. Come on. Pay attention here, will you?</p><p>IMUS: What is today, Friday?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Last Friday, the doctors told me I had a week to live.</p><p>MCCORD: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Well --</p><p>MCCORD: Let's see, it's 12 minutes after 7:00 Eastern time.</p><p>IMUS: That's what I'm saying. I want a second opinion. It's like Warner Wolf's predictions.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Yes, come on.</p><p>It is 33 minutes past the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the radio all over the country and on the FOX Business Network. Big Kenny will be back next hour. We're going to talk to him. Get to the bottom of a number of issues, right, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: It's a complicated life.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Big Kenny says love everybody.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Of course we don't love anybody.</p><p>MCCORD: No indeed.</p><p>IMUS: But maybe he can turn us around. Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program now from \"Rolling Stone\" magazine Matt Taibbi.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Taibbi.</p><p>MATT TAIBBI, \"ROLLING STONE\" CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: Good morning, I- Man.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>TAIBBI: Good morning, Charles. Good. Yourself?</p><p>IMUS: We're going to have a discussion about Mr. Taibbi's goatee which we like, right?</p><p>MCCORD: The vote is in.</p><p>TAIBBI: You're all making me uncomfortable.</p><p>MCCORD: Really?</p><p>IMUS: Well, you've got to be comfortable enough. We are.</p><p>MCCORD: Accept the compliment.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: All right.</p><p>IMUS: We're not coming on to you.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>TAIBBI: That comes later, right?</p><p>IMUS: He's trying to get you in the limo.</p><p>MCCORD: Except you do look awfully good.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Trick-or-treat.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Anyway, so they've cancelled the elections in Afghanistan. I know you and I were talking about that. We can talk about anything.</p><p>TAIBBI: I'm happy to talk about Afghanistan.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know what that means, do you?</p><p>TAIBBI: I have no idea.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know what it means, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Just the Independent Election Commission has cancelled it and declared Karzai the victor during a news conference in Kabul today.</p><p>IMUS: Well, Duran Duran -- what was the guy's name?</p><p>TAIBBI: Abdullah Abdullah.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: Dr. Duran Duran, you're right.</p><p>IMUS: He bailed out because it was so phony. And the Secretary of State said what now? She said this is just an affirmation that, you know, the process is -- I don't know, she read something into it. It sounds to me.</p><p>MCCORD: It was a bit positive.</p><p>TAIBBI: That's his name Abdullah, Abdullah?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: Dr. Abdullah Abdullah.</p><p>TAIBBI: Any gulf statesmen should have at least one double name like Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: It's a good, you know, Barack <person><nameText>Barack Obama. </nameText></person>I mean, it would work well.</p><p>IMUS: So in the current issue of \"Rolling Stone,\" you write about sports logos?</p><p>TAIBBI: Right. It's actually \"Men's Journal.\"</p><p>IMUS: \"Men's Journal.\"</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes, yes. No, it's just sort of event, the commercialization phenomenon, you know, about how, you know, it's gotten to the point I think the economy is so bad now that they're trying so desperately to rescue profits in the sports business that I think they've really gone too far and they've basically sucked the life out of, you know, the sports watching process.</p><p>I don't know about you. I mean, I spent all last year trying to get that $5 foot long, you know, theme song out of my head. Every time I hear it, I want to drive a fork into my eardrum. I just can't take it anymore.</p><p>IMUS: Well, here's the -- and the names of these -- be helpful, by the way, if I did some research prior to Mr. Taibbi coming in and knew which magazine he wrote in. \"Men's Journal\" is the one with Tim McGraw on the cover, by the way. And he reveals I'm not sure what, something.</p><p>Here's the thing about people like Tim McGraw and these others. I guess that's how they get on the magazines but they reveal stuff about themselves that we don't want to know. I mean, I just -- it's like Andre Agassi have you heard about his new book?</p><p>TAIBBI: Oh, yes, with the whole meth -- doing meth. And actually he talks about how meth is really, really, you know, great. You know, it kind of resold me on the experience, you know.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I thought man, I forgot how good that was. I read those excerpts.</p><p>IMUS: But there's another excerpt, it's coming in here. When is he coming in, Bernie, next week or so?</p><p>BERNIE MCGUIRK: November 12th.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Apparently, remember when he had great looking hair.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right, and then he went bald and yes --</p><p>IMUS: Well, it was a rug there in the latter stages of --</p><p>MCCORD: Really?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Was it like extensions or was the whole thing a rug?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm not sure. But it was a rug to the degree that he was afraid it would fall off.</p><p>TAIBBI: Wow.</p><p>IMUS: So he says that he in the 1990 French Open finals.</p><p>TAIBBI: OK.</p><p>IMUS: There's a reason he lost. It was his first Grand Slam final.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right.</p><p>IMUS: The reason he lost is because he was worried about his rug falling off.</p><p>TAIBBI: Losing his rug.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Wow, that would have been one of the great ESPN moments of all time. Don't you think?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Top ten deal, it would have been number one forever. Big clump of hair there flying on the clay in rolling hills or wherever.</p><p>TAIBBI: Did you see that Manu Ginobili actually killed a bat in the middle of a game.</p><p>MCCORD: I saw that.</p><p>TAIBBI: The basketball game last week?</p><p>IMUS: No. Where did this happen?</p><p>TAIBBI: Sacramento.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Bat flew under -- and the guy actually -- you wax it with his hand, and the bat falls on the ground and it's like twitching and dying and he reaches down and grabs it, no hesitation whatsoever.</p><p>MCCORD: He walked over and handed it to somebody.</p><p>TAIBBI: It was the cool -- it was like he knew who to hand it to.</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly.</p><p>TAIBBI: Where's the guy you hand the bat to after? You know what I mean?</p><p>IMUS: The bat is in the stadium there or in the arena at Sacramento?</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: It starts flying around in the middle of the game. It was the weirdest thing ever.</p><p>MCCORD: It's Halloween.</p><p>TAIBBI: But not as weird as Andre Agassi's hair falling off in the middle of the French Open.</p><p>IMUS: What I'm thinking, how did he -- was he worried about it falling off in the semifinals. Great. Or the quarterfinals?</p><p>MCCORD: When did he start -- when did it become an issue, a distraction?</p><p>IMUS: Yes, you can't --</p><p>TAIBBI: Well, maybe -- I mean, you've got to think about the fact that he really only surged as a player after he committed to the whole bald look.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right? I mean --</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Maybe -- I mean, that wasn't until like eight years later. But I mean, still, maybe that was when he stopped worrying about it.</p><p>IMUS: Well, he never used to be able to finish five set matches, that whole thing.</p><p>TAIBBI: Well, it's hard to do after you've been, you know, taking meth for three days straight, you know.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't think he did for fun -- didn't do it for a lot of years, did he?</p><p>MCCORD: One year I think.</p><p>IMUS: One year.</p><p>TAIBBI: Oh, OK.</p><p>IMUS: Now Martina Navratilova wants him to give back all of his -- all of his Grand Slam trophies and so on.</p><p>TAIBBI: Because he was wearing a wig?</p><p>IMUS: No, because he was doing crystal meth.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Will it make you play better or just make you want to clean the stadium?</p><p>MCCORD: Swat a bat.</p><p>TAIBBI: I'm not sure taking meth would make you play better.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, me either.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Talking with Matt Taibbi from Rolling Stone. We're talking about sports logos. I was going to mention here at 21 until the hour, when I watch basketball which is more than I like to admit, I was watching Shaquille O'Neal and Lebron James, they were playing somebody, I forget --</p><p>TAIBBI: Celtics probably.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And Quicken Loans Arena.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, it's like it's named after a pawnshop.</p><p>TAIBBI: Oh, yes, I know especially all the different companies that went out of business in the last, you know, ten years, they're in business for, you know, a year, long enough to rip off five million people. They get their name on the stadium and then they go out of business. Like Enron Field and all that.</p><p>IMUS: And Citi Field.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right.</p><p>IMUS: Because you know a lot about digressing wildly here, a lot about Wall Street and that whole --</p><p>TAIBBI: They should call it bailout field is what they should call it.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. I thought -- my wife told me about CIT last night. And I thought that was Citigroup, but it's not. It's different. CIT is who?</p><p>TAIBBI: CIT? That's the business that Goldman got involved with, but Citi Field is Citigroup.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So that's not the office.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: . that claimed bankruptcy, right, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: No. No.</p><p>IMUS: That's CIT.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right, right.</p><p>IMUS: And how is Goldman --</p><p>TAIBBI: Well, Goldman is getting preferential treatment in the bankruptcy. I forget how that all works, but that was like the last time I was on the show. So that was weeks ago. I've been doing so much meth in the meantime, I've forgotten what that was all about.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>So, I really don't know.</p><p>IMUS: As long as we're at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, how is the football coach of the Browns doing? You wrote about -- you wrote about it.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes. I took a lot of heat in Cleveland because I compared Eric Mangini to Augustus Gloop. You know, remember the fat kid in the Willy Wonka movie?</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>TAIBBI: You know, he falls into the chocolate river, right?</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes. OK.</p><p>TAIBBI: You know, because he's too greedy and Gene Wilder is like oh, help, you know, save him. Right? So I wrote a column because we have a football column in \"Rolling Stone\" now where I compared Mangini to that's where Augustus Gloop has been all these years. He resurfaces, you know.</p><p>And I've been getting like death threats from Cleveland ever since -- they've quieted down since the Bears recent losing streak because people are turning their anger towards Mangini now. But --</p><p>IMUS: Well, the Browns are like one of seven, right?</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes. I mean, you know, Mangini comes in and he's like fining guys $1,700 for not paying for a bottle of water in their hotel room and that kind of stuff and you do this before even winning a game. Of course, you're going to lose. I mean, these guys are, you know, doing more land down on TV than Paris Hilton, you know. I mean, the Browns. So, it's been a rough year for Cleveland. I hate to pick on that city, but yes, there's nothing you can do.</p><p>IMUS: How do these guys like Mangini who didn't do all that great a job -- I guess he had one good year with the Jets, right?</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes, he had one good year. What I thought was interesting though is that he got his head coaching job after he took over the Patriots defense for one year which had been one of the best defenses in the league for years and years and years. And then he takes it over and it's like 15th or 16th in the league and he gets a head coaching job.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>TAIBBI: You know, it's like the Peter Principle. People get promoted to their level of incompetence and in the NFL it just seems to happen more quickly than in other places.</p><p>IMUS: Why does it happen? Why would he be blown out of a job with the Jets? Why would Cleveland think he's the answer?</p><p>TAIBBI: I think Cleveland has been trying to, you know, make up for their mistake of having let Bill Belichick go too early for the last, you know, five or six years. So they've, you know, now hired two successive Bill Belichick lieutenants and Mangini is, you know, he even physically resembles Belichick in a lot of ways. He obviously tries to take after him. And, you know, he's bad with the media the same way that Belichick is. You know, he's a disciplinarian.</p><p>I think they were trying to recapture that magic. I don't know what it is. And then, you know, I think they're probably also trying to stick it to Belichick by hiring him. So, but it just didn't work out. This has been --</p><p>IMUS: How long was --</p><p>TAIBBI: He's cursed, you know.</p><p>IMUS: How long was Belichick there?</p><p>TAIBBI: He was there for five years. He had one winning season but, you know, he didn't figure it out until of course he left Cleveland which is what happens to everybody who lives in Cleveland.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You know what that is? It's like Buffalo. You know, nobody who actually is from Buffalo actually succeeds at life. It never happens to them while they're in Buffalo. You know what I mean?</p><p>IMUS: It's 17 until the hour. We're talking with Matt Taibbi from the \"Rolling Stone\" here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program and \"Men's Journal.\"</p><p>Where are you on Brett Favre?</p><p>TAIBBI: I actually wrote a sports column earlier this year calling for Brett Favre to be chained to a rock in the middle of the ocean so that he could have his liver pecked out by sea birds for the rest of eternity.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: Come on, man. Don't hold back.</p><p>TAIBBI: I don't know. I mean, I'm sure I'm not alone. I'm just kind of sick of the whole phenomenon. Are you? I mean, every time I turn on the television the guy is staring back at me. I thought he gets the mirror in the house. You know --</p><p>IMUS: I was talking to Mike Lupica. I said who do you want to win the Packers/Vikings game? It's got to be the Packers. This guy can't go up there and win. I mean --</p><p>TAIBBI: But he did, you know. Yes.</p><p>And actually it's turning into what could have been kind of a really, really boring and overdone media story. The only way they could have saved this is by Brett Favre actually playing out of his mind and having actually a great year to warrant all the hype and he's doing it. So I think it's turning out to be a great thing for the NFL.</p><p>If he had come back and they were four and three and he was throwing a bunch of picks, you know, it would have been a nightmare because we'd still be hearing about it just as much but it wouldn't be, you know, worthwhile. So --</p><p>IMUS: And one of the strangest resumes of anyone I've ever read, Mr. Taibbi played professional basketball in Mongolia?</p><p>TAIBBI: That's right. Right.</p><p>IMUS: Professional baseball in Russia.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes. I played for the Red Army. Yes, yes.</p><p>I actually I tried to play -- the Russians briefly had a professional football league too.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>TAIBBI: And I tried to get in on that action for a team in St. Petersburg but it was all these ex-hockey players who didn't really understand the rules all that well, so I got two. I got a couple of helmets in the back in the practices and I thought to myself I'm not going to do this too much.</p><p>IMUS: How good did you have to be to be on the Russian army baseball team?</p><p>TAIBBI: Not that good. You know, I mean --</p><p>IMUS: You have to be able to play.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes. I mean, you had to be like, you know, a good high school player basically. I mean, yes, there were three guys that I played with over in Russia who ended up in the minors in the states.</p><p>IMUS: What position did you play?</p><p>TAIBBI: Well, I was a catcher in high school really but I played -- in Russia I ended up having to play center field because one of the guys who ended up being a prospect in the states was a catcher. So, you know, he got the catcher spot.</p><p>IMUS: And then the basketball in Mongolia, how did that happen?</p><p>TAIBBI: I was playing basketball in the street in Moscow and I met a Mongolian guy who told me they had this thing called the MBA, the Mongolian Basketball Association. So I went into work the next day and quit my job, got on the Trans-Siberian railroad and went to Mongolia and found a team. Got a tryout.</p><p>And I was playing for a team called the Mountain Eagles in the MBA which is the only league in the world that has MBA rules, by the way. It has a 24-second shot clock and a three-point line and everything. I played for them for about a year until I got pneumonia and almost died and had to leave the country.</p><p>IMUS: You were obviously doing meth then, right?</p><p>TAIBBI: That was actually pre-meth, believe it or not. Yes, that was like in -- that was in my healthy period.</p><p>IMUS: I got to quit my job here in Moscow and go to Mongolia and play basketball.</p><p>MCCORD: Get on the train.</p><p>IMUS: Are you going to do a book on this Wall Street thing, by the way?</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes, I'm working on it right now.</p><p>IMUS: Good.</p><p>TAIBBI: Yes, yes.</p><p>IMUS: People still -- Frank Rich, if you can believe this, quoting your Goldman Sachs line.</p><p>TAIBBI: Right.</p><p>IMUS: . in a Frank Rich \"New York Times\" column. So all of the stuff you did and all the stuff you learned is certainly worth a book.</p><p>TAIBBI: I hope so. You know, one of the problems I'm finding though is that the public has a very, very limited appetite for the Wall Street story. They're interested in it just long enough to get upset about it but --</p><p>IMUS: Here's why they'll like yours. I'm telling you I'm being serious, why we like you, why I like you. Because you're willing to say awful things about these people and you're willing to call them awful names.</p><p>MCCORD: Like people getting their liver pecked out on a remote island.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Yes. And you're a great writer and you're willing to resort to physical humor. And that appeals to me and my 11-year-old son.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>All right, Matt, thank you very much.</p><p>TAIBBI: Thanks a lot, I-Man.</p><p>IMUS: Matt Taibbi, \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Men's Journal.\" It's 13 until the hour.</p><p>MUSIC: IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update from the FOX Business Network. Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: Time for your \"FOX Business Minute.\" AIG dropping its plans to sell some Japanese units. According to this morning's \"Wall Street Journal,\" AIG is now going to keep two of the three life insurance units it initially had tried to sell. And this fits in with the plan set forward by the CEO, Robert Benmosche, when he took over in August. AIG still owes the government, remember, some 85 billion dollars.</p><p>The liquidation of Lehman Brothers continues with the sale of more than a million dollars worth of art. Two hundred eighty-three lots brought in a total $1.35 million. Nearly twice the expectations that some had for this art work, which once hung in the walls of Lehman's corporate offices right here in New York City. The money hardly puts a dent in the 250 billion that Lehman still owes to its creditors</p><p>And this morning in case you missed it, Ford is already out with its third quarter results way above expectations. They earned 26 cents a share when they were expected to have lost money. $30.9 billion in revenue, also better than expected.</p><p>Stock up in pre-market. Ford with its turnaround plan on track according to the company. And in the next hour, we'll have more earnings coming out. Sysco, the food company, and Clorox set to be reporting their results.</p><p>That's your \"FOX Business Minute.\" When you log on this morning, go download that new FOX Business iPhone app. It's great.

Here we are, up 37 on the Dow.</p><p>More IMUS IN THE MORNING right now.</p><p>IMUS: Taibbi pretty much on automatic.</p><p>MCCORD: He sure is.</p><p>IMUS: Coming up next hour, we're going to talk with Big Kenny, get to the bottom of a number of things for Big Kenny.</p><p>Happy birthday to the boy. It's his birthday yesterday. And his son, adorable little child, 4 years old. Lincoln it's his birthday today. It was Kinky Friedman's birthday yesterday as well.</p><p>Rob and Tony are here. How are you guys?</p><p>ROB BARTLETT: We're fine.</p><p>TONY POWELL: Good.</p><p>IMUS: What's on your mind, Tony.</p><p>POWELL: Well, now, this little girl, Abigail Breslin, the child that played in \"Little Miss Sunshine\" has been cast in the Broadway revival of \"The Miracle Worker,\" the Helen Keller Story.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>POWELL: That little blind, deaf Helen Keller.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>POWELL: Well, there's a little problem because the Alliance for Inclusion, a group that advocates for disabled actors wants them to cast a blind deaf actress to play little Helen Keller. And I'm just thinking they've lost their minds.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>POWELL: Can you imagine how much money that cost in rehearsal just the rehearsal time alone?</p><p>IMUS: No, Tony.</p><p>POWELL: How many times would the director have to yell cut is my point?</p><p>IMUS: Well, there's a way -- isn't there a way they do that?</p><p>POWELL: I don't know. I can't even imagine it. First of all, think about Broadway. You've been to Broadway. Have a blackout, you know, at the end of a scene. That girl is still standing there.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>She wouldn't know.</p><p>IMUS: This is not that funny, Tony.</p><p>POWELL: It is. I mean --</p><p>IMUS: I'm happy this is not racial this time.</p><p>POWELL: Well, no.</p><p>IMUS: Whining about something -- blaming me and Rob for something.</p><p>POWELL: I don't blame Rob. I advocate for all people with all kinds of issues.</p><p>IMUS: No, you don't.</p><p>POWELL: Yes, I do.</p><p>IMUS: Most of the time you don't.</p><p>POWELL: I mean I understand. I mean, again, I just have a problem with this. I mean, you know, when you cast a play, you cast the best actor available. I mean, you wouldn't cast a stutterer to play Hamlet. That's a long show.</p><p>You go for a Sunday matinee, you don't leave until Tuesday. That's just stupid.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>POWELL: I'm just saying. Man, that's all. That's my only point. That's it.</p><p>IMUS: Be a convoy of news trucks out here today. Because you know what I'd be happy? For once they won't be here for me.</p><p>POWELL: I'm not.</p><p>IMUS: They'll be here for you.</p><p>MUSIC: Imus, Imus, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hey there.</p><p>IMUS: Did you get --</p><p>IMUS: Go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Did you get your hair fixed and everything?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I think I did. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It looks good.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, God.</p><p>IMUS: I have a little mirror here that Cavuto got me so I can check it every once in a while.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Curtains on the Titanic. Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: I don't need those kinds of comments from you, Bernard. You look like Casper the ghost grandfather. I mean, just butt out.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCGUIRK: What?</p><p>IMUS: What's the big business news this morning?</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're going to be -- we're going to be watching personal spending and income. It comes out at the bottom of the hour.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>How do I follow up? Well, speaking of Casper, at least Bernie doesn't need to buy a costume for tomorrow, right?</p><p>IMUS: No, he doesn't. But don't start in on him.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Wait a minute. You're in trouble.</p><p>IMUS: You're in trouble. Hold down a second. It's just better if you just don't say anything to him.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I wonder above the fence line. I wonder what's happening here.</p><p>IMUS: It's just like poking a -- it's just like taking a sharp stick and poking a lion. Right, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly. God almighty.</p><p>IMUS: Digressing like a drunk at a Christmas party.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: Where's your husband from?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Born and raised in New York City.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So --</p><p>MCDOWELL: His parents are artists. Now they live up in the woods in Massachusetts on a dirt road, and they are as left as they come. Nancy Pelosi is not liberal enough for them.</p><p>IMUS: What -- what do they -- how was that when he brought you home?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Hey, look, Morticia Adams is here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Here we go.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's actually pretty good. That's pretty good. I've gone as Morticia because I don't have a buy a costume. I got a closet full of black clothes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I've got the complexion of a flounder. There you go.</p><p>IMUS: You're firing me. Thank you very much, Dagen.</p><p>DON IMUS, HOST: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update. From the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, everybody. Coming up on IMUS IN THE MORNING, Big Kenny, of Big and Rich fame, will be back with Imus this morning to play some music and talk a little bit to us. So we're looking forward to that. Let's talk a little bit about some business news now with your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>CIT Group filing for bankruptcy. It's the fifth largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. The lender was unable to get its bondholders to agree to a debt for equity offer. But according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" CIT does have support for a prepackaged bankruptcy plan, including funding from billionaire investor Carl Icahn. This could allow CIT to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of the year.</p><p>It was certainly a big weekend for bank failures as feds seized nine more banks. The most ever to be shut down in one day since the financial crisis began. The banks will reopen today as U.S. bank branches after the company steps in and agrees to assume their deposits. They have and they will. This brings the total of bank failures so far this year to 115.</p><p>In other banking news, executives from the country's 28 largest banks are meeting with Federal Reserve officials today to discuss compensation, as well as regulation. The Fed is looking to take information from the meeting and get a look at the compensation trends, as well as practices used by the companies.</p><p>We also have some breaking earnings news at this hour. Sysco, which is Sysco with an s, the food company, not Cisco the big tech company. It looks like 55 cents are their earnings coming in. That would be a dime better than expectations. We're going to continue to look through and see if we have a revenue call here, which looks like we do, $9.08. That's slightly, just slightly, below the expectation of $9.1 billion. So it looks like a beat for earnings per share. A little bit miss or a little bit light on revenue.</p><p>That's your \"Fox Business Minute.\" When you log on this morning, go download the new Fox Business app. It's the only app that notifies you when your stock hits the target price you want.

You have more IMUS IN THE MORNING coming up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: By the way, about <person><nameText>Chris Christie, </nameText></person>politics aside, because I don't believe any of them, I mean, look what Obama said he was going to do when he got -- and he doesn't -- now he hasn't got any intention of doing any of it. But it's good he's there. It's good for this country. It's good for the world. Same with that fat boy from New Jersey. I mean that boy got a great sense of humor. Got a good answer on vaccinations. And, I mean, you know, the other guy is just a creep. I can -- but here's what I don't -- and Christie's right. If I'm fat, man up and call me fat, bitch, you know. I mean, what is that about?</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS SHOW: Let's go. Bring it on.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS SHOW: Don't beat around the bagel or whatever.</p><p>IMUS: Jon Corzine is a slimy, thieving, Goldman Sachs, gutless, paying his girlfriend on the side weasel.</p><p>MCGUIRK: A proven failure.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, exactly. Bernie is it for politics. I'm in it for the fat boy. How bad could the fat boy be?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: Five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country and on the Fox Business Network. Jenna Lee, Dagen McDowell, Warner Wolf, Chuck, Bernie, Lou, and then Big Kenny all coming up.</p><p>MCCORD: Great.</p><p>IMUS: What do the numbers show in the race in New Jersey, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: Still within the statistical margin of error, I-man. Very close. A dead heat.</p><p>IMUS: Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Any hopeful signs?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, yes, Obama was there yesterday and he's not exactly helping out. Carries around a lot of baggage. That's hopeful.</p><p>IMUS: Why would the president -- whether you approve of his policies or not, is a decent moral guy -- why would he campaign for some dirt bag like Jon Corzine? Or was he?</p><p>MCGUIRK: It would just -- it's going to reflect poorly on the president if the three national races -- if he loses all three. If the Democrats lose all three at this particular time. So he needs one victory here and he thinks he can get it in New Jersey. And that's why he's going all out for the Goldman Sachs thug.</p><p>IMUS: Well, we know that Corzine doesn't know what he's doing. And here's how you know -- here's how you know he doesn't know what he's doing.</p><p>MCCORD: Break it down.</p><p>IMUS: Read \"The New York Times\" yesterday and Mayor Bloomberg, whether you like him or not, is one, not a creep, and, two, not a dummy. But you know who he said was a dummy.</p><p>MCCORD: Who?</p><p>IMUS: Corzine. The boy is stupid.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He said that?</p><p>IMUS: Essentially. Implied that. Did you read it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, he said he was a moron.</p><p>MCGUIRK: It just sounds -- it just sounds like something you would say. Corzine's a moron. It doesn't sound like something Bloomberg would say.</p><p>IMUS: I'm paraphrasing the mayor.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: But he said he didn't -- they didn't -- he didn't appear to know -- he didn't appear to know what he was doing.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And essentially they're both doing the same thing, which is buying the election, or trying to, using their own money.</p><p>IMUS: Well, but you could make a case that Bloomberg has done a much better job in New York City than Corzine has done in New Jersey, couldn't you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No question. Without a doubt.</p><p>IMUS: Well, that's Bloomberg's point. I know you don't like Bloomberg, and that's fine, but he's not a creep. That's why -- he doesn't creep you out. And . . .</p><p>MCGUIRK: No ethical stains on his record (ph).</p><p>IMUS: Right, and he's done -- he's done a decent job and he's . . .</p><p>MCGUIRK: And he made his money legitimately, not . . .</p><p>IMUS: He's not a criminal and a gangster.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe we're going too far, huh?</p><p>MCCORD: No. No, you haven't gone too far at all.</p><p>IMUS: And a thug like Corzine.</p><p>MCCORD: No. Go farther.</p><p>IMUS: So we're for the fat boy . . .</p><p>MCCORD: Further.</p><p>IMUS: Who, by the way, the fat boy we're just hoping, at least he's -- he appears to be OK. And what I liked about him, he has a decent sense of humor. He didn't appear to be a complete, total phony. He's not going to cut taxes and he's not going to clean up corruption in New Jersey. And here's -- one, we don't want it cleaned up.</p><p>MCCORD: It's Jersey for God's sakes.</p><p>IMUS: It's New Jersey. Leave it. It's working fine. That part of it is working fine.</p><p>MCCORD: Badabing.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Atmosphere.</p><p>IMUS: And the tax thing, just don't raise taxes and we'll be happy with you. So -- and plus it will make me look great. I mean, I'll be leading Jeff Greenfield around the studio here with a wire coat hanger around his neck. You know what I'm saying?</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: Will that little lupica (ph) be in here tomorrow. That little liberal panty waste. We'll be slapping him around too.</p><p>So, all right, time for a little news now. And here with that is Charles McCord.</p><p>Good morning, Chuck.</p><p>MCCORD: Good morning, I-man.</p><p>Suicide bomber aboard a motorbike has killed 30 people, injured 45 today outside a bank near Pakistan's capital. This reporter's on the scene there in the city of Rawalpindi.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Security is generally very, very tight in this area, but police officials on the site said that it is very difficult to stop suicide bombers. This motorcycle rider just happened -- came up to the bank and blew himself up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: And now the continuing violence in Pakistan, some 250 people killed in recent attacks, is prompting the United Nations to suspend long-term development work in the northwestern regions along the border with Afghanistan.</p><p>Afghanistan's election commission says Saturday's presidential runoff cancelled now that Dr. Abdullah Abdullah . . .</p><p>IMUS: What? What? What?</p><p>MCCORD: They've called off the runoff now that Abdullah Abdullah has dropped out of the race. Abdullah says that he decided to get out because he believes there just will be massive voter fraud again and he wants the Afghani people to move on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ABDULLAH ABDULLAH, FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER OF AFGHANISTAN: Only and purely to the interest of the people of Afghanistan and to give the people of Afghanistan a chance to -- to move on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: So that's it. There won't be a runoff. And Afghanistan's election commission has cancelled the vote and proclaimed President Hamid Karzai victor of the nation's tumultuous ballot. Karzai's challenger Abdullah Abdullah having dropped out and they say that's it.</p><p>IMUS: Looks like Pat Cadel (ph), doesn't he?</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: Yes. Separated at birth.</p><p>IMUS: Uh-huh.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's a Halloween picture right there.</p><p>IMUS: Wasn't Pat Cadel a Hollywood guy I always said his nose always stuffed up every time he was on TV. But, yes. Is that Abdullah Abdullah or Pat Cadel?</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's Abdullah, but it's tough to tell the difference.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Don't they look almost like separated at birth? Like Cavuto and that -- well, that's unfair. And Cavuto will be on this program tomorrow, by the way.</p><p>MCCORD: OK. Good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Like you and Betty White, how about that?</p><p>IMUS: I don't think it's helpful . . .</p><p>MCGUIRK: I'm just sticking up for my man Neil.</p><p>IMUS: To say hurtful things to a cancer patient, do you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, it's not.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, God.</p><p>IMUS: Chuck continues.</p><p>MCCORD: Independent health advisors will begin monitoring the safety of the swine flu vaccine today. Specialists are not expecting problems -- doesn't mean that -- because the vaccine is made the same way as the regular winter flu vaccine.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, come on. Come on here.</p><p>MCCORD: But the government is now taking these extra steps, I-man, to track the health of millions who are going to get the shot in order to spot any problems quickly and also to explain anything that crops up, like a false alarm when common disorders coincide with having gotten the inoculation.</p><p>IMUS: Guess who's not going to get one of these?</p><p>MCCORD: Who's that?</p><p>IMUS: Me.</p><p>MCCORD: Meanwhile, White House Senior Advisor David Axelrod says there will be 10 more million doses of the vaccine available by the end of this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: We have 28 -- I'm sorry, 40 million doses. We had 28 million as of last week. It's growing every day. We expect to get 10 million this week. And we're catching up quickly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: I don't know if it works, one. Don't know -- one, don't know if it works. And, two, don't even know if the vaccine is safe, do they? Do they?</p><p>MCCORD: Well . . .</p><p>IMUS: And then here's an e-mail I got from Deirdre Imus. You know here, right?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, I do.</p><p>IMUS: OK. She says -- now this is great. When did I received this, 6:49 a.m. And she writes, Bo is right. Well, now you can't win that argument, can you?</p><p>MCCORD: With her? What argument can you win with her?</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, but . . .</p><p>MCCORD: Good Lord.</p><p>IMUS: Eight million kids are all -- well, he was talking about this medical child abuse.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Where almost every kid who comes to the ranch -- there have been a thousand through there -- almost every kid is on something. Some kind of mood altering deal. Ritalin or some other nonsense. And they put them on it. And do you know why they put them on it, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: How come?</p><p>IMUS: Because nobody wants to spend any time with them to help them deal with it.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So it's a lot easier rather than to find some sort of cure or to -- or to -- or spend time with them or get them on a decent diet, or get them some exercise, or whatever, I mean, obviously there are cases where it is needed, but almost 90 percent of the cases is not. So it's just easier to give them a drug, isn't it?</p><p>MCCORD: Over medicate them.</p><p>IMUS: That's right.</p><p>MCCORD: Shoot 'em up and ship 'em out. Basically what it is.</p><p>IMUS: I like that. But, I mean, I don't like that, but I like the phrase.</p><p>MCCORD: All right.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Time now for the Fox Business Networkbusiness report. And here with that is Dagen McDowell.</p><p>Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Fabulous.</p><p>IMUS: So I said to Jenna Lee earlier this morning, off the air, I said, I wouldn't want to be at a party with Liz Claman and Dagen McDowell. I think that could be dangerous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why?</p><p>IMUS: I don't know. I just think three drinks, you both are on the table.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Liz is a tea totaller (ph).</p><p>IMUS: She is?</p><p>MCDOWELL: But she's a -- she is fun, though. She is fun.</p><p>IMUS: She's a nice woman. I like her. And we like you, too, by the way.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, thank you.</p><p>IMUS: What's going on in -- well, wherever?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, where I am . . .</p><p>IMUS: Wall Street or main street or . . .</p><p>MCDOWELL: Where I'm locked in.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, wouldn't you read a Wall Street book by Matt Taibbi?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I would.</p><p>IMUS: Not me. And why? Because he drops the f-bomb a lot. And, two, he will say horrible things personally about everybody on Wall Street.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What was it . . .</p><p>IMUS: Fat, unattractive people.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What did he say about Favre? Having his liver eaten out by piranhas? What was it?</p><p>MCCORD: Pecked out by birds on a . . .</p><p>IMUS: Oh, well, he wanted Brett Favre tied to a rock in the middle of the ocean and wanted his liver pecked out by seagulls or -- well, it was something, yes. Oh, yes, I mean, that's what we want. That's a Wall Street book we will read.</p><p>Anyway, what's going on?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Absolutely.</p><p>Speaking of Liz Claman, she's going to be interviewing the CEO of Ford, Alan Mulally, coming up in the noon hour today. And that's -- there's going to be a lot to talk about because Ford . . .</p><p>IMUS: How does she get all these interviews, I wonder? Like Warren -- well, Warren Buffett's got the hots for her, I know that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because she works her you know what off. She stays in contact with them. She stays on top of the news. She is one of the hardest working woman I know.</p><p>IMUS: Kind of like a Barbara Walters deal. Except with Barbara Walters, Barbara slept with all of them. And I can say that because Barbara's my friend. So . . .</p><p>MCGUIRK: Was your friend.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Liz . . .</p><p>IMUS: What did you say?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Was your friend.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, she even -- Barbara, she understands what she did.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Is that how you got on the show? Please.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>Anyway, what were you going to say now, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Liz is going to be talking with the CEO of ford. She's going to have a lot to talk about because Ford produced almost a $1 billion profit in the most recent quarter. Nobody expected that. Incredible turnaround for the company. And didn't take taxpayer dollars. Didn't go bankrupt like General Motors and Chrysler. So there's going to be -- but that's hurting Ford actually because the unions turned down these wage cuts. The union, the UAW at Ford said no way to more concessions, which they gave to GM and Chrysler.</p><p>IMUS: Charles and I are rolling our eyes.</p><p>MCCORD: No we're not.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, we are.</p><p>MCCORD: Don't include me. I think that's interesting.</p><p>IMUS: No, no, she was talking. You're lying.</p><p>MCCORD: For God's sake.</p><p>IMUS: You are lying.</p><p>MCCORD: I am absolutely not.</p><p>IMUS: She was talking and you were rolling your eyes.</p><p>MCCORD: That is wrong.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why were you rolling your eyes?</p><p>MCCORD: I wasn't.</p><p>IMUS: Because it's too much information for us.</p><p>MCCORD: Not enough.</p><p>IMUS: We can't -- we just can't . . .</p><p>MCCORD: I want to know about the unions.</p><p>IMUS: No, you don't.</p><p>MCCORD: I want to know why they didn't turn . . .</p><p>IMUS: You don't care anything about it.</p><p>MCCORD: Absolutely I do.</p><p>IMUS: He's lying, Dagen.</p><p>MCCORD: I want to know why Ford didn't go bankrupt.</p><p>IMUS: He's just lying.</p><p>MCCORD: And why they were able to get by without any of our money.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can tell you -- I can tell you that.</p><p>IMUS: Ford F-150. Ford F-150, right Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's right. And I -- yes, I can tell you that too because Ford -- Alan Mulally came in and borrowed money way ahead. He planned in advance. He even mortgaged the logo.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: There you go.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: He's our guy.</p><p>All right, Dagen, thank you.</p><p>MCCORD: Foresight instead of hindsight.</p><p>IMUS: Dagen McDowell, who will be on later with business news that make sense as opposed to our ruining her report and we apologize for that. I do.</p><p>It's 16 after the hour, we're talking with Big Kenny coming up and Warner. From the Imus Ranch record, this is Big &amp; Rich. They did a good job of it.</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update. From the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.</p><p>LEE: Good morning, everybody. Let's get straight to your Fox Business minute. We have some earnings reports to tell you about this morning, starting with Sysco, the food company. Sysco with an s, that is. When you take out one-time items, Sysco earning 46 cents a share. That's a penny better than the expectation. Sales, though, slightly lower than what the street was looking for. There's a look at the stock in the pre-market.</p><p>Also, Ford reporting much better than expected results. Earnings coming in at 26 cents a share. Analysts expecting a loss of 12 cents. Revenue of nearly $31 billion, also much better than expected. The company's CFO says the results prove the company's turnaround program is on track. That stock rising in the pre-market as well. It's the biggest gainer among the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>And \"This Is It\" dancing its way right to the top of the weekend box office.

This continuing violence in Pakistan. A payday in that country turning deadly. Suicide bomber killed 30 people outside a bank near Pakistan's capital today.

He knows that right now, yes.</p><p>IMUS: So how do you like being out here on your own?</p><p>ALPHIN: I love -- oh, I'm having a blast, man. I love it all. You know, I love the -- having -- being able to play music in every fashion that I have with John and Big &amp; Rich and with all my other friends that I've made music with over the years. I just -- I love what I do. I'm excited now that we're doing -- that I'm doing something different. It lets me speak of where I'm at in my life right now.</p><p>You know, I was a bust (ph) just like Lord knows everybody else here in the early '90s when that first crippling recession came through and I had 75 employees and a construction business. And within three months, every bank that was around went out of business, was taken over by the Comptroller of the Currency, and that was when the savings and loan scandal came through.</p><p>And then I was trying to build my way out of it. I was always singing or humming around on a job site. A buddy comes up one day and says, hey, Kenny, you sing pretty good. You ought to go to Nashville. You know they pay people to write songs down there. And I set my framing hammer down and I look at him and I said, you've got to be kidding. I've been farming and slamming nails all this time and, you know, just, you know, hard work. Making hay. You know, it's hard work.</p><p>And, you know what, over the past 15 years, since I've moved to Nashville, I've found out that song writing is hard work too. Meaning, you have to put a lot of time into it to do something great.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>ALPHIN: But now I've not only gotten to a point where I've had some success in music, but I've got a family, I've got a son. As of this past year, we were able -- me and my wife work with a group called My Sister's Keeper and have a -- got a school built over the past three years right in the middle of Sudan. Got 550 young girls registered in there, having their first chance at education 45 kilometers outside of a war zone. We've got doctors, we're giving away scholarships in the Appellation now because the water's so blooming contaminated and all this area that I call home, you know, we've got to let people know that the water can be killing their kids, like lead paint was back in the '70s, you know.</p><p>IMUS: Please don't turn into my wife.</p><p>ALPHIN: Well, I'm not. But -- and the way to do that is to plant -- have music that's gross.</p><p>IMUS: How does this work? We're talking with Big Kenny here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. The album's called \"The Quite Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy.\" How does this -- how do you plant this? I mean it's an unusual packaging.</p><p>ALPHIN: Well, my -- yes. We had to come up with that.</p><p>IMUS: Remember, a lot of the people are listening to the radio.</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes, we had to come up with that packaging. Instead of using a plastic jewel case, which I just got tired of seeing them stacked around everywhere.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>ALPHIN: You know, I figure, what, there's hundreds of millions of records made every week. If we could just get rid of those one plastic jewel cases, that could be a pile as big as the Empire State Building. Huge. So we made a package that just -- it's a cardboard folder that folds up and you can put your CD, take it out or put it back in or you can take the package and it's plantable. Meaning we put in the cardboard 26 different varieties of my favorite perennial wildflower seeds. So you can just wet the stuff and break it up into pieces and put it in flower pot and plant it or you could just throw it out in your backyard and it's biodegradable, it's compostable. It will just wither to nothing. So worst thing is, if these -- if there are packages everywhere, our way will be paved in flowers.</p><p>IMUS: What's this business about loving everybody, because we don't love anybody.</p><p>ALPHIN: Oh, I don't believe that for a minute.</p><p>IMUS: Well, we don't love everybody.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ALPHIN: Well -- and it just struck me like a lightning bolt. I guess, you know, having gone through a business bust and a lot of other things in my life, and having the time as a writer to spend time a lot of time thinking and writing my thoughts down in all these crazy songs -- and this album of songs that I've written now, it really does describe my life -- I just decided that that was the best way to look at everything, every question that I had, all the things that were consuming my mind that I saw as issues throughout the world, or things that were right around me, with people that were just around me. I said the best thing I can do is just follow one rule, and that's, well, I just love everybody, no matter what.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>ALPHIN: I know it's not the easiest thing in the world, but it can be done.</p><p>IMUS: You have a white aura around you.</p><p>ALPHIN: A white aura?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCCORD: That's positive. That's good.</p><p>IMUS: That's good.</p><p>MCCORD: That is good.</p><p>IMUS: Let me ask you a question you have never been asked.</p><p>ALPHIN: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Are you and John going to record again?</p><p>ALPHIN: I hope so, yes. I would think so.</p><p>We've put a lot of energy into building what we've built so far. John is getting ready to be a daddy, I understand, and so a lot of things are changing in his world right now.</p><p>I had to hang upside down last year like a bat. I was trying to get my neck fixed naturally, without having to do what my daddy had been telling me all my life, and that was, \"Son, sooner or later, you're going to have to get your head screwed on straight.\" So this doctor in Nashville finally went in after this injury I sustained in 2002 from being hit by a drunk driver. He went into my throat and my spine.</p><p>He screwed a metal plate. So I am now bionic Big Kenny.</p><p>IMUS: Well, when John was here, he told us you were doing that. I just assumed that he was lying and that you all couldn't get along.</p><p>ALPHIN: No.</p><p>IMUS: Because look at Brooks &amp; Dunn after all these years. Well, Ronnie Dunn finally figured out -- it took him 20 years -- that he is the only one who could sing in that group. So -- I mean, the other guy is fine, but...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ALPHIN: Well, I think it's -- as musicians, it's good for us. John wanted to express a lot of songs that I wouldn't -- that wouldn't naturally come from me. And these songs that make up all of Big Kenny, \"The Quiet Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy,\" these are the songs of my life right now.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you all toured this summer, didn't you?</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes, we toured this summer and did all the Big and Rich classics. And then he played a couple, I played a couple. We had a blast. We did most of the country this summer.</p><p>IMUS: Well, people like you individually. They love -- and they may wind up loving both of you individually.</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes, I would hope so. They call me the Jack White of country music, or the...</p><p>IMUS: Jack White?</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes. He's recorded with Loretta Lynn.</p><p>IMUS: I love Jack White.</p><p>ALPHIN: He's recorded with...</p><p>IMUS: Well, that record he made with Loretta Lynn was great. That was a great record.</p><p>ALPHIN: Yes. I want to make more records just -- I've got a studio built in my back yard now. It didn't necessarily start out like that.</p><p>It started out because I was working so much, touring so much. And we were -- we tried to move across the street because we could park the bus off the street and make our neighbors happier. And then my wife's going to work, and \"All the time you're building the house, you're not going to church enough, honey.\"</p><p>So, to solve that, I had a friend come over. We sketched up a nice little building that looked kind of like a church, and we started building that in the back yard. And then my buddies are coming back going, \"Wow, this would make a great studio.\"</p><p>So now every time at home I've solved all the issues. I'm right there for my kid. He'd come running in just like I could run into the shop when my dad was working on the farm.</p><p>I've got music in a studio around me all the time so I can get quiet, think and write. And, hey, I'm in church too.</p><p>IMUS: Praise the lord. Praise Jesus.</p><p>Big Kenny is going to sing for us in just a little bit here.</p><p>ALPHIN: Amen.</p><p>IMUS: It's 33 after the hour.</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Time now for our business update from the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Here's Jenna Lee.</p><p>LEE: Good morning, everybody. Here's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Bank of America's list of candidates to replace CEO Ken Lewis is looking even shorter after another prospect reportedly told the bank no thanks. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says Bank of America approached Bank of New York Mellon CEO Robert Kelly. Kelly has been approached before for succeeding Ken Lewis, but is showing no interest in the job as of yet.</p><p>Bernie Madoff's auditors expected to plead guilty. Prosecutors say David Friehling reached a deal with the government and will enter his plea tomorrow.</p><p>In the meantime, in a jailhouse interview, Bernie Madoff telling the Securities and Exchange Commission he considers current SEC chair Mary Schapiro \"a dear friend,\" and that she \"... probably thinks I wish I never knew this guy.\"</p><p>Moving on to a different story here, winter came early in Beijing. The city waking up to snow on Sunday, to the earliest snowfall in 10 years.</p><p>Meteorologists seated (ph) clouds with silver iodide, forcing the snow to fall. Beijing's city offices said because it's suffering from a drought, it won't miss an opportunity for artificial precipitation.</p><p>There's a look at it. It looks like a lot of snow.</p><p>Quick earnings news for you. Clorox saying H1N1, the flu, actually helping out sales. They had a big beat here. Adjusted earnings, $1.18, versus the expectation of 95 cents. Revenue right in line with expectations, $1.37 billion.</p><p>That's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>If you're on the move this morning or at a computer, check us out for all the latest business headlines -- FoxBusiness.com/livemorningedition, streaming on your iPhone and online.</p><p>Here's a quick look at the futures. We have more IMUS IN THE MORNING coming up.</p><p>MCCORD: The House plan includes a government-run public run option and is expected to cost less than $900 billion over 10 years. House Republican Mike Pence of Indiana, though, fears it goes way too far and calls it, in fact, a freight train.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, at some point, don't you have to say to grandma, look, that's enough?</p><p>MCCORD: No. What are you talking about?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, maybe, but coming from the government is a little...</p><p>MCCORD: Why would you say that to grandma under any circumstances?</p><p>IMUS: Well, grandma is sitting there with the food falling out of her mouth, staring at the TV, and the TV is not on.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: I mean...</p><p>MCCORD: That's just great.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I'm just saying.</p><p>MCCORD: So you slip over behind grandma...</p><p>MCGUIRK: Be careful what you wish for.</p><p>IMUS: You can tell he's a sweet guy.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, he's a lovely man.</p><p>IMUS: He just looks at me and he says, \"Why do you hate everybody?\" I said no, it's a joke. We don't hate everybody, we just hate you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: No, we don't hate anybody. Well, we hate -- do we hate -- no, we don't hate anybody. We just don't love everybody.</p><p>All right. Well, an album you can plant, that's reason enough to buy it, \"The Quiet Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy.\"</p><p>Once again, please welcome Big Kenny.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Oh, man, that's a great song. That's a great song.</p><p>Big Kenny, he'll be back with one more.</p><p>It's 17 until the hour.</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Time now for a business update from the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Here's Connell McShane.</p><p>MCSHANE: Hi. Good morning to you.</p><p>And coming up just moments from now on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" I will be in for Alexis, and I'll be joined by a couple of former senators -- Bob Graham and Jim Talent. They're on different sides of the aisle, but both men agree that investing in vaccines is important to the nation's security. We're talking H1N1.</p><p>We'll find out why on \"THE OPENING BELL.\"</p><p>All right. Let's get to your \"Fox Business Minute\" now, with AIG dropping its plans to sell some Japanese units.</p><p>According to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" AIG is going to keep two of the three life insurance units initially it had tried to sell. Now, this fits with the plan set forward by the CEO, Robert Benmosche, when he took over back in August. AIG, by the way, still owes the government some $85 billion.</p><p>The liquidation of Lehman Brothers continues with a sale of more than $1 million worth of art. The 283 lots brought in a total of $1.35 million, nearly twice the expectations. Now, the artwork once hung on the walls of Lehman's corporate offices here in New York, and the money hardly puts a dent on the $250 billion that Lehman still owes its creditors.</p><p>Now, the big news this morning from Ford, For Motor Company reporting third quarter earnings results that blew past analysts' estimates. They reported a profit of 26 cents a share, $30.9 billion in revenue, when they were expected to have lost money.</p><p>Ford says its turnaround plan is on track for the time frame they've targeted. You see the stock. It's higher in pre-market trading.</p><p>That is your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Speaking of higher, let's take a look at the futures this morning. They are also pointing to the possibility of a higher open on Wall Street.</p><p>We'll be covering it all on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" which is coming up at the top of the hour. I will be in for Alexis on that.</p><p>More IMUS IN THE MORNING right now on Fox Business.</p><p>IMUS: Eleven minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all the country and on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>I just got an e-mail from the ayatollah, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: What's this one? God Almighty.</p><p>IMUS: Well, that would be Mrs. Imus.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, boy. What does she want?</p><p>IMUS: She says, regarding Big Kenny, \"What a great guy he is. His glasses look like yours.\"</p><p>OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: \"We should be planting every CD cover. When we buy plastic CD covers,\" according to my wife, who is to the right of Sean Hannity, she says, \"the terrorists win.\"</p><p>Well, all right.</p><p>Neil Cavuto will have the fat boy on tonight, our guy, <person><nameText>Chris Christie. </nameText></person>And -- now I'm not sure they will be in the same studio. I'm not sure that that's possible, actually.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCGUIRK: That ain't right.</p><p>IMUS: They'll be a two-shot, those two boys.</p><p>MCGUIRK: You got your wide screen.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>Coming up next hour, Matt Taibbi from \"Rolling Stone.\"</p><p>Tomorrow, Mike Lupica. His new book, \"Million-Dollar Throw,\" Wyatt Imus read and loved. And, of course, Lupica has written four or five of them, \"The New York Times\" number one bestsellers.</p><p>And then on Wednesday, Jeff Greenfield from CBS and Monica Crowley from way out there where the buses don't run. So that kind of situation.</p><p>All right, time for one more here. You all please welcome once again, singing something from -- that last song, that was a great song. This is from -- oh, how about this one, Imus? Maybe this would be great, too -- \"The Quite Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy,\" Big Kenny.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Big Kenny.</p><p>ALPHIN: Thank you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IMUS: Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program from Fox News, actually, and his own syndicated national radio program that is doing splendid, our old friend Alan Colmes.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Colmes.</p><p>ALAN COLMES, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Hello, Mr. Imus.</p><p>IMUS: Well, how about all the stuff President Obama promised he was going to do and he's done none of it? None of it.</p><p>COLMES: The guy's been in office a few minutes.</p><p>IMUS: None of it. He's been in office almost a year. He has done nof it.</p><p>COLMES: OK. That justifies Lieberman.</p><p>IMUS: He has done none of it.</p><p>COLMES: He's getting out of Iraq in 22 months.</p><p>IMUS: He was the agent of change. He's not going to get out of Iraq in anything.</p><p>COLMES: Sure he is.</p><p>IMUS: How about \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell?\" How about Guantanamo?</p><p>COLMES: I'd like to see him move faster on some things. He inherited a nightmare from the previous administration.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, well, you can't spend the rest of your life blaming that incompetent buffoon who was the president before this guy.</p><p>COLMES: You've got to sweep up the mess that was left.</p><p>IMUS: Well, yes, but grab a mop and get busy then, as he said.</p><p>COLMES: What do you think he's doing? He was just praised for going to Dover Air Force Base. That's change you can believe.</p><p>IMUS: That's one thing he did that was good.</p><p>MCCORD: Symbolic.</p><p>IMUS: I like the guy, by the way. I mean, Sean Hannity, it makes him insane when I say that, but I do like him. But I don't think he has any idea what he's doing, and he's more interested in being president...</p><p>COLMES: Oh, that's just ridiculous.</p><p>IMUS: ... spending five hours playing golf with that dope Tom Friedman.</p><p>COLMES: I'm with O'Reilly on this one. The guy's not allowed to have a golf game?</p><p>IMUS: No, not to...</p><p>COLMES: The guy can't go enjoy himself for a few hours?</p><p>IMUS: No, no, not to -- no, come on. Do you have five hours to go play -- you probably do, but I don't have five hours to go do anything.</p><p>COLMES: Wait a minute. So, when George W. Bush said, \"I'm playing through\" after he was talking about the tragedy of 9/11, that was OK, right?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I didn't say it was OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: I didn't vote for him. I didn't vote for him either time. What are you talking about?</p><p>COLMES: Well, I'm just pointing out to your audience the hypocrisy there.</p><p>IMUS: Pardon me?</p><p>COLMES: I'm pointing out the hypocrisy in the situation.</p><p>IMUS: Well, it's completely lost on me, and now you've irritated me. So...</p><p>COLMES: Oh, I'm really sorry.</p><p>IMUS: No you're not. You don't care at all.</p><p>COLMES: I don't know how I can make it up to you.</p><p>IMUS: You don't care about me.</p><p>COLMES: Yes, I do.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IMUS: Tonight at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Fox Business Network, Neil Cavuto will interview our new favorite fat boy, New Jersey gubernatorial candidate <person><nameText>Chris Christie.</nameText></person></p><p>And speaking of -- well, not fat boys, but Cavuto -- but then we could make a case for -- well, whatever.

Also, business and individual users can earn rewards for participating in the data economy and decentralized app marketplace. The CEOMax Tkachenko will be telling us more about the iTrue project in this interview. 1) Please tell us your name and about yourself?</p><p> I'm Max Tkachenko. I was born in Russia, although I have been living in Miami, Flordia, in the US, for the last 15 years. I studied at Broward College in FL, and Computer Science at Harvard. After graduating, I opened my own business in the Cyber Forensics sector. I still have my own business involving in Cyber Forensics and Investigations, which services global clients. In my experience in developing security applications for clients in the financial sector and digital payment industries, I saw the need to detect and prevent fraud by use of biometric identities, which led me and my team to start iTrue. Prior to iTrue, I founded Genico, a digital security, AI and blockchain development company offering services to enterprises around the world. I have worked with over 280 projects with $107 million in total market capitalization. 2) What is iTrue and what services are you providing to the blockchain market? iTrue is a Blockchain based solution focused on giving users control of their own data back from big technology firms. On the front end, we secure access to the system with facial recognition software, which means your face (we call it 'Face Pass') is the key to your data. On the back end, all data is stored in a state-of-the-art Stone Storage solution, which is a combination of blockchain and distributed database technology. In addition, we offer an incentive system for users on our platform. Business and individual users can earn rewards for participating in the data economy and decentralized app marketplace. iTrue is therefore an innovative platform for storage and biometric identity for the decentralized web. It's not just a blockchain but a merge of blockchain and database. Although blockchain is immutable and data cannot be altered, our unique storage technology actually allows users to delete data upon request - which makes it compliant with GDPR and other existing data privacy rules. And nobody can read that deleted data as it is encrypted. Moreover, the iTrue system actually destroys the link to such deleted data. What remains is the record of deletion itself which is stored on our blockchain-based Stone Storage solution. [embedded content] 3)How does the ITrue ecosystem work and what is the technology behind the project? At the core of iTrue's platform is blockchain, which is the optimal way of storing data online in the future. We are tackling data security issues head on with our state-of-the-art Stone Storage solution, a distributed database that enables users to store information without the need for a centralized server, as it's based off of blockchain distributed ledger principles. With our Stone Storage solution, personal information is stored separately from its record of transaction and can be divided into different levels and categories. This allows users to decide which information to share with which party, putting users in complete control over sensitive information. We are taking data security to the next level by securing information using biometric technology. This means users must successfully verify their identity by scanning their face, eye iris, or other facial feature in order to access their stored data. The iTrue token economy primarily consists of a marketplace for data and a marketplace for decentralized applications. We have 2 models of data monetization: contact data (to get new clients) and UX data (for research purpose and insights how users interact with a product).In the contact data marketplace, participants can benefit as follows: Contractors, or entiites that collect and process data, can earn tokens or get new user data they don't have when they insert user data they have into the platform; Clients, or businesses that require user data, can acquire data by paying in tokens; Users earn token rewards when they share their personal contact data with contractors or clients.It should be noted that all requests for user data will require user approval, and they can also remove their personal data from the system, making iTrue fully compliant with privacy regulations like the GDPR.In the US data marketplace, participants can benefit this way: Clients, developers, or businesses that need testing of their existing or new application or system, can acquire anonymous UX data reports, which will include mimic reactions, eyes movement, fingers interaction with mouse and touch screen during testing of a product, by paying in tokens; Users earn token rewards when they participate in testing and share their UX data in anonymous view with clients.Meanwhile, in the decentralized app marketplace, participants can benefit as follows:Developers can build apps that take advantage of the existing modules (i.e., ID verification, Biometric recognition, Personal information, etc.). They can earn tokens when users or businesses use their turnkey solutions or require customized applications. Devs can also build and share their own modules; Enterprises can utilize either turnkey solutions or request their own customized applications; Individual users can either use tokens to pay for access to unique paid apps and get rewards when they use paid or free apps.4)What is the demand and market size of Blockchain-as-a-Service solutions and what unique benefit is iTrue bringing to this market? iTrue wants to bring together Blockchain technology and Biometric Identity standards in order to get rid of online fraud. Both industries are growth markets on their own, and we believe addressing both BaaS and Biometrics will enable us to make these technologies more accessible to both enterprises and users. The market for BaaS is estimated at US$ 623 million this year, which is set to grow to US$ 15.455 billion in five years. Demand for such services is distributed across industries, but the biggest demand will come from the banking, finance, and insurance industries. In terms of biometrics, smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung have popularized their own versions of biometric authentication, such as fingerprint and face ID. While this pertains to the mass appeal of such technologies, there is a bigger potential, which is in commercial and enterprise usage. In terms of enterprise use, biometrics go beyond fingerprints. The global market for face ID was US$ 3.36 billion in 2016, and it will grow to US$6.84 billion by 2021. By 2022, it will shoot up to US$32.73 billion, according to Markets and Markets. It goes without saying that financial services will benefit greatly from the ability to make secure identification, authentication, and transactions through biometrics. Agricultural Bank of China is promoting withdrawals by facial recognition scans nationwide. Additionally, China Construction Bank has also announced commercial facial scan payments. Moreover, Shenzhen Metro, Tencent and GRG Banking jointly released a new solution which officially marked a new era of facial recognition - it will enable seamless and secure access to transport, communications, and frictionlness payments all through biometrics. Given that the growth in demand for BaaS will be supported by industries that relate to finance and fintech, it is only fitting that we also focus on the digital identity and security aspect. iTrue will make access to such financial and other services more convenient and secure through facial recognition. 5)Do you have any Competitors or similar use cases you will like to share with us? We can point out two main fields that we want to disrupt: BaaS and identity verification. In terms of BaaS, we can perhaps count blockchains that allow development of dApps as competitors, including NEO. Our main differentiator is that we have modular architecture, so we can add any new verified module. We can also support smart contracts written on any programming language, unlimited data capacity, and a robust search capability unmatched by any blockchain solution today. In terms of identity systems, there are a handful of blockchain platforms that have also launched with their own ID verification services, such as Civic and Verime. Here, again, we can highlight our integrated privacy controls, dApp development, and face verification as our main differentiators. 6) Please tell us more about the iTrue Token and token sale Conditions? We are currently on our private sale round. We accept investments from US$25,000 up, and we give 25% bonus during this round. 7) Do you have any major Partners or investors you will like to share with us, or any new opportunities for partners? Events and trade shows are one of the biggest use-cases of iTrue, and we are glad to have partnered with Trade Center Europa, one of the biggest chain of shopping and entertainment centers in Russia. We have partnered with Bancor Network, a decentralized liquidity network based in Zug, Switzerland which completed a historic Token Generation Event in June 2017. We're in negotiations with other e-commerce and offline business companies to launch pilot projects with help of our technologies. 8) On what stage of development is the ITrue platform, what is next on your Roadmap? We have developed our identity verification system, initially using facial recognition in user identification and verification. In terms of the technology, we have also accomplished our hybrid data storage solution, which is a combination of blockchain and database, thus ensuring ability to even run a search engine across the decentralized storage. We are currently working on an API to connect our platform and modules with third-party solutions. 9) Who are the experts behind this project, please tell us about your team and customer support? Our core team has had decades of experience in building secure and encrypted solutions for financial applications. In terms of blockchain and computer vision development, we have several experts on-board: Anton Gorozhankin, our CTO, has 15+ years experience in software architecture and product development, with expertise in payment gateways, billing systems, custom enterprise applications, and blockchain integration. Abhishek Gangwar is our Chief Computer Vision Engineer. With a decade experience in biometrics and computer vision technology, he has been associated with Aadhaar project and worked as a researcher in Computer Vision and Machine Learning domain at India's Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), which has around 15 branches all over India with more than 2,500 employees. Maxim Ankinin is our senior software developer. He has 10+ years experience in programming, creating solutions for variouscompanies from small utilities to big business systems, modelling for computer vision and other scientists' problem. He has worked with C/C++, Python 2/3 and various libraries (for example, OpenCV, ROOT, Boost, Qt 3/4/5 and others). He has experience with Linux (including low-level programming - writing Linux kernel modules), embedded systems (forexample, MIPS 64) and GPGPU solutions. A published technology author, Maxim has a PhD degree in computer vision (satellite imagery), artificial intelligence and machine learning. 10) How Safe is iTrue, would you like to talk about your legal and security measures? iTrue values user privacy, and thus we have built the platform with GDPR compliance at the outset. In terms of data storage, iTrue's Stone Storage solution utilizes a mix of blockchain transaction recording, along with encrypted database storage, to ensure a balance of security and performance. Encrypted personal data is stored in a decentralized network with controlled access. The system gets biometric data and additional metadata related to an operation in order to generate a crypto key. The data gets encoded by the generated public key, and finally it is transferred through protected interfaces. Confidential user data is never stored on personal devices for safety reasons, since personal devices are most likely to get hacked with the use of social engineering. 11) Do you have more information for our readers?

Also, business and individual users can earn rewards for participating in the data economy and decentralized app marketplace. The CEOMax Tkachenko will be telling us more about the iTrue project in this interview. 1) Please tell us your name and about yourself?</p><p> I'm Max Tkachenko. I was born in Russia, although I have been living in Miami, Flordia, in the US, for the last 15 years. I studied at Broward College in FL, and Computer Science at Harvard. After graduating, I opened my own business in the Cyber Forensics sector. I still have my own business involving in Cyber Forensics and Investigations, which services global clients. In my experience in developing security applications for clients in the financial sector and digital payment industries, I saw the need to detect and prevent fraud by use of biometric identities, which led me and my team to start iTrue. Prior to iTrue, I founded Genico, a digital security, AI and blockchain development company offering services to enterprises around the world. I have worked with over 280 projects with $107 million in total market capitalization. 2) What is iTrue and what services are you providing to the blockchain market? iTrue is a Blockchain based solution focused on giving users control of their own data back from big technology firms. On the front end, we secure access to the system with facial recognition software, which means your face (we call it 'Face Pass') is the key to your data. On the back end, all data is stored in a state-of-the-art Stone Storage solution, which is a combination of blockchain and distributed database technology. In addition, we offer an incentive system for users on our platform. Business and individual users can earn rewards for participating in the data economy and decentralized app marketplace. iTrue is therefore an innovative platform for storage and biometric identity for the decentralized web. It's not just a blockchain but a merge of blockchain and database. Although blockchain is immutable and data cannot be altered, our unique storage technology actually allows users to delete data upon request - which makes it compliant with GDPR and other existing data privacy rules. And nobody can read that deleted data as it is encrypted. Moreover, the iTrue system actually destroys the link to such deleted data. What remains is the record of deletion itself which is stored on our blockchain-based Stone Storage solution. [embedded content] 3)How does the ITrue ecosystem work and what is the technology behind the project? At the core of iTrue's platform is blockchain, which is the optimal way of storing data online in the future. We are tackling data security issues head on with our state-of-the-art Stone Storage solution, a distributed database that enables users to store information without the need for a centralized server, as it's based off of blockchain distributed ledger principles. With our Stone Storage solution, personal information is stored separately from its record of transaction and can be divided into different levels and categories. This allows users to decide which information to share with which party, putting users in complete control over sensitive information. We are taking data security to the next level by securing information using biometric technology. This means users must successfully verify their identity by scanning their face, eye iris, or other facial feature in order to access their stored data. The iTrue token economy primarily consists of a marketplace for data and a marketplace for decentralized applications. We have 2 models of data monetization: contact data (to get new clients) and UX data (for research purpose and insights how users interact with a product).In the contact data marketplace, participants can benefit as follows: Contractors, or entiites that collect and process data, can earn tokens or get new user data they don't have when they insert user data they have into the platform; Clients, or businesses that require user data, can acquire data by paying in tokens; Users earn token rewards when they share their personal contact data with contractors or clients.It should be noted that all requests for user data will require user approval, and they can also remove their personal data from the system, making iTrue fully compliant with privacy regulations like the GDPR.In the US data marketplace, participants can benefit this way: Clients, developers, or businesses that need testing of their existing or new application or system, can acquire anonymous UX data reports, which will include mimic reactions, eyes movement, fingers interaction with mouse and touch screen during testing of a product, by paying in tokens; Users earn token rewards when they participate in testing and share their UX data in anonymous view with clients.Meanwhile, in the decentralized app marketplace, participants can benefit as follows:Developers can build apps that take advantage of the existing modules (i.e., ID verification, Biometric recognition, Personal information, etc.). They can earn tokens when users or businesses use their turnkey solutions or require customized applications. Devs can also build and share their own modules; Enterprises can utilize either turnkey solutions or request their own customized applications; Individual users can either use tokens to pay for access to unique paid apps and get rewards when they use paid or free apps.4)What is the demand and market size of Blockchain-as-a-Service solutions and what unique benefit is iTrue bringing to this market? iTrue wants to bring together Blockchain technology and Biometric Identity standards in order to get rid of online fraud. Both industries are growth markets on their own, and we believe addressing both BaaS and Biometrics will enable us to make these technologies more accessible to both enterprises and users. The market for BaaS is estimated at US$ 623 million this year, which is set to grow to US$ 15.455 billion in five years. Demand for such services is distributed across industries, but the biggest demand will come from the banking, finance, and insurance industries. In terms of biometrics, smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung have popularized their own versions of biometric authentication, such as fingerprint and face ID. While this pertains to the mass appeal of such technologies, there is a bigger potential, which is in commercial and enterprise usage. In terms of enterprise use, biometrics go beyond fingerprints. The global market for face ID was US$ 3.36 billion in 2016, and it will grow to US$6.84 billion by 2021. By 2022, it will shoot up to US$32.73 billion, according to Markets and Markets. It goes without saying that financial services will benefit greatly from the ability to make secure identification, authentication, and transactions through biometrics. Agricultural Bank of China is promoting withdrawals by facial recognition scans nationwide. Additionally, China Construction Bank has also announced commercial facial scan payments. Moreover, Shenzhen Metro, Tencent and GRG Banking jointly released a new solution which officially marked a new era of facial recognition - it will enable seamless and secure access to transport, communications, and frictionlness payments all through biometrics. Given that the growth in demand for BaaS will be supported by industries that relate to finance and fintech, it is only fitting that we also focus on the digital identity and security aspect. iTrue will make access to such financial and other services more convenient and secure through facial recognition. 5)Do you have any Competitors or similar use cases you will like to share with us? We can point out two main fields that we want to disrupt: BaaS and identity verification. In terms of BaaS, we can perhaps count blockchains that allow development of dApps as competitors, including NEO. Our main differentiator is that we have modular architecture, so we can add any new verified module. We can also support smart contracts written on any programming language, unlimited data capacity, and a robust search capability unmatched by any blockchain solution today. In terms of identity systems, there are a handful of blockchain platforms that have also launched with their own ID verification services, such as Civic and Verime. Here, again, we can highlight our integrated privacy controls, dApp development, and face verification as our main differentiators. 6) Please tell us more about the iTrue Token and token sale Conditions? We are currently on our private sale round. We accept investments from US$25,000 up, and we give 25% bonus during this round. 7) Do you have any major Partners or investors you will like to share with us, or any new opportunities for partners? Events and trade shows are one of the biggest use-cases of iTrue, and we are glad to have partnered with Trade Center Europa, one of the biggest chain of shopping and entertainment centers in Russia. We have partnered with Bancor Network, a decentralized liquidity network based in Zug, Switzerland which completed a historic Token Generation Event in June 2017. We're in negotiations with other e-commerce and offline business companies to launch pilot projects with help of our technologies. 8) On what stage of development is the ITrue platform, what is next on your Roadmap? We have developed our identity verification system, initially using facial recognition in user identification and verification. In terms of the technology, we have also accomplished our hybrid data storage solution, which is a combination of blockchain and database, thus ensuring ability to even run a search engine across the decentralized storage. We are currently working on an API to connect our platform and modules with third-party solutions. 9) Who are the experts behind this project, please tell us about your team and customer support? Our core team has had decades of experience in building secure and encrypted solutions for financial applications. In terms of blockchain and computer vision development, we have several experts on-board: Anton Gorozhankin, our CTO, has 15+ years experience in software architecture and product development, with expertise in payment gateways, billing systems, custom enterprise applications, and blockchain integration. Abhishek Gangwar is our Chief Computer Vision Engineer. With a decade experience in biometrics and computer vision technology, he has been associated with Aadhaar project and worked as a researcher in Computer Vision and Machine Learning domain at India's Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), which has around 15 branches all over India with more than 2,500 employees. Maxim Ankinin is our senior software developer. He has 10+ years experience in programming, creating solutions for various companies from small utilities to big business systems, modelling for computer vision and other scientists' problem. He has worked with C/C++, Python 2/3 and various libraries (for example, OpenCV, ROOT, Boost, Qt 3/4/5 and others). He has experience with Linux (including low-level programming - writing Linux kernel modules), embedded systems (for example, MIPS 64) and GPGPU solutions. A published technology author, Maxim has a PhD degree in computer vision (satellite imagery), artificial intelligence and machine learning. 10) How Safe is iTrue, would you like to talk about your legal and security measures? iTrue values user privacy, and thus we have built the platform with GDPR compliance at the outset. In terms of data storage, iTrue's Stone Storage solution utilizes a mix of blockchain transaction recording, along with encrypted database storage, to ensure a balance of security and performance. Encrypted personal data is stored in a decentralized network with controlled access. The system gets biometric data and additional metadata related to an operation in order to generate a crypto key. The data gets encoded by the generated public key, and finally it is transferred through protected interfaces. Confidential user data is never stored on personal devices for safety reasons, since personal devices are most likely to get hacked with the use of social engineering. 11) Do you have more information for our readers?

Devs can also build and share their own microservicesmodules; Enterprises can utilize either turnkey solutions or request their own customized applications; Individual users can either use tokens to pay for access to unique paid apps and get rewards when they use paid or free apps.4)What is the demand and market size of Blockchain-as-a-Service solutions and what unique benefits is iITrue bringing to this market? iTrue wants to bring together Blockchain technology and Biometric Identity standards in order to get rid of online fraud. Both industries are growth markets on their own, and we believe addressing both BaaS and Biometrics will enable us to make these technologies more accessible to both enterprises and users. The market for BaaS is estimated at US$ 623 million this year, which is set to grow to US$ 15.455 billion in five years. Demand for such services is distributed across industries, but the biggest demand will come from the banking, finance, and insurance industries. In terms of biometrics, iTrue wants to bring biometric identity standard to Blockchain market to get rid of online fraud. Meanwhile, the market for biometric authentication, which iTrue offers as its core microservice. Ssmartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung have popularized their own versions of biometric authentication, such as fingerprint and face ID. ThisWhile this pertains to the mass appeal of such technologies. , there is a bigger potential, which is in commercial and enterprise usage. In terms of enterprise use, biometrics go beyond fingerprints. The global market for face ID was US$ 3.36 billion in 2016, and it will grow to US$6.84 billion by 2021. By 2022, it will shoot up to US$32.73 billion, according to Markets and Markets. It goes without saying that financial services will benefit greatly from the ability to make secure identification, authentication, and transactions through biometrics. iTrue wants to bring biometric identity standard to Blockchain market to get rid of online fraud. Agricultural Bank of China is promoting withdrawals by facial recognition scans nationwide. Additionally, China Construction Bank has also announced commercial facial scan payments. Moreover, Shenzhen Metro, Tencent and GRG Banking jointly released a new solution which officially marked a new era of facial recognition - it will enable seamless and secure access to transport, communications, and frictionlness payments all through biometrics. Given that the growth in demand for BaaS will be supported by industries that relate to finance and fintech, it is only fitting that we also focus on the digital identity and security aspect. iTrue will make access to such financial and other services more convenient and secure through biometric authenticationfacial recognition. 5)Do you have any Competitors or similar use cases you will like to share with us? We generally prefer not to discuss competition directly, as we would like to highlight the benefits of iTrue on its own merits. However, given this opportunity, wWe can perhaps point out two main fields that we want to disrupt: BaaS and identity verification. In terms of BaaS, we can perhaps count blockchains that allow development of dApps as competitors, including NEO. Our main differentiator is that we have integrated identity, privacy control, and device-free authentication, which enables developers and users to provide/gain access more easily and securely.modular architecture, so we can add any new verified module. , wWe can also support smart contracts written on any programming language, unlimited data capacity, and a robust search capability unmatched by any blockchain solution today. In terms of identity systems, there are a handful of blockchain platforms that have also launched with their own ID verification services, such as Civic and Verime. Here, again, we can highlight our integrated privacy controls, dApp development, and gadget-free authenticationface verification as our main differentiators. I would mention things from here also <url normalizedValue=\"http://prntscr.com/ldobqa\">http://prntscr.com/ldobqa</url>[2] 6) Please tell us more about the iITrue Token and token sale Conditions? We are currently on our private sale round. We accept investments from US$25,000 up, and we give 25% bonus during this round. 7) Do you have any major Partners or investors you will like to share with us, or any new opportunities for partners? Events and trade shows are one of the biggest use-cases of iTrue, and we are glad to have partnered with Trade Center Europa, one of the biggest chain of shopping and entertainment centers in Russia. We have partnered with Bancor Network, a decentralized liquidity network based in Zug, Switzerland which completed a historic Token Generation Event in June 2017. We're in negotiations with other e-commerce and offline business companies to launch pilot projects with help of our technologies. 8) On what stage of development is the ITrue platform, what is next on your Roadmap? We have developed our identity verification system, initially using facial recognition in user identification and verificationauthentication. In terms of the technology, we have also accomplished our hybrid data storage solution, which is a combination of blockchain and database, thus ensuring ability to even run a search engine across the decentralized storage. We are currently working on an API to connect our platform and modules with third-party solutions. 9) Who are the experts behind this project, please tell us about your team and customer support? Our core team has had decades of experience in building secure and encrypted solutions for financial applications. In terms of blockchain and computer vision development, we have several experts on-board: Anton Gorozhankin, our CTO, has 15+ years experience in software architecture and product development, with expertise in payment gateways, billing systems, custom enterprise applications, and blockchain integration. Abhishek Gangwar is our Chief Computer Vision Engineer. With a decade experience in biometrics and computer vision technology, he has been associated with Aadhaar project and worked as a researcher in Computer Vision and Machine Learning domain at India's Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), which has around 15 branches all over India with more than 2,500 employees. Maxim Ankinin is our senior software developer. He has 10+ years experience in programming, creating solutions for various companies from small utilities to big business systems, modelling for computer vision and other scientists' problem. He has worked with C/C++, Python 2/3 and various libraries (for example, OpenCV, ROOT, Boost, Qt 3/4/5 and others). He has experience with Linux (including low-level programming - writing Linux kernel modules), embedded systems (for example, MIPS 64) and GPGPU solutions. A published technology author, Maxim has a PhD degree in computer vision (satellite imagery), artificial intelligence and machine learning. 10) How Safe is iTrue, would you like to talk about your legal and security measures? iTrue values user privacy, and thus we have built the platform with GDPR compliance at the outset. In terms of data storage, iTrue's Stone Storage solution utilizes a mix of blockchain transaction recording, along with encrypted database storage, to ensure a balance of security and performance. Encrypted personal data is stored in a decentralized network with controlled access. The system gets biometric data and additional metadata related to an operation in order to generate a crypto key. The data gets encoded by the generated symmetrical key, then by an openpublic key, and finally it is transferred through protected interfaces. Confidential user data is never stored on personal devices for safety reasons, since personal devices are most likely to get hacked with the use of social engineering. 11) Do you have more information for our readers?

Live from CNN London, I'm Hala Gorani.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight,</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, FOREIGN MINISTER OF IRAN: Anybody who starts with Iran, will not be the one who ends it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GORANI: The Iranian foreign minister's strong words. That CNN interview and full analysis, straight ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then, President Trump digs in and tweets on. Now, we've just heard from the top House Democrat as her party calls for a vote on impeachment.</p><p>Plus, would you insert a microchip into your brain? We'll tell you about Elon Musk's dream of a future where humans merged with artificial intelligence. That will be interesting.</p><p>A rescue operation or an act of war? Iran and the U.S. have very different takes on exactly what happened to an oil tanker missing in the Persian Gulf. Tehran says the Panamanian flagged tanker sent out a distress call and Iran answered. The U.S. thinks Iran may have seized the ship as a way of destabilizing shipping lanes in the gulf.</p><p>A short time ago, CNN sat down with Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to get his reaction to the escalating tensions in the gulf. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST, FAREED ZAKARIA GPS: Foreign Minister, what can you tell us about this Panamanian flagged tanker that appears to have been escorted to a port in Iran by the Iranian navy?</p><p>ZARIF: Well, I haven't had any briefing about that. What I've heard in the news, is that it required assistance. And it's being assisted. But I haven't seen any private briefing about that.</p><p>ZAKARIA: You know, a lot of people think that the Iranian government is trying to raise tensions in the Persian Gulf by interdicting tankers, by, in a sense, signaling that it could, in various ways, block the flow of oil from the Straits of Hormuz.</p><p>ZARIF: Well, you see, we are in the Persian Gulf. We have 1,500 miles of coastline with the Persian Gulf. I mean, we control the Strait of Hormuz. It is -- I mean, these waters are our lifeline. So their security is of paramount importance for Iran.</p><p>But throughout history, Iran has provided security in these waters. The United States is intervening in order to make these waters insecure for Iran. You cannot make these waters insecure for one country and secure for others.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Do you believe that as a result of this, whoever is to blame, you could have an escalation which would result in a military incident?</p><p>ZARIF: Well, in such a small body of water, if you have so many foreign vessels, you -- I mean, accidents will happen. You remember 1988, when a U.S. warship in these waters shot down an Iranian civil airliner, killing 290 passengers. So accidents, even catastrophes, can happen under these circumstances.</p><p>ZAKARIA: Do you think that with tensions being as high as they are, there is a possibility of war?</p><p>ZARIF: Well, you cannot simply disregard a possibility of a disaster. But we all need to work in order to avoid one. There is a war going on right now. It's an economic war. An economic war against Iran targets civilian population. And President Trump is on the record saying that he is not engaged in military war, but in an economic war.</p><p>Economic war is nothing to be proud of because in a military confrontation, civilians may become collateral damage. Whereas in an economic war, civilians are the primary targets.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI: Let's talk about the foreign minister's comments with CNN Pentagon Correspondent, Barbara Starr and our Global Affairs Analyst, David Rohde.</p><p>David, is Iran ready to talk? They've been sending some signals in various interviews that some things are off the table, implying that other things might be on the table. Is there a window here, do you think?</p><p>DAVID ROHDE, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: I think the only window is if there is some reduction in the economic sanctions. They're under pressure domestically to somehow ease the crippling impact of these sanctions, so I don't see them entering talks without getting some sort of sanctions relief.</p><p>GORANI: And, Barbara, we also heard the foreign minister say some things, the statement was quite bellicose. Let's listen again to what he said about what would happen in that part of the world if the U.S. decided to start a war.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[14:05:14] ZARIF: I can tell you that we will never start a war. We've never started a war, we will never start a war. But we will defend ourselves. And anybody who starts a war with Iran will not be the one who ends it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: How is this being interpreted at the Pentagon?</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Hala, I think the first thing to say is on that mystery tanker, if you will. The Pentagon has come to no conclusions about what may have happened to it. They're continuing to look at the intelligence.</p><p>On the question of not starting a war with Iran, this may be the one area where publicly at least, the president and the foreign minister are in agreement. As Mr. Zarif said, the president is on the record that he's not looking for war with Iran, and the Pentagon has said the same thing.</p><p>That said, they both -- you know, the U.S. and Iran both say they have the right of self-defense. So while everybody's trying to stay very calm about this and the U.S. is putting force into the region for deterrence against aggression, I think the bottom line is there's still plenty of concern about that very fact. Both sides could miscalculate, there could be a disaster but nobody wants that to happen of course.</p><p>GORANI: Of course. And from Iran's perspective, David, of course, it's the U.S. that walked away from this deal. The Europeans believed it was working. They're still trying to salvage it. Can it survive?</p><p>ROHDE: It does not look good at this point. And what's new and interesting is that the Iranians are really pushing Europe. They're furious at Britain for seizing this Iranian tanker, you know, recently.</p><p>And I think, you know, they may have seized this tanker -- the one that's missing that they said they are, you know assisting, but that might be sort of retaliatory for Britain's seizure of the tanker.</p><p>TEXT: Iran and Its Proxies Lashing Out in the Past Month: Iran shoots down U.S. drone; Iran-backed Houthis fire missile at airport in Saudi Arabia; Iran's military believed to be behind attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman; Iran breaches limits on uranium enrichment</p><p>ROHDE: And so you could have, you know, the next British prime minister, whether it's Jeremy Hunt or Boris Johnson, facing this, these growing tensions. And I see the Iranians pushing Europe. They've been demanding more economic aid to help ease the sanctions. And that hasn't happened. So Iran will keep pushing --</p><p>GORANI: Well, they have few -- but they have few, David, as you know, options, the Europeans. I mean, they're trying this kind of parallel payment system. But I mean, big European companies won't do business with Iran if they fear U.S. sanctions, right?</p><p>ROHDE: That's true. And then, you know, Boris Johnson's come out and said he would not back a U.S. war against Iran. He'd have to stand by those words if there was some sort of conflict that erupted.</p><p>GORANI: So, Barbara, where are we going here when it comes to the U.S. and Iran? Is there a real chance of -- I know both sides are saying they don't want war. But both sides are escalating.</p><p>STARR: Well, are they? You know, that's, I think, a real question to be looked at. The U.S. is continuing to put some deterrence force in there, claiming the right of self-defense, of course, for American interests in the region. They are trying to get a maritime coalition together so other countries who have oil shipments going through that area will take some responsibility for escorting their own ships. But very much, trying to stay in that defensive deterrent posture.</p><p>Iran, I think, this latest tanker mystery will tell us a lot when it gets resolved. Were they really trying to help a tanker that was broken down at sea? Or was there something else going on here? Are they still really trying to engage in provocation?</p><p>GORANI: Well, we'll learn soon enough. We know their transponder or their signaling systems on board were disabled. Thanks very much, David Rohde, Barbara Starr, for joining us on this.</p><p>And you can catch Fareed Zakaria's full interview with Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, this Sunday on \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS,\" 3:00 p.m. London time and 10:00 p.m. in Hong Kong.</p><p>For the first time in more than 100 years, the U.S. House of Representatives has rebuked a sitting president. But the controversy over Donald Trump's racist tweets is not over yet because a Democratic lawmaker is now pushing for a vote on a proposal to impeach President Trump. It's not a given, of course, that such a vote will ever happen.</p><p>Our Manu Raju questioned House speaker and top Democrat Nancy Pelosi a short time ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We have six committees that are working on following the facts in terms of any abuse of power, obstruction of justice and the rest that the president may have engaged in. That is the serious path that we are on, not that Mr. Green is not serious. But we'll deal with that on the floor.</p><p>MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Will you vote to table it? Will you vote to table it?</p><p>PELOSI: I don't know what we will do. But we will deal with it on the floor.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Let's get the very latest now. Manu Raju is with us. He's live on Capitol Hill. And we're also joined by White House reporter Stephen Collinson.</p><p>And, Manu, there really doesn't seem to be appetite, as far as Nancy Pelosi is concerned, appetite for pursuing this impeachment path even if more junior members of the Democratic Party on Capitol Hill are in favor of it.</p><p>[14:10:06] RAJU: Absolutely. And in fact, this resolution, put forward by Congressman Al Green, is putting Democrats in a bit of a difficult spot, including Democrats who support opening up formal impeachment proceedings, because of the way that Al Green is doing this, the way that he has structured this resolution is an articles of impeachment saying that the president should be removed from office because of racism.</p><p>This has nothing to do with the Mueller report, the findings of potential obstruction of justice, nothing like that, as what a number of lawmakers want to begin impeachment proceedings over. Instead, it has exclusively to do with this notion that the president, according to Al Green, is a, quote, \"bigot.\" That is not how Democrats want to pursue this.</p><p>But because of the way that this is structured in the U.S. House, he can essentially force a vote on the House floor, making Democrats take that -- take a position about whether to impeach the president. And what you heard from Pelosi, she does not want to go this route.</p><p>The ultimate question is, how many Democrats vote against this. Republicans are expected to also vote against it later tonight. So that could disappoint some Democrat supporters who want their party to take a much firmer stand against this president. But at the moment, the tactics, there's been a tactical debate within the Democratic Party --</p><p>GORANI: Well, but --</p><p>RAJU: -- for months, going to play out on the floor in just a matter of hours, here, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: -- why is Nancy Pelosi and other top Democratic leaders in the House opposed to pursuing impeachment proceedings at this point? Why?</p><p>RAJU: She believes that it essentially would be a fruitless endeavor that would consume the House and then it would not succeed in the United States Senate, which is run by Republicans.</p><p>The way that it works in the U.S. is that you have to impeach the president in the U.S. House run by Democrats, and the Senate, now run by Republicans, two-thirds majority would have to remove him from office.</p><p>And she (ph) believes (ph) that will just simply not succeed and there's no point in going that route. Instead, she believes investigate. And she says, then litigate, and then do oversight over this -- over what the demands for information from this White House.</p><p>So that's the strategy she's pursuing, which is why she's tamping down calls for impeachment even though, as you noted, Hala, a number of Democrats are increasing their calls for at least beginning the formal process of an impeachment inquiry. We'll see if the speaker ultimately changes her mind.</p><p>GORANI: And, Stephen Collinson, the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll shows that support among Republicans for the U.S. president, Donald Trump, has actually gone up since those racist tweets, by five percentage points, to 72 percent. Could you explain why?</p><p>STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, the president has a stronghold on the Republican Party, you know? He's dominated the party. The party is now no longer the party of Lincoln, as it used to be. It's the party of Trump. And that's the reason.</p><p>This is one piece of evidence that suggests that this clash, which you might think would be a disaster for any other president, to be accused of being a racist is actually a political victory in the very narrow terms that Donald Trump sets for this. He has no, you know, worried about his reputation. He pursues politics at the lowest possible point, down in the gutter. He drags people down with him.</p><p>And there are a lot of Republicans and conservatives who see this not from the perspective of the president sending out a racist tweet, but of an overreaction by what they see as a far-left Democratic Party that is always seeking to portray itself as a victim, and is always pursuing identity politics.</p><p>So you can see --</p><p>GORANI: Yes.</p><p>COLLINSON: -- whereas most people in the United States and in the rest of the world see this as a very pejorative moment for the president, for his supporters and for many conservatives, it's exactly --</p><p>GORANI: Yes.</p><p>COLLINSON: -- the opposite.</p><p>GORANI: Also, Manu, far-left in Europe means something completely different than far-left in the United States. Oftentimes, Republicans will call something far-left that is pretty centrist in this part of the world.</p><p>But I do wonder, I can understand why Republicans who might be concerned about, you know, tough primary battles, don't want to openly criticize the president for some of these tweets. Privately, are you hearing different stories from some members of Congress?</p><p>RAJU: Well, certainly, they are -- don't want him to say these things because they believe that it completely undercuts their agenda, what they're trying to sell to the American people. And as a -- and wanting to keep a focus on what they believe are Democratic policies that they believe that a lot of voters do not like.</p><p>TEXT: Sided With Democrats on Resolution Condemning Trump: Texas Rep. Will Hurd, swing district; Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, swing district; Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, swing district; Indiana Rep. Susan Brooks, retiring from Congress; Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, just left GOP</p><p>RAJU: But every time the president does something like this, they are put in a difficult position because they don't want to be seen as criticizing the president for the reasons that Stephen mentioned.</p><p>[14:15:00] But also, they also don't want to -- they also realize that some of these things that the president said are not -- they can't defend. So they are put in this awkward spot. We asked them about it, they sized up the question. It distracts from what they're trying to say.</p><p>And they're -- that's why you hear Republicans say they wish the president would stop tweeting. But of course, the president is not going to do that. And he will continue to say things and put them in an awkward spot. Even if the president believes it may help him politically, a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill believe it does not.</p><p>GORANI: And lastly, Stephen, as far as 2020 is concerned, is the president trying to, as you mentioned, portray the Democratic Party as this radical far-left party represented by the members of the so-called Squad, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others? That's the strategy? Is that what we're going to see more of, going forward?</p><p>COLLINSON: Yes. And I think we're going to see it in a few hours when the president holds his latest re-election rally.</p><p>GORANI: Yes.</p><p>COLLINSON: President Trump is pursuing quite --</p><p>GORANI: Because it's working with the base, we've seen that? It's working with the base?</p><p>COLLINSON: Right. So President Trump is pursuing what is clearly a strategy of racial resentment in his re-election campaign, much as he did on the issue of immigration during the 2016 campaign.</p><p>We all -- we've talked about -- often about this, how he sees politics as an approach by which you get support from your base, you solidify that support, you get them to turn out in massive numbers.</p><p>The question, going into 2020, is will it work as well as it did in 2016. The evidence from some of the midterm election results in 2018 is that the president's scorched-earth immigration rhetoric did turn away some moderate voters, moderate Republicans, independents who he needs to come back to him in order to win a very narrow victory in 2020.</p><p>And, of course, Hillary Clinton, his opponent in 2016, was a very unpopular and controversial figure herself. If the Democrats manage to nominate somebody that doesn't have that handicap, a lot of people think that the way that the president is pursuing his re-election campaign could ultimately end up in defeat.</p><p>But a lot depends on whether he can demonize that Democratic candidate and define them as being from the same radical left wing stream of thought that he sees these four congresswomen, you know, exemplifying.</p><p>GORANI: Manu Raju, thanks so much.</p><p>Stephen Collinson, thanks for joining us.</p><p>Still to come tonight, an interesting perspective on American immigration. A pro football player is donating thousands of dollars to help families at an immigrant detention center in Texas. I'll talk to him, ahead.</p><p>Also ahead, Europe takes action on big tech, launching a major anti-trust probe into Amazon. How will that change the way you shop online? We'll discuss, next.</p><p>[14:20:04] GORANI: So we all use these websites. The reach of big tech companies like Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon is increasingly coming under scrutiny for that reason.</p><p>Governments and consumers are becoming more aware of the way in which they permeate all of our daily lives. More and more, we're forced to ask ourselves, \"Do they have too much power? Do they know too much about us?\" At the heart of this are concerns over privacy, concerns over competition and control.</p><p>And now, it seems that the European Union is taking action. It's launching a major antitrust probe into Amazon in particular. We pretty much, pretty sure that most of you have shopped on Amazon.</p><p>They'll investigate whether the retail giant is abusing its dominant position by using third-party sellers' data unfairly. At issue is the buy box on Amazon's website. And there, you see it when you search for something. It's a massive boon to any seller that has it. Amazon, and how it decides which sellers get the box, is unclear. And remember, Amazon not only hosts a marketplace, but it's a seller as well.</p><p>Let's get more on this. Hadas Gold is here.</p><p>So talk -- what has regulators concerned? What is the -- for anybody who hasn't shopped on Amazon? What is this buy box? It pops up when you search for something and it suggests something for you to buy?</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN REPORTER: The buy box is one of sort of two main issues that the European Union competition regulator is looking into. Now, the buy box is something special that on other products, you and I have to click through to the product page in order to put it into your cart. But this buy box allows you straight from search to say, \"Oh, I want that one.\" And having that button could obviously increase sales.</p><p>But the main thing that the E.U. is looking into is actually the fact that Amazon is both a marketplace where third-party sellers can sell their goods, but also Amazon is also creating its own products and sometimes, some sellers complain that Amazon will copy their products and start selling them under the Amazon brand, which then Amazon, then, of course, promotes.</p><p>Because if you search on Amazon, sometimes it'll say underneath, you know, \"These are some alternatives from Amazon itself.\" And what the E.U. is looking into is whether this gives them an unfair advantage because they get data about --</p><p>GORANI: Sure.</p><p>GOLD: -- what's selling the best, they get a lot of data about what's going on in this marketplace, and then they can create their own competitors.</p><p>GORANI: Can you give me an example of a product that Amazon is accused of having copied, something that Amazon manufactures, sells under its own brand?</p><p>GOLD: So Amazon actually has a surprising number of its own name-brand items, everything from toilet paper to diapers to mattresses.</p><p>GORANI: Right. See, I had no idea.</p><p>GOLD: Right. Because they might not be labeled, \"Amazon.\" They might have a different label. But a lot of them might be connected to the parent company of Amazon or just to Amazon as kind of the overall umbrella.</p><p>But there are some complaints from sellers. Now, Amazon wants -- says that, you know, they don't necessarily use the seller data to inform their decisions on what they make. But sellers have complained that they have created things -- for example a computer stand -- and then Amazon will start selling a similar computer stand for cheaper.</p><p>GORANI: But they don't manufacture it? Or do they?</p><p>GOLD: Well, for third-party resellers, they can contract with Amazon, then Amazon will sell it on their platform and even that they'll host it in their warehouses for them.</p><p>But also, Amazon does manufacture. I mean, through its subsidiaries --</p><p>GORANI: Right, right.</p><p>GOLD: -- it does make some of its own goods. Like if you think about, have you heard of Amazon Basics? These are some Amazon-branded products that you can buy.</p><p>GORANI: And it goes beyond that. Now, there's talk of some of these big tech giants wanting to launch their own currency. And when you look at the subscriber numbers for a website like Facebook for instance, even if a small portion of people started using a cryptocurrency from one of these websites, they could rival traditional currencies.</p><p>And elected representatives in the U.S. -- Maxine Waters in particular -- had this to say about a Facebook cryptocurrency, potentially.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): Ultimately, if Facebook's plans come to fruition, the company and its partners will wield immense economic power that would -- that could destabilize currencies and governments.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: So there you have it, you know? Can they be prevented from doing this?</p><p>GOLD: Theoretically, that's what the regulators probably want to do. There's been a lot of skepticism from regulators about Facebook getting into this cryptocurrency arena.</p><p>Because think about it. Like you said, Facebook has about two billion users. If even half of them or even a quarter of them start using this cryptocurrency as their main way of doing business, what effect is that going to have on the global monetary policy and the way things work right now? That is a question that a lot of people are looking for the answer.</p><p>GORANI: Sure. You shop on Amazon, right?</p><p>GOLD: Yes.</p><p>GORANI: See, I do too and I learned something today, to be more careful to make sure that I don't automatically click on the first suggested -- I guess that's advice we could give users, or --</p><p>GOLD: Yes. And that's the question that the regulator is looking at, saying whether there is an unfair advantage to Amazon, to this huge company where a lot of people do their shopping to the -- to the competitive landscape, to a smaller company out there. Because having your ranking on Amazon, that could be make-or-break for a company.</p><p>[14:25:02] GORANI: Yes. Hadas Gold, thanks very much for that.</p><p>Elon Musk wants to insert implants into your brain. He says the Bluetooth- enabled devices could enable telepathy. It consists of a tiny chip -- this just doesn't sound real, but anyway, he did say all this -- it consists of a tiny chip connected to 1,000 wires, measuring one-tenth the width of a human hair. A robot would insert it by drilling two-millimeter holes into a person's skull.</p><p>The entrepreneur says his new project is a way to use artificial intelligence for the good of humanity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELON MUSK, FOUNDER, NEURALINK: I think even in a benign A.I. scenario, we will be left behind. And so hopefully it is a benign scenario. But I think with a high-bandwidth brain-machine interface, I think we can actually go along for the ride. And we can effectively have the option of merging with A.I.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Let's take you to San Francisco. Ahiza Garcia has been following this story.</p><p>So this does sound -- I'll just be blunt. It just sounds a little nuts, the idea that a robot's going to implant a chip into our brain. That being said, 50 years ago, if somebody had predicted half the things we use every day today, they would have been called nuts, too. What should we think of this?</p><p>AHIZA GARCIA, CNN BUSINESS WRITER: I think it's definitely -- I mean, the science behind it is definitely been out for a while. What's cutting-edge about what Elon Musk is proposing and what this company is proposing is that the threadlike insertion in the brain is very, very noninvasive because it's so, so thin.</p><p>And so it will hopefully allow the company to, you know, help people with medical needs or, as Elon said, to help people who just want a memory boost.</p><p>But essentially, I mean, it is a very, you know -- I certainly don't see myself signing up for this any time soon. It seems like, you know, unless there is a definite medical need, inserting stuff into the brain seems like a really risky procedure.</p><p>Obviously, Elon has addressed some of those concerns and said that, you now, they're working and continuing to, you know, test on mice, on rats, on -- there was even a test on a monkey.</p><p>And so it's a long way, I think, from being tested on humans. But Musk is hoping to get human clinical trials started by the end of 2020, so we'll see.</p><p>GORANI: And how are markets, investors just Elon Musk observers reacting to all of this? He's said some outlandish things in the past.</p><p>GARCIA: Right. So his big concern is that A.I. is coming and is going to be this potentially nefarious thing that he sees the way forward for humans as trying to have kind of a symbiotic or a merging of relationships.</p><p>He's talked a lot about, you know, if when A.I., like if it does have a beneficial response, we still want -- humans still want to be a part of that. Twitter, you know, was abuzz with scientists saying that this technology has been out for a while. The science behind it is not quite as novel as it might seem.</p><p>But there is some unique -- there are some unique aspects to what Neuralink is trying to do, just in the terms of how they're approaching it and how thin this threadlike insertion into the brain would be. And the fact that, you know, it would eventually -- while it's still in a prototype phase right now, the eventual plan is for it to wirelessly transmit signals from within the brain, and information.</p><p>But that raises a lot of concerns, obviously, right? You've got privacy issues, consent --</p><p>GORANI: Well, we're concerned about Amazon buy boxes, so --</p><p>GARCIA: -- what's happening with that data --</p><p>GORANI: I was just going to say, we're concerned about much more benign things today, about who's collecting my data if I buy a vacuum cleaner online. I can't even imagine what kind of can of worms it opens up if we start putting chips in our heads.</p><p>GARCIA: Absolutely. I mean, you have so many -- you know, a lot of the implications for the medical -- people with medical needs, that raises a lot of concerns about consent, right? If some of these individuals aren't able to verbalize consent or you know, give that in a way that's recognizable to doctors, how are we proceeding with this?</p><p>But again, as you also pointed out, just the privacy concerns are a huge thing. They're literally -- would be able to potentially see -- you know, monitor your innermost workings.</p><p>GORANI: Well, I think people would be quite disappointed. Ahiza Garcia, thanks very much for joining us, live from San Francisco.</p><p>[14:29:57] Still to come tonight, new rules in the United States targeting people outside its borders. Mexico says no. We are live in Mexico City, next.</p><p>GORANI: The Trump administration is facing pushback against a new rule aimed at reducing migration along the southern U.S. border. The rule would require migrants traveling through Mexico to seek asylum there before heading on to the United States.</p><p>Now, Mexico's foreign ministers says its country disagrees with the plan and suggests that Mexico may not cooperate with that plan.</p><p>Senior International Correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh has more on the story. He's live in Mexico City. So, what are the Mexicans saying about these new asylum rules proposed by the U.S.?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, essentially, this particular new rule could end asylum for Central Americans heading to the U.S.-Mexico border. Because it says frankly, if you transit it through Mexico, that's where you should be applying for asylum.</p><p>Now, Mexico has had a pretty welcoming policy, frankly, to the hundreds of thousands of Central Americans over the last year or so have headed north towards the U.S./Mexico border.</p><p>But slowly, I think, as time, we've seen a poll coming up today suggesting six out of 10 Mexicans aren't particularly continuing that welcome in the way they had in the past. You got to remember a lot of these border towns, thousands of Central Americans waiting for the U.S. to call their number. They have entered into a voluntary queueing system and then U.S. agents say, right, let's go and hear your case.</p><p>It seems now, since this new rule went in yesterday, that those people are still being called. This isn't quite clear whether or not new rule means that all Central Americans who have transited for a third country are no longer eligible for asylum.</p><p>I understand it's probably going to take about a week or so for the court to adjudicate this challenge being put forth forward by human rights groups and advocates against the particular rule. Whether that's successful or not, of course, we'll potentially determine the faith of whether Central Americans can continue to do this at all. It's the exceptions for how people can still apply under this new rule are incredibly slide and incredibly hard to prove.</p><p>So it does essentially amount to yet another move of the Trump administration to end what has been a decade's long of migration north. Hala.</p><p>GORANI: And this poll that you mentioned 55 percent of Mexicans support sending migrants back to their country of origin, is that number up? I mean, what's behind -- it's more than half. So it's a majority of Mexicans support deporting these migrants. Why is that?</p><p>PATON WALSH: This is essentially, I think, the impact of months of pressure from Washington and the results of migrants who would normally try and find their way into the United States, finding that harder, find themselves caught in Mexico, and Mexico having to deal with that, having to issue humanitarian visas. Having now slowly to perhaps consider this asylum case of many Central Americans as well. And Mexico dealing with the consequences of that slowly overtime. Mexico is sending National Guard troops in Mexican-Guatemala border as well, we've seen.</p><p>[14:35:26] They've done all they can to make it practically harder and harder for migrants to move through. But it hasn't lessen the need for these Central Americans to try and find some asylum somewhere and the risk they're willing to endure in order to try and get a chance of a better life in the United States. It just seems potentially, this new rule, may legally make the whole journey pointless, because the United States will not be addressing asylum cases like that. It's to say it could face a potentially, they called court challenge in the week ahead or so.</p><p>But still, this slow drumbeat of pressure from Donald Trump is pressuring Central American countries to do more themselves as well. As it seems having some kind of impact not least on Mexican public opinion, too, towards people frankly from Central America just want a better life half the time, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: Nick Paton Walsh in Mexico, thanks very much.</p><p>The U.S. sports star is taking a special interest in the immigration crisis. Josh Norman of the NFL's Washington Redskins is joining me from Los Angeles.</p><p>And, Josh, these pictures show you at the U.S.-Mexico border. And you've taken a special interest in this migration crisis at the border. You've visited detention centers over the last several months. Why are you -- and you've donated money as well to some of these respite centers. Why are you so interested in what's going on in that part of the U.S.?</p><p>JOSH NORMAN, AMERICAN FOOTBALL PLAYER: Because it's important. It's important for us as U.S. citizens to stand up to anything that we feel that's necessarily right. We was born in this country. We all came -- didn't come from here. We all migrated here from other places. And, this is just as much as their land and it is ours. My friend, Demario Davis, cannot be here with me today that go on with me to these different places that we go and help support. But he feels the same way.</p><p>And also that just you see through some of the videos of what we had to go through in McAllen, Texas, and those conditions, they are shot for real. This is real. This is in your face. You see it so you have to move. We have a lot of people that talk. There's a lot of talking and it is a lot of things that carry on, on the shows and go on out there but -- where are you at with it? Put your money where your mouth is. That's what they say. Don't --</p><p>GORANI: What most -- what most touched you or made you emotional during these visits? What stays with you?</p><p>NORMAN: I mean the kids. The kids. I mean there was one kid out there who's running the street with his just underwear on. I mean, literally, it's like you are thinking it was in a third world country or something. It was kind of crazy to see that when we was there at the center where they was holding the immigrants -- and when they come there to the center, I mean, they're coming off of buses.</p><p>But these are prison buses with like cages that like literally shut off the windows from the outside world. And they come off from that and coming to the center where you have 600 people but not -- but only eight rooms, like probably like 12 -- not even 12,000 square foot facility.</p><p>You can't house all of them people at one time and then you shove them in the rooms, and people top on each other. It's really inhumane, the kind of conditions that they go through. But then we went back that second time and we saw some things that, you know, it still didn't help. So that's why I decided to go out there and support and like I toll, you know, it's the just the normal that I would do.</p><p>GORANI: And what kind of response are you getting? Because I know you told my producer this isn't political. But I guess I would say it shouldn't be political, but it is. Because on the one hand, you have, you know, one end of the political spectrum that supports closing the border or being certainly a lot more discerning into who comes in in these migrant detention facilities. On the other end of the spectrum, you have those who like you say this is inhumane, so you're taking a position here.</p><p>NORMAN: I mean for sure, like I'm positioning for what's right, no matter what it is. I mean, that's right. I mean, we all didn't come here. We didn't come here. This was not our land. We want to be honest with you -- this isn't his land before we got here, everyone. So when we got here, it just seems like we ended up building something more and we ended up making it our own infrastructure.</p><p>[14:40:10] And so when you look at that, Everyone has a right to come over and have due process. I mean, it's not what we are founded upon. And it seems to me that we lost that. We lost that (INAUDIBLE) touch. And for me, I'm just trying to do all I can to help and prove that situation whether this is political or not political.</p><p>I mean, we sit up here and we talk about the president so much and it seems as to me that's just a smoke screen. What are we going to do to actually really put people on the grounds and put boots on the ground and actually move the situation that's happening?</p><p>GORANI: What kind of response have you been getting from football fans, from your fans to this? Because, of course, as our -- this is a big international issue, you're here on CNN International and people are talking a lot about what's going on at the U.S. border, and whether it was taking knee or other things that big sporting stars have done in the past, they've sometimes gotten negative, they gotten flat for it. Have you had any negative reaction to what you've done?</p><p>NORMAN: Of course. Of course, there's negativity. No matter what you do in life, there's always going to be negativity. I was going to be the people that just wake up by their morning, I mean, wake up out the bed in the morning and just decide to be negative because that's who they are. You can't -- you can't do anything about that.</p><p>What you can do is just go out there and continue to do what's right and what you feel is right thing to do. You can't worry about those people. They are who they are, you're not going to change them. So I don't even look at them.</p><p>What I do though is I use my resources, I help what I can and try to benefit the people who need it the most, because those are the ones that's struggling. I don't feel like I wake up every morning, I don't struggle. But people are and I see that firsthand. I try to do as much as I can to help, because that's my purpose in life, to help others.</p><p>GORANI: Yes. I've seen just over the last over few months, the centers you've visited, the money you've donated, what's your plan? What's your next visit? What's your next trip?</p><p>NORMAN: Oh, man, I have big plans. I have huge plans.</p><p>GORANI: Tell me about it.</p><p>NORMAN: Oh my gosh, to tell you about, I'm just giving you a little bit of my ideas, the little army, the Swiss knife that we have in our back pocket to throw out there. But, no, I'm definitely helping out big time in McAllen. We're doing some more things there as well to see if we can help out the immigration situation there and moving some people around and helping that situation out.</p><p>Because, I think that facility -- I mean, they bring in at least 600 people a day. You know, that facility, sometimes, it get overcrowded. So, you know, I'm using my resources and what I do have to try and help out and getting things moving as far as facility-wise and transportation, moving things a little bit more smoother than they are right now.</p><p>Because it's hectic. And if anybody ever step foot in that place where on the ground, they will see for themselves. But a lot of people just talk about it, instead of actually being about it. And that's my whole issue. I mean, we can talk about all the other stuff. But if you're not actually putting action into what you're saying, you are just like the people who against us. This is not -- it's not a good feeling. It is not a good thing.</p><p>GORANI: Josh Norman, Washington redskins, quarterback, thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate it. Good luck to you.</p><p>NORMAN: Yes, for sure. Thank you guys for having us. I mean, you can stay tuned. I'm sure that there'll be a lot more things that's coming up about what we are doing and how we are helping out the kids and everybody and the families at the border, because they needed the most.</p><p>GORANI: We'll stay in touch. Thanks so much, Josh.</p><p>Still to come tonight, outgoing British prime minister, Theresa May, says politics have sunk to an all-time low. Find out who she's blaming for that, next.</p><p>[14:45:09] GORANI: The outgoing British Prime Minister, Theresa May, is delivering a warning about the state of politics in the U.K. and around the world, a week before she leaves office. In her last major speech before she steps down, Mrs. May said politicians, on the right and left, have lost the ability to compromise. She warned that's -- that that is sparking a winner-take-all approach detrimental to democracy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: It is on that school that today, we do have grounds for serious concern, both domestically and internationally, in substance and in tone, I'm worried about the state of politics. Today, an inability to combine principles with pragmatism and make a compromise when required seems to have driven our whole political discourse down the wrong path.</p><p>This dissent of our debate into rancor and tribal bitterness, and in some cases, even vile abuse at a criminal level, is corrosive to the democratic values which we should all be seeking to uphold.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: So there were no real fireworks here. This was kind of an exit speech. What's the main take away?</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It was consistent with her premiership. And in fact, there is no better person qualified to discuss the divisions in politics, the rancor is in bitter debate that we've seen, not just in the United Kingdom, but also around the world. And she was global in her outlook when it came to this speech.</p><p>Her key takeaway is where the importance of compromise. We expected that. When she said she was going to resign, she said compromise is not a dirty word. She said it was also important to know when not to compromise and took her studio tone when it came to threats to the liberal international order. She spoke about Vladimir Putin saying that the liberal idea was obsolete. She said that was incorrect. She said it was cynical.</p><p>She also made a couple of statements which can easily be seen through the prism of criticisms of President Trump this week. She spoke about not seeing international politics as a zero-sum gain while one country gains and another loses. She caution against adversarial international relations. So she did have a lot to say about that.</p><p>On Brexit, she said she was deeply disappointed, the state of affairs are where they are. She didn't have a lot to say about how a successor should take this forward necessarily. She did, in a fairly passionate piece, of the speech, she said that she put her job on the line in order to achieve the compromise that she thought was necessary. But it didn't work, as we know, even though that she managed to pass -- well, failed to pass her bill with a slightly slim of majority each time. She was unsuccessful.</p><p>GORANI: We covered every second of that. And this time, next week, it'll be goodbye Theresa May and hello -- we are expecting Boris Johnson.</p><p>NOBILO: We are. All the polls, all the anecdotal advents of conservative members that we've spoken to suggest that Boris Johnson is far and away going to be the winner of this leadership contest.</p><p>Today, she gave an ultimate performance and prime minister's question time, so she will likely do that as well next Wednesday and then the prime ministers will switch over, so Theresa May will leave Downing Street, the new prime minister will come in. We'll have the former announcement though of who it is going to be around noon London time on the 23rd.</p><p>GORANI: OK, Tuesday?</p><p>NOBILO: Yes. All the focus is on that.</p><p>GORANI: Thank you very much, Bianca Nobilo.</p><p>Zimbabwe is facing severe drought. More than two million people there now lack access to clean water. With our story, here's David McKenzie.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In Harare, the taps are running dry. More than a million people in Zimbabwe's capital like Ben Mungkosa (ph) are struggling under severe water restrictions after the city began the rationing program.</p><p>Locals can now only access clean tap water once a week, forcing them to turn to water merchants, open wells and boreholes to fill the void.</p><p>[14:50:07] There is no water coming from the taps. We have to depend on boreholes water. And you got to have a wheelbarrow to push up some (INAUDIBLE) from the borehole to a place. It's just bad. It's that bad.</p><p>MCKENZIE: City officials say a severe drought and the cost of the purifying process has drained the city's reservoirs and resources. The latest sign that Zimbabwe's economy is all but collapsing.</p><p>Prices of basic supplies like sugar and cooking oil have skyrocketed in the past month, in some cases soaring by 200 percent.</p><p>KUDZAI MUTSAKA, HARARE RESIDENT: I think it's also making us a less consumptive population. Because now you have to really see what is necessary? Do I need this? Maybe not.</p><p>MCKENZIE: The inflation rate has nearly doubled since May, reaching 175 percent in June. That's a troubling uptick for a country that saw hyperinflation grow to 500 billion percent in 2008 at the height of its financial collapse.</p><p>Zimbabwe's president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, promised to turn around the battered economy after he replaced Robert Mugabe in 2017 in an apparent coup. But widespread shortages have lingered.</p><p>CHARLES MWAZHA, HARARE RESIDENT (through translator): Life is becoming tougher for us because we do not have money to buy diesel and the price increase means only those who are rich can afford to buy.</p><p>MCKENZIE: Businesses are also floundering, as power companies cut electricity to keep up with the demand. Sometimes, for over 18 hours a day causing production lines to slow to a crawl and leaving workers in the dark.</p><p>KENNEDY GAMBANGA, WELDER, FABRICATOR (through translator): I feel ill after working in the cold for two nights in a row. I'm still not well. But I had to come or else my family will not eat.</p><p>MCKENZIE: A struggle for bare necessities felt millions of times over.</p><p>David McKenzie, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOATPE)</p><p>GORANI: Staying in Africa on the ongoing Ebola outbreak that shows no sign of slowing down. The World Health Organization is now calling it a public health emergency of international concern. As of Monday, there have been 2,512 Ebola cases and 1,676 deaths in this outbreak that began last August.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>GORANI: Well, it was the wild moment during the huge Bastille Day parade in Paris over the weekend. When a man quite literally floated in the sky, showing off some pretty impressive hoverboard technology.</p><p>CNN\"s Melissa Bell sat down the inventor and find out where he hopes to fly to next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Neither a bird nor a plane, but a fly board air above Paris on Bastille Day caught the world's imagination. But this was the view from the man flying it.</p><p>Right now, it can reach an altitude of nearly 500 feet with the potential to go much higher and a speed of 140 kilometers per hour.</p><p>A vision of the future developed by the French jet-ski champion who demonstrated it himself on Sunday, holding a replica weapon. Franky Zapata began his quest with hydroflyers, using the power from personal watercraft like jet skis to take to the air. Now, though, he's taken his technology to another level.</p><p>[14:55:05] FRANKY ZAPATA, INVENTOR, FLYBOARD AIR: When you fly with your body and then you see that your hands affect the direction you want to go and you feel the air through your finger before the wind affects your body, it's like coming like birth.</p><p>BELL: The key, says Franky Zapata, was being able to place turbine engines over conventional electric propellers to allow intuitive flight controls designed around the human body. It may sound complicated but he says it all comes down to one single dream -- the dream of being able to fly.</p><p>ZAPATA: The one I enjoyed the most is when I'm alone, flying around the desert and around the mountain. That's why I drew the mission.</p><p>When you fly in front of people and when you get some majors and some attractions, that helps. That's help to jump to the next step. But in my heart, I -- the best is the freedom.</p><p>BELL: Early on, the French Defense Ministry saw a future and decided to invest $1.4 million in tests of the board in the hope that it might give the French military a technological edge.</p><p>Back in 1989, the makers of \"Back to the Future Part II\" had imagined hoverboards used by civilians but that, says Zapata, will still take some time.</p><p>ZAPATA: The problem is not the technology, the problem is the regulations, first. How we can create enough safety and convince the government that it's safe enough.</p><p>BELL: In 2016, Zapata broke the world record for a hoverboard flight, traveling more than 2,200 meters in the South of France.</p><p>Next week, though, he'll attempt to go much, much further still, traveling from France to England to mark the 110th anniversary of the first flight across. If he makes it, the ride will blow away his previous record as he gets the first real bird's-eye view of the English Channel.</p><p>Melissa Bell, CNN, Marseille.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI: That was quite something on the Bastille Day celebrations as he hovered above all the world leaders gathered there.</p><p>Thanks for watching. I'm Hala Gorani. I'll see you next time, but stay with CNN. \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" is up next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019071701cbk40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKP-CG81-JB20-G1M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8205\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mohammad Javad Zarif</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iran</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pentagon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nancy Pelosi</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Al Green</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>House</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republicans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Impeachment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democratic Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Squad</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>E.U.</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elon Musk</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.S.-Mexico Border</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Theresa May</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zimbabwe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bastille Day</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Paris</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Personal Watercraft</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUFBMjczQ0I1NDNENDdDRDgwOUVCM0UwRUMwOTlDRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUJGMzIwOUU1NUY0NDU3MzhFRjhFRkMxQzgxOEI3MEY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLUZ</classCode><className>EU MERGER REGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday September 9th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are higher this morning. Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading this morning. Take a look. Dow Industrials up 55 points, S&amp;P up 7 and the Nasdaq up 18 points.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors are keeping a close on China and the trade tensions there. We know that the next meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials will happen in early October in Washington. The world's two largest economies confirming that next round of face to face talks next month as Beijing shows more signs that the economy there has slowed as a result of this ongoing battle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The markets also finished the week higher last week. It was a good week. Dow Industrials up 1.5 percent, S&amp;P was up 1.75 percent as well as the Nasdaq up 1.75 percent.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this and it's more of a mixed picture. Britain's GDP report was out this morning showing surprising economic growth for the month of July that eased some recession fears over Brexit. But as you know Boris Johnson is keeping to his plan of getting the U.K. out of the E.U. by the end of October.</p><p>Different story in Japan overnight. Second quarter GDP growing at a slower than expected pace. Nikkei average nonetheless off one-half of 1 percent overnight. Shanghai composite in China up almost 1 percent.</p><p>A MORNINGS WITH Maria exclusive this morning: I will sit down with John Schnatter. He in his first interview since stepping down as chairman and CEP of the company he built and founded. He weighs in on his departure from the company and his plans for the future.</p><p>More worries for Wework this morning. The company was totally looking into further valuation cuts and may even postpone its public debut altogether. We've got the very latest on Wework.</p><p>And then retirement in America in this morning. Details behind new study revealing which states are the most expensive to settle down in. All those stories coming up.</p><p>Also coming up this morning, my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on trade, the Fed, and Fannie and Freddie Mac reform, housing reform. The Treasury came out with its plan last week.</p><p>Fox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano, he is here, on big tech's antitrust suit and Georgia Congressman House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins coming up on the upcoming inspector general report.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big show this morning -- big two hours.</p><p>And our top story this hour, the state of Papa John's. The pizza giant going through a series of leadership changes as the company's founder stepped down as CEO two years ago.</p><p>Joining me right now in an exclusive interview is the founder himself, Papa John's founder and former CEO John Schnatter. Great to see you -- John. Thanks very much very joining us.</p><p>JOHN SCHNATTER, FOUNDER, PAPA JOHN'S: Good morning -- Maria. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You stepped down. You were forced to step down, the company that you built and that you founded. Tell us first what happened?</p><p>SCHNATTER: I was not force to step down. We had a successive plan in place so we actually heeded that plan. And I was ready to retire. We had a fantastic nine-year run. We took the stock from about $6.40. It's almost 88 bucks.</p><p>And so good run, good fun, good time -- we were ready to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So in other words, what you're saying is you enriched a lot of people by creating this business, making a profitable business and then -- and then making the stock go up, causing a very good situation for a lot of people involved.</p><p>You were ready to retire but you had a problem obviously. And you were on a conference call and a racial slur was used, can you tell us what was behind of all of that?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Well, if you look at the chronological events, the NFL call was November 1 and it was a benign call. There was nothing racial about that. They turned a little bit into kneeling but there was nothing said about kneeling.</p><p>The call you're referring to was July -- May 22nd that aired July the 12th, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. So let's go back to first the NFL call. Tell me about the NFL and your relationship with the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell.</p><p>SCHNATTER: Right, very good. Papa John's was the most associated brand with the NFL, most recognizable brand with the NFL, about a third of our budget was spent on the NFL. And they were having issue with kneeling.</p><p>And I kind of got on Goodell a little bit to fix the problem here. You know, let's satisfy the players and the owners but there was nothing in there about the players kneeling or anything that was any way racial.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what was most upsetting about that call?</p><p>SCHNATTER: The way it was misconstrued. The comments were benign and the way it was twisted. And then the company's lack of effort to correct the record, that was probably the most frustrating thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you're saying you would have liked Roger Goodell to come to your defense.</p><p>SCHNATTER: I WOULD have liked Roger Goodell to fix the problem, remember, a third of our budget was the NFL. So when the ratings I think were down some 20 percent, so it was hurting our business. It was hurting our franchisees. It was hurting our small business owners.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think he was behind forcing you to give up the chairman's title?</p><p>SCHNATTER: I don't know if he was behind it. I think he was a little bit frustrated with my comments. He's not used to being challenged. And the NFL's is very powerful.</p><p>And I was pretty stern. You need to fix the problem. You're the leader, be accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Then what happened?</p><p>SCHNATTER: I retired end of '17 and we -- we started to deteriorate a little bit with the performance and then as I was coming back in the picture we had a diversity training session in New York with the laundry service. And falling short of it is they tape the call which is fine. You and I get taped all the time. But I wish they would have told me who was on the call and they were taping it. And that got twisted.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So on that call you were talking about somebody else and you made a comment that was a racial slur?</p><p>SCHNATTER: No -- there Has never been any racial slurs. There's never been any use of the word, that's probably been the most frustrated. That's not true at all. What the call was 52 minutes and it was totally anti- racist.</p><p>At the very end of the call, I simply stated what another founder said and the way he went about using that word. Colonel Sanders called black people the n word. I would never call a black person the n word. It's not the way I was raised.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You were saying what Colonel Sanders said?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Yes -- paraphrasing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now, Colonel Sanders' family as you know has come out and said he's a weasel. He's a liar. You know, Colonel Sanders would never speak like that, he never said that. I don't know what John Schnatter was talking about?</p><p>SCHNATTER: I haven't heard that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. The family came out and said it's not true.</p><p>SCHNATTER: That Colonel Sanders did not use that language?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. Yes. Colonel Sanders --</p><p>SCHNATTER: I don't want to debate the Colonel -- God rest his soul.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, I know. I'm just saying but you repeated something that you say Colonel Sanders said?</p><p>SCHNATTER: It was common knowledge that Colonel Sanders talked like that. But let's not talk about the Colonel.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. Ok.</p><p>So let me ask you this. Can you give us a sense of the culture as you know it at Papa John's at that time. Was it common place for people to throw around words like that? Was it -- did you feel that it was no big deal that you were repeating something that somebody else said?</p><p>Tell me about the culture and whether or not these kinds -- this kinds of language was acceptable at the time?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Oh, Papa John's was voted the best place to work in Kentucky five years in a row. I would not tolerate that for one second. The board members that had been on the board for average of 10 years, management was 20, 25 years -- so no way that conduct would have been permissible, no way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what happened after that call, after you repeated something that you had heard or you knew Colonel Sanders had said and you were referring to him when you said the word?</p><p>SCHNATTER: First thing I found out IS they taped it and then laundry service was let go so they were bitter. And they attempted to extort money, otherwise they were going to hurt the company and hurt me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In what way?</p><p>SCHNATTER: The owner of Washman, Casey Washman, who owns the laundry service, basically said if you don't pay me millions of dollars I'm going to bury the founder. So that's when I went, oh, my gosh, we've got a problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. So then what happened? When did you first realize this was going viral, this was going to be a public situation?</p><p>SCHNATTER: The reporter at Forbes, Noah Kirsch -- excuse me -- he wrote an article on the 11th that went viral on July the 12th.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And this is the inside story of Papa John's toxic culture? The Forbes story was that a second story?</p><p>SCHNATTER: That was the second story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. So the first story was just specifically about that phone call.</p><p>SCHNATTER: What he has heard about the phone call. Noah at the time didn't have the tape but I believe laundry service or somebody else miscommunicated or mischaracterized what was on the tape and Noah ran with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what do you want people to know about you knowing that they have the story, that you used this word, this language even if you were talking about someone else saying it, what do you want the public to understand about you?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Well, to put it in context the most unfathomable, unbelievable thing about this whole situation is that the old board and the old executive team under Richie used the black community, used race in the media, to Forbes, to steal company and thus stripped (ph) the company very badly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In what way? How?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Well, stock was $88, went down to $40.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very quickly.</p><p>SCHNATTER: $88 on the 16th, $40 as of two months ago. It's up to $50. So Jeff Smith and the new board have got the stock up. Wall Street is fine -- $40 to $50. Good momentum.</p><p>What concerns me is main street, our business is not healthy right now so that needs to be rectified rather quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. I want to talk to you about that and what you're going to do to try to fix the situation. Your life was completely changed after this. You make this remark on a phone call, your life changes, correct?</p><p>SCHNATTER: No. My life --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The public -- there's so many stories about you and this phone call. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying the perception, what people were talking about what's important to them.</p><p>SCHNATTER: No, I don't like any of this and it's not true. It's a farce. But in the 14 months this has been going on I've never had a negative comment in public.</p><p>Now what I'm worried about is my employees and my franchisees, the small business owners that really wake up every day and make Papa John's great. Those are the people that keep me up at night. They're losing their jobs. They are scared they're going to lose their jobs. And the franchisees are in trouble.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>Let's take a short break. We want to hear more about what you're doing now and the future of Papa John's. The founder and former CEO is with me -- John Schnatter.</p><p>We are going to take a short break and then we will have more when we come back.</p><p>Then big tech is in the spotlight. Dozens of State Attorneys-general formally launching an antitrust investigation. What it means down the road. We will talk about that later in the program. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>I'm back in this exclusive interview this morning. The founder of Papa John's Pizza, he is the former CEO as well -- John Schnatter.</p><p>And John -- we were just talking about what you have experienced in the last two years. You think this was a coup to get you out.</p><p>SCHNATTER: I feel like the deal boards and all the executive team felt like they could run the business better than I could run the business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So this -- you gave them an opportunity to do something about it with that phone call. They said that you used racial slur, let's get him out. And then let's distance ourselves from the founder and the guy who built this company.</p><p>SCHNATTER: I feel like it's safe to say that they used something that wasn't accurate in a way to twist it to get me out, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Then there was back and forth with other board members where you had said, well, this person said this, and somebody else said this about you and there was this conversation, locker-room type conversation, which they are denying that they ever said anything that was untoward?</p><p>SCHNATTER: I don't really recall that, where they were saying things that were not true, I just know that, you know, being the founder, the brand is synonymous with me. And the franchisees and employees are not in a good place right now. And I will do whatever it takes in my power to help get the employees and franchisees back on their feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you do that? I mean recently the company announced plans, partnership with Shaq O'Neill. Tell me about that -- Shaquille O'Neill.</p><p>SCHNATTER: Shaquille O'Neill -- I like that. Shaquille sits on the board. The board and the chairman of the board report to the shareholders. So their duty of loyalty and duty of care, you know, is responsible to the shareholders -- myself and the rest of the shareholders.</p><p>So I'm just hoping with Shaq on board that he -- he upholds his fiduciary duties and he sells a lot of pizza.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now you've already sold a big portion of your stake, you've cut that stake in half?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok.</p><p>SCHNATTER: I don't like what I'm seeing at store level. Again, Wall Street is $50 a share but at main street I just don't think the business is quite as healthy as I'd like to see it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How are you going to appeal to main street to make sure that your customers or even former customers in some -- in some regard understand that the culture is not what it appears based on what we've read in the headlines?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Right, the culture on the way up, $6.40 a share at the end of '08 to $89 a share at the of '15 -- the culture was mutually respect, collaborative alliance, self-serving honesty. Everybody pulls together, everybody wins from top to bottom and that culture in the last two years has switched.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think that one of the reasons that you were -- were pushed out was because of the comments that you made on the call or is it bigger than that? You said this was a coup, explain.</p><p>SCHNATTER: I think as long as I was in the building and as long as I had 31 percent of the company, whether I was CEO or whatever title I had I still was in control. And I think there is some resentment towards that of which I actually would have been fine with all this if it would have worked.</p><p>The problem is the earnings at the end of '16 and '17 were $2.66 a share. In '18 it was 3 cents a share. EBITDA was $200 million, now it's basically flat. How do you take a business from $200 million EBITDA to flat, then you say well, that's after special charges. Special charges, legal fees -- they are not going to go away. Marketing supported franchisees -- that's not going to go away.</p><p>Support for franchisees, recruiting bonuses, retaining bonuses -- none of those special charges are going to go away, so you basically have a company that makes almost no money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Does it have the scale to operate and thrive in this kind of a situation or would you like to see Papa John's merge or get acquired by Wendy's?</p><p>SCHNATTER: I think to your point -- I think two things have to happen and a third one if Jeff Smith had his wish list. I think one is Rob Lynch needs a 12-month plan to fix this business, he's not going to fix it overnight. It's in trouble. So we need a good solid 12-month plan for Rob.</p><p>We need to transition from Steve Richie and that team to a new management team. So Smith needs to quiet down Richie because he's not saying good things about Jeff Smith or the old board.</p><p>And last but not least he's going to have to find (INAUDIBLE) for somebody that wants to take over this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you want them to merge or be acquired by Wendy's?</p><p>SCHNATTER: I'd have to look at the deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When you were in charge did you have conversations with Wendy's?</p><p>SCHNATTER: We did have conversations with Wendy's.</p><p>BARTIROMO: About a merger?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Well, you've to look at what is the synergy between the two companies, purchasing power, marketing power and technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think that deal will go through ultimately?</p><p>SCHNATTER: I think it's -- the odds have gone up with Rob Lynch in the picture because he comes from Arby's.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you going sell the rest of your stock in -- in Papa John's?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Well, depends on what happens. I mean every day is a different day at Papa John's. People buy stock because they think it's going to go up --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SCHNATTER: -- then they sell stock because they think it's going to go down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You sold half of your position?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Right -- it's a short. It's a hedge.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this. You hired an outside counsel to investigate all of these things that they said you did in terms of the racial slur, in terms of this -- you know, what Forbes wrote about a toxic culture. What has your investigation loose free (INAUDIBLE) with your lawyer. What has that turned up?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Exactly what I told you. The entire thing was a farce and it wasn't true and they made it up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you going to do now, John?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Sit back, try to help the franchisees and employees any which way I can. When they ask for counsel, give them counsel. Give them guidance. Give them -- you know, the institution knowledge that I hold and hope for the best.</p><p>BARTIROMO: and what do you think about the restaurant business in general. I mean you've $15 an hour minimum wage coming up, what if Papa John's pays minimum wage?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Depends on the phase. I mean you do $7.25 and it could be as much as, you know $9 or $10.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is it going up to $15?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Over time it will go up to $15.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And your assessment of the business today?</p><p>SCHNATTER: The -- I don't like the culture. I don't like the momentum. The recipes have been changed, that bothers me. And I don't like the fact that the managers in the stores are not making a bonus. When I was there everybody made a bonus, we were all -- from store manager to the janitor, to accounts receivable -- all way up. I think that's key.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When you say you don't like the culture, you were the CEO. Who breeds that culture?</p><p>SCHNATTER: Well, the culture -- again that's the place to work in Kentucky for four straight years. Up to '16 beginning to '17 culture was good. From '17 to '19 culture has done this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. John -- it's very good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>SCHNATTER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: John Schnatter joining us, former CEO at Papa John's.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Trouble at British Airways. Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, big trouble -- Maria.</p><p>An unprecedented walkout has grounded nearly all British Airways flights. Pilots changing a 48-hour work stoppage. This is in response to a long running pay dispute between pilots and the airline. Another job action is actually planned for later this month as well. Those flights today and tomorrow, that's going to be the problem.</p><p>And you may want to think twice if you plan to retire in New York state. According to a survey by a bank (ph) New York comes in dead last when it affordability due to high costs and taxes. Bank Rate survey also looked at other factors such the weather, crime, and culture. California was ranked second to least affordable followed by New Jersey, Maryland and Connecticut. The best states overall for the golden years folks -- Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, South Dakota and Florida.</p><p>You know Maria -- I never saw myself wheeling myself around in that wheelchair in New York City. So looks like that's not my plan.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: President Trump just tweeted on the 2020 race. Here is what the President writes, \"When the former governor of the great state of South Carolina Mark Sanford was reported missing only to then say he was away hiking on that trail then was found in Argentina with his flaming dancer friend, it sounded like political career was over. It was, but then he ran for congress and won only to lose his reelect after I tweeted my endorsement on election day for his opponent. But now take heart he's back and running for president of the United States. The three stooges\", the President writes, \"all badly failed candidates will give it a go.\"</p><p>The President went on to tweet about congressional rules this morning as well. Here's what he says there.</p><p>\"House Republicans should allow chairs of committees to remain for longer than six years. It forces great people and real leaders to leave after serving, the Dems have unlimited terms while that has its own problems, it is a better way to go, fewer people in the end will leave.\"</p><p>I guess the President here is talking about the fact that on the Republican side they have these term limits whereas if you're chairman of a committee like Devin Nunes who was the chairman of intel, once you lose that because of term limits often times you leave Congress. You don't want to go back to the rank and file membership after being the chairman of the committee.</p><p>He's saying don't do that. Maybe that's the reason we are seeing so many retirements in the Congress. What do you think, Lee?</p><p>LEE CARTER, POLLSTER: It could be or at least that's what he's trying to get people to believe is the reason so many people are leaving Congress and retiring right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>All right. We will take a break.</p><p>When we come back, big tech in the hot seat. Dozens of states' attorneys general will formally launch an anti-trust probe. What it means for future of big tech, coming up. We're going to take a look at that.</p><p>Then more worries for Wework, the company reportedly looking into further valuation cuts may postpone its public debut. We'll break it all down when we come back.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, September 9th. Your top stories right now, 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures pointing to a gain at the start of trading this morning. Dow Futures are up 55 points, S&amp;P up seven and the NASDAQ up 15.</p><p>We are watching China trade tensions, officials confirming the next round of face-to-face talks next month, early October in Washington, as the economy in Beijing continues to show more signs of slow growth.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will join me in half an hour. We will talk about China as well as housing reform, coming out of the Treasury.</p><p>Markets finished the week higher last week, take a look, Dow Industries up 1-1/2 percent on the week, the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ each up 1-3/4 percent.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mixed. Take a look at European Indices which are largely lower, FT-100 down 38 points, CAC Quarante down four, although the DAX Index is up 35 points. We had Britain's GDP report out this morning, it's showing a surprising economic growth for the month of July that ease some Brexit recession fears.</p><p>However, German exports are up in July and overall the European economic story is having a hard time generating any growth.</p><p>It is a different story in Japan. Second quarter GDP grew at a slower than expected pace as you see, the Nikkei Average nonetheless was up one half of one percent. In Asia overnight, markets were mixed as you see there.</p><p>Big tech is under pressure, states attorneys general ready to launch an anti-trust investigation into Google and Facebook over privacy concerns. Those stocks are up this morning in the premarket.</p><p>Meanwhile, more worries for WeWork, the company reportedly looking into further valuation cuts, even may postpone its public debut all together.</p><p>And a nostalgic trip, Sony is bringing back their Walkman and the surprise feature will blow you away. Wait until you hear that. All those stories coming up this Monday morning.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, taking on big tech, anti-trust investigations are launching across the country, looking into Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet, the main focus of their influence on advertising and whether they're stifling competition.</p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge, always a pleasure.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are they stifling competition?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, I don't know what the answer to that is. It's the -- it's states attorney general believe that there's at least a case worth investigating.</p><p>But let's look at a couple basics. The Supreme Court has ruled that if there was a federal statute and a state statute and the same behavior has arguably violated both, that both can investigate.</p><p>So at the same time that the FTC is looking at Facebook and at the same time that the Department of Justice is looking at Alphabet, the state attorneys general in two groups, one headed by the attorney general of the state of New York and one headed by the attorney general of the state of Texas, these are non-ideological and non-political.</p><p>In other words, there are Republicans, Democrats, Liberals, Conservatives in both groups are looking to see if each state individual states laws were violated, particularly the laws against privacy.</p><p>So the federal law that prohibits for example computer hacking or failing to safeguard information that was given to you, there are state versions of those laws as well. That's one way to look at this.</p><p>The other way to look at this is, what do they really want? They're run -- they're running in the red. They're looking for cash.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: Bingo.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Just like when they shook down big tobacco. They got billions in cash and how many people stopped smoking as a result of all that? Where did that money go?</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) a really easy reason and a -- and a good way to do it. I mean, they're giving it on the silver platter. They might be looking for cash, fine. But that doesn't mean that there's no problem here.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct. So there's two ways to look at it. If they won, one way is, we know they violate privacy.</p><p>It's kind of silly for the government to say you're violating privacy because nobody violates privacy more than the government does, state and federal. But there are laws there and the state attorneys general have sworn to uphold the laws and this is the way you do it. You begin with an investigation.</p><p>And it actually is more efficient to do it in groups rather than 30 different investigations. You have two, each of which has 15 states involved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Isn't there more to this, though? I mean, there's -- we know that the ideology of big tech is liberal is -- you know, how many people in Google were crying when Hillary Clinton lost the election. There's -- there are lawsuits right now that -- you know, that say they are stifling conversation coming out of the Conservative Party.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Devin Nunes suing Twitter. Tulsi Gabbard suing Google --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- for these reasons. So is that part of this?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It is not and maybe it will be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It may not be part of this as state attorneys general, but isn't there pressure like in other corner?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know -- you know, there might be. And I'm in the minority on this, in my view, as hateful as it is and it could happen to me, it could happen to anybody in this room, it could happen to anybody watching us now. Google's a bulletin board, they want to take me off their bulletin board, there's no First Amendment obligation on their part to keep me up there. The First Amendment only regulates the government. Not everybody believes that.</p><p>A lot of people are (INAUDIBLE) that it is so big, it is tantamount to a government and it is so big it will be impossible to compete with it. And if they stifle my political speech, there should be recourse. Again, that has -- that issue hasn't been resolved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a conversation we get into a lot, I mean, is this a media company or is this the bulletin board?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, you can argue that these companies are more powerful today in terms of being media companies than they ever have been and that they have to be an open forum for everybody and not just pick and choose where they want to go.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Some federal judge sitting in Washington, D.C., I'm going to guess, probably in the next three or four years is going to have to make that call as to exactly what they are and what -- to what protections they are entitled. Because if they --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congress could make that call. They could get rid of the liability waiver for contents that's --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because again, they're free from being sued for the content, saying (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: And what they put in the bulletin board, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- it's the content that is produced by the users of these services and not the company. Congress could get rid of that. And it would open them up to lawsuits. They'd be a lot more careful about basically icing out certain types of speech. NAPOLITANO: Dagen is quite correct, a majority vote in either House of the -- both House and the Congress and the president signs it and the law is radically different and the courts would have to follow that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, there's so many legs around big tech right now. I mean, you look at Google having an A.I. lab in China, right? The employees balked at Google, you know, using their A.I. technology for the government working with the Pentagon. They walked away from Project Maven, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because they didn't want to use that. And then they -- then they open up this A.I. lab in China.</p><p>Google is the leading company in the world on A.I. Nobody has better A.I. than Google. That's their jewel, OK.</p><p>They have an A.I. lab in China. So you have to question, is the Chinese -- can the Chinese try to intercept and meddle in our election through Google?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes. Well, I don't know if they can technically. But the more involvement Google has with the Chinese government, the more the Chinese government understands how Google works, the easier it would be for them to do it.</p><p>The president of the United States is opposed, President Trump, to the relationship between Google and China's A.I., but he needs legislation to stop it. I mean, he's exposed it, but in order to make it unlawful, only Congress can do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes it's interesting. Because in China, the Chinese government will say you do this and you do that companies.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And in this country we have our ethics and you know, --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We have laws.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: We also have the free market, sort of free.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, let's switch gears, ask you a pharmaceuticals because you got the drug maker Purdue Pharma expected to file for bankruptcy now, judge. Group of state attorneys general stalled. The company had offered billions to settle lawsuits claiming that they used deceptive sales practices to advertise the pain killer OxyContin.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: These are the same state attorneys general that we were just talking about a couple of minutes ago. Which Purdue approached, said look, there's all these lawsuits. You guys are suing us on behalf of thousands of people and thousands of people are suing us individually. Here's $13 billion, you divide it up. And they couldn't come to an agreement.</p><p>Now if this goes to bankruptcy court, Purdue Pharma will make out far better than it will if there are lawsuits before juries or if the case is settled, because bankruptcy is just a cold financial decision.</p><p>There's no -- there's no pain and suffering. There's no emotion. There's no jury. It's just a bankruptcy judge deciding, OK, you're -- you owe 15 and you only have 10, here's how we're going to -- here's how we're going to divide it. Purdue Pharma will survive this. It will be a lot smaller but it will go on and have another life and the claimants will get far less money from -- mark my word, far less money from bankruptcy than they would get from filing lawsuits or even settling this case.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Judge, great insights from you always.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Such a pleasure on a Monday morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Judge Andrew Napolitano there.</p><p>We'll take a break. But first, President Trump tweeted again this morning, he just said this. 94 percent approval rating in the Republican Party, a record. Thank you, writes the president.</p><p>Quick break and then more worries for WeWork to report. The company reportedly looking into further valuation cuts to its IPO. It could in fact delay the public debut. We'll break it all down, next.</p><p>And then Sony celebrates and updates one of its ground-breaking products 40 years later. What's old is new again at Sony. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, the trouble keeps on coming for WeWork. The company cut the valuation it could cut the valuation for its IPO. Jackie DeAngelis now with all the details. Jackie, Good morning to you.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you. Well, as we're waiting to hear what WeWork exactly is going to do, the plan was that it was going to do a road show this week. But now they're having conversations about maybe taking the valuation down to $20 billion or even possibly delaying the IPO until 2020.</p><p>And $47 billion is where they were earlier in the year. So this is a big cut, almost in half. And it's kind of a red flag to a lot of investors that have already been skeptical about this.</p><p>A couple of the issue here, people are worried about governance, how they're running the company. But they're also worries about the business model and the ability to turn a profit.</p><p>Now in the IPO environment, we've been talking about this, how do you invest in companies that don't turn a profit? But short-term there's some concern too back to that business model, that this renting of office space, if there's a downturn in the market, you know, could see potential problems and of course the environment's very different than it was in the beginning of the year as well when we saw Uber and Lyft go public.</p><p>I will also say this, the CEO reportedly has sold some of his stock. That's making people nervous too, about $740 million. So it's never really a good sign if the chief executive isn't a hundred percent invested. And the question now really is, if you sell the IPO and you need all this cash to really hit the growth targets and help it move forward, where does WeWork go from here?</p><p>SoftBank is a big investor and the conversation right now seems to be is SoftBank going to step up and infuse some cash here to keep it going. But it's definitely a story to watch.</p><p>Maria, I know you always talk about the losses. 2018, WeWork lost $1.6 billion. Hard to get behind that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and then, you know, they had an all-male board until they decided to go public and then they had a woman then.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Yes and so that goes back to the governance too and the chief executive, you know, there's some concern that he's very controlling. He's sort of a little overbearing in how the operations run. And people are just looking you know, twice at this and having a bit of a keener eye.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, this the whole idea of what WeWork does has been quite popular in terms of when you actually look at the business. Mitch, your thoughts.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: When you shifts at the -- a business model like WeWork shifts the risk from trying to for a small business signing a lease with a landlord directly which can be very difficult if you're a small business, to having the ability to have your employees work in one location in one city, another location in another city. So it's a really good business model for small business. The question is, what's on the other side and how they operate their business.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Right, conceptually and I go back to the Lyft and Uber models as well, you know, I mean, these are amazing businesses that people have praised in terms of the convenience that they've provided consumers. But when you're an investor really, it comes down to the dollar and cents of it all. And you can see, you know, in terms of the performance of those share prices, even though there was a lot of excitement around it, you know, maybe the rest remains to be seen if you will.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want to point out Kevin Kelly, the day that this company filed its IPO on this show went through all -- the host of problems with this company, not just the governance and the fact that what the co-founder has 20 votes per share -- like 20 votes per share, so a complete voting control of the company, in addition to the kind of upside down business model that this company has.</p><p>So it's trying to raise money to expand, to grow, when it's not making money now. And this kind of market environment, good luck selling shares with that pitch.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Well, what's interesting --</p><p>CARTER: It just seems though that there's a -- there's a big opportunity in this space for a company that's going to make more sense. So they might have gone and made this splash. Now there's a lot of others that are coming up behind it that maybe could make a business model that make more sense.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: The challenge is it's very capital intensive. So you're talking about Uber and Lyft, there the capital investment is on that part of an independent driver who buys or leases a car. Here, they have to buy -- you know, sign this long-term lease to secure, that takes a lot of capital and a lot of commitment.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Yes, and I said, if the housing market were to turn or people were not feeling as stable if we do see the economy at some point go into a recession, that's going to be a problem in terms of delivering on those leases, I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Jackie, we'll be watching. Thanks so much.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Important story there.</p><p>Coming up, my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up on trade, the Fed, debt, Fannie and Freddie all that coming up, 8:00 a.m. Eastern this morning.</p><p>Then, Sony updates one of its signature products with a 2019 makeover. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Centers for Disease Control issuing a new warning against vaping. Cheryl Casone with the details this morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria, the number of deaths possibly linked to vaping has now jumped to five. Three additional deaths confirmed on Friday in Indiana, Minnesota and California following two previously reported deaths. CDC is currently investigating about 450 cases of severe lung illness nationwide, potentially connected to e-cigarette use.</p><p>Well, Tesla fans will going to have to wait a little while longer to check out the company's electric pickup. The truck which CEO Elon Musk calls the coolest car I've ever seen was expected this summer or next month. But the reveal's been pushed back to November. Musk says it's a really futuristic, like cyber punk blade runner pickup truck. That's what he said.</p><p>The Tesla truck would compete against an all-electric version of Ford's popular F-150 which could be available in 2021.</p><p>Well, before smart phones and Bluetooth there was the Walkman. Remember the Sony Walkman? Well, the revolutionary portable music player that changed how we listen to our music celebrates its 40th anniversary this year.</p><p>Sony is making the occasion releasing a new version, one with modern technology to support downloads and stream music. The new Walkman even comes with a soft case to make it look like the ancestor, complete with a touch screen window on the player, makes it looks like there's a cassette actually playing inside, Maria. So what's old is new again or something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I can't wait to see it. And I think it's such an important reminder of how technology, the next better thing will take you out in three seconds. It was the Walkman which really all started us on, you know, music, mobile music and you know, walking around and having our earphones with our music and that was the rage until Apple came out and took the Walkman out.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: How about the boom box? Why are we forgetting about the boom box?</p><p>CARTER: I mean, just think about the impact that this had on our lives. It's like we were able to have a sound track to our lives, be able to walk around, listening to music and it's totally -- and you're right, it's such an important reminder to say like just one day, just like that, something can disrupt and come along that you're not even thinking of, so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: The -- I saw a boom box (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I saw a guy with a boom box yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, just -- and it was an old school boom box. I don't know how old the thing was with the cassette -- the cassette player in the front of it.</p><p>CARTER: Say anything.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But Sony had a good long run though throughout the '80s, and it went from the Walkman with the cassette tape to the Discman.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, you had the Discman.</p><p>MCDOWELL: SO it was into the -- remember the round disc?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes, I had one of those.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: You had to run very stably if you had the Discman or else it would start skipping on you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You ran with the Discman?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I ran with the Discman. Yes, I had to shop with Discman.</p><p>MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's hard.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like you're carrying a China dish.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Or tape it to your body somehow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because it would skip (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, quick break and then my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up on trade, the Fed, Fannie and Freddie, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, right here, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Monday, it is Monday, September 9th.

Devin Nunes, R-CA; Maria Bartiromo, FNC</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Time: 10:05:00</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Date: 2019-03-03</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  And we begin this morning with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen scheduled for another round of now closed-door testimony before the House Intelligence Committee this Wednesday, this as Democrats ramp up their own investigation into the proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining me right now, in an exclusive interview, is the ranking member of that committee.  He is Republican Congressman from California Devin Nunes.  He also sits on the House Ways and Means Committee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.  </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>First, reaction to Michael Cohen this past week, and give us a sense of why it's important to go from the public hearing last week.  Now he's going to be in front of your committee behind closed doors this upcoming week.  </p><p>NUNES:  So, remember, he was in public with the Oversight Committee.  Then he came behind closed doors with us for no reason at all.  This is not a man who has any classified information whatsoever.  </p><p>We interviewed him for some eight, nine hours.  In fact, Republicans were pretty much done with interviewing after a couple of sessions.  We didn't have any more questions to ask him.  We're not sure why he's coming back, but he will be back this week once again in a classified setting, for someone who has no classified information.  </p><p>So, from my perspective, it's all about building out a narrative.  They want to keep it behind closed doors, so that they can conveniently say, well, we can't talk about what happened behind closed doors, when the reality is, we can talk about whatever we want to talk about, because the guy has no classified information.  It's ridiculous.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said a couple things this past week that some people are wondering if he perjured himself again by saying he never wanted a job in the White House.</p><p>And then I thought there was something really interesting in terms of the work you have done so well for the last year-and-a-half on the dossier.  He said he was never in Prague.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And isn't it true that, in the dossier, the dossier said that he went to Prague to go meet with Russian officials to meddle into the U.S. election?  </p><p>NUNES:  Yes.  This is why they don't want him outside.  They don't -- they want him behind closed doors, so that we can't talk about the testimony.</p><p>The bottom line is, is that Cohen was great for Republicans.  It was great for Donald Trump, because we now know that the dossier was total bunk.  There was no truth to it.  And we know that because of -- that Cohen has testified now publicly that he wasn't in Prague, and there was no truth to anything in the dossier.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said there was no collusion, by the way.  </p><p>NUNES:  No collusion -- no collusion conspiracy, no obstruction.  </p><p>You know, these are all issues that were essentially made in that dossier that was the Democrat -- remember, for the viewers out there -- and I think a lot of people forget -- this was the Democratic campaign committee working with the Clinton campaign that produced this dirt, fed it into the FBI to start this investigation in the first place.</p><p>It was totally debunked this week, and it will be debunked again next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have been investigating this now for upwards of two years.</p><p>You have told us a lot.  You have informed the public a lot in terms of what took place in the 2016 election.  I don't think, without you and your colleagues, we would even know what really took place by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI and the DOJ.  </p><p>NUNES:  Yes.  There's still more to come.  We're going to keep interviewing people.  We're going to get this information out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about that, because you're wrapping up your investigation.  You have got a couple of things to do.  </p><p>One of them is, you have provided a list of the people that you would like to come down to speak to you and get testimony of them.  So we have got this list.  Go through some of these names and why they're important, Tashina Gauhar, Gregory Brower, John Carlin, Kevin Clinesmith.</p><p>Tashina Gauhar is important why?  </p><p>NUNES:  So, these are all names that we had sent to our Republican task force at the end of the last Congress.  </p><p>These names are all important, because we need to know if these people were involved in the chain of custody of the dossier that we just referred to, because the dossier makes claims that this information came from Russians.</p><p>So all the names that are on this list that we didn't get to last year that still need to be interviewed, if we're really looking for Russian collusion, we need to know if any of those people were actually talking to Russians on behalf of the Clinton campaign or any operative, whether it's Fusion GPS, what Russians were they actually talking to, because, look, they could be the problem.</p><p>They could be -- these Clinton people could be the ones that were in bed with Russians, for all we know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, these are all...</p><p>NUNES:  Or it could be total nonsense.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Many of these names are associated with Hillary Clinton.</p><p>NUNES:  Right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, obviously, names like Jake Sullivan, who was a P.R. guy, I believe, for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>NUNES:  Right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Robby Mook, another P.R. guy for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Sidney Blumenthal, tell me why he's on your list.</p><p>NUNES:  Well, he was also involved in one of the dossiers.  So there's several versions of the dossiers, OK?</p><p>So this was dirt he was feeding into through friends and acquaintances that got into the State Department, right?  So, remember, the dossier came at very different angles all over the place into the FBI and DOJ.  </p><p>Some of those people in the Clinton campaign -- I think a lot of people forget this -- why would people in the Clinton campaign be tweeting out messages about Trump's involvement with Russia?  It's because they had the dossier.  They were promoting this message, this dirt out there in 2016.</p><p>And we need to ask these Clinton campaign people where they got it from.  Did they get it from Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS, the dossier that they were paying for, or did they get it from some Russian friends of theirs that they know of?</p><p>The bottom line is, is that everything that was in that dossier, all the accusations that were made, whether it was tweets from the Hillary campaign, press releases from the Hillary campaign, it was all nonsense.  It was stuff they were feeding into the press.  The press was writing about it, they were tweeting it out and promoting it out.  And they were all in on it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a part of -- it was part of their strategy to get this narrative out that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians.  Give it to the media, let the media drive the bus on all of it.</p><p>And it actually worked, because...</p><p>NUNES:  At the end of the day -- at the end of the day, it worked.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... a year-and-a-half later, we're still talking about the potential of this.  </p><p>NUNES:  That's right.  That's right.  </p><p>And that's why we're trying to get to the bottom of who was involved.  That's why we have all these lists of people we need to interview.  We need to know what their involvement was in all this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, so this is a list of 32 people.  </p><p>Do you think you're ever going to get these people to come down and give you testimony?  You don't have subpoena power anymore.  Your colleagues are trying to lift every rock and look for a crime around Donald Trump.  </p><p>NUNES:  So, the Democrats claim that they're going to be so much nicer than we were to them.</p><p>So, remember, we gave them every single witness they wanted over the last two years when we were in the majority.  They claim they're going to give us witnesses.  So far, they have given us zero witnesses.</p><p>So, if they continue not to give us any witnesses, we will ask all of these people to voluntarily come into Congress to talk to us.  If they won't come in, we will either do it through the courts, or we will send it over to the Senate, and hope that Lindsey Graham and his team can get to the bottom of it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Senator Graham has been with us many times over the last several weeks.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said he's doing a deep dive.  He's going to bring the necessary people to testify.  In fact, he's going to interview definitely the people who signed the FISA warrant.</p><p>So as you wrap up your investigation, you have got these 32 names you want to interview.  You have got, number two, declassification.  Are we ever going to see declassification for some of the documents that you think are most important to educate the American people about this?  </p><p>NUNES:  Yes, I kind of sum it up this way.</p><p>There's really five areas, the interviews we just talked about.  There's the criminal referrals that have to be made.  There's the declassification, radical declassification.  We need to have declassification across from everyone we interview to everyone that Mueller interviewed.</p><p>Then we're going to have to have a fundamental FISA reform.  We can never again let the FISA process be used to target political campaigns, right?  We can't let our intelligence capabilities be targeted and pointed at political campaigns.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they went to the FISA court.  And they said, look, we have this dirty dossier, and that's the reason that we're going to spy on the Trump campaign, essentially.  </p><p>NUNES:  Yes, and not only that.  Not only did they get a warrant to get into somebody's e-mails on the campaign and get -- to be able to suck all that up, e-mails and listen to phone calls and all of that.</p><p>They also opened a counterintelligence investigation into a political campaign.  Now, these are tools that are supposed to be used to go after terrorists, you know, the people that destroyed the buildings here in New York.</p><p>And then the final thing that we have to deal with is, the media was involved in all of this, this disinformation campaign.  They were given the dossier, and they spread it out.  They spread numerous fake news stories about myself, the work that we were doing on the committee, many members on our committee, staff on our committee.  </p><p>That's going to have to be dealt with too, this disinformation campaign.  The slander and the libel will all have to be dealt with.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're saying you're going to deal with the misinformation out there.  How do you deal with that?  You have referred to them in the past as tech oligarchs to me.  </p><p>NUNES:  Yes.</p><p>So, there's two ways that they're doing it.  So, the fake news media, they're putting out fake news stories.  Sometimes, it comes from the Democrats, right, and the dossier.  They feed it to the media.  The media runs a story</p><p>And then the numerous tech companies out there that are really controlling what all Americans see, right?  So, what these tech companies have become is, they try to pretend they're not, but they're content developers.  They're developing content, OK, through two ways, one, algorithms.  So they're controlling what you and I see when we get on our device.</p><p>So for them to say that they're not developing content is nonsense.  The other thing that they're doing is, they're monetizing this.  So there are some people that will not get rewarded.  Like, if you're a conservative out there putting conservative videos together, you're not going to get money for that, right?  People are not going to advertise on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>NUNES:  So, all this has -- has got to be dealt with, I think, in the future.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me get back to that, because I want to find out how are you going to do that.</p><p>But speaking of interviews and your team looking at who you want to speak to, I want to talk about this letter that your colleagues Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan sent to the attorney general, William Barr.</p><p>And, basically, they are asking for a number of things from the A.G.  And they mention in particular Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad.  These are two individuals that worked at the Department of Justice and now work at the special counsel 's office.  </p><p>Can you tell me about Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad?  </p><p>NUNES:  So, Weissmann is the number two.  It's Mueller's deputy.  He was involved in the custody of the dossier.  So, in early 2016, he was given the dossier.  </p><p>This is somebody, him and the other individual that's mentioned there, both DOJ people, both on the Mueller team.  They shouldn't be involved in this investigation.  I don't know -- well, and the questions that my colleagues are asking is...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>NUNES:  ... is, you know, there's clear regulations that DOJ has that you can't be conflicted.  And so they're asking questions.  </p><p>Look, did they disclose to Mueller before Mueller picked them that they were involved in the chain of custody of this dossier?  Because I will tell you, if I was -- I don't know that they're going to have any criminal indictments or not, but, if I was any attorney, I would be saying, look, these people that are bringing this forward, they shouldn't be involved in this because they are biased.</p><p>We already know the people that were kicked off were biased.  But you also have the fact that these two individuals that Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows are asking about were involved in the chain of custody of important evidence, the dossier, the dirt from the Clinton campaign, that is the basis for this entire hoax.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is important, because, for a long time, I have been asking the question, can the Robert Mueller special counsel report have credibility if it doesn't look at what we know to have been wrongdoing by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI?</p><p>So, Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows write to Bill Barr.  And they say this. Number one, we'd like you to identify all actions taken by Weissmann and Ahmad, including disclosures to apprise the department or the special counsel's office of their role in the events Bruce Ohr testified to about supplying the FBI with information relating to the Trump campaign.  </p><p>So, they also want to explain all the actions taken by Weissmann and Ahmad after learning that Steele, Simpson and Nellie Ohr were providing Bruce Ohr information for the purpose of relaying it to the FBI, provide all documents and communications referring or relating to disclosures made by Weissmann and Ahmad, and provide documents and communications related to the process the department used to evaluate prosecutors and investigators' independence.</p><p>So they're right now still working on the special counsel's investigation, Robert Mueller.  </p><p>NUNES:  Right.  And they're not -- they're not independent investigators.  These are people that were in on this from the beginning.  They knew about the dossier.  They were -- they brought this dossier forward.</p><p>I don't know if they told -- maybe they told Mueller, and Mueller decided to waive these requirements that are there.  Also, let's not forget, we also have evidence that, at one time, that Weissmann was meeting with reporters.</p><p>And so you have this.  And this is part of this whole disinformation campaign.  I should have said this earlier.  It's not just the media.  It's not just that they were getting it from the Clinton campaign.  You also had people within the Department of Justice and the FBI that were briefing reporters.</p><p>Now, what on earth are you doing briefing reporters?  What was Weissmann doing talking to AP reporters, right?  We have asked those questions and never got the answers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>Well, it's a good point that you make.  Jordan and Meadows want this information from the A.G. by March 15 at 5:00 p.m.  </p><p>I want to take a short break, but we have got more to cover here.  </p><p>Number one, do you think they are going to get this information by March 15?  And, also, Mueller's report going to drop soon.  Got to get your expectations.</p><p>Congressman Devin Nunes is with us this morning.  He's staying with us.  </p><p>Quick break, and then we will talk about the concerns about China technology giant Huawei as well and the red flags being raised by U.S. lawmakers on how Beijing may be infiltrating American universities to spread its propaganda.  </p><p>Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures.  Let me know what you would like to know from Devin Nunes on Instagram @SundayFutures.  </p><p>Stay with us, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>And I am back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the ranking member on the House Intel Committee.</p><p>And, Congressman, you just said that you want to get these people a list of 32 people down, so that you can interview them.  </p><p>What happens next?  I mean, our audience wants to see accountability.  What are you expecting in terms of accountability?  How will Bill Barr response to this letter that Meadows and Jordan just sent him?</p><p>And do you think -- I mean, when you say criminal charges, what does that mean, criminal referrals?  </p><p>NUNES:  Let me start with this.  </p><p>All of us want to see justice equal under the law, right?  So we want to see everyone held accountable.  </p><p>I believe that, if the new attorney general and the Department of Justice, if they don't take all of this on, and do a full scrub and have full accountability and transparency for the American people, you're going to see generations of conservatives who will not trust the Department of Justice, they will not trust the FBI, and they for sure will not trust the FISA process.</p><p>So I mentioned this in things that we have left to do earlier.  And I don't want to gloss over it, because it's very important.  The FISA laws were first written in the '70s.  They need to be completely rewritten because of what the Clinton campaign and the former people at DOJ and FBI were able to do.  </p><p>That's going to be a whole undertaking that Congress has to undertake.  If that's not done -- so we need accountability by -- from the attorney general and the Department of Justice for all the people that were involved in this mess.  And, at the same time, Congress is going to have to rewrite the laws that allow the intelligence agencies to go after American citizens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have brought all of this information forward.  You have put it right there in front of Bill Barr.</p><p>Is he going to act on it, do you think?  What are your indications...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NUNES:  Well, we're going to -- yes, we will continue -- we will continue to work with the Justice Department.  Barr just got in there, so let's give him some time here.</p><p>I think, once the new deputy attorney general gets in, and then we will slowly get to work, and start to work with them to try to bring accountability to everyone.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Last week, a federal judge in Florida ordered the release of the depositions given by former British spy Christopher Steele and an associate.  </p><p>What are you expecting in terms of getting these depositions unsealed?  </p><p>NUNES:  So, this is great, because this is going to -- I think it's going to be on March 14 is going to be the day.  </p><p>So, remember, Christopher Steele is the guy who was hired by the Democrats to go get information from the Russians.  He wouldn't come and talk to us, right?  He's already been criminally referred to the Justice Department.  He was supposedly an asset for the FBI.  We never got to interview him.  </p><p>Luckily, someone sued him and a guy named, I think, David Kramer, who was also involved in the creation and -- creation and dissemination of the dossier.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>NUNES:  So, he pled the Fifth to us.</p><p>So between Christopher Steele and Kramer, we really want to know, what did they tell the court?  So this is going to be fascinating information.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the Mueller report?  Are you expecting it to drop soon?  What's going on there?  </p><p>NUNES:  You know, you're going to interview Ken Starr a little later.  </p><p>I don't understand.  If Mueller doesn't have any crimes that he's -- that he's going to prosecute on, then I don't know what report we'd be looking for, because, as far as I can tell, the Mueller investigation was stood up for one reason, and one reason only, and that was based on the dossier.  </p><p>And, remember, we have never seen the scope memo that started -- we have talked about it many times on your show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>NUNES:  I hope people understand this.</p><p>There's a classified scope memo of what Mueller is supposed to be doing.  It's been hidden from Congress.  It's been hidden from the American people.  My guess is, all it is, is the information from the dossier.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, real quick, Adam Schiff is looking for a crime.  And he's doubling down on investigations.</p><p>Let's take a short break, and then I have got to ask you about your colleague Adam Schiff.</p><p>Then, Senator Rick Scott and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney are here.</p><p>Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the ranking member on the House Intel Committee.</p><p>Your colleague who is the chairman of the Intel Committee is Adam Schiff.  He said a long time ago he had more than circumstantial evidence that there's collusion between the president.  He's still out there looking for a crime, as you're trying to finish up your investigation to indicate wrongdoing that he continues to push back on.  </p><p>NUNES:  Yes, it's a lot like looking for, like, some mythical creature, right, this collusion creature?</p><p>So I often say -- I joke that it's like in search of Sasquatch, or Loch Ness Monster, or Chupacabra, which is like this mythical animal supposedly in the Southwest.  They just don't exist.</p><p>And so he's just doing a lot of chasing the ghost around in the closet.  He's made lots of promises, and now he's basically moving the goalposts to where they're no longer on collusion anymore.  They're on to basically every single one of Donald Trump's business ventures that he was ever involved in.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>NUNES:  So, it's gotten way out of control, in terms, this is no longer -- this has nothing to do with Russia anymore.  This is just like going after Trump, which is not the job of the Intelligence Committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they want him out.  I mean, let's face it.  </p><p>I want to move on to China, because you have done an investigation for multi years at the Intel Committee.  </p><p>And this week, I had the opportunity to speak with the chief security officer of Huawei Telecom.  You have said for many years that China has been stealing our intellectual property for years.  </p><p>Listen to this exchange I have got to get your reaction to, Andy Purdy from Huawei.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You just said there have been no major issues around Huawei.</p><p>But, in fact, over the last year, years, several years, I can cite a list of companies that have sued you and you have done settlements with, Motorola Solutions, T-Mobile, Cisco.</p><p>All of those companies sued Huawei for stealing trade secrets.  </p><p>ANDY PURDY, HUAWEI CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER:  There have been no major cybersecurity incidents in the world involving Huawei.  </p><p>That industry and the fact that we have had some lawsuits in the past has characterized the industry for the last 20 years.  We have resolved those issues, and we're moving forward.  The remaining issues, we hope to resolve in the next year or so.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andy, it's not accurate to say that there were no issues around Huawei, when you had lawsuits for stealing trade secrets.  Huawei settled a lawsuit with Motorola Solutions for stealing trade secrets.  </p><p>You settled a lawsuit with Cisco for stealing router trade secrets.  So are you saying that, yes, these issues and lawsuits went on in the past, and we settled them, and now we're not going to steal anymore?  Is that what you're saying?  </p><p>PURDY:  I'm saying two things.  </p><p>I'm saying that, but I'm also saying there have been no major cybersecurity incidents in the world in the 170 countries in which we do business.  Our customers trust us around the world.  And we believe there are additional mechanisms that can be done, so we can provide assurance and transparency, so that we can help make the -- America benefit from us being allowed to compete.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand that you are on this P.R. trip today, and you have this whole-page ad in The Journal.  And I agree that Huawei needs to convince the world that we can actually trust the products of the company.</p><p>But to say there have been no issues with Huawei is just 100 percent inaccurate.  I just listed the number of companies that have sued you for stealing trade secrets and the settlements that you have done.  </p><p>PURDY:  Maria, I didn't disagree with the facts of those cases.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there you go.</p><p>What do people need to understand about Huawei and China?  </p><p>NUNES:  Like all major companies in China, they're owned by the Chinese Communist Party.  They're owned by the leadership.  </p><p>Huawei especially is one of the largest.  They are developing connections across the entire globe, the entire communications network around the globe, so that they can have -- they can suck up anyone's e-mails, phone calls, text messages.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>NUNES:  That's what they're working on.</p><p>And any of the countries that allow Huawei to come in and put in the backbone of their architecture, they're absolutely crazy, because everything from their government is going to be headed straight to Chinese intelligence.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have a report here by IPVM.  And they call themselves the leading researcher on all video -- all things video cameras.  </p><p>They report that Huawei Telecom components are currently in 60 percent of all video cameras across the world.  That's -- I don't want to be an alarmist, but that tells me that China is not just listening to us.  They're watching us.  </p><p>NUNES:  Well, and don't forget, the big tech companies are able to do that too.</p><p>And so -- but, as it relates to Huawei, the challenge is, this is not a private company, as much as it is a government-owned company from the Chinese communists.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>I want to ask you about the so-called Confucius centers, because you and I have spoken about this in the past.  But there was a new Senate investigation.  And they're warning that these Chinese state-run centers are at -- in more than 100 U.S. colleges.  </p><p>You have got Confucius centers in and around Silicon Valley, like near Stanford.  They're sharing research.  What do you make of Confucius centers?  </p><p>NUNES:  Well, I would say first that Senate report that you referred to, great report done by Senator Portman and his team.  </p><p>It's not just the 100 universities that they're involved in.  It's what they do there, right?  So they're bringing in what are likely either intelligence officers or people that are working with Chinese intelligence.  </p><p>They're doing -- they're seeding people into companies.  They're recruiting people.  These are all things that are in this Senate Intelligence -- or the Senate report by Rob Portman that I would encourage all of your viewers to go and take a Sunday and read it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not only that, but China has an enormous amount of money.  So they're buying up companies, like energy companies and banks, and getting American data that way too, another way to...</p><p>NUNES:  And that's a whole 'nother -- yes.  And they're doing that all over the globe, which that could be a whole show just on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's great to have you on the program.</p><p>NUNES:  Thank you.  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Congressman Devin Nunes joining us.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-583943</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJM-3CR1-DY7X-Y52Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4612\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal News Service, Inc.

Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, July 10th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All eyes on Fed chief Jay Powell today. It is day one of his two-day testimony getting underway this morning in front of Congress. Investors are awaiting any hints or suggestions towards a rate cut in the future. We'll be watching closely, and parsing through the words.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ahead of the testimony, futures are pointing to a lower opening for stock prices this morning. Dow futures down 65. S&amp;P futures down 7. And the Nasdaq futures down about 20 points.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a mixed day yesterday on Wall Street. The Dow edged was lower, while the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P finished with modest gains. As you can see the Nasdaq, the best performer up 43 points. All three major indices less than 1 percent below their all-time record highs.</p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks are edging lower. Investors there also waiting on Powell. European markets are down, with the FT down 6, CAC 40 down 1, and the Dax index in Germany down 62.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed moves there as well -- take a look. Pretty much fractional moves. Worst performer was Shanghai -- China down almost half a percent.</p><p>More signs of an economic slowdown meanwhile in China. The producer price index for June came up showing no growth from a year earlier, no inflation on the producer side there.</p><p>Border crisis -- arrests at the border decline sharply as Mexico steps up efforts as part of the deal with the United States.</p><p>And a major ruling on Twitter, a court says that President Donald Trump cannot block critics from his account.</p><p>Now Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is facing a lawsuit of her own. Wait until you hear this one.</p><p>Plus the frightening moment on a Delta flight: an engine fails, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing mid-flight. We have the very latest.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PWC Mitch Roschelle, and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Good to be here. I know Dagen touched on this earlier, but the independence of the Fed, and Jerome Powell reiterating that in his testimony, is going to be extremely important, I think. Because look at the trend you're seeing.</p><p>We saw in Mexico the finance chief resigned. In Turkey granted, you know, there have been questions about their central banking policies for some time, got fired by the President.</p><p>And so what we're seeing is a politicalization of these central banks and that is something that the fed wants to stay away from.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you don't want to see that at all.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: And to think -- go ahead, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: No. And -- no, I was just going to point out that Nick Timiraos, who writes about the Federal Reserve for the \"Wall Street Journal,\" writes an extensive piece about there is bipartisan support for Jay Powell on the -- broadly speaking.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Within Congress.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Whether it's say John Kennedy says I think that Powell has done a, quote, \"damn good job\"; Senator Richard Shelby. So there's a lot support for him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Also worth noting from the \"Journal\" is the Boeing story. Boeing poised to lose its place as the world's largest plane maker to Airbus -- after a reign of number one for seven years. This is what these crashes have done and this really underperformance in terms of the 737 Max.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I think there's 150 them that are sort of in limbo that were ordered and not delivered because of the issue. So that's a big -- that's the most popular plane they sell.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Boeing's stock has really taken a hit on all of that meanwhile.</p><p>Coming up this morning, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff is here, Marc Short joining us this morning, along with Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. Former economic advisor under President George W. Bush Ed Lazear is here. Along with House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, professional golfer Cristie Kerr joining us as well.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it, we've got a big two hours.</p><p>And our top story this hour, escalating tensions in Tehran. The U.S. Is looking to create a coalition of allies to patrol waters around Iran and Yemen. It comes amid a new bipartisan alliance to block President Trump from going to war with Iran without congressional approval.</p><p>Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz teaming up with Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna to introduce this bill following President Trump's comments he does have the power to strike Iran without an ok from Congress.</p><p>Congressman Gaetz defending the amendment yesterday. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R), FLORIDA: Our amendment stands against the proposition of endless wars. The Khanna-Gaetz legislation would require any president to come back to the Congress after 60 days, and particularly that would apply in the conflict that we could potentially see with Iran.</p><p>I don't believe that a 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force is applicable in the year 2019 or beyond. I think we need to update the conditions and terms where we would send America's bravest patriots into battle, and I think we can do that here..</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And joining me right now is the Florida congressman himself, a member of both the House Judiciary and Armed Services Committees, Matt Gaetz. Congressman it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GAETZ: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Does that thinking, that sentiment also hold true if Iran attacks the United States?</p><p>GAETZ: No. Under the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can the United States just go back at Iran if it attacks it without going to Congress, my question.</p><p>GAETZ: Of course, even if we saw Iran preparing an attack we would maintain first strike capabilities under the current War Powers Act, the President can maintain a conflict for 60 days.</p><p>Our issue is that no President should be able to keep our country in war for months or years without ever coming back to the Congress. That's just not what the constitution says.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I understand that. So as a member of the armed services committee, how serious is this threat from Iran -- Congressman?</p><p>GAETZ: It's very serious. Iran engages in malign influence all over the globe. We see that they continue to enrich uranium, it's noteworthy that they're nowhere near weapons grade uranium in that enrichment process now. But if Iran were to break to the bomb, obviously we would have to build an international coalition to resist that outcome.</p><p>As we sit today, I don't believe that it's the obligation of the United States to avenge Emirati or Qatari's oil or a robot with blood. And that's why I don't think that the war hawk calls for conflict at this moment are well-founded. I think the President's strategy has worked very effectively with Iran. I think he's pulled us back from the brink of war, and hopefully now we're building a stronger international coalition.</p><p>We see the Brits more engaged, seizing that Iranian oil that was headed to Syria in the port of Gibraltar. And I think that ultimately we will bring Iran back to the table without bloodshed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you think that the Europeans will align with the United States against Iran because, you know, with these waivers in place, Europe is still trying to get its oil and gas from Iran, still in business there, not wanting to, you know, shake the boat.</p><p>GAETZ: Well, the President's maximum pressure campaign is what has brought us to this moment. I agree with Senator Rubio, Senator Cruz and Senator Cotton, who have urged the administration not to grant waivers to companies but to keep that pressure on.</p><p>I think the fact that you saw Britain seize that Iranian oil that was headed to Syria through Gibraltar shows that there is resolve within Europe because, look, this is Europe's problem too. There's nobody in Europe who wants to see Iran obtain a nuclear weapon.</p><p>But Iran getting a nuclear weapon is precisely what was going to happen under the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal. It was just going to take a little longer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So let me ask you about this breaking news hitting the tape this morning. U.K. Ambassador to the United States, Sir Kim Darroch, has resigned. This follows the leaked e-mails where he was critical of the Trump administration.</p><p>This is the cover story of the \"Financial Times\" this morning that yesterday the President tweeted about him, saying this wacky ambassador that the U.K. foisted upon the United States, is not someone who we're thrilled with, a very stupid guy. I don't know the ambassador but have told he's a pompous fool.</p><p>Today we see he's actually resigning. What's your reaction to this? And tell me what you think of Kim Darroch.</p><p>GAETZ: Yes. Well, it was pretty dumb for the former ambassador to be making those comments about the Trump administration as America is enjoying some of our greatest prosperity and success, certainly in my lifetime. And I think that the fact that we are still working so closely together on Iran and other issues in the world shows that the U.S., United Kingdom relationship is enduring beyond the enduring beyond the personality of one ambassador. And I'm sure when they send someone else to fill that role, that we'll be right back working together as we always did.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. By the way, it's the cover of the \"Financial Times\" this morning on this story after the President's tweets.</p><p>Let me ask you about digging deeper here. A House panel is voting week on whether to subpoena a list of current and former Trump administration officials, Congressman, including senior advisers to the President Jared Kushner, former national security advisor Michael Flynn, former attorney general Jeff Sessions, former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and former White House chief of staff John Kelly.</p><p>What's happening here? I know you have been knee-deep --</p><p>GAETZ: It's nuts, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm sorry.</p><p>GAETZ: It's totally nuts. I think my Democratic colleagues can't take a hint. They can't take a hint that the country is ready to move on from the Mueller report. The Democrats in Congress view the Mueller report as a screenplay that they're trying to bring to life in the form of a movie by bringing all these people back to sort of reenact their various lines and contributions.</p><p>But it is preposterous to suggest that a dozen or so Democrats in Congress are going to be able to get more than Robert Mueller got after 22 months, $30 million, dozens of prosecutors and FBI agents, thousands of witness statements. I think that we can all rest assured that there was no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p><p>Now let's get on to serving the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well you're on Judiciary -- what do you want to ask Robert Mueller when and if he does come down to testify? Because we know that Christopher Steele has been under scrutiny.</p><p>We know that the investigating of the investigators is in full mode. You've got William Barr looking at it. You've got, you know, John Durham looking at it, in terms of what happened early in 2016 and how that cabal of individuals tried to put their finger on the scale to stop Donald Trump. Where is that investigation? Where does that stand today -- Congressman?</p><p>GAETZ: Well, we see that the Attorney General has put an intense amount of focus on ensuring that this type of corruption never happens again in our country to any other president. When it comes to Mr. Mueller's testimony, I think we've got a lot of questions about bias, about how he assembled this team.</p><p>I think we also want to know why he flipped the expectation that Americans are innocent until proven guilty. It seemed as though Mr. Mueller thought that people were guilty unless he was able to clear them. And I think we've got a lot of questions about that as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier, obviously has been scrutinized, reportedly grilled by the Justice Department officials in a 16-hour interview last month. The interview apparently was credible enough to extend the Russia investigation.</p><p>So where are we on this? Do you think we're going to see accountability here? We know that the FBI was told by the number two person in Europe that Christopher Steele's information was not credible, and yet they still used that dossier to get a FISA warrant to spy on American citizens because they were part of the Trump campaign, Congressman.</p><p>GAETZ: Yes. We even saw reporting that the British government itself had given information to representatives of the United States indicating that Christopher Steele was not credible, that he was working on false information from Russians, and that he was simply trying to meet an election day deadline with this information and that it wasn't fully vetted or checked out and was largely intended to influence the election.</p><p>This gets back to Mueller. Why did Robert Mueller not investigate the Russians who were trying to influence the United States election by putting flawed information into this Steele dossier that then resulted in the politization of our intelligence community. Those are reasonable questions and I think that we need institutional reform so that we don't allow the intelligence community to be politicized against political adversaries.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When do you think Robert Mueller knew there was no collusion? Because there's this theory out there the he knew that there was no collusion months before he actually announced it and he just sat on it so that the midterm elections would come and go.</p><p>GAETZ: We knew from the beginning. If you look at the text messages and communications between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, ten months into the investigation, the lovers were texting each other that there's no there there. And in Lisa Page's deposition, she said they were talking about the fact that there lacked any evidence suggesting a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia</p><p>So there was never evidence that suggested that this was the case and I think largely it was intended to distract from the fact that you had Russia trying to discredit democracy itself by undermining President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So do you think Robert Mueller is going to be asked that when he testifies in a week?</p><p>GAETZ: I'm certain of it. I'm absolutely certain of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You're certain of it. Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>GAETZ: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Matt Gaetz joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Twitter lawsuit, a judge's decision about President Trump's social media presence, having immediate implications on another outspoken lawmaker -- details coming up.</p><p>And then engine failure, a Delta flight forced to land after scary moments in the sky. More dramatic video coming up.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Funeral services for former Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca being held today.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: It will be quite a tribute -- Maria.</p><p>Lee Iacocca was going to be remembered at a funeral mass in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Before, of course, leading Chrysler, Iacocca created the iconic Ford Mustang, helped launch the Minivan, the Chrysler K car and the Ford Escort. Iacocca saved Chrysler from bankruptcy back in 1980. He died last Tuesday. He was 94 years old.</p><p>Well, some sky-high terror to show you. Incredible video taken by a Delta passenger shows a pretty badly damaged plane engine which forced an emergency landing this week.</p><p>Now, you can see the loose engine cone rattling, bouncing around on the mouth of the engine, tough to see. Passengers reported that the entire cabin filled with smoke as a result of this. The flight was en route from Atlanta to Baltimore. It had to land in Raleigh, North Carolina. No reports of any injuries, luckily.</p><p>And then there is this. It's the end of the road for hippies, surfers, the Beetle -- it's over, folks. Volkswagen is going to stop making the iconic Beetle with the last one rolling off the assembly line today in the company's plant in Mexico. Volkswagen says the plant is now going to focus on making a compact SUV.</p><p>And Maria -- I will say, if you're aboard a plane and you lose an engine, you only need the other engine to work -- just to comfort everybody out there. Those jets can fly with one engine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, ok.</p><p>CASONE: Just in case you just see an engine go out on your plane.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good information -- thank you.</p><p>CASONE: You're always going to worry about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You're right. You're right.</p><p>Well, there is a census fight that is deepening. Coming up a judge striking a blow against the Trump administration's citizenship question. The legal battle is next.</p><p>And then entrepreneur hotspots. Austin comes in at number two as one of the best cities for startups. Number one is coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>So the citizen question battle goes on. A federal judge in New York blocking the Justice Department from switching out its lawyers handling of a renewed effort to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census. President Trump responded to the ruling, tweeted this, \"So now the Obama appointed judge on the census case, are you a citizen of the United States, won't let the Justice Department use the lawyers that it wants to use. Could this be a first?\"</p><p>House Democrats are now preparing to schedule a vote on holding the Attorney General and the Commerce Secretary in contempt for not cooperating with subpoenas and congressional investigations looking into the origins of the citizenship question.</p><p>Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>Judge -- these subpoenas are so ridiculous in my view. I mean, they're trying to subpoena something to say what's the origin of the question. I mean they just want to fight the Trump administration on every turn.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: There's no question that they want to fight the Trump administration on every turn. But the wording of the statute that allows the census bureau to add questions other than how many people live here requires the Census Bureau to give a rational basis, a reason for the question.</p><p>So when the challengers and the DOJ representing the Census Bureau, the challenges to the census question and the DOJ asked a representative from the Commerce Department what is the rational basis, what is the reason for this? Wilbur Ross refused to give an answer and sent instead a bureaucrat, unfamiliar with the President's thinking and unfamiliar with Secretary Ross' thinking. And what did the bureaucrat say? To enforce the Voting Rights Act.</p><p>Well, the reason the courts don't believe this is because the Census Department has nothing to do with the Voting Rights Act. The Voting Rights Act only applies in eight states. It doesn't apply in the other 42 states of the United States. So that is not a believable reason. That is the reason the Supreme Court ruled as it did.</p><p>Fast forward a week later. The DOJ brass reads the Supreme Court opinion. The Commerce Department brass reads the Supreme Court opinion and said we lost. The case is over, the Supreme Court has rules, we're not going to put the question on. Start the presses rolling and print these forms.</p><p>The President hears the lawyers say to the judge, \"Judge, we lost so the case is over. We're going to start printing the forms.\" The President goes that's fake news. It was his own justice department saying it to a judge in lower Manhattan.</p><p>After that happened, the lawyers resigned from the case. 11 lawyers on one case in the DOJ. The top experts on administrative law and the census. They all resigned from the case. The DOJ attempted to replace them and yesterday the judge said you can't replace them.</p><p>Now, does the public really care who the lawyers are representing the federal government in a case? Yes, if the lawyers think their client is not being truthful to them and if their client is the federal government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But when we go back to the actual origins of the story, the question is are you a U.S. Citizen? Shouldn't that be in the census?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, you know, it's a long history --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean really.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It was in in 1950. It was then in in 1960.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's the purpose of the census?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: To count persons. The constitution only allows one question. How many people reside there? Federal statute in my view in defiance of the constitution allows ancillary questions if the answers will help the government to do its job.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And we need to point out that the Supreme Court essentially said that the Commerce Secretary has the right to add this question but you have to give us a legitimate reason as to why.</p><p>This all falls on Wilbur Ross' shoulders, quite frankly.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He fouled up.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is the holding up the soup can incident --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, you're exactly right -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- trying to say don't you worry your pretty little head about your soup going up because of the steel and aluminum tariffs. It's a foul- up on behalf of the Commerce Secretary.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: So what is -- what is the rational basis for it and why don't they just articulate what the rational basis is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: In one of the President's tweets he said, \"Ok, let's be honest. We want to know who's a citizen is for reapportionment purposes. The DOJ told two judges five times that reapportionment has nothing to do with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: So it's a major setback for the Attorney General and for the Department of Justice and for the President. In fact, it's such a setback that in my view the President's going to sign an executive order very soon, perhaps in 48 hours in order to attempt to bypass the courts. I don't think that will work. I think the injunction will prevent him from enforcing it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just really because Carlos Gutierrez backed up what would be the Democrats' argument against putting the question on the census, saying it hurts the count. That people find out they're going to be asked whether they're a citizen or not, that illegal immigrants or even immigrants might not respond and Carlos Gutierrez seconded that yesterday.</p><p>I heard that directly from a census taker when I was part of the household survey for the unemployment rate years and years ago. She said that she always argued that -- she told me personally, it's very hard to count what the true unemployment rate is particularly among Latinos because even people who were here legally won't open the door if they hear you're from the federal government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And if the question is -- they just won't --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- they just wont fill it up.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Here's a question. What does the census count? Does it count citizens? Does it count citizens and legal residence? Does it count all persons? Answer, it counts all persons and that's the basis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I've got to switch gears -- I've got to switch gears and to you about social media because a federal appeals court says that President Trump cannot block Twitter followers. Now Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez is facing a lawsuit of the same issue. She is blosking followers all the time. And now the President can't block followers.</p><p>There's a summit at the White House for social media. You've got to believe that legislation conversation is going to come up against social media. It's sort of a whole ball of wax. But this one issue about the President not being able to block users -- your reaction.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, when the President said his social media statements are official government pronouncements, he made that a government Web site. And just as the government, the federal government itself cannot discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, he doesn't like a particular follower, Twitter follower of the President because that person criticizes him, just as the government can't do that, the President can't do it.</p><p>I don't know about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. If this is a government Web site, she can't discriminate. If it's a private Twitter account, she can. The President said this is not private, this is government. That forced him to keep it open to everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see what you're saying. So social media summit at the White House this week is going to a platform for supporters, writes the \"Wall Street Journal\" today, for the potential legislation. When I had the President on last week, a week and-a-half ago, he called into the show, I said, look, do you want to see competition, would that be a better outcome in terms of leveling the playing field.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'm going to guess he said yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He said you're going to have to see legislation to lead to competition. It looks like legislation is coming for social media.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Legislation may come to enhance competition. Being a free market person, competition always lowers the price -- there's no price, but improves the product.</p><p>However the decision yesterday to say you can't pick ands choose who followers are going to be when you run a government Web site is based on the First Amendment. No legislation can interfere with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Two issues here in terms of that story and the legislation for social media. We know Devin Nunes is suing Twitter for shadow banning, et cetera. We know that the President said that he's unfairly treated on social media. Do you think we're going to see legislation?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Probably.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I think so.</p><p>Probably that's what the President said, probably.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Some of the big tech companies want legislation because they're going to capture the regulators and make it impossible to compete - -</p><p>BARTIROMO: If they're not overseen like media companies, right Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Nope, you can't sue them for defamation. I think that they lose that legal protection. I think one of the first things that would happen is they would lose that legal protection.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: So we are seeing a little bit of a crack in the wall with respect to Amazon. It used, it's another story you asked me to be prepared for this morning. You couldn't sue Amazon if the product you bought at Amazon was defective. You would have to sue the manufacturer of that product. Third circuit court of appeals ruled two days ago you can now sue Amazon for that defective product.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All the other retailers wanted it to go that way, by the way.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Of course.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They thought Amazon gets a free ride.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Judge -- good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Pleasure -- guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>Quick break. And then a lot to come, the border crisis, Vice President Mike Pence visiting the southern border this Friday. I'll be speaking with his chief of staff, Marc Short, next. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, July 10. Your top stories right now, 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell on the hot seat today. It is day one of his two-day testimony. It is getting underway in just a few hours. His prepared remarks will come out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. That's when the embargo will lift. So that may very well be the time that markets move. We will have those remarks for you at 8:30, one hour from now. We will bring them to you.</p><p>Ahead of the testimony, Futures are pointing to a lower opening. Take a look, Futures indicating the Dow will open down 57 points, S&amp;P down six and the NASDAQ down 15.</p><p>This after a mixed story on Wall Street yesterday. All three major indices less than one percent below their record highs despite really fractional moves yesterday. The NASDAQ up 43 points, that was the best performer.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mixed. The European Indices are edging lower. Take a look, the CAC Quarante is higher in Paris by three points but the FT-100 in London down four point and the DAX Index in Germany lower by 52.</p><p>In Asia overnight mixed performances there as well. As you can see, fractional moves across the board.</p><p>More signs of an economic slowdown in China. The producer price index for June showed no growth from a year earlier in China.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, crisis at the border, Vice President Mike Pence is headed to the border this Friday along with a bipartisan group of Senators. His visit taking place amid a growing outcry over conditions at migrant detention centers. But the Department of Homeland Security says there's been a 28 percent decline in border enforcement action since May. Of course, many are attributing that to Mexico's input.</p><p>Joining me right now is the chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, Marc Short. Marc, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MARC SHORT, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE'S CHIEF OF STAFF: Thanks for having me on Maria, good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What should we expect from the vice president's trip to the border, what is he looking for in terms of priorities?</p><p>SHORT: Well Maria, what we've seen obviously in the last several months is a -- is a historic crisis at the border where you have literally over a million migrants will be apprehended at the border this year, in part because of how great the economy is.</p><p>We've had over six million jobs created since Donald Trump was elected, over 600,000 construction jobs is creating a magnet for people wanting to get jobs here. But the challenge is we don't have the resources right now to safeguard and protect our border and that's what we're trying to work on to fix.</p><p>What you're going to see the vice president do is take a group, bipartisan as you said, Senate Judiciary Committee down to the detention centers and really highlight what is happening inside there, because candidly Maria, there's just been such a gross mischaracterization of what's happening.</p><p>When Democrats go down and talk about concentration camps, I mean, Maria, concentration camps are what Nazi's used to gas Jewish children to death. What you're seeing on our border is law enforcement actually going to the desert to protect the lives of migrants, bring them into safe shelter and help (inaudible) for the children, help to find foster care in the United States. The comparisons and the rhetoric is just absolutely absurd.</p><p>And so, the president asked the vice president to go down to the border and showcase to the American people what is actually happening in those centers and that's what we look forward to sharing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that is so wrong that there's such a mischaracterization. I actually spoke with a number of border sources, because I took my show to the border a couple of months ago and what we saw was just stunning.</p><p>And I spoke with them before and after AOC went down there and after the meeting they told me that is was hostile from the get-go. She doesn't believe anything, she questions everything. When she went to the detention center she said that people were drinking from the toilets, which was absolutely not true, a lie.</p><p>So, I mean, it's good that the vice president is going to be with the Senate Judiciary folks, because the public needs to hear the truth. I mean, these pictures you're looking at right now are of children having crossed the border on their own. It was really so sad to see how many kids are being put into dangerous situations because of these loopholes.</p><p>SHORT: Right Maria, so that's the other part of the trip that the vice president will try to highlight, is that we still need more help from Congress. As you mentioned in the lead-in, we've had more assistance from Mexico in the last month than we've had from Congressional Democrats in 10 years in trying to secure our border.</p><p>The 28 percent decline is really attributed to Mexico. We have so many challenges in our laws, where -- and one of the things that the vice president and Secretary Pompeo helped negotiate last month with Mexico, is a Remain in Mexico policy. Many of your viewers may not know this, other than Mexican rule that says if you're not from Mexico we can't return you back, we have to keep you here in the United States and go through the adjudication process.</p><p>So, the Remain in Mexico policy that Mexico has allowed us to pursue will keep the migrants in Mexico as they seek asylum claims here in the United States, which I think will help to protect some of the flow as well.</p><p>But there's no doubt that our border and our facilities are overburdened. That's why it's not just the last couple months the administration has tried to bring attention to this, the very first budget Donald Trump submitted to Congress asked for more resources for more beds in our facilities, back in his second month of the presidency and Democrats have consistently refused to give us those resources. So, we're trying to draw more attention to it to say, we continue to need additional resources here to fix the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But what's the answer when you pose that question? I mean, they say that they want an end to the chaos and they say that they want an end to what they're calling disastrous conditions, and yet they won't agree to provide more beds.</p><p>SHORT: That's exactly the conundrum we're trying to shed light on Maria, and we hope that we'll be able to in the coming months to show that more. I think the challenge is the far left the Democrat Party believes, that if they're giving more beds, it allows the Trump Administration to detain more migrants. But the reality is, it also provides us the ability to have more humanitarian assistance to provide facilities for those coming across our border.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SHORT: And we do hope to, again, shed light on it, be more transparent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Marc, let me move on to China, because the U.S.-China trade talks are obviously slow going. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer spoke over the phone yesterday with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and Vice President Pence is set to give a speech today about USMCA. Let's talk first USMCA, is it going to come down to the floor for a vote?</p><p>SHORT: We think it will, Maria. We're optimistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When?</p><p>SHORT: Ambassador Lighthizer's had very good conversations with Speaker Pelosi and he's earned a lot of trust from Congressional Democrats. I think that the reality is, it's more likely to happen this fall.</p><p>We were certainly hopeful it would be happening this summer, but we're going to remain encouraged and we're going to keep pushing for this. When you see the Vice President travel, as he has today, he's going to Congressional Democrat districts that need this trade deal for their own constituents. It creates jobs and commerce, so today he'll be going out to San Joaquin Valley, going to agricultural district represented by a Democrat, for when that district a lot of their agricultural produce is exported to Mexico and to Canada, and so we'll be making the case. This is all the more reason you need to help put additional pressure on Speaker Pelosi to bring this to the floor for a vote, because we think if it's brought to the floor it has the votes to pass. But likely it's going to look more like this fall I think at this point, Maria, than the summer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and so what about China? Is the president -- does the vice president want a deal to get done with China or the fact that they have reneged on some of the most important big ticket items, is that a -- is that a deal killer?</p><p>SHORT: Well, I think we're all encouraged since the G20 those conversations have opened back up the president's encouragement with the Chinese premiere.</p><p>But let's keep in mind that for decades I think American presidents have been led with a notion that if we get open access to markets you can see all these other freedoms flourish in China, and that has not been the case. They continue to repress religious minorities. They don't allow all the freedoms we enjoy in western democracies, but additionally they've cheated and lied on a lot of the trade deals. This administration, this president said we're not going to tolerate that anymore.</p><p>And so, what they've been I think reluctant to is agree to many of the enforcement provisions that this administration is trying to into put into these trade agreements, which I think are necessary because you've seen China steal intellectual property, you've seen them force the transfer of ownership, and this administration's not going to allow that anymore and we're going to reset the relationship.</p><p>We're encouraged the negotiations have restarted. We're hopeful there'll be a deal, but as the president said, it's not that we need a deal. We want to get a deal, but the reality is that many manufacturing companies are already leaving China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SHORT: That I think they're facing more pressure right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but do they -- does the U.S. have an alliance? I mean, do you think that there is a plan B in terms of doing a deal with Vietnam, the Philippines, and the regional players there if in fact, there's no deal?</p><p>SHORT: I think you're going to continue to see the administration look to strike trade deals on an individual basis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>SHORT: That's what the president said. He didn't like the multilateral deals. He's basically been negotiating individual deals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He says he wants bilaterals, and the last time he joined us -- he joined me on the show a week and a half ago, he said that he's talking to Japan, talking to India, so we're waiting on more developments there.</p><p>Look, there was breaking news earlier this hour about the U.K. The U.K. Ambassador to the United States has now resigned. This follows that leaked e-mail where he was critical of the Trump administration and the president hit back, said he was a pompous fool. What's behind this?</p><p>SHORT: Well Maria, I think the reality is that his effect in this has certainly been limited based upon the news coverage, so we're glad to see that he's resigned and we look forward to working with the new ambassador.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me about the vice presidential trip to New Hampshire abruptly cancelled last week, Marc, without any explanation. Do you --</p><p>SHORT: Maria, it's one of those things that I'm not able to talk to you about today. But again, I think that as the president indicated, we'll have more information on that in the coming weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. In terms of the trip coming up, you've got the border trip on Friday with the vice -- with the vice president's going to the border. Tell me his priorities going into 2020 in terms of legislation. Is it more economic stimulus? Is it social media? Where does the vice president see the priorities going into this new election?</p><p>SHORT: Well Maria, the vice president's priorities are the president's priorities, and I think that right now at Congress we think the biggest opportunity is getting a trade deal done with the United States, with Mexico, and Canada. And so, that will be our primary push throughout this fall.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you said that you think the bill comes to the floor for a vote in the fall?</p><p>SHORT: We're optimistic that we'll get there this fall, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you think -- and you -- do you think it's going to pass?</p><p>SHORT: Again, we think that it has the votes. There's enough -- the reality is that there are 31 congressional Democrats residing in districts that Donald Trump won in 2016. But more importantly, those are districts that are creating enormous number of manufacturing jobs in the auto industry or agricultural jobs because we've now provided, let's say, additional access to dairy farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota.</p><p>And so, we think that votes are there on a bipartisan basis to pass it, but there still needs to be, I think, some additional work with Speaker Pelosi because she holds the keys about when she gets to bring it to the floor for a vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, of course. All right, some important piece of legislation. Marc, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>SHORT: Thanks for having me on, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Marc Short this morning at the White House.</p><p>Coming up, battle in the skies, Airbus makes gains on Boeing to become the world's largest plane maker. What it means for jobs in America, coming up.</p><p>And then, gender reveal gone way wrong. A planned celebration headed south very fast. What happened? When we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Boeing is about to lose its title as the world's biggest plane maker to rival Airbus. Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. The rise of Airbus follows the grounding of Boeing's 737 Max jets after two deadly crashes. Boeing said the deliveries of commercial jetliners fell by more than a third in the first half of 2019 from a year ago. Deliveries of the Boeing 737 Max jet were suspended back in March. The aerospace giant is still working on changes to the plane's flight controls and more importantly that software. Boeing has been the top plane maker for the last seven years.</p><p>Well, head west if you want to launch a successful startup. It's the finding of software company Volusion which analyzed the 2017 census to come up with the best location for a fledgling business to survive. So the winner, best place Washington States, specifically the Seattle, Tacoma, Bellevue area, earned an entrepreneurship score of 99. About two percent of sale startups received venture capital funding Austin, Texas, big tech hub obviously down there coming in second followed by San Jose. Rounding out the top five, Nashville, Tennessee and Denver, Colorado.</p><p>Well, it was a gender reveal that took a really bad turn in Australia. Look at this. A driver apparently spinning out to make blue smoke only to have the car burst into flames and the smoke went black, oh yes. The driver escaped. The blue smoke quickly again as you can see there going black. The driver has been fined $1,000 and now can't drive for six months. An unfortunate turn of events. But it was a boy. If anybody wasn't clear on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl. Wow.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think it was crazy.</p><p>CASONE: One way to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Gender reveals, prom proposals, what else, Mitch?</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Well, those are the top of my list of profound stupidity that we got to get rid of.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stop acting like you're the first woman to ever conceive. I will say that to anybody who is pregnant on Instagram. And those from people on (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, quite the reveal there. All right, quick break and then the whiskey business, a world class golfer expanding her pallet. She's introducing us to the new spirit she's backing. She's coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Whiskey and golf. The British Open, the fourth and final major of the golf season now just over a week away. Rory McIlroy and Brooks Koepka among the favourites, some talk about Tiger Woods as well. This year the Open has a partnership with Loch Lomond Whiskey. Joining us right now is LPGA golfer and Loch Lomond ambassador, Cristie Kerr. Great to see you. Thank you so much for being here Cristie.</p><p>CRISTIE KERR, AMBASSADOR, LOCH LOMOND: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, tell us the connection and why you wanted to back this whiskey and be this ambassador?</p><p>KERR: Well, we've been in the wine business since 2008. Actually '06 was our first vintage of curvature with our Kerr seller's partnership, we -- well, I'm studying to be a sommelier. So, sommeliers know about whiskey, they know about sake, they know a lot of different spirits. So, I went over to Scotland to play in the Scottish Open and went to the Loch Lomond distillery, saw they're cooperage, saw what they're doing there, saw that the reason was solera system of aging and I thought I really kind of geeked out about it and we just -- we just hit it off and formed a partnership.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's terrific. And you mentioned your wine business. You also have this wine business.</p><p>KERR: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How long have you been in the wine business?</p><p>KERR: We -- again, since '08, we've been in the wine business and with our curvature brand. And 2013 was our first vintage of the Kerr Reserve which got 93 points by wine spectator. So if anybody wants more information, you can go to KerrSellers.com and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The second biggest Pinot Noir in California.</p><p>KERR: Yes, this year with 95 points --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations, that's fantastic.</p><p>KERR: -- which this vintage of Scotch is 2002 and it's (INAUDIBLE) Pinot Noir barrels which is really awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Love it.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: And this vintage is very special to you, being a 2002. Tell us about that.</p><p>KERR: Yes, when we decided to do this partnership, they said what year really resonates with you. And I said, well, why don't we do the first win I ever had? The year that I won my first tournament, so 2002 is the vintage.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How great.</p><p>BELL: Amazing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Cristie, with the ticker tape parade for the women's soccer team going to happen in lower Manhattan today, technically not ticker tape any longer. What's it going to take for female athletes to get paid on the same footing as men, whether it's soccer or golf? What needs to happen if you've got one thing?</p><p>KERR: Well, that's a pretty loaded question. But you know, --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know. For a minute and --</p><p>KERR: You know, in all of sports, women's sports gets four to five percent of the spend from corporations. So I think it really is going to take those corporations to step up and see that women's golf and women's sports really has value. I mean, most household decisions are made -- a lot of them are made by women, at least 70 percent of the household financial decisions are made by women. So I think, you know, we have great corporations like CME Group, AIG, a lot of corporations that have stepped up. Evian has stepped up to --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's what I said earlier. I was like --</p><p>KERR: -- to raise the purses. So, we're getting there slowly but surely. But you have a lot of companies in men's golf that don't even spend a dime on women's golf.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Boo.</p><p>KERR: And I just don't think that's right. It is the dawn and age of the women and, you know, we're here.</p><p>BELL: Well said.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us what you're expecting from the Open?</p><p>KERR: Well, women's or men's?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Women's.</p><p>KERR: OK. Well, it's going to be in London this year so that's going to be pretty amazing. I mean, I played at Woburn before. It's a great test of golf. Hopefully the weather will be good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How about the men's? People talk about Tiger again.</p><p>KERR: Yes, well, Tiger's here and Royal Portrush is quite a venue. So everybody will be watching.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kristie, it's great to have you. Congrats.</p><p>KERR: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Cristie Kerr.</p><p>Still ahead, Jay Powell on the Hill, markets are watching as Fed chairman testifies before Congress later today. The embargoed comments out in 30 minutes.

Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining me exclusively right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" coming up, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is here on the impeachment inquiry and on what happened inside that explosive meeting between the president and Speaker Pelosi.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">House Intel Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes is here on the push to shed light on the secretive impeachment process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, Lindsey Graham responds to criticism from President Trump and the chaos in Syria, why he is leading the charge in Congress to hold Turkey accountable. The senator will be here. Plus, the Senate Judiciary chairman, how is he preparing for the possible impeachment trial?</p><p>Plus, more of my exclusive interview with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, this morning. Could pulling troops from Syria give Iran a new foothold in the Middle East?</p><p>Also with us, House Foreign Affairs Ranking Member Michael McCaul will join me exclusively.</p><p>All that and a lot more, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now.</p><p>And we begin this morning with that exclusive White House meeting last week between President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday.</p><p>The president tweeted out a photo from the Cabinet Room accusing Pelosi of having a meltdown. She also reportedly refused to read a letter Trump sent to Turkey's president demanding an end to the violence in Northern Syria.</p><p>Pelosi stormed out of the room with her colleagues, while Republicans continued their meeting with the president. Democrats say that the president was disrespectful to the speaker, while Republicans say the incident is part of a pattern with Pelosi.</p><p>Joining me right now is one of the lawmakers who was in the meeting, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.</p><p>Leader McCarthy, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Thank you for having me back on, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to get to the impeachment inquiry.</p><p>But, first, can you tell us what went on in that meeting? You were there. What took place?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, I have been in many of these meetings. This is a pattern of the speaker.</p><p>When she doesn't want to come to a solution, she really is unbecoming of a speaker, throws a fit, and then leaves the room. That's not a sign of a leader. A leader stays in the room and solves the problem.</p><p>But let me explain to you exactly what happened at the very beginning. The president starts the conversation. And this is a bipartisan, bicameral meeting. And he's landing a letter out that is a letter that he sent to the president of Turkey, Erdogan, about not entering that area, about protecting the Kurds.</p><p>As each elected official gathers that letter, they start to read it. They pause. It's something they have not seen before.</p><p>The speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi turns it over and, sitting directly across from the speaker -- the president -- sets it right down on the table to make a point to him that she's not going to listen to him.</p><p>And what's really creeping into all of this is impeachment. She couldn't put that aside for one moment to talk about the security of an issue that should be one person that we're all speaking together with one voice.</p><p>But it was impeachment. And if you watched her and Senator Schumer, they said the exact same thing over and over, until they felt they were at the moment that, on their own script, they were supposed to get up and walk away.</p><p>And the dirty little secret here, Maria, is, the other Democrats stayed in the room, and we had really a productive, normal meeting. The only common denominator that disrupted this all was the speaker of the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what are you going to do, as the leader of the GOP right now in the minority, if you can't get anything done, and it's all about impeachment?</p><p>Now, you sent a letter to Nancy Pelosi asking her 10 questions. You said that she only answered two of them. Tell me what you want to know and explain the impeachment process to us.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, first of all, we have to think and your viewers have to understand, what does impeachment mean?</p><p>Impeachment is the most serious thing that an elected official could almost do. It is removing an individual who was duly elected. So you shouldn't take this lightly. You shouldn't bring politics into it. And you should make sure you have a fair process.</p><p>In this letter I sent to the speaker of the House, laid out 10 questions. These aren't 10 questions that I made up. This is the process used for President Nixon and President Clinton.</p><p>Do you have due process? Is the president's attorney, counsel able to be in the room, cross-examine? Are they able to bring witness forward? And are both sides able to have a subpoena process?</p><p>And you know what happened? She only answered two of them. We have never taken a vote about impeachment inquiry. And the reason why that is so important, every American lends their voice for two years to their representative.</p><p>Right now, one person is having all of the power, instead of the people across America actually have a say in this process. And now they are bringing Adam Schiff, who has lied numerous times to the American public, in charge of this process?</p><p>And they are denying members of Congress from even being in the room or hearing the transcripts and reading them of what's being said. Adam Schiff controls who can come into the room.</p><p>So members who are on the committee aren't even -- on Judiciary Committee and others aren't even allowed in the room. And members who have to vote on this come down to the committee and they can't even read the transcripts? How is this fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, she came back to you and answered two questions, but she ignored the other questions? She said she's not going to bring it to the floor for a vote.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, she's not going to bring an impeachment inquiry, something we have always done in the past.</p><p>And remember what we're talking about. You're changing the fabric of the America. You're changing what democracy has said, only because of your own political views? That is what is wrong.</p><p>You want to trust democracy. And from a very important standpoint here, we need due process in this. A Republican speaker made sure this process happened with President Clinton. A Democrat speaker made sure this process happened with a Republican president.</p><p>So why can't she follow the same process with such a serious question that's before us? It's because she's letting politics play into it. Remember when she said we're going to move into impeachment injury? If she waited 48 hours until she read the transcripts of that phone call with President Trump and the president of Ukraine, we wouldn't even be in this mess.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: We already put America through a two-year nightmare, and they're trying to do it again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the two-year nightmare about collusion and President Trump, which then we learned definitively that wasn't the case.</p><p>Let me take you back to something you just said, because you said, after that meeting at the White House, that you went on to have a productive meeting, the Republicans and the Democrats, within that meeting at the White House.</p><p>Did you make a decision in terms of bringing the vote on sanctions on Turkey, given the fact that they did go into Syria and the chaos is still worsening today?</p><p>MCCARTHY: We had discussions. And it was Democratic senators and Democrat congressional members in the key committees.</p><p>We had a discussion that the president, with the secretary of defense, the general of Joint Chiefs, and it was a very open discussion, where people had differences of opinions, but they weren't yelling, they weren't getting up and walking away.</p><p>And what we really learned in that meeting was, the president was telling us his concerns, but also that you had the vice president, Mike Pence, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, landing in Turkey at that moment, trying to acquire a cease-fire, which they were successful at, a cease-fire that could save the Kurds' lives, give them time to actually move out, get a safe zone in there, and if we were to move on sanctions at that moment in time, without having that discussion, without having that knowledge, could have sent the wrong message and actually created a much difficult situation for us.</p><p>So it's important that we have these conversations with the Republicans, Democrats and the administration, not get up and walk away to run out to the stakes.</p><p>And if you watch them speaking at that podium, all three of them talking at the same time, it's almost as they choreographed this and it was always -- and if you listened to the final words, it was about impeachment.</p><p>And before the speaker of the House left the room, I listened to her, and she almost threatened the president. She didn't use the word impeachment, but you knew what she was talking about, when she said something to the extent, you just wait to see what we do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MCCARTHY: I mean, that is unbecoming of a speaker.</p><p>And, more importantly, that's not a real leader. A leader can have disagreements.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wait to see -- yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: And I have difference of opinion, but I stay in there to try to find a solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wait until you see what we will do.</p><p>All right, we want to take a break. I want to get your take on whether or not you want to see Adam Schiff step down. I know that there is a resolution which will be taken up this upcoming week.</p><p>More with Leader McCarthy when we come right back.</p><p>We're also going to talk about his meeting with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures, and on Instagram as well.</p><p>Stay with us. A lot more with a Leader Kevin McCarthy on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>I'm back with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.</p><p>Congressman, we were just talking about Turkey. Before we move on to Adam Schiff, because I want to ask you about that resolution this upcoming week, do you expect you will vote on sanctions against Turkey this upcoming week?</p><p>MCCARTHY: No, I do not believe we're going to vote on it, as I see the schedule going forward.</p><p>And what I think would be appropriate at this moment in time, to have the vice president and the secretary of state come and brief us on their meeting with President Erdogan and others and where we currently are in this situation, and what is the strategy going forward.</p><p>I think the administrative branch or the executive branch should come in and brief us, so we're all on the same page and have all the same information</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, let me move on to Adam Schiff and, of course, your colleagues bringing this resolution to try to censure Adam Schiff.</p><p>Where are we on that? And you're expecting that vote this upcoming week?</p><p>MCCARTHY: That will come up on Monday.</p><p>And why -- why we're doing this, remember, Intel Committee is different than any other committee. They have exclusive information that other members of Congress never get about intel and others.</p><p>To be the chairman of the committee -- and remember what this individual has done, Adam Schiff. First, he lied to the American public that he had proof beyond circumstantial evidence. And we went threw a two-year nightmare.</p><p>He then went on, and he lied when he sat as chairman of the committee of what he wanted to be in that phone call, but wasn't. It was so powerful that the speaker of the House on national television, with George Stephanopoulos, said what Adam Schiff said was correct, which would put us into jeopardy.</p><p>And now we find out that he lied to the American public when it came to the whistle-blower, that his staff actually met with him. He's become a fact witness.</p><p>And the Democrats have now put him in charge? So those are three times he's lied to the American public. And especially when they give the exclusive classified information, that we need to trust those individuals who on the Intel Committee, I think it's only proper that the House itself censure this individual.</p><p>And it'll be a real question for these Democrats. Would they not stand up for the truth, knowing and seeing and listening to this man continuing to lie to the American public?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, can anything come of that, though? You are in the minority.</p><p>I mean, let's say all of the Republicans vote for that. What does that mean in terms of actually removing Adam Schiff?</p><p>MCCARTHY: It has nothing to do about being a Republican or a Democrat.</p><p>This has to -- this has to be to the integrity and the truth of the individual themselves. This individual is given the responsibility to be the head of the Intel community -- Committee that actually sees the classified information that members of Congress never see, and he lies to the American public about it?</p><p>But, more importantly, he lies to his own members that put us in jeopardy. The very least we can do is censure him. That's not removing him from committee, which I'd like to do and I called for back in March, when he lied the first time.</p><p>But, at the very least, this goes to the honesty, the integrity of the House of the Representatives. If they cannot stand and censure him, when they knowingly look at him lying him three separate times to the American public and to the U.S. House of Representatives, it says a lot about they are putting politics before people, and they only care about impeachment, instead of standing for the truth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's very tough to look at what's happening in Washington today with the vitriol.</p><p>Do you expect anything legislatively to get done before 2020?</p><p>MCCARTHY: The Democrats have done nothing in this Congress.</p><p>And, Maria, you know this more than anybody, in your business sense. Here we are that Mexico and Canada have become our number one and number two traders. We have the United States, Mexico and Canada agreement sitting before us, where Mexico has ratified it, Canada has been sitting and waiting. And now they have an election today.</p><p>And we have a president negotiating with China, our number three trader, next month. We would only be stronger had we ratified this agreement with our top two traders sitting and negotiating with our number three trader.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>MCCARTHY: The only person that has the power for that to come up is the speaker of the House. And everybody knows, if she called it up, it would pass.</p><p>But she cares more about tearing this president down, instead of building this country up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's really a shame.</p><p>OK, real quick on Mark Zuckerberg. You met with him. There seems to be a feeling on both sides of the aisle that these companies, social media, are more powerful than they ever have been before. And you have been pushing this idea of the right to your knowledge of what they're doing with our data.</p><p>Tell me what's happening with Facebook and if you see any regulation coming in terms of big tech.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, Maria, I have to thank you, because you're one of the few that do call them out.</p><p>Big tech has become so powerful and so influential, that 95 percent of all searches go through Google. They have a certain amount of power. So we have called them out when they have tried to suppress conservative vote or conservative thought.</p><p>But something happened different last week. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, went to Georgetown. And he actually stood up for free expression. And we know free expression is still the best business model in the world.</p><p>And one thing that's happened, look what China just tried to do to the NBA commissioner. Tried to get a general manager fired for standing up for free speech of those in Hong Kong.</p><p>So, at the same time I call out big tech every time I see them trying to take away conservative speech...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: ... I just saw somebody stand up for free expression.</p><p>And it's -- we need to be fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: If Mark Zuckerberg is willing to make that stand, we should stand with him.</p><p>But we need to hold these companies accountable because of the influence. I remember what they did to the Republican Party in California. If you Googled the Republican Party two weeks before the election, they said our ideology was Nazism.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. That's right. Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: That's wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are going to talk to Devin Nunes about that. He's suing Twitter right now.</p><p>Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Kevin McCarthy there.</p><p>Coming up: chaos in Syria amid a shaky cease-fire deal.</p><p>My next guest vows to hold Turkey and President Trump accountable for the consequences. Senator Lindsey Graham is next right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The fighting is continuing in Northeast Syria this morning, as we are learning that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a congressional delegation are in Jordan this morning to discuss the crisis.</p><p>Well, here at home, the White House faces a bipartisan backlash over the decision to pull American troops from the region.</p><p>I spoke exclusively with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this past week on \"Mornings With Maria\" on FOX Business just before he left for Turkey to discuss America's national security interests and the danger of ISIS returning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I always go back to our first principles: What's the mission? What's the objective?</p><p>When we set about this now to lay down the President's national security strategy a couple years back, our mission set was very clear, to do counterterrorism all around the world in an effective way to protect the American people.</p><p>Our efforts in Syria, our efforts in West Africa, our efforts in the Philippines, all across the world have been aimed at that singular objective. It's what we're still focused on.</p><p>And so Syria is a small part of this. It's a small part of our Middle East strategy more broadly.</p><p>You and I, I think, have spoken a number of times about the world's largest state sponsor of terror, the Islamic Republic of Iran. This -- to focus singularly on what's taking place in a part of Syria neglects the true risk to the American people and how effective this administration has been at preventing that risk from impacting security for the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and I'm not disagreeing in terms of the effectiveness so far.</p><p>But is it not in the U.S.' national security interest to keep a small number of troops there to actually protect -- help the Kurds protect, for example, the oil fields?</p><p>I mean, if you've got Iran getting access to those oil fields, you and the administration have had Iran on its heels, and now, with Turkey invading, you're opening up these oil fields to the Iranians, giving them revenue to continue to support ISIS, not to mention the ISIS fighters being -- you know, being let out of these jails.</p><p>POMPEO: I've watched the world rally to push back against President Erdogan and the invasion that took place.</p><p>We should never mistake who the actor is that has caused this disruption there. It wasn't the United States. It wasn't the European countries that were there in Syria alongside of us. It was President Erdogan who is responsible for this instability.</p><p>We're now working to make sure -- and your point is well taken. There are oil fields a little bit further south that are very important, and I know the president is thinking about, with the recommendations from myself and the vice president, about how best to address that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But isn't it also true that we had a small number -- we have a small number of troops in Syria, and for the most part we are acting as the backup to the Kurds, we're helping them with armament and weaponry, we have not lost many people in the last five years?</p><p>And, granted, any life lost is too many, but when you consider the fact that it's really the Syrian Kurds that are doing the bulk of the fighting, the Syrian Kurds that are losing men and women, not the U.S.?</p><p>POMPEO: Every American life matters an awful lot, Maria, as you just said. I know we both value that. We're...</p><p>BARTIROMO: How many people have we lost? How many people have we lost in five years?</p><p>POMPEO: Yes, it's been more than any American would wish. Right?</p><p>I mean, Maria, I understand your point. Your point is well taken. But we need to make sure that we get this right, that we get the balance right, and I'm very confident that President Trump will do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I guess my biggest issue here is the strength of Iran.</p><p>And I feel like the administration had the Iranians on their heels and ruining the economy through sanctions, through this pressure campaign. And now we give up and leave Syria, and in effect, wrong those people who have been supporters and have been our partners, the Kurds, and open up this area to Iran.</p><p>POMPEO: Maria, I can assure you of this. The Islamic Republic of Iran is feeling the full might, the full pressure of the United States of America.</p><p>They were feeling it yesterday. They were feeling it a week ago. They will feel it months from now.</p><p>We've laid down the strategy, the ask, what it is we're hoping the Iranian regime will do, how they'll change their behavior. We are still fully committed to that, and I am confident that ultimately we will prevail.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: My next guest just spoke with President Trump last night about the objectives in Syria.</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham joins us. He is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p>And, Senator, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>Your reaction to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo?</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Well, no, it's a blessing to have him on the team. He's sort of the anchor tenet.</p><p>General Milley is doing a great job. Ambassador Jeffrey, who has the Syrian portfolio, is the best in the business. And we have got a really good team. The vice president did a terrific job.</p><p>So let me tell you where I think we are. Withhold judgment as to what's going to happen in Syria until it's all in. I am increasingly optimistic that we can have some historic solutions in Syria that have eluded us for years, if we play our cards right.</p><p>I blame Erdogan for the invasion, not Trump. But here is what the president told me over the weekend. Here are our objectives, to make sure we have a demilitarized zone between Turkey and the Kurds. The Kurds were the allies what helped us defeat ISIS. They lost 10,000 soldiers. We have lost eight in four years. God bless the eight, but it was the Kurds who did most of the fighting.</p><p>Protect our NATO ally Turkey from elements of the Kurds that they considered to be terrorists, a demilitarized zone occupied by international forces, no Americans, but we provide airpower.</p><p>The president appreciates what the Kurds have done. He wants to make sure ISIS doesn't come back. I expect we will continue to partner with the Kurds into Eastern Syria to make sure ISIS doesn't reemerge. That is in our national security interests, and we owe it to the Kurds.</p><p>The big thing for me is the oil fields. President Trump is thinking outside the box. I was so impressed with his thinking about the oil. Not only are we going to deny the oil fields falling into Iranian hands. I believe we're on the verge of a joint venture between us and the Syrian Democratic Forces, who helped destroy ISIS and keep them destroyed, to modernize the oil fields and make sure they get the revenue, not the Iranians, not Assad.</p><p>And it can help pay for our small commitment in the future. And protecting Israel is the number one objective. And we can do all of that with a very small force.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator, you...</p><p>GRAHAM: I'm increasingly optimistic this could turn out very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It could turn out very well.</p><p>This is completely different than what you have been saying all week. You have been a staunch criticizer of the president's move to pull all the troops out of Syria.</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You said, in fact, on this program just two weeks ago, if we abandon the Kurds, ISIS is going to come back and that there's an attack on our allies.</p><p>So, you have changed your mind based on what you have heard from the president last night?</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>I still believe that, if we abandon the Kurds, nobody helps you in the future. They have lost 10,000 fighters to destroy the caliphate. But there are 15,000 or 20,000 ISIS fighters running around in Syria and Iraq.</p><p>A small contingent of Americans providing airpower and capability will keep ISIS at bay and keep the jails locked up and the Kurds -- I mean, the ISIS fighters won't break out.</p><p>What I heard from the president was a very -- play the ball as you lie is a concept in golf. Well, after Erdogan's invasion, things have gotten scrambled in Syria.</p><p>But I see a way forward now that really, quite frankly, is historic, historic security for Turkey, historic security for the Kurds. A plan to keep ISIS down and out forever, and a chance to keep the oil fields in the hands of our allies, not our enemies, would be a hell of an outcome, and I think that's now possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you, Senator.</p><p>The president says that he wants the troops home, he doesn't want wars. And the American people, much of them, agree with him.</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why are we sending troops to Saudi Arabia then?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, because Saudi Arabia is an ally and Iran is an enemy.</p><p>And Iran is the biggest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet. They're trying to build a nuclear weapon. They are liars. They murdered their own people. They dismembered Lebanon and Yemen, and on and on and on. They have got American blood on their hand. They attacked the largest oil field in the world in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>And it's in our interests to make sure that oil field is protected and the world's economy doesn't plunge because of misadventures of Iran. That's why what President Trump is proposing in Syria, a joint venture dealing with the southern oil fields in Syria, between our allies, the Kurds and the Arabs who helped us destroy ISIS, is a historic change that could pay dividends for the region.</p><p>And, quite frankly, we could generate revenue to pay for our commitment in Syria, something we haven't been able to do.</p><p>So, the bottom line here is, you have got to play the ball where it lies. And if President Trump fulfills the objectives he laid out to me, then I think we can end Syria successfully.</p><p>And God bless all those who have fought to destroy ISIS.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>Well, that's breaking news this morning, Senator, that you actually do see a way forward after you have spoken with the president on his plan to secure those oil fields.</p><p>Thank you for that.</p><p>I want to switch gears real quick, before you go, because we got news this week...</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ... that the State Department concluded its investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private e-mail usage.</p><p>They have determined nearly 40 people committed violations. Are you going to be bringing anybody down to question, testimonies to find out what went on here? People would like accountability. And it seems like we never get any with the Clinton machine.</p><p>Ditto for the I.G. report that's pending and whether or not you are going to do a deep dive into the origins of the Russia probe.</p><p>GRAHAM: Right. Well, there's two questions there, and there are two good ones.</p><p>In terms of the e-mail report, that would have to go to the Foreign Relations Committee that has jurisdiction over the State Department. I would imagine that the Chairman Risch would have a hearing about that. How did they abuse the rules?</p><p>And I promise you -- and I keep saying this -- as soon as Horowitz is done with his review of the FISA warrant application, the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, you will have -- we will have a hearing in public with Horowitz, and we will call a bunch of witnesses.</p><p>As to the corruption in the Ukraine, I want your listeners to understand that I think Ukraine was involved in the 2016 election. I think they were trying to hurt Trump. They may have been working with the Democrats.</p><p>And I want somebody to look at Ukraine involvement in our 2016 election, like Mueller looked at the Russian involvement. That has yet to be done. And it needs to be done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You want a special counsel?</p><p>GRAHAM: I have been calling one for a year. But if Durham is doing it, I'm OK.</p><p>But I'm going to write a letter to Barr. I want him to tell me that, yes, we're looking at the allegations regarding Ukraine interference in our 2016 election. Manafort, who was the president's campaign manager for a relatively short period of time, worked in the Ukraine. And I think people were out to get him.</p><p>But the Politico article is very disturbing, where DNC members went to the Ukrainian Embassy to find dirt.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GRAHAM: So, the bottom line, I hope we look at Ukrainian corruption. And I'd like to call the prosecutor into the United States and have him testify, the one that Biden had fired.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Senator...</p><p>GRAHAM: Isn't it kind of odd that the only person that Biden wanted fired was the one investigating his son?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator, hold on.</p><p>Senator, stay with us. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I am back with Senator Lindsey Graham.</p><p>And, Senator, moments ago, you said you want to question the former prosecutor of the Ukraine. Just to be clear, this is the prosecutor that Joe Biden got fired.</p><p>GRAHAM: Right.</p><p>I want to know what happened. I want somebody to look at interference by Ukraine into the 2016 election, like Mueller looked at Russia. I'm hoping that's being done. If it's not being done, it should be done.</p><p>I'd like to do it outside of politics. And I find it odd that the only person that Biden wanted fired was the prosecutor. Maybe he is corrupt, but clearly he was looking at the boards that Hunter Biden was serving on.</p><p>You know, if it had been a Republican that pulled this shenanigans, it would be all over the news. So I'm not going to give up on the idea that both -- both sides need to be looked at. Trump has been looked at. Now it's the Democrats' turn.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>I mean, as we peel the onion back on the origins of the Russia probe, we are learning more and more. And we will continue to focus on this.</p><p>Senator, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator Lindsey Graham.</p><p>Democrats are setting up more closed-door interviews this upcoming week, meanwhile, in their impeachment inquiry, amid growing criticism from Republicans, who argue the process is largely being done in secret.</p><p>Joining me right now, a top Republican who was inside the room for those closed-door interviews. He is House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes.</p><p>Congressman, always a pleasure to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can you give us a sense of what's going on in those rooms?</p><p>You were present for both the last two very important testimonies, Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker.</p><p>NUNES: Yes, Maria.</p><p>And it's all being done in secret. Remember, these guys don't have any classified information. If they really want to do an impeachment, they should be having this out in the public.</p><p>And, remember, both Ambassador Volker and Ambassador Sondland, these are supposedly the guys in the middle that were doing all -- all the mischief with Rudy Giuliani.</p><p>Well, the fact is, is that they blew a hole completely through that conspiracy theory. And watching these nitwit Ivy League lawyers on the Democratic side where -- asking these questions, it's like watching the crazy train trying to get to the impeachment fantasy land.</p><p>These guys are on a fishing expedition. And you can tell. After about 20, 30 minutes, when they don't get the answers they want, they start to lead the witness to get the answers they want, so that, when they release the transcripts and do their phony report, when they try to get this vote for impeachment, they are just creating this false narrative made for television, really, and made for sound bites.</p><p>It's just all about narrative-building. And they just don't have a case. And this should be -- this is an embarrassment to the United States of America.</p><p>And, look, at the end of the day, we have real work to do here. We have a trade agreement with the United States and Canada, our two largest trading partners. That means something to real people out there in America. And these guys just won't do it because they can't get impeachment off their brain.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, let me ask you.</p><p>You have done so much work in terms of the origins of the Russia probe. Is this impeachment inquiry and Ukraine tied to the origins of the Russia probe? I understand you asked a question about that within the meeting. I know you can't say anything because its done behind closed doors.</p><p>But can you...</p><p>NUNES: Well, they leaked it. That's a good point, right? They leaked that to one of their favorite reporters.</p><p>So, that's the thing, is, when they want something out, they leak a fake narrative out. But they tell us, oh, you can't leak any of this.</p><p>And this is part of the problem of, it's really, you know, we will do whatever we want, but, at the same time, we're going to leak to our favorite reporters the things that we want to leak.</p><p>But I think the...</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you asked Ambassador Sondland a question about the origins of the Russia probe and Ukraine's involvement?</p><p>NUNES: Yes.</p><p>So, this is the problem. If you really look at it, what was Rudy Giuliani doing in Ukraine? It's very clear why Rudy Giuliani was in Ukraine. His client, the president of the United States, had been dirtied up by Ukrainians, OK?</p><p>So, people forget Ukraine is all over the Steele dossier. We know that Nellie Ohr testified that she was getting information from Ukrainians. So, why on earth is there a problem for the president's lawyer to go to Ukraine to get information to figure out, where did this dirt come from? Where did it originate from?</p><p>So for the president to be upset with Ukraine, upset about the corruption, because he knows -- don't forget, the Ukrainian ambassador here in the United States in August of 2016 wrote a nasty hit piece on President Trump -- well, then candidate Trump, before the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NUNES: There's plenty of reasons why the president would be over in Ukraine having his lawyers in Ukraine to try to get to the bottom of the Russia probe.</p><p>And, look, these nitwits on the Democratic side -- and I call them not being -- it's not -- I'm not trying to do name-calling here, but it's like they're living in a dream world. They don't know that the dirt that they paid for -- they paid Fusion GPS to send a British spy to Ukraine to dig up this dirt.</p><p>And now, all of a sudden, they pretend like -- like that just doesn't exist?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NUNES: Sorry. We're going to hold them accountable.</p><p>And we're going to ask the questions every time about the Democrats; ties to Ukraine. And I was glad to hear Senator Graham say that, look, we need to get to the bottom of, what did the Ukrainians know?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NUNES: Who were the Democrats that were dealing with Ukrainians?</p><p>Because it appears like more and more evidence out there that there were a lot of operatives for the Democratic Party, not just Fusion GPS, that were coordinating with Ukrainians to dirty up this president. And the American people need to know that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And one of the operatives we have talked about is Joseph Mifsud.</p><p>We have this timeline, which is the George Papadopoulos entrapment timeline, that we are going to show here. And I know that, in April of 2016, it was Joseph Mifsud who told then campaign staffer George Papadopoulos that Russia had Hillary Clinton's e-mails.</p><p>Now we understand that William Barr and John Durham have obtained BlackBerrys tied to the launch of the Russia probe. And these phones were the property of Joseph Mifsud.</p><p>What are we going to find on these phones? And why is it important that we look at Joseph Mifsud?</p><p>NUNES: Well, Joseph Mifsud should have been the guy at -- that we should have got to the bottom of.</p><p>With Mueller's $35 million probe, we should have known exactly what Joseph Mifsud was up to, because he's the one that supposedly first knew about the e-mails.</p><p>So why would you not spend the first part of your investigation to definitely get to the bottom of Joseph Mifsud? Now, what do we know about Joseph Mifsud? We know that he worked with FBI agents. We know he trained FBI agents at the Link campus in Rome.</p><p>We know that he was around many NATO members running dialogues with NATO members. So this is a guy who, if he was a Russian asset, OK, as -- so -- you have James Comey said he was a Russian asset. Mueller stopped short, just saying that he had Russian connections.</p><p>Well, somewhere in there, we got to know the truth, because either Joseph Mifsud is not a Russian asset and he was working for someone else -- we need to know who that was -- or if he was a Russian asset...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NUNES: ... my God, the State Department has been corrupted, our own FBI has been corrupted.</p><p>Joseph Mifsud was in the United States Congress in early 2017, as we were beginning our investigation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NUNES: So, something doesn't add up. So, the fact that Durham is building evidence...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because, once we know for sure -- once we know for sure that Mifsud working with Western intel, we know that it was all entrapment.</p><p>Stay with us, Devin Nunes. I want to ask you about your lawsuit against Twitter when we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm back with House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes.</p><p>And, Congressman, you with suing Twitter. You got a legal victory two weeks ago by a judge. Tell us where that stands.</p><p>NUNES: Well, look, I'm very concerned because, of all of the content that's being created out there that's anti-conservative -- 90 percent roughly of the media that's out there is against conservatives and Republicans.</p><p>But what's more concerning than that is what I call the tech oligarchs. And they have these devices where, whether it's Twitter or Google or Facebook, that really controls what Americans are seeing, especially younger people.</p><p>So that's really, I think, critical for the next election, that those companies can't be biased. And what's amazing about Twitter, you know, here for six months, I have been -- we have been in court. They have had plenty of chances to come clean. Right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NUNES: But yet they have hundreds of anonymous accounts that attack me on a daily basis, sometimes hourly basis, with defamation, slander, et cetera.</p><p>And you just have to wonder, like, what on earth are the board members and the CEO of Twitter thinking here? So now a judge has now ordered them to participate in the discovery process. We need to know the identities of the people who are committing these crimes, OK, and, in some cases, veiled death threats.</p><p>Yet Twitter and their board members are so negligent that they're not willing to give up those names, so that we can have our day in court?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hmm.</p><p>NUNES: I mean, they're basically telling a Virginia judge to go pound sand, they're not going to participate.</p><p>So we're going to compel them. We're going to be back in court in a few weeks. And at some point...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NUNES: Twitter is -- is a major company, with billionaires that own it.</p><p>But they have got mom-and-pop investors. And all the stuff you talk on your business show, Maria, they have a responsibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NUNES: I mean, as they're -- I mean, I think they are getting close to securities fraud here by not telling the people that are the owners of the company and the American people that -- how many of these accounts that are out there are actually just bought accounts, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NUNES: And why are you shutting down accounts for Democrats that attack Democrats, but you let hundreds against Republicans just be out there slandering?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>NUNES: What the hell is wrong with them?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Close to securities fraud.</p><p>Congressman, we want to talk more about this tomorrow morning on FOX Business. I will see you on \"Mornings With Maria.\"</p><p>NUNES: I look forward to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we will continue the discussion on Twitter.</p><p>Good to see you, sir. Thanks very much.</p><p>NUNES: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Devin Nunes.</p><p>House Foreign Affairs Ranking Member Congressman McCaul will join me next on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" A lot to get into with him.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>As Congress prepares harsh sanctions on Turkey for its attacks on the Kurds, Nancy Pelosi leads a delegation to Jordan for talks.</p><p>Joining me right now for exclusive reaction is Congressman Michael McCaul. He is the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p><p>Congressman, it's a pleasure to have you. Thanks so much for joining me today.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX): Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: First, your reaction to what has taken place in Syria, and are you expecting to bring those sanctions on Turkey?</p><p>MCCAUL: Well, we're very concerned about Turkey's aggressive behavior, invading Syria.</p><p>I did have a meeting in the White House, the one that became very publicized, where the speaker walked out of that meeting. After she left, we had a very, I thought, civilized conversation, with Democrats as well, about moving forward.</p><p>I got assurances from the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the president, and the secretary of defense on residual force.</p><p>My biggest concern, Maria, is, when Obama pulled out 10,000 troops out of Iraq, he created the space for ISIS, and then the formation of the so- called caliphate.</p><p>We do not want to see that same phenomenon happen in Syria. So we pressed very hard on the fact that we need a residual force in Syria to, first and foremost, protect the homeland.</p><p>So, right now, we're in a five-day cease-fire, after which it will become permanent. I talked to the vice president about this cease-fire. We want to give this a chance to work. And I'm hopeful that it will.</p><p>But, if it doesn't, we are prepared as early as next week to move forward at the committee level on very tough sanctions against Syria, if they continue to misbehave in the region.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is it true, Congressman, that some of the ISIS fighters have been able to get released, they are out of jail, because the Turks ran over basically the Kurds who were protecting those jails?</p><p>MCCAUL: It's another high priority of the administration, is to protect those prisons that hold, Maria, 10,000 of the worst of the worst jihadists left in that region.</p><p>My briefings, I think about 100 of them have escaped from these prisons. So we want to make sure, at all costs, that these prisons are protected.</p><p>I have been given the assurance they are right now. But it's a very fluid situation there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, before you go, I want to ask you about the State Department conclusion that the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private e-mail usage determined nearly 40 people committed violations.</p><p>The e-mail investigation found hundreds of violations, dozens of individuals at fault. Your committee has jurisdiction over the State Department.</p><p>MCCAUL: Correct.</p><p>And I -- we got a copy of this report late Friday night. We're looking through it. We will be asking a lot of questions. I will request a hearing on this.</p><p>And I think, above all, Maria, what I have the most concern about, even back in 2016, when this got exposed, were these highly secretive special access programs. These are the covert programs or the most really highly classified programs in the United States government.</p><p>The fact that she took those programs overseas on electronic devices and potentially compromised that, that will be the biggest focus I have on this issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It just feels like there's never any accountability.</p><p>I mean, look at that meeting that you had in the White House last week where Nancy Pelosi stormed out. There's no focus whatsoever by your colleagues on the left of the true wrongdoing.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: The job market suffering, a big miss ahead of tomorrow's big 10-year bull anniversary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From politics to pocketbooks, an incredible run-up. How did we get here? And what is ahead for your money?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne in for Neil Cavuto. This is \"Your World.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those weaker-than-expected jobs numbers raising new concern about the economy, just as the bull market for the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 turns 10 tomorrow. So, what does it mean for your money, the 2020 election? We are going to get to in a moment.</p><p>But, first, FOX team coverage with Susan Li with the action and John Roberts at the White House with the president's reaction, what he likes about today's report.</p><p>But we begin with Susan. She's outside the New York Stock Exchange -- Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>So, yes, we have the longest ever bull market run set to turn 10 on Saturday, forged from the destruction and the ashes of the global financial crisis. What a decade it's been.</p><p>Take a look at the performance of all the stock markets here in the U.S., the S&amp;P and the Dow both up some 300 percent over those 10 years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq seeing gains of over 400 percent, thanks to the emergence of tech giants like Facebook, Netflix and Amazon during that period.</p><p>And it's not surprising that when we take a look at the best performing stocks over that 10-year period, Apple is at the top of the tree, up some 1300 percent. A surprising one in second place, Boeing, the plane maker, up some 1200 percent. UnitedHealth and Visa rounding out the top four.</p><p>Now, a bull market is defined as a sustained period of gains over 20 percent without a drop of 20 percent. We were very close to reaching those levels at the end of 2018. Close. Thank goodness we didn't get there. But today's jobs number, given that we saw a big miss, only 20,000 jobs in the month of February, 180,000 expected, this has investors concerned because bull markets usually don't last 10 years.</p><p>We are here in the final stages, according to a lot of investors, and these global growth concerns, whether it's slowing in China, Europe, people are concerned that it will come here to the U.S. at some point and end this bull market run that we're still in the middle of -- Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Susan, thank you very, very much.</p><p>So, the question now is, who gets credit for this 10-year bull run, President Trump or former President Obama?</p><p>Let's ask our market pros.</p><p>Gary Kaltbaum is, Rebecca Walser and Scott Martin.</p><p>So, Gary, who gets the credit?</p><p>GARY KALTBAUM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, under Obama, I give it to Obama and the central banks. Under Trump, I give Trump and the tax cuts and the regulatory cuts.</p><p>But I think the last two months, central banks are back in force not only here and around the globe, but, overall, I give the hard work and the ingenuity and the sweat and toil of the great American people and the great American companies that keep coming up with new inventions, new technologies, new medical breakthroughs. And I think the best is yet to come in the next 10 years.</p><p>PAYNE: Rebecca, when the market gets hammered the way it did right before President Obama came in, you do anticipate that it will rebound. And we were down 50 percent. It was ridiculously sold off.</p><p>But to the extent that it's rallied now, many people are really shocked that, 10 years later, we'd still be going like this.</p><p>REBECCA WALSER, WALSER WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Yes, absolutely, Charles.</p><p>But the thing is, I mean, let's be honest. Over Obama's full eight-year period, he had GDP at 1.5 percent. His last year in office, it was 1.6 percent and then Trump came in, in 2017 and took it to 2.3 percent. And that's what his economists had projected.</p><p>So, I give all the credit to President Trump, deregulatory policy, tax policy. And, unfortunately, I think Obama had higher wealth inequality and not real good job growth. So, GDP numbers were awful. So, no, it's unusual to have 10 years. This is the longest ever. And I do think the global slowdown is making investors nervous and it's interesting.</p><p>We're in a really interesting point.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, Scott, today, we did learn, also, what's interesting is that accompanying this rebound in the stock market is an economic recovery that's finally getting to the masses. Wages are up now big time, four months in a row over 3 percent. If you're a blue-collar worker, up seven months in a row over 3 percent.</p><p>We didn't think that could ever happen anymore. That goes part and parcel, of course, with this market, no?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: Yes. And a couple of more job months or job growth months we are going to see, Charles, I think we're going to see in the next couple of months, we are going to see wages go towards 4 percent.</p><p>And you're seeing companies, too. You know, you guys talked about in kind of the previous comments about a little bit of different feel to the economy now, isn't it? It feels a little bit more self-sustaining. It feels a little more energetic vs., say, what it was in the previous administration.</p><p>So, you're seeing companies raise wages, minimum wage and things like that, because of the fact that they're confident about the regulatory environment going forward and they're confident about what's happening in D.C. now going forward.</p><p>So, that's another reason that companies, which is a good thing, are going to make their own decisions. They're going to breathe and live on their own and create job growth and create economic growth. And that, too, is going to keep this economy going in the coming years.</p><p>PAYNE: I want to go back to the New York Stock Exchange, bring Susan Li back into this.</p><p>What's interesting, Susan, is, overnight, China's stock market, their main market, the Shanghai, down more than 4 percent. It's been absolutely decimated over the last year, compared to our market, which is up significantly over the same time since President Trump has been in office.</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: As we head into the final phase of the China-U.S. trade talks, what kind of an impact does that give us? What kind of leverage does that give President Trump?</p><p>LI: Well, over the last 10 years, Charles, my favorite term has been the cleanest dirty shirts, and that's what the U.S. market and the U.S. economy has been.</p><p>And I would say actually especially true in the current environment in 2019. We do have a slowing economy taking place in China. They were down some 30 percent last year -- I would say probably the best performing stock market so far in 2019, but that all hinges on getting a U.S.-China trade deal.</p><p>Last night, we saw exports really falling off a cliff, down some 20 percent in a month. And don't forget, that is the bread and butter of the Chinese economy. That's what oils it. And if that's going down at this point, you can imagine that they are looking at a very sharp downturn and they want to sign a deal as soon as possible.</p><p>So maybe the U.S. and the Trump administration has the upper hand when it comes to signing possibly a trade truce.</p><p>PAYNE: Gary, you know, you brought up the Federal Reserve. Again, you know, Powell, let's give him credit for sinking the market in the fourth quarter of last year. Let's give him credit for maybe coming to his senses.</p><p>But now there's some concerns that the Fed is going to become even ultra- dovish and even trying to push this economy even further, and some people are concerned about that. So, where do you see interest rates?</p><p>KALTBAUM: Well, I was the first to say that they were going to stop dead in their tracks on raising rates. And I will be the first to say that the next move is going to be lowering of rates.</p><p>You know, look, we continue to be the very strong developing country. I don't -- I think China may be even in a recession. But we're not immune. I think we will slow down also. And I think Powell has already telegraphed it and I suspect we are going to see him lower rates during 2019, probably helps markets and, keep fingers crossed, keeps our economy in good stead.</p><p>And, again, let me repeat something. I give all the credit to Trump on not only lowering the taxes, but lowering the regulatory front. That was huge. Obama for eight years was the king of regulations and that needed to be undone. So good on this president.</p><p>PAYNE: There's no doubt that the business tone has taken a different tenor in the last two years, Scott.</p><p>And you have to wonder what that means for this market. We know there's an old saying on Wall Street that bull markets don't die of old age. But there's so many folks out there reluctant to get in this market, even though they see their own personal fortunes improving.</p><p>MARTIN: Yes, and, Charles, it goes across the board. It's from large multinational industrials to a small business owner like myself that, to Gary's point, sees that better regulatory environment, the better tax environment that we have seen.</p><p>And that helped kind of unleash that next level of growth that I think everybody kind of is waiting for here, even trade deal or not. So I think that's really good. And I like Susan's point, too, about kind of the cleanest dirty shirt in the basket here. And I will throw another one to her. You know, the U.S. is still kind of like the strongest guy or girl at the beach.</p><p>And so that's another reason why if you're an investor here and you see pullbacks like we have seen in the S&amp;P 500 this year alone on, say, controversial or maybe good or bad economic data, that's why I would take that as an opportunity to get in and put some money to work.</p><p>PAYNE: Rebecca, 20,000 jobs reported for last month. Perhaps that gets revised higher. By the same token, though, the wage number was absolutely phenomenal.</p><p>And what I think people aren't talking about, the Federal Reserve is not going to get in the way. They're going to let America, Americans get a raise. What does that mean for the economy and the stock market?</p><p>WALSER: Yes, I mean, Charles, like you said, we had wage growth and we had the unemployment actually drop.</p><p>So we actually even had January revised upwards to 311,000. So, if we look at the trends, six months looks good, three months looks good. The fundamentals are still there. I don't think the market needs to overreact. It overreacted a little bit this morning. Now you it's pulled back and kind of normalized.</p><p>We expect -- the underlying fundamentals are the best in the world. Are we going to have the fact that we have an aged bull market here having some impact and some economic creep in from China and the E.U.? Obviously, it affects us. We still are, as you said, Scott, the best in the world.</p><p>PAYNE: All right, double-edged sword that there's not a lot of enthusiasm about the market. Most experts say that's one of the reasons why it's going to keep going higher.</p><p>But we have got some -- I want to thank our experts on this panel. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>WALSER: Thanks, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, despite today's big jobs miss, the president sounding very upbeat on the economy.</p><p>John Roberts it at the White House with more on that -- John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Charles, one of the things that's overhanging the economy, at least this month, is, as Susan Li was pointing to, is whether or not there is a trade deal between the United States and China.</p><p>We were expecting that there was going to be a meeting Mar-a-Lago at the end of this month between President Trump and Xi Jinping, the president of China. It now looks like that's not going to happen.</p><p>FOX News has learned that the Chinese had time pencilled in, blocked out for Xi Jinping to come to Mar-a-Lago at the end of March. They have removed that time from his calendar. And I'm told there is no plan on the American side for a meeting in March now.</p><p>Now, what President Trump has said, getting a trade deal with China may come down to a face-to-face meeting between he and Xi. The Chinese now want a deal in place before Xi comes to the United States.</p><p>One of the reasons why, China watched what happened in Hanoi last week, when President Trump walked away from Kim Jong-un, and there is no chance that the Chinese will let Xi come to the United States and have that happen if they can't reach a final deal.</p><p>This morning, the president didn't seem to be aware that China was reconsidering the summit. Listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think they're doing well, but if it happened that way, we will do even better. We will do very well either way, with or without a deal, if you're telling me something that I have not heard.</p><p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>TRUMP: Yes, sure I'm confident. But if we don't make a very good deal for our country, I wouldn't make a deal. If this isn't a great deal, I won't make a deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: There's still some hope, though, that that meeting could happen in April.</p><p>Also this morning, the president putting his best face on disappointing February jobs numbers, only 20,000 jobs created, just a fraction of the 180,000 that were expected. Here's how the president put it this morning:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Well, it's a step. I think you will probably find out it averages out. The unemployment rate just went lower. We're down now to 3.8 percent, so we had very good news in that. I think the big news really was that wages went up.</p><p>And that's great for the American worker. That's something people, I don't know if they expected to see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: The chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said this morning that he thought the jobs number was fluky and doesn't really jibe with all of the other economic indicators out there. So we will see what happens in March -- Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: John, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, the wide-ranging impact of this bull market run will extend all the way to 2020 and that presidential race. And we're on top of that.</p><p>And, later, Republicans want to know if staffers of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff coached Michael Cohen ahead of his testimony last week. We will have the latest there as well.</p><p>PAYNE: You're looking live at the New York Stock Exchange, investors celebrating a 10-year bull run.</p><p>But we did stumble in the last of the last year. In fact, the Federal Reserve saying American households lost around $3.7 trillion in wealth during the final three months of 2018.</p><p>So how could all of this play out in the 2020 presidential race?</p><p>Let's get reaction from The Hill's editor in chief, Bob Cusack, and The Wall Street Journal's Jillian Melchior.</p><p>Bob, let me start with you.</p><p>We have had an amazing run in household wealth, but that fourth quarter obviously impacted with that massive soon in the stock market and even some softness in housing. Obviously, those aren't the numbers that the president wants to go into in 2020. But just how important are they?</p><p>BOB CUSACK, THE HILL: Oh, very important, Charles.</p><p>I mean, that is what Trump has. He has the economy. The economy has improved. I think what you're going to hear from the president in his reelection campaign is what you have heard from prior candidates when the economy is booming, is, are you better off than you were four years ago?</p><p>And that's something the Democrats are going to have to grapple with. And, of course, it's a long way, Charles, before 2020. We don't know what's going to happen with China. And I think that's -- that China deal, if it happens, will greatly impact the market.</p><p>But, right now, it is the one thing that Trump is going to repeatedly mention, of course, going after Democrats for investigations, but the economy being something that he improved.</p><p>PAYNE: And, Jillian, and putting even a finer point on it, the job part of this, the one thing that is really blowing me away, I got to tell you, seven consecutive months of blue-collar wage growth, more than 3 percent.</p><p>We haven't seen anything like this in well over a decade. Six of those seven months, wages for blue-collar workers growing faster than their supervisors. Those are jobs in the heartland. Those are jobs that President Trump promised.</p><p>JILLIAN MELCHIOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, I think we're seeing last year in October, record-breaking unemployment.</p><p>I was excited to see today that small business hiring is up. So lots of good signs here. And, you know, there's also a Fed paper that just came out today, and it's looking at the impact of such a tight labor market, and it's really showing that when the economy is booming, like it is right now, that no one is left behind.</p><p>So the theory here is that female workers, people of color, workers with a lack of skills or a lack of education, in a labor market this tight, businesses are going to give opportunities to all of them. They're competing for workers. So you're seeing wages go up, more opportunity.</p><p>So I think this is really inclusive growth. And Democrats are playing up this identity politics game. I think this in two ways -- I mean, it not only affects their narrative on the economics, but also some of the identity politics that they're playing up. It's hard to say that only the 1 percent is benefiting, when it's been bottom up.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>And then Bob, today, Elizabeth Warren comes out with a plan to dismantle Amazon, to dismantle Google, to dismantle Facebook. Listen, we know that everybody is angry at them. They haven't been great actors, but the notion of government dismantling the hottest companies in America, do you think that will play with voters?</p><p>CUSACK: I think it's going to be a tough sell for Democrats. And that's why the Democratic Party has to worry about having a candidate that's too far left.</p><p>The Democratic Party has turned left. We should certainly see that with the progressives in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez and others. So Democrats have to make sure that they win the middle class. It's something Chuck Schumer is always focused on is winning the middle class.</p><p>That is where this is going to be decided on.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>CUSACK: But if they have a candidate that's too progressive, then Trump is going to be -- it's a binary choice, as you know, Charles, and he can go after their policies.</p><p>PAYNE: Which is why many are saying that Joe Biden is the moderate hope for the Democratic Party, perhaps a savior.</p><p>Bob and Jillian, I will ask you both this. Bob, I will let you finish and then Jillian.</p><p>Joe Biden comes in and says, yes, we have had a 10-year run. Eight of those happened when I was part of the team that made it happen. I mean, is he ultimately the one who could come in for the Democratic side with some sort of not only economic vision, perhaps, certainly blue-collar side, but to say I have got a resume as well?</p><p>CUSACK: Listen, I think that Biden is -- would be somebody that Republicans -- and we talk to Republicans -- they're nervous about. At the same time, Trump can use his numbers against the Obama administration and say, which numbers are better for the economy?</p><p>And that is the advantage Trump. But is Biden dangerous in a general election? Absolutely.</p><p>PAYNE: Jillian?</p><p>MELCHIOR: I would agree with that.</p><p>I mean, he has going for him that he's not a New Green Deal guy. He's not somebody trying to completely from the top and bottom remake this economy that's already working.</p><p>But, at the same time, I think what we're seeing right now is that tax reform and particularly deregulation are paying off for Americans of all classes, all stripes. And I think that comparing that to the Obama record is not great.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, it's going to be hard. He's going to be promising things that are already happening.</p><p>Bob, Jillian, thank you both very much.</p><p>MELCHIOR: Thank you.</p><p>CUSACK: Thank you.</p><p>PAYNE: Hey, did the staff of House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff coach Michael Cohen before his testimony? That's what Republicans want to know. If so, is it unusual?</p><p>The latest from Catherine rMDNM_Herridge on that.</p><p>Plus, meet the Republican congressman who sent letter to Cohen demanding answers next.</p><p>PAYNE: Did former Trump attorney Michael Cohen get some coaching from his Capitol Hill testimony from the staff of Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff?</p><p>To Catherine Herridge with the latest on that -- Catherine.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon.</p><p>FOX News was the first to report that Democratic staff from the House Intelligence Committee traveled to New York four times and met with Cohen for more than 10 hours in advance of his seven-hour public testimony.</p><p>Two sources told FOX News that sessions with Cohen were wide-ranging, covering The National Enquirer's catch-and-kill policy, American media CEO David Pecker, as well as the alleged undervaluing or inflating of President Trump's assets.</p><p>What's key here is that, one by one, Democrats raised the exact same topics during Cohen's public testimony. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER ATTORNEY/FIXER FOR DONALD TRUMP: I was involved in several of these catch-and-kill episodes. These catch-and-kill scenarios existed between David Pecker and Mr. Trump long before I started working for him in 2007.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK: And, to your knowledge, did the president ever provide inflated assets to an insurance company?</p><p>COHEN: Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERRIDGE: In a statement to FOX News, a spokesman for Chairman Schiff said -- quote -- \"Despite this professed outrage by Republicans, it's completely appropriate to conduct proffer sessions and allow witnesses to review their prior testimony before the committee interviews them. Such sessions are a routine part of every serious investigation around the country, including congressional investigations.\"</p><p>For some context, Cohen has now testified at least five times in private and public congressional hearings. He first told the House committee over a year ago that he wasn't aware of any direct evidence showing collusion with Russia -- Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Catherine, thank you very much.</p><p>HERRIDGE: You're welcome.</p><p>PAYNE: And, by the way, we have called Congressman Adam Schiff for an interview. We have yet to hear back from him.</p><p>But want to go now to Ohio Republican Congressman Michael Turner. He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and wrote a letter to Michael Cohen demanding answers.</p><p>Sir, thanks for joining us.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL TURNER (R), OHIO: Charles, thanks for having me.</p><p>PAYNE: It feels like a bombshell for those of us not familiar with how all the -- how things proceed there.</p><p>You know, is this unusual? Has this happened before? Do you know of times, perhaps, when Republicans may have engaged in a similar kind of tactic?</p><p>TURNER: Not like this.</p><p>And my congratulations to Catherine, Charles, because what we knew before on the Government Reform testimony, that Cohen himself had admitted that he had had contact with Democrat Adam Schiff.</p><p>And what we know now from reports, Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, is reporting that there were four trips to New York and over 10 hours of contact with Adam Schiff's staff.</p><p>To give you some perspective, he testified in front of the government reform committee for seven hours. Let's say the Democrats were four hours of that questioning and answering. That means that they would have spent three hours behind closed doors working with Cohen preparing him for that testimony and questioning for every hour that we got to see on TV.</p><p>Now, we thought this was a congressional hearing, how they normally are, people asking questions, contemporaneously getting answers. Now, they say this is a public investigation, but it sounds like public and professional orchestration.</p><p>These types of contacts are very, very unusual. And, you know, what do you do for over 10 hours of sitting down with Cohen before he testifies publicly? You know, it absolutely rises to the level of questions of coaching and whether or not this is political theater.</p><p>PAYNE: Do you think you can get to the bottom of this? Do you think you can ultimately find out if, in fact, there was some sort of rehearsal session, some sort of coaching session?</p><p>And I think, more importantly as well, does this rise to the level of being illegal? Certainly, it sounds like it perhaps is unfair with respect to being a public hearing.</p><p>TURNER: Well, I think Democrat Adam Schiff has some answers that he owes the public, because, here, these happened behind closed doors solely with Democrat Adam Schiff's staff.</p><p>No one else was present at the time, over 10 hours of work with Michael Cohen before he came out and publicly testified. I think that the public deserves answers as to what happened during these sessions, what was discussed?</p><p>And what we certainly know was discussed were items that were of interest to the Democrats that they brought forward to the Government Reform Committee. They knew the answers he was going to give before they asked the questions, and that's what -- not what the American public expects.</p><p>They don't expect guiding and coaching of a witness. If we're going to have a congressional testimony, it should be actual testimony from the witness and questions from those who are present.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>Adam Schiff said that it was sort of proffer -- proffer sessions and that they were routine. At the beginning of this interview, you suggested that Republicans have done something similar.</p><p>TURNER: No. Actually...</p><p>PAYNE: Tell me what the difference would be between Republicans, what they may have done in the past, compared to what you think happened in this case.</p><p>TURNER: Yes.</p><p>So, no, I wasn't suggesting at all has happened with Republicans. What I would -- what I think everybody would expect, that there could be some contact. For example, it wouldn't be shocking if the aggregate of contacts between the House Oversight Committee and the House Intelligence Committee on the Democrat side in preparation for the logistics of Cohen's testimony was an hour, you know, how it's going to go down, how it's going to work, how it's structured.</p><p>At five hours, you start to get, what are you talking about? But now we're hearing this is over 10 hours. Over 10 hours, clearly, this is trying to affect testimony. This is where coaching occurs. This is where questions of theater occur and orchestration.</p><p>You know, you hear from, you know, reports on the Democrat on the Government Reform that they were proud of their performance. Well, if it's been, you know, rehearsed, they certainly have a reason to be proud.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, apparently, Representative Turner, if indeed there were some rehearsal, maybe they -- there was some issues about the pardoning controversy now, because whether or not Michael Cohen or a representative of Cohen approached the White House, Lanny Davis coming through in successive days with more information on that, what do you make of it?</p><p>Where are we with that? I mean, do you think that Michael Cohen lied during that testimony?</p><p>TURNER: You know, the only thing I'm confident where Michael Cohen has told the truth is when he pled guilty to lying to Congress. I think, past that, you can't take much credibility in what he's saying.</p><p>You know, you have to understand that, every time he opens his mouth, as an attorney who swore to hold the confidences of his client, he's already violating his professional pledge, and that he's proven -- he's a convicted felon for having proven to have lied.</p><p>I think his guilty plea is probably the only thing that we can count on that Michael Cohen has told the truth about.</p><p>PAYNE: Representative Mike Turner, thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>TURNER: Thank you.</p><p>PAYNE: We're going to drill into this later a little further with a former federal prosecutor.</p><p>And then freshman Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sparking a brand-new controversy. Now she's claiming a pro-Israel group is coming after her and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. And she's fund-raising off that claim. The fallout from that is next.</p><p>PAYNE: President Trump has arrived just moments ago. That's on tape.</p><p>But it's just moments ago at Mar-a-Lago -- Palm Beach, rather, this, of course, after touring Alabama, where he met officials and victims.</p><p>PAYNE: Republican Congressman Mike Turner slamming House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff for reportedly having a staff meet four times with Michael Cohen prior to his congressional testimony.</p><p>Former federal prosecutor Doug Burns joins us now.</p><p>Doug, it's just, you know, again, from the outside looking in, we're getting a civics lesson through all of this.</p><p>DOUG BURNS, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Yes. We are.</p><p>PAYNE: We're not liking what we're learning. Is this kosher, in your mind?</p><p>BURNS: Well, in cases, people meet with the prosecutors all the time. This is a lot different, though.</p><p>I mean, when you have a congressional hearing, and then the witness is meeting with that, you know, congressional committee...</p><p>PAYNE: These are the folks who you are going to question during the meeting, and a 10-hour meeting?</p><p>BURNS: Where I come down on all this is that people that are smarter than I am, most notably Professor Dershowitz, Ken Starr, have said, look, we're criminalizing politics, we're criminalizing political differences, we're weaponizing criminal law.</p><p>Real crime is narcotics dealing, organized crime, murder. OK? And here this one lied. It's like a schoolyard. No, he lied. He lied. And it's crazy.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>BURNS: But, to your question, look, it is untoward, yes.</p><p>PAYNE: All right, but these sessions, you know, ostensibly, heretofore...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: ... were always designed, we thought, to seek truth, to seek answers.</p><p>BURNS: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Instead, if it turns out it was all a coordinated rehearsal, then it makes a mockery of Congress and it makes a mockery of the system.</p><p>BURNS: Mayor Giuliani famously said the truth isn't the truth. Everybody was foaming at the mouth going crazy. How could he say that?</p><p>He's 100 percent right, OK? And what we mean by that is, you go into these meetings and there are subtle insinuations, maybe it happened that way, didn't it? You sure it wasn't this way, didn't it?</p><p>So, to your point, yes, all of this weaponization, this politics stuff is not a good process for the truth. I totally agree with you, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Wow.</p><p>Speaking of wow...</p><p>BURNS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: ... tongues are still wagging over the sentencing yesterday, Paul Manafort.</p><p>BURNS: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Really, a lot of people really were just caught completely off- guard, although I will say, we had a guest on last night, Gene Rossi, who said it would be a low sentence.</p><p>BURNS: I saw that.</p><p>PAYNE: And he gave some pretty interesting reasons for it. And yet, today, it's being characterized as misjustice.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNS: No, no, no, but let me clarify a couple of things.</p><p>I watched people go on television left and right saying -- quote -- \"He's going to be in prison for decades. It's a life sentence.\"</p><p>And I was saying to myself, these people don't know what they're talking about, because what happens is, the government -- telling little tales out of school -- when you go to trial, the pre-sentence reports tend to be much, much higher than if you plead guilty, even though it's the same case.</p><p>That's a little dark secret about penalizing somebody for going to trial. Had Paul Manafort pled guilty, everybody would have said, oh, it's eight to nine years, on the same facts, OK? A little dark secret.</p><p>So, the point is I knew for sure that the judge wasn't going to give him 20 years. That was...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: But 47 months?</p><p>BURNS: That was 5 percent out of 100.</p><p>Forty-seven months, but there's a follow-up point real quick, was 15 percent out of 100. The other 80 percent was six to nine years, seven to 10 years. That's what all my friends, all the experts were telling me. And I agreed with that.</p><p>Now, the point is, though, this is a little bit of a head-fake, because next Wednesday, Judge Jackson in the District of Columbia sentences him. The sentence she imposed by law is consecutive, unless she determines that that she wants to make it concurrent.</p><p>I'm still trying to handicap -- I'm not there yet -- what I think she's going to do. But the point is, if she gives him 47 months, hypothetically -- and runs it consecutive -- then he ends up with like an eight-year sentence.</p><p>PAYNE: All right, Doug, thank you very much.</p><p>BURNS: My pleasure.</p><p>PAYNE: Coming up next:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I thought yesterday's vote by the House was disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE: President Trump blasting House Democrats over their resolution after the Ilhan Omar controversy. Now one of her fellow freshman -- fellow freshman Democrats actually fund-raising off this controversy. Really?</p><p>PAYNE: President Trump arriving a short while ago in Florida. He was in Alabama earlier today visiting the victims of a tornado that killed 23 people this past Sunday.</p><p>Jonathan Serrie is in Lee County, Alabama, with the details on the president's visit -- Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Charles.</p><p>The president and first lady started with the helicopter tour getting a bird's-eye view of just the scope of the massive amounts of damage here in Lee County, Alabama.</p><p>They then landed and took a walking tour of one of the neighborhoods that suffered some of the worst devastation. There, they met with families who lost loved ones in Sunday's tornado.</p><p>They include the family of Sheila Creech and Marshall Lynn Grimes, a couple that died in the storm. Mr. Grimes' 10-year-old daughter remains hospitalized. In fact, she wasn't well enough to go to the parents' funeral.</p><p>And the daughter's friend, 10-year-old Taylor Thornton, who was over for a visit at the time died in the storm. Family and friends held a funeral service for Taylor this morning.</p><p>After touring the devastation, President Trump visited a church that is serving as a staging area for relief efforts. There, he met with volunteers and first-responders and thanked them for all their hard work during the hours and days following the tornado.</p><p>He also praised Alabama Governor Kay Ivey for her handling of the disaster.</p><p>Now let's go to a live shot that we have from the town of Smiths Station. That's about 20 miles away from where I'm standing. You can see recovery efforts are well under way. The president's visit is receiving praise even from the other side of the aisle.</p><p>Alabama Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat, says such visits have a way of connecting Washington politicians with communities in need on a much more intimate and enduring level.</p><p>And now coming back to our live location here in Beauregard, Alabama, look at all of this debris on the ground and up in the trees. That's a concern as we go into the weekend, because, Charles, more severe weather is forecast for Alabama.</p><p>The worst storms are expected to pass to the north of us. But with all this debris on the ground, even moderate winds could scatter it. And the concern is that will slow down some of the recovery efforts -- Charles, back to you.</p><p>PAYNE: Thank you very much, Jonathan.</p><p>Now to an official who met with President Trump in Alabama today.</p><p>Joining us on the phone, mayor of Opelika, Alabama, Gary Fuller.</p><p>Mayor, thanks for joining us.</p><p>GARY FULLER, MAYOR OF OPELIKA, ALABAMA: Charles, my pleasure to be with you. Thank you.</p><p>PAYNE: First, before we talk about your visit today, give us an update on your town. I know you have about 30,000 folks there. How devastating was it? And where are you now?</p><p>FULLER: Well, thank goodness, Charles, it didn't touch Opelika.</p><p>We're about 13 miles from the community of Beauregard, so the storm was south of Opelika and Auburn. And, of course, because of the density of the population here or in Auburn would really have been -- it's bad enough as it is with 23 lives lost.</p><p>But it would have been really a terrible, terrible thing had it moved several miles north. But, you know, the cleanup continues. We were very grateful to have the president and first lady with us today. And I think they met some folks that are strong and will rebuild that community, not only in Beauregard, but in Smiths Station.</p><p>PAYNE: Mayor, talk to us more about the president, just how important it is, how critical is it for him and the first lady to be there and how it can lift the spirits of the folks there?</p><p>FULLER: Well, I think all of us were greatly encouraged by the fact that he would take time to come here and be with those folks that have been harmed and some of them lost everything, including family members.</p><p>But it's a great encouragement for us. And then, of course, you know, the president has many fans in the state of Alabama, and certainly here in Lee County. I think he probably carried Lee County in a big way back in the last election. So he was among friends, not all of them friends, but mostly friends.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAYNE: Right. Yes.</p><p>FULLER: And, of course, Senator Jones, who is our junior U.S. senator, is a Democrat. But Senator Jones was here, and had a chance to visit with him.</p><p>And, of course, it's great to see everybody working for a common goal. And that's to get that community rebuilt and to get it cleaned up.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, and Senator Jones is a good man.</p><p>You mentioned a common goal. I know there's been some relief efforts and there's a relief drive going on. How is that coming along?</p><p>FULLER: It's almost overwhelming, Charles, the outpouring of love and prayers and contributions.</p><p>In fact, a couple of days ago, all of the agencies said, please, don't bring any more food or bottled water or blankets or clothes. We may need those later.</p><p>PAYNE: Right. Right.</p><p>FULLER: Right now, if you want to do something, give money. And there's a number of organizations, including the Red Cross, the Lee County United Way, they're involved.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>FULLER: And then the East Alabama Medical Center Foundation is involved with the Poarch Band of Creek Indians to pay for the burial of all of those deceased.</p><p>PAYNE: We have got less than 30 seconds, but I have to give you a shout- out.</p><p>In the midst of all of this, you secured a pretty good deal for your town, an almost $6 million deal with an Indian automobile manufacturer. Just quickly, you know, talk to us because we have been -- there's a theme in this country about businesses coming to America.</p><p>FULLER: Charles, we think everything starts with good-paying jobs.</p><p>My friend Al Cook taught me that. And these folks, Yongsan Automotive, that made the great decision to locate here, going to employ 150 people within three years, good jobs, good pay, that's good for everybody.</p><p>PAYNE: It is.</p><p>Be safe. And we really appreciate you taking the time out, Mayor Gary Fuller.</p><p>FULLER: Thank you so much, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: More right after this.</p><p>PAYNE: President Trump slamming House Democrats and their anti-hate resolution, this coming after Minnesota freshman Ilhan Omar was accused of anti-Semitic remarks.</p><p>But Congresswoman Omar wasn't named in the resolution. So is this an issue that's going to stay with Democrats for a while?</p><p>Let's talk to The Washington Examiner's Kelly Jane Torrance.</p><p>Kelly Jane, what are your thoughts there?</p><p>KELLY JANE TORRANCE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: I do think it's going to stay with Democrats for a while, Charles.</p><p>This resolution, I think, was just completely pointless. It's not even that it didn't name Ilhan Omar, which is bad enough. But they actually completely changed the resolution. The original resolution condemned anti- Semitism, and it actually had a little bit about the history of anti- Semitism and why it is such a problem.</p><p>Well, they totally watered it down. As James Clyburn of South Carolina said, we need to have an anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, all that stuff. It's mind-boggling.</p><p>And, you know, Ilhan Omar was saying she thinks people are tagging her because she is Muslim. Now, they're not. They're worried about her because she's made anti-Semitic remarks.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>TORRANCE: But by putting Islamophobia and other things in there, Democrats are making it look like they think she is right.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, to your point, President Trump saying Democrats are now the anti-Israel, anti-Jewish party, to which Senator Schumer just releasing a tweet.</p><p>And I want to share it with the audience. \"For the president who when neo- Nazis marched in Charlottesville in front of a synagogue and said burn it down, and he said both sides are to blame, this is a new divisive low. His comments show the president is only interested in playing politics of division and not in fighting anti-Semitism. Mr. President, you have redefined chutzpah.\"</p><p>Your thoughts?</p><p>TORRANCE: Well, yes, it's -- if I were President Trump, I might not decide to comment on this and call another party the party of anti-Semitism.</p><p>We have had a few Republicans who have had some issues. But I don't really like this whataboutism. I think the Democrats also have a problem. Let's address it. And I don't think the Democrats are addressing it.</p><p>And if they're not brave enough to address it, it is going to continue to be a problem for them.</p><p>PAYNE: That's the operative word there, Kelly Jane, brave. That was a bad move yesterday.</p><p>But, real quickly, maybe this is a bad move, too, because New York freshman Democrat AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, now fund-raising over a controversy. She's claiming that the pro-Israeli group AIPAC is coming after her and she's raising money on this. Your thoughts?</p><p>TORRANCE: Again, exactly. This is divisive politics. This is not the way to go.</p><p>You know, AOC has been one of the people who has been really defending Omar on this. We would have been moving on from this if Ilhan Omar had just apologized and moved on and quit making the remarks.</p><p>But she just keeps doing it. She can't stop. And the Democrats -- at first Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer, the Democratic leadership in the House, had a statement when Omar first made some comments. They have wimped out since then. And that's why people are still talking about it, because it looks like the Democrats are trying to cover up for some other Democrats.</p><p>PAYNE: And you have got to believe it's going to happen again.</p><p>Thank you very, very much, Kelly Jane Torrance.</p><p>In the meantime, Elizabeth Warren vs. Wall Street all over again. And this time, the Democratic senator and 2020 hopeful, well, she's targeting big tech. That's next.</p><p>PAYNE: Democratic senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren wants to break up big tech companies, claiming companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon hurt small businesses and innovation.</p><p>We invited Senator Warren to come on the show, but her schedule today didn't allow her to join in.</p><p>Here now to discuss is Stanford University School of Business Professor David Dodson and former Republican senator -- Senate candidate for Wyoming.</p><p>David, thanks for joining us.</p><p>This isn't your typical, hey, let's break up a company or two because they're big. She wants to dismantle prior mergers and just completely take it all apart. Your thoughts?</p><p>DAVID DODSON, STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: Oh, it's naively mind-boggling, what she is suggesting.</p><p>I don't know if this is just a continuation of this kind of Democratic economic nanny state that is being promoted increasingly by the fringes of the Democratic Party, or it's just a political stunt where she's seen three big juicy targets, and she could take sort of a populist stand against these three companies.</p><p>Look, these companies only have two things in common. The first is that they have been successful. And the second is that they sell things over the Internet.</p><p>That doesn't mean that the government should take their regulatory chain saw and arbitrarily decide, if you get to be a certain size, that must be bad, and so we're going to cut you in half.</p><p>Now, we all know that there are issues with Facebook and Google in terms of privacy issues, and how ads are sold and hacking and so forth.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>DODSON: But you don't solve those things by taking a chain saw and cutting the companies in half and expecting that's going to be fixed.</p><p>PAYNE: What about consumers?</p><p>DODSON: Consumers are not harmed because Amazon has figured out that people like me like the stuff brought to our house at a really low price.</p><p>That's why Amazon has done so well, not because they're doing anything illegal. And, in fact, she literally said this morning that their purchase of Whole Foods was illegal.</p><p>On what basis is that illegal?</p><p>PAYNE: Real quick, we only have 30 seconds, but what about the idea that it's not hurting the customer, but it's hurting small businesses?</p><p>DODSON: Well, I think that's absurd, because if you look at how many -- for example, how many books have been published, self-published books on Amazon, it reached a million this year. Never before.</p><p>More things are sold by regular people over the Internet now as a result of the democratization of the Internet, whether it's all the way from eBay back in the day, to Amazon, to Facebook and so forth.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>DODSON: So these are places where people have an opportunity to sell products.</p><p>PAYNE: David, thank you very much.</p><p>Really appreciate it.</p><p>DODSON: Not at all.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, big tech played a big role in keeping this bull market running, so be sure to tune in to \"Cavuto Live\" tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Eastern for special coverage on the bull market's 10-year anniversary.</p><p>In the meantime, I will be back on Monday at 2:00 p.m. Eastern for \"Making Money\" on the FOX Business Network. We will see you then, again, tomorrow, 10 years, bull market, big deal.</p><p>So is \"The Five.\" It starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019030803cb140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKN-RRS1-DXH2-63S6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7547\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

THIS COPY MAY NOTBE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  The job market suffering, a big miss ahead of tomorrow's big 10-year bull anniversary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From politics to pocketbooks, an incredible run-up.  How did we get here?  And what is ahead for your money?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everyone.  I'm Charles Payne in for Neil Cavuto.  This is \"Your World.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those weaker-than-expected jobs numbers raising new concern about the economy, just as the bull market for the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 turns 10 tomorrow.  So, what does it mean for your money, the 2020 election?  We are going to get to in a moment.</p><p>But, first, FOX team coverage with Susan Li with the action and John Roberts at the White House with the president's reaction, what he likes about today's report.</p><p>But we begin with Susan.  She's outside the New York Stock Exchange -- Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>So, yes, we have the longest ever bull market run set to turn 10 on Saturday, forged from the destruction and the ashes of the global financial crisis.  What a decade it's been.</p><p>Take a look at the performance of all the stock markets here in the U.S., the S&amp;P and the Dow both up some 300 percent over those 10 years.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq seeing gains of over 400 percent, thanks to the emergence of tech giants like Facebook, Netflix and Amazon during that period.</p><p>And it's not surprising that when we take a look at the best performing stocks over that 10-year period, Apple is at the top of the tree, up some 1300 percent.  A surprising one in second place, Boeing, the plane maker, up some 1200 percent.  UnitedHealth and Visa rounding out the top four.</p><p>Now, a bull market is defined as a sustained period of gains over 20 percent without a drop of 20 percent.  We were very close to reaching those levels at the end of 2018.  Close.  Thank goodness we didn't get there.  But today's jobs number, given that we saw a big miss, only 20,000 jobs in the month of February, 180,000 expected, this has investors concerned because bull markets usually don't last 10 years.</p><p>We are here in the final stages, according to a lot of investors, and these global growth concerns, whether it's slowing in China, Europe, people are concerned that it will come here to the U.S. at some point and end this bull market run that we're still in the middle of -- Charles.</p><p>PAYNE:  Susan, thank you very, very much.</p><p>So, the question now is, who gets credit for this 10-year bull run, President Trump or former President Obama?</p><p>Let's ask our market pros.</p><p>Gary Kaltbaum is, Rebecca Walser and Scott Martin.</p><p>So, Gary, who gets the credit?</p><p>GARY KALTBAUM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, under Obama, I give it to Obama and the central banks.  Under Trump, I give Trump and the tax cuts and the regulatory cuts.</p><p>But I think the last two months, central banks are back in force not only here and around the globe, but, overall, I give the hard work and the ingenuity and the sweat and toil of the great American people and the great American companies that keep coming up with new inventions, new technologies, new medical breakthroughs.  And I think the best is yet to come in the next 10 years.</p><p>PAYNE:  Rebecca, when the market gets hammered the way it did right before President Obama came in, you do anticipate that it will rebound.  And we were down 50 percent.  It was ridiculously sold off.</p><p>But to the extent that it's rallied now, many people are really shocked that, 10 years later, we'd still be going like this.</p><p>REBECCA WALSER, WALSER WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Yes, absolutely, Charles.</p><p>But the thing is, I mean, let's be honest.  Over Obama's full eight-year period, he had GDP at 1.5 percent.  His last year in office, it was 1.6 percent and then Trump came in, in 2017 and took it to 2.3 percent.  And that's what his economists had projected.</p><p>So, I give all the credit to President Trump, deregulatory policy, tax policy.  And, unfortunately, I think Obama had higher wealth inequality and not real good job growth.  So, GDP numbers were awful.  So, no, it's unusual to have 10 years.  This is the longest ever.  And I do think the global slowdown is making investors nervous and it's interesting.</p><p>We're in a really interesting point.</p><p>PAYNE:  You know, Scott, today, we did learn, also, what's interesting is that accompanying this rebound in the stock market is an economic recovery that's finally getting to the masses.  Wages are up now big time, four months in a row over 3 percent.  If you're a blue-collar worker, up seven months in a row over 3 percent.</p><p>We didn't think that could ever happen anymore.  That goes part and parcel, of course, with this market, no?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Yes.  And a couple of more job months or job growth months we are going to see, Charles, I think we're going to see in the next couple of months, we are going to see wages go towards 4 percent.</p><p>And you're seeing companies, too.  You know, you guys talked about in kind of the previous comments about a little bit of different feel to the economy now, isn't it?  It feels a little bit more self-sustaining.  It feels a little more energetic vs., say, what it was in the previous administration.</p><p>So, you're seeing companies raise wages, minimum wage and things like that, because of the fact that they're confident about the regulatory environment going forward and they're confident about what's happening in D.C. now going forward.</p><p>So, that's another reason that companies, which is a good thing, are going to make their own decisions.  They're going to breathe and live on their own and create job growth and create economic growth.  And that, too, is going to keep this economy going in the coming years.</p><p>PAYNE:  I want to go back to the New York Stock Exchange, bring Susan Li back into this.</p><p>What's interesting, Susan, is, overnight, China's stock market, their main market, the Shanghai, down more than 4 percent.  It's been absolutely decimated over the last year, compared to our market, which is up significantly over the same time since President Trump has been in office.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>PAYNE:  As we head into the final phase of the China-U.S. trade talks, what kind of an impact does that give us?  What kind of leverage does that give President Trump?</p><p>LI:  Well, over the last 10 years, Charles, my favorite term has been the cleanest dirty shirts, and that's what the U.S. market and the U.S. economy has been.</p><p>And I would say actually especially true in the current environment in 2019.  We do have a slowing economy taking place in China.  They were down some 30 percent last year -- I would say probably the best performing stock market so far in 2019, but that all hinges on getting a U.S.-China trade deal.</p><p>Last night, we saw exports really falling off a cliff, down some 20 percent in a month.  And don't forget, that is the bread and butter of the Chinese economy.  That's what oils it.  And if that's going down at this point, you can imagine that they are looking at a very sharp downturn and they want to sign a deal as soon as possible.</p><p>So maybe the U.S. and the Trump administration has the upper hand when it comes to signing possibly a trade truce.</p><p>PAYNE:  Gary, you know, you brought up the Federal Reserve.  Again, you know, Powell, let's give him credit for sinking the market in the fourth quarter of last year.  Let's give him credit for maybe coming to his senses.</p><p>But now there's some concerns that the Fed is going to become even ultra-dovish and even trying to push this economy even further, and some people are concerned about that.  So, where do you see interest rates?</p><p>KALTBAUM:  Well, I was the first to say that they were going to stop dead in their tracks on raising rates.  And I will be the first to say that the next move is going to be lowering of rates.</p><p>You know, look, we continue to be the very strong developing country.  I don't -- I think China may be even in a recession.  But we're not immune.  I think we will slow down also.  And I think Powell has already telegraphed it and I suspect we are going to see him lower rates during 2019, probably helps markets and, keep fingers crossed, keeps our economy in good stead.</p><p>And, again, let me repeat something.  I give all the credit to Trump on not only lowering the taxes, but lowering the regulatory front.  That was huge.  Obama for eight years was the king of regulations and that needed to be undone.  So good on this president.</p><p>PAYNE:  There's no doubt that the business tone has taken a different tenor in the last two years, Scott.</p><p>And you have to wonder what that means for this market.  We know there's an old saying on Wall Street that bull markets don't die of old age.  But there's so many folks out there reluctant to get in this market, even though they see their own personal fortunes improving.</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, and, Charles, it goes across the board.  It's from large multinational industrials to a small business owner like myself that, to Gary's point, sees that better regulatory environment, the better tax environment that we have seen.</p><p>And that helped kind of unleash that next level of growth that I think everybody kind of is waiting for here, even trade deal or not.  So I think that's really good.  And I like Susan's point, too, about kind of the cleanest dirty shirt in the basket here.  And I will throw another one to her.  You know, the U.S. is still kind of like the strongest guy or girl at the beach.</p><p>And so that's another reason why if you're an investor here and you see pullbacks like we have seen in the S&amp;P 500 this year alone on, say, controversial or maybe good or bad economic data, that's why I would take that as an opportunity to get in and put some money to work.</p><p>PAYNE:  Rebecca, 20,000 jobs reported for last month.  Perhaps that gets revised higher.  By the same token, though, the wage number was absolutely phenomenal.</p><p>And what I think people aren't talking about, the Federal Reserve is not going to get in the way.  They're going to let America, Americans get a raise.  What does that mean for the economy and the stock market?</p><p>WALSER:  Yes, I mean, Charles, like you said, we had wage growth and we had the unemployment actually drop.</p><p>So we actually even had January revised upwards to 311,000.  So, if we look at the trends, six months looks good, three months looks good.  The fundamentals are still there.  I don't think the market needs to overreact.  It overreacted a little bit this morning.  Now you it's pulled back and kind of normalized.</p><p>We expect -- the underlying fundamentals are the best in the world.  Are we going to have the fact that we have an aged bull market here having some impact and some economic creep in from China and the E.U.?  Obviously, it affects us.  We still are, as you said, Scott, the best in the world.</p><p>PAYNE:  All right, double-edged sword that there's not a lot of enthusiasm about the market.  Most experts say that's one of the reasons why it's going to keep going higher.</p><p>But we have got some -- I want to thank our experts on this panel.  Thank you all very much.  Appreciate it.</p><p>WALSER:  Thanks, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE:  You know, despite today's big jobs miss, the president sounding very upbeat on the economy.</p><p>John Roberts it at the White House with more on that -- John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Charles, one of the things that's overhanging the economy, at least this month, is, as Susan Li was pointing to, is whether or not there is a trade deal between the United States and China.</p><p>We were expecting that there was going to be a meeting Mar-a-Lago at the end of this month between President Trump and Xi Jinping, the president of China.  It now looks like that's not going to happen.</p><p>FOX News has learned that the Chinese had time pencilled in, blocked out for Xi Jinping to come to Mar-a-Lago at the end of March.  They have removed that time from his calendar.  And I'm told there is no plan on the American side for a meeting in March now.</p><p>Now, what President Trump has said, getting a trade deal with China may come down to a face-to-face meeting between he and Xi.  The Chinese now want a deal in place before Xi comes to the United States.</p><p>One of the reasons why, China watched what happened in Hanoi last week, when President Trump walked away from Kim Jong-un, and there is no chance that the Chinese will let Xi come to the United States and have that happen if they can't reach a final deal.</p><p>This morning, the president didn't seem to be aware that China was reconsidering the summit.  Listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think they're doing well, but if it happened that way, we will do even better.  We will do very well either way, with or without a deal, if you're telling me something that I have not heard.</p><p>QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>TRUMP:  Yes, sure I'm confident.  But if we don't make a very good deal for our country, I wouldn't make a deal.  If this isn't a great deal, I won't make a deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS:  There's still some hope, though, that that meeting could happen in April.</p><p>Also this morning, the president putting his best face on disappointing February jobs numbers, only 20,000 jobs created, just a fraction of the 180,000 that were expected.  Here's how the president put it this morning:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, it's a step.  I think you will probably find out it averages out.  The unemployment rate just went lower.  We're down now to 3.8 percent, so we had very good news in that.  I think the big news really was that wages went up.</p><p>And that's great for the American worker.  That's something people, I don't know if they expected to see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS:  The chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said this morning that he thought the jobs number was fluky and doesn't really jibe with all of the other economic indicators out there.  So we will see what happens in March -- Charles.</p><p>PAYNE:  John, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, the wide-ranging impact of this bull market run will extend all the way to 2020 and that presidential race.  And we're on top of that.</p><p>And, later, Republicans want to know if staffers of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff coached Michael Cohen ahead of his testimony last week.  We will have the latest there as well.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PAYNE:  You're looking live at the New York Stock Exchange, investors celebrating a 10-year bull run.</p><p>But we did stumble in the last of the last year.  In fact, the Federal Reserve saying American households lost around $3.7 trillion in wealth during the final three months of 2018.</p><p>So how could all of this play out in the 2020 presidential race?</p><p>Let's get reaction from The Hill's editor in chief, Bob Cusack, and The Wall Street Journal's Jillian Melchior.</p><p>Bob, let me start with you.</p><p>We have had an amazing run in household wealth, but that fourth quarter obviously impacted with that massive soon in the stock market and even some softness in housing.  Obviously, those aren't the numbers that the president wants to go into in 2020.  But just how important are they?</p><p>BOB CUSACK, THE HILL:  Oh, very important, Charles.</p><p>I mean, that is what Trump has.  He has the economy.  The economy has improved.  I think what you're going to hear from the president in his reelection campaign is what you have heard from prior candidates when the economy is booming, is, are you better off than you were four years ago?</p><p>And that's something the Democrats are going to have to grapple with.  And, of course, it's a long way, Charles, before 2020.  We don't know what's going to happen with China.  And I think that's -- that China deal, if it happens, will greatly impact the market.</p><p>But, right now, it is the one thing that Trump is going to repeatedly mention, of course, going after Democrats for investigations, but the economy being something that he improved.</p><p>PAYNE:  And, Jillian, and putting even a finer point on it, the job part of this, the one thing that is really blowing me away, I got to tell you, seven consecutive months of blue-collar wage growth, more than 3 percent.</p><p>We haven't seen anything like this in well over a decade.  Six of those seven months, wages for blue-collar workers growing faster than their supervisors.  Those are jobs in the heartland.  Those are jobs that President Trump promised.</p><p>JILLIAN MELCHIOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Yes, I think we're seeing last year in October, record-breaking unemployment.</p><p>I was excited to see today that small business hiring is up.  So lots of good signs here.  And, you know, there's also a Fed paper that just came out today, and it's looking at the impact of such a tight labor market, and it's really showing that when the economy is booming, like it is right now, that no one is left behind.</p><p>So the theory here is that female workers, people of color, workers with a lack of skills or a lack of education, in a labor market this tight, businesses are going to give opportunities to all of them.  They're competing for workers.  So you're seeing wages go up, more opportunity.</p><p>So I think this is really inclusive growth.  And Democrats are playing up this identity politics game.  I think this in two ways -- I mean, it not only affects their narrative on the economics, but also some of the identity politics that they're playing up.  It's hard to say that only the 1 percent is benefiting, when it's been bottom up.</p><p>PAYNE:  Right.</p><p>And then Bob, today, Elizabeth Warren comes out with a plan to dismantle Amazon, to dismantle Google, to dismantle Facebook.  Listen, we know that everybody is angry at them.  They haven't been great actors, but the notion of government dismantling the hottest companies in America, do you think that will play with voters?</p><p>CUSACK:  I think it's going to be a tough sell for Democrats.  And that's why the Democratic Party has to worry about having a candidate that's too far left.</p><p>The Democratic Party has turned left.  We should certainly see that with the progressives in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez and others.  So Democrats have to make sure that they win the middle class.  It's something Chuck Schumer is always focused on is winning the middle class.</p><p>That is where this is going to be decided on.</p><p>PAYNE:  Right.</p><p>CUSACK:  But if they have a candidate that's too progressive, then Trump is going to be -- it's a binary choice, as you know, Charles, and he can go after their policies.</p><p>PAYNE:  Which is why many are saying that Joe Biden is the moderate hope for the Democratic Party, perhaps a savior.</p><p>Bob and Jillian, I will ask you both this.  Bob, I will let you finish and then Jillian.</p><p>Joe Biden comes in and says, yes, we have had a 10-year run.  Eight of those happened when I was part of the team that made it happen.  I mean, is he ultimately the one who could come in for the Democratic side with some sort of not only economic vision, perhaps, certainly blue-collar side, but to say I have got a resume as well?</p><p>CUSACK:  Listen, I think that Biden is -- would be somebody that Republicans -- and we talk to Republicans -- they're nervous about.  At the same time, Trump can use his numbers against the Obama administration and say, which numbers are better for the economy?</p><p>And that is the advantage Trump.  But is Biden dangerous in a general election?  Absolutely.</p><p>PAYNE:  Jillian?</p><p>MELCHIOR:  I would agree with that.</p><p>I mean, he has going for him that he's not a New Green Deal guy.  He's not somebody trying to completely from the top and bottom remake this economy that's already working.</p><p>But, at the same time, I think what we're seeing right now is that tax reform and particularly deregulation are paying off for Americans of all classes, all stripes.  And I think that comparing that to the Obama record is not great.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, it's going to be hard.  He's going to be promising things that are already happening.</p><p>Bob, Jillian, thank you both very much.</p><p>MELCHIOR:  Thank you.</p><p>CUSACK:  Thank you.</p><p>PAYNE:  Hey, did the staff of House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff coach Michael Cohen before his testimony?  That's what Republicans want to know.  If so, is it unusual?</p><p>The latest from Catherine rMDNM_Herridge on that.</p><p>Plus, meet the Republican congressman who sent  letter to Cohen demanding answers next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PAYNE:  Did former Trump attorney Michael Cohen get some coaching from his Capitol Hill testimony from the staff of Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff?</p><p>To Catherine Herridge with the latest on that -- Catherine.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon.</p><p>FOX News was the first to report that Democratic staff from the House Intelligence Committee traveled to New York four times and met with Cohen for more than 10 hours in advance of his seven-hour public testimony.</p><p>Two sources told FOX News that sessions with Cohen were wide-ranging, covering The National Enquirer's catch-and-kill policy, American media CEO David Pecker, as well as the alleged undervaluing or inflating of President Trump's assets.</p><p>What's key here is that, one by one, Democrats raised the exact same topics during Cohen's public testimony.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER ATTORNEY/FIXER FOR DONALD TRUMP:  I was involved in several of these catch-and-kill episodes.  These catch-and-kill scenarios existed between David Pecker and Mr. Trump long before I started working for him in 2007.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  And, to your knowledge, did the president ever provide inflated assets to an insurance company?</p><p>COHEN:  Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  In a statement to FOX News, a spokesman for Chairman Schiff said -- quote -- \"Despite this professed outrage by Republicans, it's completely appropriate to conduct proffer sessions and allow witnesses to review their prior testimony before the committee interviews them.  Such sessions are a routine part of every serious investigation around the country, including congressional investigations.\"</p><p>For some context, Cohen has now testified at least five times in private and public congressional hearings.  He first told the House committee over a year ago that he wasn't aware of any direct evidence showing collusion with Russia -- Charles.</p><p>PAYNE:  Catherine, thank you very much.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p>PAYNE:  And, by the way, we have called Congressman Adam Schiff for an interview.  We have yet to hear back from him.</p><p>But want to go now to Ohio Republican Congressman Michael Turner.  He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and wrote a letter to Michael Cohen demanding answers.</p><p>Sir, thanks for joining us.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL TURNER (R), OHIO:  Charles, thanks for having me.</p><p>PAYNE:  It feels like a bombshell for those of us not familiar with how all the -- how things proceed there.</p><p>You know, is this unusual?  Has this happened before?  Do you know of times, perhaps, when Republicans may have engaged in a similar kind of tactic?</p><p>TURNER:  Not like this.</p><p>And my congratulations to Catherine, Charles, because what we knew before on the Government Reform testimony, that Cohen himself had admitted that he had had contact with Democrat Adam Schiff.</p><p>And what we know now from reports, Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, is reporting that there were four trips to New York and over 10 hours of contact with Adam Schiff's staff.</p><p>To give you some perspective, he testified in front of the government reform committee for seven hours.  Let's say the Democrats were four hours of that questioning and answering.  That means that they would have spent three hours behind closed doors working with Cohen preparing him for that testimony and questioning for every hour that we got to see on TV.</p><p>Now, we thought this was a congressional hearing, how they normally are, people asking questions, contemporaneously getting answers.  Now, they say this is a public investigation, but it sounds like public and professional orchestration.</p><p>These types of contacts are very, very unusual.  And, you know, what do you do for over 10 hours of sitting down with Cohen before he testifies publicly?  You know, it absolutely rises to the level of questions of coaching and whether or not this is political theater.</p><p>PAYNE:  Do you think you can get to the bottom of this?  Do you think you can ultimately find out if, in fact, there was some sort of rehearsal session, some sort of coaching session?</p><p>And I think, more importantly as well, does this rise to the level of being illegal?  Certainly, it sounds like it perhaps is unfair with respect to being a public hearing.</p><p>TURNER:  Well, I think Democrat Adam Schiff has some answers that he owes the public, because, here, these happened behind closed doors solely with Democrat Adam Schiff's staff.</p><p>No one else was present at the time, over 10 hours of work with Michael Cohen before he came out and publicly testified.  I think that the public deserves answers as to what happened during these sessions, what was discussed?</p><p>And what we certainly know was discussed were items that were of interest to the Democrats that they brought forward to the Government Reform Committee.  They knew the answers he was going to give before they asked the questions, and that's what -- not what the American public expects.</p><p>They don't expect guiding and coaching of a witness.  If we're going to have a congressional testimony, it should be actual testimony from the witness and questions from those who are present.</p><p>PAYNE:  Right.</p><p>Adam Schiff said that it was sort of proffer -- proffer sessions and that they were routine.  At the beginning of this interview, you suggested that Republicans have done something similar.</p><p>TURNER:  No.  Actually...</p><p>PAYNE:  Tell me what the difference would be between Republicans, what they may have done in the past, compared to what you think happened in this case.</p><p>TURNER:  Yes.</p><p>So, no, I wasn't suggesting at all has happened with Republicans.  What I would -- what I think everybody would expect, that there could be some contact.  For example, it wouldn't be shocking if the aggregate of contacts between the House Oversight Committee and the House Intelligence Committee on the Democrat side in preparation for the logistics of Cohen's testimony was an hour, you know, how it's going to go down, how it's going to work, how it's structured.</p><p>At five hours, you start to get, what are you talking about?  But now we're hearing this is over 10 hours.  Over 10 hours, clearly, this is trying to affect testimony.  This is where coaching occurs.  This is where questions of theater occur and orchestration.</p><p>You know, you hear from, you know, reports on the Democrat on the Government Reform that they were proud of their performance.  Well, if it's been, you know, rehearsed, they certainly have a reason to be proud.</p><p>PAYNE:  Well, apparently, Representative Turner, if indeed there were some rehearsal, maybe they -- there was some issues about the pardoning controversy now, because whether or not Michael Cohen or a representative of Cohen approached the White House, Lanny Davis coming through in successive days with more information on that, what do you make of it?</p><p>Where are we with that?  I mean, do you think that Michael Cohen lied during that testimony?</p><p>TURNER:  You know, the only thing I'm confident where Michael Cohen has told the truth is when he pled guilty to lying to Congress.  I think, past that, you can't take much credibility in what he's saying.</p><p>You know, you have to understand that, every time he opens his mouth, as an attorney who swore to hold the confidences of his client, he's already violating his professional pledge, and that he's proven -- he's a convicted felon for having proven to have lied.</p><p>I think his guilty plea is probably the only thing that we can count on that Michael Cohen has told the truth about.</p><p>PAYNE:  Representative Mike Turner, thank you very much.  Appreciate it.</p><p>TURNER:  Thank you.</p><p>PAYNE:  We're going to drill into this later a little further with a former federal prosecutor.</p><p>And then freshman Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sparking a brand-new controversy.  Now she's claiming a pro-Israel group is coming after her and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.  And she's fund-raising off that claim.  The fallout from that is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PAYNE:  President Trump has arrived just moments ago.  That's on tape.</p><p>But it's just moments ago at Mar-a-Lago -- Palm Beach, rather, this, of course, after touring Alabama, where he met officials and victims.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PAYNE:  Republican Congressman Mike Turner slamming House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff for reportedly having a staff meet four times with Michael Cohen prior to his congressional testimony.</p><p>Former federal prosecutor Doug Burns joins us now.</p><p>Doug, it's just, you know, again, from the outside looking in, we're getting a civics lesson through all of this.</p><p>DOUG BURNS, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  Yes.  We are.</p><p>PAYNE:  We're not liking what we're learning.  Is this kosher, in your mind?</p><p>BURNS:  Well, in cases, people meet with the prosecutors all the time.  This is a lot different, though.</p><p>I mean, when you have a congressional hearing, and then the witness is meeting with that, you know, congressional committee...</p><p>PAYNE:  These are the folks who you are going to question during the meeting, and a 10-hour meeting?</p><p>BURNS:  Where I come down on all this is that people that are smarter than I am, most notably Professor Dershowitz, Ken Starr, have said, look, we're criminalizing politics, we're criminalizing political differences, we're weaponizing criminal law.</p><p>Real crime is narcotics dealing, organized crime, murder.  OK?  And here this one lied.  It's like a schoolyard.  No, he lied.  He lied.  And it's crazy.</p><p>PAYNE:  Right.</p><p>BURNS:  But, to your question, look, it is untoward, yes.</p><p>PAYNE:  All right, but these sessions, you know, ostensibly, heretofore...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE:  ... were always designed, we thought, to seek truth, to seek answers.</p><p>BURNS:  Yes.</p><p>PAYNE:  Instead, if it turns out it was all a coordinated rehearsal, then it makes a mockery of Congress and it makes a mockery of the system.</p><p>BURNS:  Mayor Giuliani famously said the truth isn't the truth.  Everybody was foaming at the mouth going crazy.  How could he say that?</p><p>He's 100 percent right, OK?  And what we mean by that is, you go into these meetings and there are subtle insinuations, maybe it happened that way, didn't it?  You sure it wasn't this way, didn't it?</p><p>So, to your point, yes, all of this weaponization, this politics stuff is not a good process for the truth.  I totally agree with you, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE:  Wow.</p><p>Speaking of wow...</p><p>BURNS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>PAYNE:  ... tongues are still wagging over the sentencing yesterday, Paul Manafort.</p><p>BURNS:  Yes.</p><p>PAYNE:  Really, a lot of people really were just caught completely off-guard, although I will say, we had a guest on last night, Gene Rossi, who said it would be a low sentence.</p><p>BURNS:  I saw that.</p><p>PAYNE:  And he gave some pretty interesting reasons for it.  And yet, today, it's being characterized as misjustice.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNS:  No, no, no, but let me clarify a couple of things.</p><p>I watched people go on television left and right saying -- quote -- \"He's going to be in prison for decades.  It's a life sentence.\"</p><p>And I was saying to myself, these people don't know what they're talking about, because what happens is, the government -- telling little tales out of school -- when you go to trial, the pre-sentence reports tend to be much, much higher than if you plead guilty, even though it's the same case.</p><p>That's a little dark secret about penalizing somebody for going to trial.  Had Paul Manafort pled guilty, everybody would have said, oh, it's eight to nine years, on the same facts, OK?  A little dark secret.</p><p>So, the point is I knew for sure that the judge wasn't going to give him 20 years.  That was...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE:  But 47 months?</p><p>BURNS:  That was 5 percent out of 100.</p><p>Forty-seven months, but there's a follow-up point real quick, was 15 percent out of 100.  The other 80 percent was six to nine years, seven to 10 years.  That's what all my friends, all the experts were telling me.  And I agreed with that.</p><p>Now, the point is, though, this is a little bit of a head-fake, because next Wednesday, Judge Jackson in the District of Columbia sentences him.  The sentence she imposed by law is consecutive, unless she determines that that she wants to make it concurrent.</p><p>I'm still trying to handicap -- I'm not there yet -- what I think she's going to do.  But the point is, if she gives him 47 months, hypothetically -- and runs it consecutive -- then he ends up with like an eight-year sentence.</p><p>PAYNE:  All right, Doug, thank you very much.</p><p>BURNS:  My pleasure.</p><p>PAYNE:  Coming up next:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I thought yesterday's vote by the House was disgraceful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAYNE:  President Trump blasting House Democrats over their resolution after the Ilhan Omar controversy.

He was in Alabama earlier today visiting the victims of a tornado that killed 23 people this past Sunday.</p><p>Jonathan Serrie is in Lee County, Alabama, with the details on the president's visit -- Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Charles.</p><p>The president and first lady started with the helicopter tour getting a bird's-eye view of just the scope of the massive amounts of damage here in Lee County, Alabama.</p><p>They then landed and took a walking tour of one of the neighborhoods that suffered some of the worst devastation.  There, they met with families who lost loved ones in Sunday's tornado.</p><p>They include the family of Sheila Creech and  Marshall Lynn Grimes, a couple that died in the storm.  Mr. Grimes' 10-year-old daughter remains hospitalized.  In fact, she wasn't well enough to go to the parents' funeral.</p><p>And the daughter's friend, 10-year-old Taylor Thornton, who was over for a visit at the time died in the storm.  Family and friends held a funeral service for Taylor this morning.</p><p>After touring the devastation, President Trump visited a church that is serving as a staging area for relief efforts.  There, he met with volunteers and first-responders and thanked them for all their hard work during the hours and days following the tornado.</p><p>He also praised Alabama Governor Kay Ivey for her handling of the disaster.</p><p>Now let's go to a live shot that we have from the town of Smiths Station.  That's about 20 miles away from where I'm standing.  You can see recovery efforts are well under way.  The president's visit is receiving praise even from the other side of the aisle.</p><p>Alabama Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat, says such visits have a way of connecting Washington politicians with communities in need on a much more intimate and enduring level.</p><p>And now coming back to our live location here in Beauregard, Alabama, look at all of this debris on the ground and up in the trees.  That's a concern as we go into the weekend, because, Charles, more severe weather is forecast for Alabama.</p><p>The worst storms are expected to pass to the north of us.  But with all this debris on the ground, even moderate winds could scatter it.  And the concern is that will slow down some of the recovery efforts -- Charles, back to you.</p><p>PAYNE:  Thank you very much, Jonathan.</p><p>Now to an official who met with President Trump in Alabama today.</p><p>Joining us on the phone, mayor of Opelika, Alabama, Gary Fuller.</p><p>Mayor, thanks for joining us.</p><p>GARY FULLER, MAYOR OF OPELIKA, ALABAMA:  Charles, my pleasure to be with you.  Thank you.</p><p>PAYNE:  First, before we talk about your visit today, give us an update on your town.  I know you have about 30,000 folks there.  How devastating was it?  And where are you now?</p><p>FULLER:  Well, thank goodness, Charles, it didn't touch Opelika.</p><p>We're about 13 miles from the community of Beauregard, so the storm was south of Opelika and Auburn.  And, of course, because of the density of the population here or in Auburn would really have been -- it's bad enough as it is with 23 lives lost.</p><p>But it would have been really a terrible, terrible thing had it moved several miles north.  But, you know, the cleanup continues.  We were very grateful to have the president and first lady with us today.  And I think they met some folks that are strong and will rebuild that community, not only in Beauregard, but in Smiths Station.</p><p>PAYNE:  Mayor, talk to us more about the president, just how important it is, how critical is it for him and the first lady to be there and how it can lift the spirits of the folks there?</p><p>FULLER:  Well, I think all of us were greatly encouraged by the fact that he would take time to come here and be with those folks that have been harmed and some of them lost everything, including family members.</p><p>But it's a great encouragement for us.  And then, of course, you know, the president has many fans in the state of Alabama, and certainly here in Lee County.  I think he probably carried Lee County in a big way back in the last election.  So he was among friends, not all of them friends, but mostly friends.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAYNE:  Right.  Yes.</p><p>FULLER:  And, of course, Senator Jones, who is our junior U.S. senator, is a Democrat.  But Senator Jones was here, and had a chance to visit with him.</p><p>And, of course, it's great to see everybody working for a common goal.  And that's to get that community rebuilt and to get it cleaned up.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, and Senator Jones is a good man.</p><p>You mentioned a common goal.  I know there's been some relief efforts and there's a relief drive going on.  How is that coming along?</p><p>FULLER:  It's almost overwhelming, Charles, the outpouring of love and prayers and contributions.</p><p>In fact, a couple of days ago, all of the agencies said, please, don't bring any more food or bottled water or blankets or clothes.  We may need those later.</p><p>PAYNE:  Right.  Right.</p><p>FULLER:  Right now, if you want to do something, give money.  And there's a number of organizations, including the Red Cross, the Lee County United Way, they're involved.</p><p>PAYNE:  Right.</p><p>FULLER:  And then the East Alabama Medical Center Foundation is involved with the Poarch Band of Creek Indians to pay for the burial of all of those deceased.</p><p>PAYNE:  We have got less than 30 seconds, but I have to give you a shout-out.</p><p>In the midst of all of this, you secured a pretty good deal for your town, an almost $6 million deal with an Indian automobile manufacturer.  Just quickly, you know, talk to us because we have been -- there's a theme in this country about businesses coming to America.</p><p>FULLER:  Charles, we think everything starts with good-paying jobs.</p><p>My friend Al Cook taught me that.  And these folks, Yongsan Automotive, that made the great decision to locate here, going to employ 150 people within three years, good jobs, good pay, that's good for everybody.</p><p>PAYNE:  It is.</p><p>Be safe.  And we really appreciate you taking the time out, Mayor Gary Fuller.</p><p>FULLER:  Thank you so much, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE:  More right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PAYNE:  President Trump slamming House Democrats and their anti-hate resolution, this coming after Minnesota freshman Ilhan Omar was accused of anti-Semitic remarks.</p><p>But Congresswoman Omar wasn't named in the resolution.  So is this an issue that's going to stay with Democrats for a while?</p><p>Let's talk to The Washington Examiner's Kelly Jane Torrance.</p><p>Kelly Jane, what are your thoughts there?</p><p>KELLY JANE TORRANCE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  I do think it's going to stay with Democrats for a while, Charles.</p><p>This resolution, I think, was just completely pointless.  It's not even that it didn't name Ilhan Omar, which is bad enough.  But they actually completely changed the resolution.  The original resolution condemned anti-Semitism, and it actually had a little bit about the history of anti-Semitism and why it is such a problem.</p><p>Well, they totally watered it down.  As James Clyburn of South Carolina said, we need to have an anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, all that stuff.  It's mind-boggling.</p><p>And, you know, Ilhan Omar was saying she thinks people are tagging her because she is Muslim.  Now, they're not.  They're worried about her because she's made anti-Semitic remarks.</p><p>PAYNE:  Right.</p><p>TORRANCE:  But by putting Islamophobia and other things in there, Democrats are making it look like they think she is right.</p><p>PAYNE:  Well, to your point, President Trump saying Democrats are now the anti-Israel, anti-Jewish party, to which Senator Schumer just releasing a tweet.</p><p>And I want to share it with the audience.  \"For the president who when neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville in front of a synagogue and said burn it down, and he said both sides are to blame, this is a new divisive low.  His comments show the president is only interested in playing politics of division and not in fighting anti-Semitism.  Mr. President, you have redefined chutzpah.\"</p><p>Your thoughts?</p><p>TORRANCE:  Well, yes, it's -- if I were President Trump, I might not decide to comment on this and call another party the party of anti-Semitism.</p><p>We have had a few Republicans who have had some issues.  But I don't really like this whataboutism.  I think the Democrats also have a problem.  Let's address it.  And I don't think the Democrats are addressing it.</p><p>And if they're not brave enough to address it, it is going to continue to be a problem for them.</p><p>PAYNE:  That's the operative word there, Kelly Jane, brave.  That was a bad move yesterday.</p><p>But, real quickly, maybe this is a bad move, too, because New York freshman Democrat AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, now fund-raising over a controversy.  She's claiming that the pro-Israeli group AIPAC is coming after her and she's raising money on this.  Your thoughts?</p><p>TORRANCE:  Again, exactly.  This is divisive politics.  This is not the way to go.</p><p>You know, AOC has been one of the people who has been really defending Omar on this.  We would have been moving on from this if Ilhan Omar had just apologized and moved on and quit making the remarks.</p><p>But she just keeps doing it.  She can't stop.  And the Democrats -- at first Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer, the Democratic leadership in the House, had a statement when Omar first made some comments.  They have wimped out since then.  And that's why people are still talking about it, because it looks like the Democrats are trying to cover up for some other Democrats.</p><p>PAYNE:  And you have got to believe it's going to happen again.</p><p>Thank you very, very much, Kelly Jane Torrance.</p><p>In the meantime, Elizabeth Warren vs. Wall Street all over again.  And this time, the Democratic senator and 2020 hopeful, well, she's targeting big tech.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PAYNE:  Democratic senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren wants to break up big tech companies, claiming companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon hurt small businesses and innovation.</p><p>We invited Senator Warren to come on the show, but her schedule today didn't allow her to join in.</p><p>Here now to discuss is Stanford University School of Business Professor David Dodson and former Republican senator -- Senate candidate for Wyoming.</p><p>David, thanks for joining us.</p><p>This isn't your typical, hey, let's break up a company or two because they're big.  She wants to dismantle prior mergers and just completely take it all apart.  Your thoughts?</p><p>DAVID DODSON, STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  Oh, it's naively mind-boggling, what she is suggesting.</p><p>I don't know if this is just a continuation of this kind of Democratic economic nanny state that is being promoted increasingly by the fringes of the Democratic Party, or it's just a political stunt where she's seen three big juicy targets, and she could take sort of a populist stand against these three companies.</p><p>Look, these companies only have two things in common.  The first is that they have been successful.  And the second is that they sell things over the Internet.</p><p>That doesn't mean that the government should take their regulatory chain saw and arbitrarily decide, if you get to be a certain size, that must be bad, and so we're going to cut you in half.</p><p>Now, we all know that there are issues with Facebook and Google in terms of privacy issues, and how ads are sold and hacking and so forth.</p><p>PAYNE:  Right.</p><p>DODSON:  But you don't solve those things by taking a chain saw and cutting the companies in half and expecting that's going to be fixed.</p><p>PAYNE:  What about consumers?</p><p>DODSON:  Consumers are not harmed because Amazon has figured out that people like me like the stuff brought to our house at a really low price.</p><p>That's why Amazon has done so well, not because they're doing anything illegal.  And, in fact, she literally said this morning that their purchase of Whole Foods was illegal.</p><p>On what basis is that illegal?</p><p>PAYNE:  Real quick, we only have 30 seconds, but what about the idea that it's not hurting the customer, but it's hurting small businesses?</p><p>DODSON:  Well, I think that's absurd, because if you look at how many -- for example, how many books have been published, self-published books on Amazon, it reached a million this year.  Never before.</p><p>More things are sold by regular people over the Internet now as a result of the democratization of the Internet, whether it's all the way from eBay back in the day, to Amazon, to Facebook and so forth.</p><p>PAYNE:  Right.</p><p>DODSON:  So these are places where people have an opportunity to sell products.</p><p>PAYNE:  David, thank you very much.</p><p>Really appreciate it.</p><p>DODSON:  Not at all.</p><p>PAYNE:  Well, big tech played a big role in keeping this bull market running, so be sure to tune in to \"Cavuto Live\" tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Eastern for special coverage on the bull market's 10-year anniversary.</p><p>In the meantime, I will be back on Monday at 2:00 p.m. Eastern for \"Making Money\" on the FOX Business Network.  We will see you then, again, tomorrow, 10 years, bull market, big deal.</p><p>So is \"The Five.\"  It starts right now.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2189811449</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMD-VTC1-DY0W-41DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7636\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it Thursday, January 31st. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. It is the busiest day for earnings so far, General Electric out last hour. The stock keeps rising over the last hour. It is now up better than nine percent on better-than-expected revenue in the fourth quarter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have an eye on big tech this morning. Facebook soaring this morning on a record profit reported last night, stock is up 11-3/4 percent even in the face of the privacy scandal. The stock to watch after the close, Amazon. Amazon shares right now up two percent. The company reports earnings after the close tonight. Markets this morning are looking at a mixed open for the broader averages.</p><p>Take a look. Dow Industrials right now down 36 points but the S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ, higher by 35 points right now. This after a sharp rally yesterday fueled by Federal Reserve. The Dow Industrials up 435 points at the close yesterday. 1-3/4 percent. The S&amp;P 500 up 41, 1-1/2 percent and the NASDAQ up 155 points, up 2-1/4 quarter percent. And the Federal Reserve officially told us they are on hold in terms of data dependency on interest rate hikes.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. The European indices right now are most higher. FT-100 up 35 points, one-half of one percent. CAC Quarante in Paris up 3-1/2 points, fractional move. DAX index in Germany down 38 points, one-third of one percent. In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look, best performer is Hong Kong and Japan, each up better than one percent.</p><p>Back in U.S. The arctic blast has turned deadly. Temperatures across the Midwest falling to their levels in decades.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's like hard to take a breath and it stick to my lungs a little bit.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The winds, the windchill is probably the worst of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have a look at when millions of Americans can expect temperatures to fall. We will tell you. Plus this, attacking the wealthy again. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz answers critics about his success. Then Roger Goodell breaks his silence. What he said about the infamous no call during the NHC championship game later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman. And former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee. Good to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you very much.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here. The kind of interesting we've been talking about for the last year really, Facebook, how much do users care about these privacy issues. And last summer we got those results looked look like maybe users aren't really digging this but this latest numbers, you got to say, it looks like users care less about the privacy issues than those of us in media.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And then they have other areas other than the Facebook business to monetize. Like with WhatsApp, Messenger, which they're not actually getting any advertising from so far. So one thing not monetize those think there's an expectations from a business perspective that there's going to be even more growth</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Instagram is kind of the great juggernaut that they have -- or that they're growing, incredibly rapidly but I point this out that because Apple banned this basically data gathering app where they were getting young people in teens to give them all data this is Facebook, Apple bans it, well -- from this app store. You know what's interesting? That self-regulation.</p><p>Again, it's not going to be the government that comes in, it's going to be all of these tech companies maybe regulating each other and realizing it might be in their best business interests to not just help them grow incredibly strong but also limit their growth.</p><p>HUCKABEE: I'm more worried about Facebook censoring content. I don't mean the censoring the classic sense of the government but deciding what people get to see, that worries me more than the privacy issue. When you sign up for Facebook, you know you're giving away privacy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But you don't realize is that Facebook is picking for you what you get to see and with 60 percent of Americans now getting most of their news from Facebook. That's really disturbing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is what the Congress is looking at and that's why got those guys, Facebook, Google executives to testify. Last year in Capitol Hill to see if in fact they are censoring conservative conversation.</p><p>HUCKABEE: And they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You mentioned Instagram, check out our Instagram post today, it is throwback Thursday. And posted a shot of way back in 1985, you posted a shot of yourself in the 80s. Where is your picture? Post your picture from throwback Thursday Instagram. I'm having the best time on Instagram.</p><p>MCDOWELLL: If I looked like you did in the 80s, I would be posting throwback photos while -- may even look like you now but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You look gorgeous.</p><p>MCDOWELLL: No, no. Maria looks like Sophia Loren and I look -- well, not so --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, come on. Throwback Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN: A lot of good looks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got some good looks this morning. So check out our Instagram pages. Meanwhile, we've got a big hour coming up. Joining the conversation this morning, Wisconsin Congressman and House Financial Services Committee member Sean Duffy is here. Former Ambassador to the U.N., Bill Richardson is with us. Along with L.A. Dodger pitcher Ross Stripling joining us this morning.</p><p>And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in as always. Don't miss a moment of it. We kick it off right here with this. General Electric shares are soaring this morning on strong earnings. Susan Li is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the details. Stock is up nine percent, Susan. Good morning to you.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Good morning to you, Maria. And congratulations for mastering Instagram. We'll talk about Facebook in just a bit. But yes, G.E. shares are higher rallying in the premarket and this is because they got a revenue beat, it's actually pretty good for G.E. as you know, it's been shrinking. There's been problems with the company. But aviation was strong for G.E. in the quarter and that offset the slowdown.</p><p>And so as some problems that we're seeing in the capital business and also their power businesses as well. G.E. also by the way settling that DOJ subprime settlements of just around $1-1/2 billion. This goes back to the 2008 financial crisis. And as you know, they have been spinning off several businesses in 2018 to spring off some cash flow and to try to make some profit.</p><p>Let's talk about Facebook because also rallying in the premarket, Faceboook shares and as you mentioned stories doing very well for them on Instagram and also on Facebook as well. And they grew, daily active users and all geographic locations and this is after a downturn of course in Europe and also plateau in North America. So that's important to watch. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Susan. Thank you so much. Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade, the President tweeting about it this morning saying this, China's top trade negotiators are in the United States meeting with our representatives. Meeting are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides. China does not want to -- an increase in tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal, they're correct.</p><p>I will be meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in Oval Office, no final deal will be made until my friend, President Xi and I meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the longstanding and more difficult points. Very comprehensive transaction. Writes the President. He goes on to say, Chinese representatives and I are trying to do a complete deal leaving nothing unresolved on the table.</p><p>All of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully revolved. Tariffs on China increased to 25 percent on March 1st. So, all working hard to complete by that date. My next guest is the cosponsor of a bill that will give President Trump executive power to raise tariffs and joining me right now is Wisconsin Congressman, House Financial Services Committee member, Sean Duffy. Congressman, it's good to see this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN: It's good to be with you, Maria. Thanks for having me on.</p><p>DOBBS: So in the President's tweet just now, he said everything is on the table, all of these tough issues, does that mean that he is also talking about espionage, the forced transfer of technology and the I.P. theft?</p><p>DUFFY: Absolutely. I think he is talking about all these issues. When you have a relationship with trading partner like China, you can't do business for very long. We have a country like China stealing our intellectual property or the force transfer of intellectual property. So, yes. No, this is all on the table. Here's what I think is going on now, Maria. We understand that China lies and they cheat and they steal, right?</p><p>So we want to get a deal before March 1st so we don't have that increase in tariffs. But I don't know that all the other tariffs currently imposed are going to come off on March 1st if a deal is struck because even if you get a deal with China, are they going to implement the deal? And that's going to take time. So, we got to actually -- we don't have this trust but verify like Reagan said with the Russians.</p><p>We have I think a philosophy of don't trust and verify with the Chinese because we -- they can sign a document with us, an agreement with us but that doesn't mean they're going to implement that document. So, folks, if a deal comes and tariffs are lifted, I don't think that's a strategy right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we know that because they did that on beef, right? They said that they would buy certain amount of beef and then they didn't.</p><p>DUFFY: Right. Yes. You're absolutely correct. And, so, you know, again, I -- we believe in free trade and we think, you know, having a great trading partner like China where we can, you know, lower tariffs and respect each other's intellectual property is a great relationship but when you see the rising threat of China militarily and their -- and their substantial growth, we have to take a second look at, you know, what they're doing and what risk that poses to our to American way one of life.</p><p>And by the way, Maria, what's -- you know, what President Trump has done brilliantly is, you know, because of these tariffs but also, you know, the knowledge of the force transfer of technology, you see the whole global supply chain changing away from China. And you can't do business for that long when you steal a technology to people who come to your country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DUFFY: And Americans are getting -- China is not a good home for business. There's other places that we can go outside of China and it's having a real impact even on American earnings as you reported are American companies missing some of their numbers, Apple, Nvidia because of lack of sales that are happening inside of China because of the slowdown that has been led by Donald Trump --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you know, it's interesting because we actually had Steve Ballmer on a couple of months ago, former CEO of Microsoft and he said that the theft from China costs Microsoft $10 billion in profits because 90 percent of the companies in China use the Microsoft operating system only a fraction, one percent actually pay for it. So, there's all of this theft going on.</p><p>What are the metrics that you want to use to check to verify that in fact if you do do a deal that they will follow through on it? And do I hear you saying that there is no way that tariffs are going to be gone? That you can't lift tariffs at all because you can't trust what they say they're going to follow through on?</p><p>DUFFY: Yes. I think metric is time, Maria. I mean, we have to give this time to see with actual implementation. And so I don't know if that's a year or two years, I think -- I think you have a longer runway here on the tariff front with China but you might mentioned intellectual property I think the Chinese are suing us at the WTO for $50 billion of tariffs that President Trump put on the Chinese for intellectual property theft.</p><p>And our analysis is that they steel $250 to $600 billion a year of American technology and they're -- they have their goal to sue us over the $50 billion in tariffs. I mean, this is rich stuff with the Chinese and I just -- I think we have a president -- President Trump who's willing to actually fight this out for the American people and try to win for our country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me -- let me switch gears and ask you about Foxconn, a major reversal. We talked about you in the electronics' giant first announced their new Wisconsin factory that was supposed to bring blue collar manufacturing jobs. Now the research centers for scientists and engineers. Congressman, what about the manufacturing jobs, how disappointed are you by this reversal?</p><p>DUFFY: So they're still -- they're still committed to the R&amp;D side of it but you're right on the manufacturing side. They haven't necessarily pulled out but they have signaled that they will on the manufacturing side of Foxconn. And Maria, first of all, so they invested $100 million in the University of Wisconsin system to train our workers. That's fantastic. They bought buildings, they have land to build their facilities.</p><p>But what's happening, Wisconsin, why is this decision made? Scott Walker lost. The guy that won, Tony Evers in Wisconsin was bashing this deal from the very beginning. So now you have an unfriendly government in Wisconsin who doesn't want Foxconn there. This a massive investment. And if you're going to make it, you better have a governor who goes, yes, you know, come to my state, bring us the jobs, I'm happy to have you.</p><p>And that's hasn't been Tony Evers. And so, they've been attacking this deal from the very beginning. I don't think this will happen if Scott Walker had won in Wisconsin but it is now because, you know, business -- Foxconn is under attack in our state because of our new governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. So you -- so you blame the new governor as --</p><p>DUFFY: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For this, how many jobs will be cut then?</p><p>DUFFY: Well, so they haven't walked away. They had a promise of 13 million jobs to $10-billion investment. They haven't walked away from that number. And by the way, the incentives that we gave for Foxconn to come were tied to the investment and the jobs. And so they just missed a $10- million incentive because they didn't hit the job number. So, again, this is still up in the air for us but if you're Foxconn, you really have to consider the politics of our state and what's changed in the last, you know, two months.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. All right. Before you go, what are you dealing with, negative 26 degrees right there in Wisconsin, Congressman?</p><p>DUFFY: Yes. So, it's 27 below, windchills hit up to 50 below, just have been -- people don't get this in the south but our cars don't start here. The post office, it never shuts down, the post office is shut down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY: Our ski hill is shut down. My Congressional office yesterday was shut down. People couldn't get to work. So, you know, it's crazy cold and by the way, kids, we have eight kids, seven of them are at home, you coop up kids for two days in the house because they can't go outside.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh my god.</p><p>DUFFY: Crazy fights are going and you can only watch so many movies, Maria, and play some of the games monopoly before your house is ready to explode.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, the whole Midwest experiencing the coldest temperatures in decades, so they're staying home from school, right?</p><p>DUFFY: Yes. You can't send these little kids out waiting, you know, for a bus to go to school. I mean, listen you people get hurt in this kind of weather. So it breaks today, this afternoon we start to see a breaks. We go from minus 27, I think we have a high today of minus four. That's the heat wave that's coming our way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>DUFFY: And if I can make one last point, Maria, I just watch through the 80s and 90s, I have pull up Instagram pictures of your throwback Thursday. Huge fan when you're on other networks, I'm a huge fan of you here. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you.</p><p>DUFFY: -- I'm looking forward too. If Dagen is up, so we're going to check out Dagen from back in the 80s.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY: You know, she has some big, you know, 80s hair.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love the throwback Thursday, yes. Well, that picture that I posted in the Instagram is from 1985. Post your picture, Congressman. Thank you so much.</p><p>DUFFY: I got some really bad ones too. I got big old -- yes. Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll see you soon. Sean Duffy joining us there. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, the Midwest is facing the coldest temperatures in decades. The extreme freeze is turning deadly. Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Weather Center right now with the very latest. Janice?</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST: Hi, Maria. Yes. Unfortunately, we're going to have one more day of this and then the cold air will start to retreat but you can see the windchill is most dangerous part of this cold air. Is across the northern plains, the great lakes, now into the northeast where it feels like minus 13 in New York, it feels like zero in D.C. but minus 40 Fargo, minus 41 is what it feels like in Chicago.</p><p>Those incredible pictures coming out of Chicago of the rivers just freezing. Green Bay, air temperature, minus 23, windchill minus 23, air temperature in Chicago by the way is minus 21 but it is the windchill that's potentially deadly. That's why people are urged to stay indoors. If you've got kids, if you got pets and you want to check on the elderly. Today will be the really cold day and things will start to improve Friday.</p><p>But windchill advisories and warnings in place for millions of people where the windchill is anywhere from minus 25 to minus 60 especially across the northern plains in the upper Midwest. OK. So here is our polar vortex that is dipped as far south as the Tennessee River Valley, Ohio. By Saturday it retreats up into Canada but we're not done yet heading into Monday. We start to see it move southward again across the plain states across the great lakes.</p><p>So we're not done. Now, this cold air, the really cold air is probably done for the season but we're still going to see below freezing temperatures as we get into next week. But I will tell you as we head into the weekend, Maria, look at this, so minus one, today is the daytime high for Minneapolis but will be in the 40s by Sunday. And then, Monday, things will start to come down again.</p><p>Here is Chicago where we are dealing with minus 40 degree windchills, by Saturday and Sunday even Monday, 53 degrees. I mean, that is a 60-degree temperature difference from today and Monday. So something we're going to have to watch. These are weather extremes. Certainly, we'll watch it. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Janice. Thanks so much. Janice Dean with the latest there. Coming up. We are watching markets this morning on last trading day of the month today. Busiest day for earnings. Dow Industrials down 51, S&amp;P and NASDAQ up. Next up, L.A. Dodgers pitcher turns stock broker, Ross Stripling in the house with his take on market action.</p><p>Then breaking his silence, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell finally speaks out on the controversial no call that knocked the Saints off the path to the Super Bowl. What he had to say right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets in focus this morning, futures indicating a mixed opening for the markets this morning on this. The last trading day of the month. Dow Industrials expected to be down 60 points, S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are higher fractionally. This after the major indices rallied yesterday big time after the Federal Reserve indicated it has done raising interest rates for now, it will be data dependent.</p><p>But the Dow Industrials were as high as 500 points, better than 500. it ended up 434 on the Dow. 154 points higher on the NASDAQ. Joining us right now is Los Angeles Dodgers all-star pitcher and B. Riley Wealth Management stock broker, Ross Stripling. Ross, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>ROSS STRIPLING, STOCK BROKER, B. RILEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Good morning, Maria. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we got to talk sports but we want to first talk money. Tell us what you think about what you heard from the Fed yesterday and how you're telling clients to allocate capital right now.</p><p>STRIPLING: Yes. You know, that was definitely optimistic, you know, coming out and saying that, you know, our economy is growing, spending is strong, they're going to be patient moving forward with the -- with the rate hikes, you know, October, November, December were certainly ugly for me as a -- as a growth investor, you know, that got out of hand but, you know, I definitely think we got oversold.</p><p>And, you know, so we're kind of telling investors, you know, it's a good time to be patient and a good time to be, you know, long-term mined I think if you think back to January 2016,you know, it definitely got oversold in that month and then all the market did was rally 10,000 points over the next two years. So, I think it's a good time to be patient, you're getting a good -- so you can get some good names at low valuations and obviously, get some of that money back lost that we lost late last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>FREEMAN: Can we go to baseball questions?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Go for it.</p><p>FREEMAN: OK. So -- I apologize, I didn't watch this when it happened but Wikipedia says, your very first major league start, you had no hitter into the 7th inning and you got pulled out.</p><p>STRIPLING: Yes, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: So this is --</p><p>STRIPLING: Yes. Thanks for bringing that back up. No, I'm just kidding.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: Basically, the highs and lows of baseball in your first professional appearance.</p><p>STRIPLING: Yes. I mean, man, if you just think about what goes into the - - to a debut of Major League Baseball, I mean, I was just so nervous that day and then to finally get up to game time and then to -- like you said, to be able to go over seven innings of no-hit baseball and then -- and then you get pulled. I mean, it happens so fast, you know, and I certainly thought about it more since then that, you know, things that will never get to know how would have finished but I've always said that I understood the decision to pull me out.</p><p>I was coming off for Tommy John surgery, I've already thrown a hundred pitches, that was the most I've thrown in two years. So, you know, we'll never know how it would have ended like I said but I've have always been open about understanding that decision and, you know, maybe I'll get another shot and no-hitter someday.</p><p>MINERD: Hey, Ross, this is Mike Huckabee and one of the things that I'm most intrigue by is your use of data to prepare for ballgames. It sounded like a real-life version of Moneyball in modern times. So explain how do you collect the data and how do you go about using that to plan your own pitching strategy because I think that's fascinating.</p><p>STRIPLING: Sure. You know, I'll try and give you the shortest version of that question as possible. And, you know, the Dodgers are probably kind of leading the way in all that, you know, analytics and things like that. So we have a whole division that kind of gets the data for me and I mean, they can give you as much as you want and I -- at first when I got up I wanted it all, just give me all the data possible and I will just get what I want out of it.</p><p>But now, after three years, you know, you got to cut it down to what you want which is usually, you know, what guys slug in certain counts, what they hit the hardest, what's their biggest swing and missed pitch. You can even look like what the man on second base, you know, do they get more aggressive. There's just tons of data out there, so you kind of pick and choose what you want and use it when you're on the mound.</p><p>That way you're not just like boggled down with data while you're on the mound, you know, at the end of the day you just got to trust your ability to get major league hitters out but you want to use to it come up with a plan and each guy is different and you go over with your pitching coach and your catcher and all of that and you have a plan against every batter, one through nine for any situation and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is --</p><p>STRIPLING: -- you know, that's kind of thought. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is really smart. Let me ask you before you go, Ross, Super Bowl 53, three days away, who are you betting on? Your hometown Rams or the Patriots?</p><p>STRIPLING: Yes. I got to go hometown Rams. I think McVay have some up his sleeve that Bellatrix never seen and they made a lot of acquisitions in offseason on that defense, maybe they can get a big stop on Brady. So I'll take the Rams.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching. Ross, great to have you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>STRIPLING: Thank you, guys. Have a good one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ross Stripling joining us. Make sure you tune in tomorrow, we'll bring you live coverage of the January jobs' report starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.

Blake Burman is live this morning at the White House with the very latest. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Maria, good morning to you as well. Just one meeting among that group, 17 Democrats, Republicans trying to hash out a border security package, and already this morning, we are seeing a pretty big amount of frustration being expressed by President Trump. Just moments ago, he sent out the following tweet about that group saying the following quote, \"Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time. Democrats, despite all of the evidence proof and caravans coming are not goings to give money to build the desperately needed wall. I've got you covered, wall is already being built, I don't expect much help.\"</p><p>You'll remember over the last few weeks as well as the President was trying to hash out a deal or at least Democrats and Republicans were, about securing wall funding that the President said, Well maybe we can call this steel slats or a physical barrier. Doesn't need necessarily need to be called a wall. He's backing off that today as well because he tweeted this this morning, \"Let's just call them wolves from now on, and stop political games, a wall is wall, give you a pretty good idea of where his mindset is after just one meeting from this group up on Capitol Hill. Meantime, the Pentagon says that several thousand more troops are going to be heading to the Southern Border. The Undersecretary for policy testifying up on Capitol Hill earlier this week that several caravans are headed north.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN C. ROOD, UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY: Current information shows a caravan of over 12,000 people. There's three that we are tracking, the Department of Homeland Security's tracking en route, and one of which is over 12,000 people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Didn't get an exact number from the Pentagon, Maria. Currently, there are 2,500 give or take active duty service members down at the Southern border. That is down from a high of nearly 6,000, but the pentagon says several thousand more are headed that way. Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Blake. Thank you so much. Blake Burman at the White House this morning. Let's bring in Former New Mexico Governor, Former Ambassador to the United Nations, and Former Presidential Candidate, Bill Richardson. Good to see you, sir. Thank you so much for joining us this day, this mooring.</p><p>BILL RICHARDSON (D), FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean this whole idea of -- that they can't get together, on an agreement for the wall or for any kind of barrier, what do you think this means? I mean is this going to be the next two years where the Congressional Democrats are constantly resisting everything the President wants?</p><p>RICHARDSON: Well, the first thing you need to do is the President needs to get off this idea that unless he gets his way, there's going to be a government shutdown. That was very damaging to the country. And I think to the President, too. This is early. Look, the early talks, did not go well yesterday. But we got until February 15th. You don't negotiate until the very end to get the best deal for both of you. But, look, if there are more caravans, we're sending more troops. I was a border governor, like Mike Huckabee, governors, we got to deal with these things directly.</p><p>What we need is more border detection equipment at the border crossings, Coast Guard needs to have more facilities. You don't need a wall. You go under a wall, over a wall, you have tunnels like El Chapo. That's not going to solve the problem. Let's have significant border security and agree on increase border patrol agents' budget --</p><p>RICHARDSON: That's the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Governor, I want to -- I want to bring in Governor Huckabee in a moment, but you said we don't need a wall. Are -- isn't it true though that in some border security agree on we need a wall. For example, there is a wall in Nancy Pelosi state right now, which separates Tijuana and San Diego. We're at the very dense area. You've got three million people on one side of the Tijuana wall, and other three million people on the other side in San Diego. If you tear down that wall, isn't it -- doesn't it -- I mean do you think those people would just assimilate into the United States?</p><p>RICHARDSON: Well, look, I'm not advocating tearing down what is existing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, but you said we don't need a wall.</p><p>RICHARDSON: I'm saying that for the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That wall worked. Would you say that that will work?</p><p>RICHARDSON: No. Well, that deal does not -- or no.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It doesn't work?</p><p>RICHARDSON: That wall --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So then why not tear it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON: No, it's -- no, it's not working. It's not working. It's that they have good border patrol agents, detection equipment, they know what they're doing ---</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you would be OK tearing it down then?</p><p>RICHARDSON: -- they have (INAUDIBLE) the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So then you would be OK tearing it down?</p><p>RICHARDSON: Makes no difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You don't think that the three million people on the Tijuana side would assimilate into the three million people in the San Diego (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>RICHARDSON: No, I don't. I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Without that wall?</p><p>RICHARDSON: I don't. You're using scare tactics. No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm not scare -- I'm just saying the facts, sir.</p><p>RICHARDSON: Border enforcement -- no, no, no, you're not. Those are not facts. Border immigration --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON: -- illegal immigration has gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's not factual about what I just said?</p><p>RICHARDSON: It's gone down. It's gone down. Totally all across the border. It's gone down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All I'm asking you is does that wall work to separate Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>RICHARDSON: I don't think it makes much of a difference, but I'm saying leave it where it is. But give them more resource, more border patrol agents detection equipment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, I think the President's just saying that as well.</p><p>RICHARDSON: Go in depth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mike Huckabee, jump in here because I think that the President does want a wall in certain areas but in other areas said, you said that agrees with the Democrats in terms of technology and drones.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Ambassador, you're one of my favorite democrats. You know I love you, but I remember when Duncan Hunter was the one who put the appropriation in for that wall in San Diego, 95 percent of the drug trafficking stopped. I'm looking at Israel. They put up a wall, a security fence. They were condemned for it, but they went from a thousand suicide bombers. I agree that walls don't need to go for the entire border because there are certain y natural barriers, some electronics, but I just can't believe that people say that walls in certain places, whether it's a fence, whether it's a steel slat, just would not have an effect, and if that's true then we should tear down the 600 miles that we already have, and I don't know of anybody who realistically thinks that makes good sense.</p><p>RICHARDSON: Well, Mike, first of all, the tactics that are being used to get that wall, which I think is very dubious to build because I don't think it'll work and it's too expensive is that if the President doesn't get his way, he's going to shut down the government, and he's going to do harm to 800,000 Federal workers, businesses, and then this wall, Mike, I mean it's going to take landowners out of there, it's going to take ranchers, indigenous people, wildlife. You're right, and most of the border, you can't build the wall because of the hills, because of the terrain, so --</p><p>HUCKABEE: But Bill he has been very flexible in saying that it's a combination of all of those things, it's not just a wall. But you say he's not been willing to give. I've not seen Nancy Pelosi give one inch, not one inch, and he's offering DACA, he's offering all sorts of concessions, he's making compromise, but where -- tell me exactly where Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer is offering any kind of concession or compromise. I can't find it.</p><p>RICHARDSON: Well, they are offering significant funding increases in Border Enforcement and Detection Equipment, that will work, that will work, Mike. And then the President --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But that's not just to answer President Trump. That's because --</p><p>RICHARDSON: -- says, \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down -- I'm going to shut down the government. That is unprecedented, that is damaging the country. Are we going to allow any President, they don't get their way, that the answer's got to be I'm going to down the go of year? Mike you're a good politician. You're my favorite Republican Politician. This border shutdown was not good for the President for Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, actually I think that the --</p><p>RICHARDSON: The country blinds him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, when you look at the polls, the President really didn't get impacted very much. Nancy Pelosi's approvals actually went down.</p><p>RICHARDSON: Well, I don't know what poll you're reading, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The -- and the President is tweeting -- wait. Governor, the President just tweeting this morning --</p><p>RICHARDSON: I don't know what poll you're reading. It was significant damage to the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The President is tweeting this morning. Let me tell you what he says. He says, \"Democrats are becoming the party of late-term abortion, high taxes, open borders, and crime. Your reaction.</p><p>RICHARDSON: Oh, I mean this -- you know, he's into his campaign mode. This is like when he says to his intelligence people that we spend over $20 billion in intelligence, CIA, NSA, Department of Defense --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So is that -- is that tweet incorrect?</p><p>RICHARDSON: -- all of North Korea, they're my -- they're my buddies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that -- is that tweet inaccurate? Wait, is that tweet inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON: Totally inaccurate. Totally inaccurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's inaccurate? What's inaccurate?</p><p>RICHARDSON: The whole thing. The whole thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wait, late term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON: It's like the President's saying to his intelligence fee --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- higher taxes? Which one? Later term abortion?</p><p>RICHARDSON: Totally inaccurate. Totally -- no.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Open borders? Wait, which one?</p><p>RICHARDSON: You know, this is -- this is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's inaccurate, governor?</p><p>RICHARDSON: This is ridiculous. No. Open borders? That's ridiculous. All of that is ridiculous. There should be serious negotiations right now. And it's not happening. And the President's not helping with these tweets.</p><p>RICHARDSON: You know the thing is? I mean I know that a lot of your colleagues say that they're for border security, but they didn't vote for Kate's law, they didn't vote to end Sanctuary Cities, they didn't vote for a border wall, so how can you say you're for border security when you actually haven't done so in terms of your voting record?</p><p>RICHARDSON: Well, look at what the Democrats are proposing for this showdown, one, more border patrol agents, two, more Coast Guard assistance, three, more drones, four, all kinds of new technologies that will work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why do you think they voted for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON: A border wall is not going to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why do you think they vote --</p><p>RICHARDSON: It doesn't work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why did Nancy Pelosi vote for a wall before?</p><p>RICHARDSON: That -- perhaps that wall she voted for on her border. All I'm saying is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But why is that not immoral?</p><p>RICHARDSON: -- let's make this work. Let's make this work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>RICHARDSON: But not threaten border shutdowns, not end the government working, that's what the President is saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bill Richardson --</p><p>RICHARDSON: \"If I don't get my way, I'm going to shut down the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you, sir. Thanks so much.</p><p>RICHARDSON: All right. All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bill Richardson joining us. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Facebook reporting a record profit. The stock is soaring this morning. Joining me now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hi, good morning, Maria. You know, I wasn't looking at that profit report for the profit number or profit margin, I was looking at it to see how many active monthly users they've got. When I saw that number come over, 2.7 billion, I figured that Facebook was out of the woods. Think of all the scandal, all the bad publicity, all the privacy questions that have been leveled against Facebook in the last, what, year or six months? It--- it's not touched their business. I thought that the scandal may have reduced the number of monthly users, active users on the -- on the base, but it didn't. They've actually increased. And that's why I think Facebook is up so much this morning, 11 percent gain for a stock like that is absolutely enormous. My bottom line is this, all the scandal did not touch its financial business. The heart of its business was not touched by all the political goings-on around it. Facebook, 167. Who would have thought?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's pretty incredible. You're right, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: It really is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great analysis. I know you have a lot more in about 12 minutes' time.</p><p>VARNEY: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we'll see you top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY: You got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank so much. \"Varney &amp; Co.\" begins top of the hour, 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

Shares looking this morning, up two-thirds of one percent.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO impossible 2020 independent hopeful Howard Schultz says he's surprised being attacked for being rich.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER STARBUCKS CEO: This interesting phenomenon in the last week or so where I have this moniker now of being, you know, I'm a billionaire and so don't trust him because he's a successful person. I grew up literally in public housing in the projects. And I have succeeded in America I always thought that was something to be celebrated, that my success should not be something that is punitive. My success is living proof of the promise of the country. I can't find the answers why people are all of a sudden chastising me for being successful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Many Democrats are caffeinated against him, criticizing Schultz over his potential presidential run saying he will only help to reelect President Trump. Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much, Cheryl. Listen, I'm looking at this. We are celebrating throwback Thursday this morning. We're showing you our best looks from the 80s, that's next stay, with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is throwback Thursdays here on the MORNINGS WITH MARIA set. Here's me from circa 19857. I was working in a photo lab, printing pictures.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I told you, Sophia Loren.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Care-free days. I don't even know that I was thinking about what stock to buy. I don't even know that I was thinking about me being a journalist.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Look at this complexion. This is even before -- well, it's before the internet really, but the no photo filters, you're glowing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's see yours, Dagen McDowell. Come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. I told you I'm really ugly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do they have it?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wait, Governor Huckabee with his daughter. OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, there I am.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's Dagen.</p><p>HUCKABEE: There's Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I jumped in a swimming pool fully clothed right after that was taken. And I am not making that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And this is about 1980 --</p><p>MCDOWELL: 88.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 88.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was the summer after my freshman year in college.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Governor Huckabee with your daughter, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. Aww. That is too cute.</p><p>HUCKABEE: That's about 1984. She was about two years old at that time. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So great. That's beautiful shot. And lastly, the photo James Freeman gave us.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, so this is me. You asked for a throwback --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Come on, James.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- Thursday photo of James Freeman. Apparently, this is the Reverend James Freeman. Apparently, he was an outstanding preacher. Governor, you might want to grade his performance, I don't know, but very influential in Boston. My kids ran across this a few weeks ago while sightseeing, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You couldn't find any shots of yourself as a baby.</p><p>FREEMAN: I -- well, I did -- if you give me more time, I'll try and find it. But I told you, I never went with the mullet. My great regret, so I don't know if we're going to have really fun 80s photos, but I'll do my best.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Next Thursday.</p><p>FREEMAN: OK. Deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Next Thursday, we'll do another throwback Thursday, how's that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK. You got to let me know in advance and so we I can dig some photos out of my -- well --</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.

Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Happy Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, September 23rd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures are off of the lows this morning, take a look. Dow Industrials are still negative, down 12 points. But the S&amp;P 500 has turned positive. It's up 1.75. And the Nasdaq is also 5 and above 14.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This on top of last week where the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P posted a losing week. But they are still within striking distance of hitting all- time highs. Last week the Dow was down about 1 percent on the week.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. In Europe today, we are looking at a down session. Ft 100 down 28 points, a third of a percent. CAC 40 in Paris is down 53, that's almost 1 percent. And the DAX index in Germany 131 points right now, better than 1 percent.</p><p>There were signs of a slowdown in Europe, manufacturing sentiment in the eurozone down in September to the worst level in seven years. We also got the PMI, the purchasing manager's index is out of Germany and France this morning, they came in well below expectations.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed market there. Japan is closed for a national holiday. The Shanghai was down almost 1 percent in China.</p><p>The General Motors strike meanwhile is entering is entering day eight. Reports say important progress has been made but we could still be far from seeing workers back on the assembly line.</p><p>We're going to have the very latest there as GM shares down this morning, about three-quarters of 1 percent.</p><p>The Saudi oilfield attack repairs could take months, not weeks. The steps Saudi Aramco is taking to get full production back online.</p><p>And then the CEO of Wework could be on the way out, Board members reportedly pushing to oust Adam Newman after the company delayed its IPO.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning. And joining me to break it all down. Payne Capital Management president, Ryan Payne is here. Fox News contributor, columnist for \"The Hill\", Liz Peek. And the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor James Freeman.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\". Good to be here. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We're talking about Ukraine. We're talking markets. What else is important this morning?</p><p>PEEK: We're talking Europe being stagnant and smug at the same time. Germany passes a green measure which does not allow them to -- and raises taxes at the same time. It's almost unimaginable.</p><p>The country is being run by committee and it's a mess, in my view.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hey -- no wonder they've got negative interest rates in Europe.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They can't generate economic growth.</p><p>PEEK: It's incredible. I mean honestly, Germany has natural gas. Had they decided to exploit their natural gas reserves, their emissions would be going down which they're not. Yet they lecture us all the time. I mean it's really -- it's kind of crazy making honestly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is there any reason to buy Europe right now from your standpoint?</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PAYNE MANAGEMENT: I love Europe.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You love -- well, from a stock standpoint.</p><p>PEEK: We're not talking about travel.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, now you just move (INAUDIBLE) standpoint. I mean look, we know the slowing has been kind of priced into the market. But I also think that remember, most European economies are running a surplus right now, besides Greece and France. And right now we have a $1 trillion deficit in the last 12 months.</p><p>So I mean they're balance sheets are actually --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you saw those PMis.</p><p>PAYNE: We knew that, right. That wasn't a surprise. We knew manufacturing was going to slow but you have to look at their domestic economies. They've been relatively resilient here. I mean, you know, they haven't really gone that far into the negative.</p><p>And as an investor, you just have to love those low valuations right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Evaluations certainly are different than for the U.S. is in terms of valuations. I'll give you that.</p><p>Meanwhile our top story this hour, President Trump on the world stage this week. The U.N. General assembly kicking off today amid tense Middle East relations.</p><p>Iranian President Rouhani slamming the latest round of U.S. sanctions on the rogue regime as, quote, desperate, according to him.</p><p>And now, new this morning, the rogue regime also freeing a British tanker it seized back in July, ending a monthlong standoff with the U.K. ahead of the U.N. Summit.</p><p>I spoke exclusively this weekend with Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Lindsey Graham on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".</p><p>He outlined how he would like to see the U.S. respond.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What kind of a response do you want to see from the United States?</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: I hope the President will put on table a military option that will restore deterrence because sanctions are not enough.</p><p>I give the President a ton of credit for taking Iran on. But this is a defining moment in his presidency. I think President Trump has been strong on China, strong on ISIS, Strong on North Korea strong on Iran.</p><p>But the Iranians are acting out in a very dangerous way. By attacking the Saudi Arabian oilfield, they have attacked the world economy. It's in our national security interest to protect Mideast energy supplies even though we're less dependent. It is in our national security interest to protect the navigation of the seas.</p><p>And this is a rogue regime. Do to what Iran now what Reagan did to them in 80s when they acted up. You will restore deterrents Mr. President. They will not get in an all-out war with the United States because that will be the end of the regime.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Pennsylvania Congressman, member of the Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committee and Iraq War Veteran -- Guy Reschenthaler.</p><p>And Congressman, it is good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.</p><p>REP. GUY RESHENTHALER (R-PA): Thanks for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean given your experience -- thank you for your service to our great country, by the way --</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So from your stand point, do you want to see a military option on the table for the U.S. to respond to Iran?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Well, I think we always need have a military option on the table. That helps us with deterrence. But I can tell you that, Iran is acting out. They've been acting out for several years. But it's heightened because of the maximum applied pressure the Trump administration is putting on the regime.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean Lindsey Graham and General Jack Keane, four star general will say if there is not a response from the United States, Iran will continue to poke and continue doing things to just get back at the U.S. because of taking the country out of the Iran Nuclear Deal.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Right. Well, that's absolutely correct. Iran will keep acting out. They're really trying to put pressure on Europe because they think that Europe will crack. They'll bend, they won't honor the sanctions. That's why we have to work really hard to make sure Europeans stand with us. That's why we need to make sure that these sanctions actually work.</p><p>But you're absolutely right. We can never take the military option off the table. If we do, then we lose all pressure we have on Iran.</p><p>FREEMAN: Congressman -- hi. James Freeman of the \"Wall Street Journal\". Speaking of potential military action, what about Saudi Arabia? Who you expect them to respond to Iran and is there a reason why they don't have that capability? I know they buy a lot of American military equipment. I think it's the third largest defense budget in the world.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Right. Well, you have to remember, Iran has one of the strongest militaries in the world and we are the hegemonic super power in the Middle East. We have put troops, more troops in Saudi Arabia. We're helping with their missile defense.</p><p>But if there is going to be an engagement, it will more than likely be one that's led by the United States, but, of course, alongside our allies such as Saudi Arabia.</p><p>PEEK: Congressman -- I have heard that there is no question that Iran was behind this attack, and yet France continues to question the evidence and so forth. France obviously has a different agenda and we want them on- board with our pushback to Iran.</p><p>What is it going to take to put them there? What is it that France is hoping to achieve by this kind middling ground?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Right. Well, we've got to keep the Europeans with us, and sadly the Europeans really have the most to lose because if they're not with us on sanctions, if they're not helping with diplomatic options, then it makes actual kinetic operations more likely which we all want to avoid.</p><p>So by standing with us, the French and the Europeans actually help us avoid an actual military engagement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about these waivers? I mean the U.S., you know, renewed those sanction waivers for nuclear programs and for Europeans to do business with Iran. I mean, is that the issue here, that the Europeans still want to buy gas from Iran?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Right. Well, the Europeans are much more susceptible to energy prices. We have to remember, the unsung hero here and that is frackers in the United States -- Pennsylvania and Texas.</p><p>If we didn't have natural gas development in the United States, we would probably be in a recession, oil prices would be skyrocketing.</p><p>Because the Europeans, particularly the Germans, won't allow fracking and horizontal drilling, they're much more susceptible to market swings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, somebody needs to tell the Germans about what the U.S. has been doing so that the Germans understand they don't necessarily need Iran for this.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Right. Well, drilling for natural gas is a win on all fronts because you have energy independence or you move toward energy independence. Your carbon emissions are reduced because natural gas is much cleaner.</p><p>I wish that the Europeans would take a look at our boom -- our natural gas boom, and see what we're exporting energy, that we're much less susceptible to the whims of the OPEC nations. Unfortunately, they're not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about this impeachment inquiry, controversy swirling around the president's July phone call with Ukrainian president. The president admitted that he did discuss former vice president Joe Biden on the call and that's sparking calls for impeachment once again. Is this more Russia collusion speculation all over again?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Well, as far as the so-called whistleblower, let's see what the whistleblower says to the House Intel and the Senate Intel Committees when the whistleblower comes to testify.</p><p>But I can tell you that for impeachment, the American people don't want to go down this road. And unfortunately Jerry Nadler has taken the bait. He's trying to appease his far left radical base. He can have -- what I would call impeachment lite in the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>We have got to remember that for impeachment proceedings to begin the entire floor has to vote on that. The democrats have tried three times to call for impeachment and they failed three times on the floor.</p><p>So they're trying to have their cake and eat it too. With Jerry Nadler having this faux impeachment style proceedings in the House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. the problem is, it's so irresponsible, I think, because I mean even today there's almost like half of America still thinks that there's a possibility of collusion.</p><p>I mean the bad information and the misinformation coming out as a result of these calls, the Democrats and the media, is really irresponsible. And I think that's one of the reasons that the Chinese reneged on that deal that the U.S. had in place. He said they were 90 percent there back in April. Because China is over there thinking that oh, well I'm going to be done with this guy in a couple years because of the collusion story.</p><p>Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning. Thank you.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I've got to get your take. And to you -- we appreciate you joining us. We'll see you soon.</p><p>Want to get your take on this next breaking news story -- guys. Snap reportedly been in talks with the Federal Trade Commission regarding Facebook.</p><p>Snap is compiling a dossier of ways Facebook attempted to thwart competition, according to Dow Jones. The reports also says its start up founders who sold their companies to Facebook are also talking to the FTC. Looks like everybody is getting on board to take Facebook down.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. We'll it's going to be going to be interesting. Because this question of what is the consumer harm has been looming behind all of this and the regulators have said we're going to look at a lot of these big techs including Facebook, to see their level of dominance in the market and the impact.</p><p>And it hasn't been entirely clear what exactly they were looking at and what they were planning to allege if they're going to bring a case on consumer harm. So maybe this is now something concrete that we can evaluate and discuss.</p><p>PEEK: But the answer here, the solution is not going back and investigating the Instagram acquisition by Facebook. It is preventing further acquisitions because new startups will challenge this company and Google and other companies. If the government is serious about anti-trust, that's what they should focus on.</p><p>I mean I think a lot of this is political show but there is an issue here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But how serious is the issue of censoring of conservative conversation? Right now, you've got Devin Nunes suing Twitter. You've got Tulsi Gabbard suing Google for all of these reasons, for that reason of censorship.</p><p>PEEK: I think it's a very serious issue. If you go back and look at some of the complaints, it's not a joke. It's not something that right wing people have sort of made up out of thin air.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>PEEK: There is definitely a political bias. When they say it's just the algorithms -- those algorithms are written by people. Those people have a bias and it shows up in the way they write the algorithm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's important because, you know, I mean big tech -- when you Google something during 2016, during the election there, you Google Hillary Clinton -- you got all best thing since sliced bread stories. Then you Google Donald Trump, and it was all he's horrible, he's this and that.</p><p>I mean: the way that they set up the search results was biased.</p><p>PEEK: No question.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, they've gone with this algorithm excuse or honest mistake excuse but Josh Holly tweeted last week that Zuckerberg told him, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that it was bias in one of the recent episodes where they essentially blocked some conservative content.</p><p>So it's going to be interesting what comes out of that. There was no more algorithm excuse with that one apparently.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. We've got a lot to talk about this morning. We've a big show. Joining the conversation, President Trump's lawyer and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani is here this morning. Along with White House press secretary for President Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, Stephanie Grisham is joining us this morning along with House Judiciary committee ranking member Georgia Congressman Doug Collins.</p><p>We've got a big two hours coming up. Don't miss a moment of it coming up next.</p><p>And then first, Aramco worries. The Saudi state oil giant says that repairs to its facilities may take longer than expected. The impact on crude coming up.</p><p>Then workers at Wework, company board members looking to oust the CEO. We will take a look at whether this will put the IPO back on track. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tropical storms bearing down on Puerto Rico and Bermuda this morning. Cheryl Casone with headline now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes. the season is under way, Maria.</p><p>Karen (ph) is moving across the southeastern Caribbean Sea, prompting tropical storm warnings for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as well. Heavy rain and flooding expected for this week.</p><p>And then you've got, tropical storm Jerry -- which could pass near Bermuda tomorrow night. That storm is packing sustained winds of up to 65 miles per hour.</p><p>We're also watching this across the pond, Saudi Aramco's repairs could take months longer than the company originally expected. This is what contractors are saying according to the wall street journal this morning. Aramco is in emergency talks with service providers, offering to pay a premium rate for a speedy recovery and rebelled. But it could take months instead of the 10 weeks so it's a promise by Aramco. Two Aramco sites hit during attacks back on September 14th.</p><p>And then there's this -- some progressive healthcare proposals by Democratic presidential candidates getting mixed reviews from voters. This is according to a new \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC News poll.</p><p>So that survey found that two thirds of registered voters support expanding Medicare but more than half opposed -- get this Maria -- Medicare for all, that would replace private insurers.</p><p>Because according to the polling their current health insurance and don't want the government to run it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like hundreds of millions -- possibly. I don't know, 180 million people --</p><p>PEEK: Like all those UAW strikers. I mean that's always been something I could not understand why Democrats are so insistent on Medicare for all where their biggest constituents, the labor unions, have the best benefits on earth. That seems like a head scratcher.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they're certainly upset this morning, once again at GM. We're entering strike week two, the UAW and GM still at odds over the contract, healthcare benefits included. The sticking points when we come back.</p><p>And then Disney dreams coming true with its streaming service now available for preorder. We've got all the details on that when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The United Auto Workers strike against General Motors now in its second week. Both sides say they're still at odds but there are reports that important progress has been made.</p><p>Joining us right now is the \"Detroit Free Press\" senior content editor, Randy Essex (ph). Randy -- great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>RANDY ESSEX, DETROIT FREE PRESS: Hi, good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can you walk us through the issues? What do the unions want specifically.</p><p>ESSEX: Well, the GM workers really want a way for temp workers, which is about 7 percent of GM's hourly workforce to get the same pay scale that the permanent workers have, to have the same benefits, to get profit sharing. That's been important to the GM workers.</p><p>The company isn't budging on that we heard yesterday. The company did say that it would keep the healthcare benefits that they have, which seems like a pretty big concession on the part of the company because that's a big expense.</p><p>But workers are insistent on temps and profit sharing. We reported -- go ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, no -- go ahead.</p><p>ESSEX: Well, we reported yesterday that the union has thought hard about staying out on strike after a tentative agreement is reached. That puts some pressure on GM because if the work stoppage goes a couple of weeks, the costs become much higher. If it's a shorter strike, they can ramp up production, the workers get overtime, they get a ratification bonus and, you know, the economic impact to both the company and the workers is a little less.</p><p>The economists here in Michigan also tell us that the effects really start to hit the state, which is, you know, auto workers concentrated here, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>PEEK: Randy -- question for you. Are the temporary workers that you're talking about, are they members of the union? Is this something that's actually supposed to help those workers or help the union by allowing them to unionize?</p><p>ESSEX: They're already members of the union. They just -- back in the recession, the union made some concessions that allowed the companies, all the companies to hire proportion of temporary workers who make 15 to $18 an hour.</p><p>So it holds down company costs. Their benefits are different. They don't get profit sharing. They do get health insurance.</p><p>PAYNE: Randy -- another question for you. Ryan Payne here from Payne Capital. What about this electric car plant that they're using as a possible opportunity for some of these workers that's a way to kind of resolve this strike.</p><p>ESSEX: So two of the plants that in November GM said it would close, Detroit Hamtramck here and Lordstown in Ohio, which is of course getting a lot of publicity, it appears that those are being discussed as potential electric car or battery production facilities. Producing electric vehicles and batteries of course doesn't require as many workers. So you wouldn't see as many people in Lordstown, for example. And they probably will have some sort of joint venture. You know -- excuse me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ESSEX: There's discussion about the electric car or electric truck company, workhorse, trying to put together a new enterprise to buy part of the Lordstown plant. So that seems to be factored in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All real quick -- James.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. I'm just wondering, Randy, we mentioned the corruption case is ongoing against UAW leadership. Does that create a problem in terms of the incentive here that they have to prove they're doing an amazing job and not selling out their membership?</p><p>ESSEX: Yes -- we think that's a big factor in terms of ratification. So the -- we've been told and I think this is probably true, the workers tend to trust the layer down from the very top that is doing the negotiating. But when it comes to ratification, there's going to be some skepticism about whether they're getting the best deal that they can, which seems to be part of the reason that the union may be talking about leaving the workers out on strike after the tentative agreement is reached.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>ESSEX: By the way, I do want to say, GM yielding on healthcare, apparently yielding on healthcare, that could be a problem when the negotiations turn to Ford because healthcare is a big deal for Ford. They have the largest number of U.S. hourly workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's important, yes, good point. When is that negotiation are you expecting for Ford?</p><p>ESSEX: Well, the union picks one company to go first and it chose GM. Then it takes that tentative -- or that agreement as a template to the other two companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure.</p><p>ESSEX: Often that goes pretty smoothly but there could be hitches.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Randy -- thanks so much. Great to have you.</p><p>ESSEX: You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Randy Essex joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the Ukraine controversy, President Trump attorney and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani is next. He's here on the fallout from the President's phone call with his Ukrainian's counterpart.</p><p>Then trouble at Wework, reports putting the company's CEO on the hot seat, what it means for the IPO in the future. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, September 23rd. Your top stories right now, 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets are off of the lows this morning, take a look. Dow Industrials now down just 10 points, the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are positive with the NASDAQ up 15 points and the S&amp;P up two points.</p><p>This after the markets posted a losing week last week, but all the major averages, Dow, NASDAQ, S&amp;P are still just within striking distance of all- time highs.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this, and as you will see, it is a weak story in the Eurozone. We have signs of slowing economy in Europe, manufacturing sentiment in the Eurozone fell in September. So the worst level in nearly seven years.</p><p>The Purchasing Managers' Index has came out today in Germany and France, they too well below expectations. The Manufacturing weakness has the major indices in Europe lower this morning.</p><p>FT-100 down 33, CAC Quarante down 53 and the DAX Index in Germany down 133 points.</p><p>Asian markets overnight look like this; Japan was closed overnight for a national holiday. The Shanghai Composite was down almost one percent that was the worst performer.</p><p>Investigating Facebook, Dow Jones this morning is reporting that Snap kept a dossier called Project Voldemort on the ways Facebook allegedly tried to thwart competition and it is speaking to lawmakers this morning.</p><p>WeWork's CEO could be on the way out, board members reportedly pushing out to oust Adam Neumann after the company delayed its IPO.</p><p>And then the streaming wars, new info, Disney Plus available for pre-order ahead of its big November debut. The stock is unchanged this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning but first, our top story this half an hour, President Trump's July phone call with the president of Ukraine, the president reportedly pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his anti-trust investigations in Ukraine while his son Hunter Biden was working there.</p><p>I spoke with Senator Lindsey Graham yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" about that phone call. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Does the president have something to worry about in terms of that phone call he had with the leader of Ukraine?</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I think every president would have a lot to worry about if this phone call is handled the way they're talking about.</p><p>Joe Biden said everybody's looked at this and found nothing. Who is everybody? Nobody's looked at the Ukraine and the Bidens. Nobody's look at the role the Ukraine played in the 2016 election.</p><p>I'm calling for somebody in the Justice Department to look at all things Ukraine. We've looked at all things Russia and Trump. His family, everything about his family, every transaction between the Trump campaign and Russia. Now it's time to see whether or not the Ukrainians released information regarding Manafort, who is Trump's campaign manager, what relationships if any did the Biden world have to the Ukraine. What role if any did the Ukraine play in the 2016 election?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now, no response so far from the DOJ to Senator Lindsey Graham's call to investigate and probe all things Ukraine. We're waiting for that.</p><p>House Democrats say that this could ignite impeachment proceedings meanwhile.</p><p>Joining me right now is personal attorney for President Trump, former New York City Mayor, Mayor Rudy Giuliani. And Rudy, it's always a pleasure to see you. Let me ask you first though about the whistleblower. What do we know, who is this person where it's once again unidentified sources?</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, let's take a look at how the story has evaporated, kind of like Kavanaugh. It began with the president of the United States told the president-elect of Ukraine, I'm not going to give you $250 million if you don't investigate Biden. Money, quid pro quo kind of like what Biden did on tape, by the way.</p><p>Now the story's become no money was mentioned, no quid pro quo. Now we take out to the area of any kind of wrongdoing, we get into a propriety.</p><p>BARTIROMO: More speculation.</p><p>GIULIANI: But the Democrats, you know, wanted to impeach when it was quid pro quo in money. Now there's no quid pro quo, no money. A proper action by a president, they might say improper but certainly not grounds for impeachment.</p><p>As the story gets less serious, as the story disappears, they still want to impeach. So I hope the American people get the point. They want to impeach it doesn't matter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now we don't know --</p><p>GIULIANI: Here's the problem for them, even if you take the first story about the president, what Biden did is much worse. Much, much worse.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I want to get to that because this is opening --</p><p>GIULIANI: But first of all it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is opening up the spotlight on Biden. I want to get to that.</p><p>And If there's anybody -- if there's anybody in this country that doesn't think Biden did this to get his son out of trouble, then they need a little help.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But does the president give his skeptics sort of this stuff on a silver platter. I mean, you read the op-ed in the -- in the Journal today, Trump's Ukraine call, Mr. Trump's request showed bad judgment, they write. He was trying to draw a foreign leader into the middle of an American presidential politics.</p><p>GIULIANI: No, he wasn't. The Wall Street Journal -- first of all, the Wall Street Journal is dead wrong on the front page. The Wall Street Journal said that there was no accusation of wrong doing against Biden.</p><p>I told a reporter from the Wall Street Journal, would you go listen to the tapes? She wanted me to give it to her. I said go online. Listen to Kaleniuk tape, listen to the statement from Shokin -- read the statement from Shokin. Listen to the (INAUDIBLE) tape.</p><p>There are three tapes in which two prosecutors and another person in the Ukraine directly said that Biden did this to get his son out of trouble. And I'm going to have more facts tomorrow that prove it conclusively. But today we wanted to show that just in case you wanted to understand the criminality of this. Biden was paid a lot of money for this; there was one $3 million payment to the kid.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You said Ukraine gave Biden $3 million?</p><p>GIULIANI: A crooked company in the Ukraine called Burisma run by a guy who took $5 billion from Ukraine, pro-Russian --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Biden was on the board of that company.</p><p>GIULIANI: Yes, and he was hired by a fugitive. He was hired by probably one of the worst organized criminals in Ukraine at the time. A guy named, Mykola Zlochevsky. Mykola Zlochevsky (INAUDIBLE) big-time criminal hired by -- hired Joe Biden two weeks after Joe Biden is named the czar for money to Ukraine.</p><p>They go hire Biden, Hunter Biden. They go hire a guy who is having a drug problem. He got thrown out of the military a few months earlier for drugs. Now, how did he get in the military? Joe pulled strings to get him in. The guy was like 37, 38. He was only there less than a year and he got caught with cocaine.</p><p>Now, you're going to put a kid on a board like this who's a cocaine abuser? And pay him a million dollars a year?</p><p>And here's how you pay him. They didn't give him a check; they didn't give him a wire. They sent his $3 million from Ukraine to Latvia, Latvia to Cyprus, Cyprus to the U.S.</p><p>When the prosecutor who got fired zeroed in on Cyprus and demanded the money, the Cyprian government told him that the U.S. Embassy, Obama's U.S. Embassy intervened and told them not to give the amount of money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, I understand what you're saying.</p><p>GIULIANI: At that point -- at that point, the president of the Ukraine called him in and said Biden wants you fired. He had just zeroed in on the $3 million laundered to the son.</p><p>You don't get paid if it's legit. I prosecute a lot of people, Maria. This is like the best proof you can have of intent. It goes from Ukraine - - anybody here get paid that way? Ukraine, Latvia, Cyprus.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You make -- you make all the right points and I understand --</p><p>GIULIANI: And then they won't give the information.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The president's skeptics are not focused on that at all.</p><p>GIULIANI: Who cares about that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you, -- look, and I understand -- and I understand, and believe me, we just came off of the Russia collusion which I called that from the get-go.</p><p>But let me ask you this, did the president threaten to cut off aid to the Ukraine?</p><p>GIULIANI: No, that was a fault story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 100 percent?</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, I can't tell you if it's 100 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because we know that the administration did delay U.S. aid to Ukraine, why?</p><p>GIULIANI: The Wall Street Journal also fails in its false article today, it fails to point out on the headlines on Saturday in the Ukraine, the Ukrainian version of the story.</p><p>The Ukrainian says, no pressure. The Foreign Minister of the Ukraine gave a speech and he said that he's pretty devastate, purview the conversation, there was no pressure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>GIULIANI: No pressure. Again, once again, the story is falling apart. No money mentioned. No quid pro quo. No quid pro quo means no pressure.</p><p>Now, who would know if there's pressure more than -- if the Ukrainian president didn't feel the pressure, there's no pressure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why would the president bring up Joe Biden and his son?</p><p>GIULIANI: Because Joe Biden --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why do that (INAUDIBLE) why give your skeptics, your adversaries who are wanted to take you down anything to sort of bring up? That's really the question.</p><p>I mean, like, The Journal writes what we know of the call underscores Mr. Trump's greatest flaw as president.</p><p>GIULIANI: Oh, come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is his political narcissism. Every decision boils down to how it affects him or his re-election (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>And The key fact that there are three people that are accusing Biden of wrong doing and they have on the front page that he wasn't accused of wrong doing. They had no idea about the money laundering that I just laid out.</p><p>You know, they could have found out about this money laundering by not being so lazy and looking at the tapes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I will say this, it's -- you cannot ignore the double standards of --</p><p>GIULIANI: Double standard?</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- of the way Mr. Trump's opponents treat the president. Right, we just came off all of this collusion nonsense for two years, where we're talking about unidentified sources and the president colluded and then we understand that it was absolutely a lot of nothing which we expected anyway.</p><p>GIULIANI: And this guy's story has changed now three times. And now it also turns out he's not a direct witness. I don't even know how he knows about it. He's got it all wrong. No money, no quid pro quo. According to the Ukrainians, no pressure. I mean, --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, we know that Biden had this interaction in the Ukraine then there's China. I want to ask you about this because vice president did take Hunter Biden on Air Force Two and then -- to China.</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, let me figure -- let me figure out how the Democrats going to get out of this one. So the vice president flies his son, the guy that's drug challenged and flies him to China, yes. He negotiate --</p><p>BARTIROMO: While he's on a trip to go meet with --</p><p>GIULIANI: Serious trip. He's trying to talk China out of the Falkland Islands.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what the vice president is -- why the vice president is going to China.</p><p>GIULIANI: -- every one of his diplomatic missions including his one to -- his one to Baghdad where he couldn't get his status of forces, he failed (INAUDIBLE) He failed at every foreign policy issue he ever had, that's their Secretary of Defense, not mine.</p><p>So he goes there, he's negotiating with the Chinese. He doesn't tell anybody the kid is spending his time in the Bank of China. He fails with his negotiation with the Chinese. He blows it. Maybe he wanted to thank for him, I don't know but he failed. But Joe fails at everything so it's hard to say.</p><p>Eight days later there's a $1 billion check that goes into Hunter Biden's private equity fund, a private equity fund that I think made about $0.04 and you know the part is where, the son of the vice president of the United States, the stepson of the Secretary of State of the United States John Kerry and Whitey Bulger's nephew.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>GIULIANI: Tell me this isn't news.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you know that Joe Biden and (INAUDIBLE) when he first -- when Joe Biden first cut on the scene --</p><p>GIULIANI: I just said Whitey Bulger, you don't think that would be on the front page of every newspaper if a Republican president?</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it's not, that's the thing.</p><p>GIULIANI: Don't tell me they aren't phony.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All of this does not smell right. I agree with that.</p><p>However, how are you going to get through and cut through all of the adversaries of this president that are putting it on the front page as if there were something improper there?</p><p>GIULIANI: I'm doing it, it takes some blood to do it but we're doing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because remember when Joe Biden first ran for president, he said China's fine, no problem with China.</p><p>GIULIANI: Maria, that China thing happened three years ago, four years ago, it finally -- now I have another question. What kind of ethics standards do they have in the Obama administration?</p><p>Obama read this story about this kid who gets tossed out of the army for drugs, getting hired by the most crooked oligarch in Ukraine, Biden have a -- did Obama ever call Biden in and say what's going on, Joe? Don't they check conflicts?</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's another issue and I think Devin Nunes brought this up yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\". Should we have a precedent that the president of the free world's private calls with other world leaders are open to the public scrutiny.</p><p>GIULIANI: No, of course not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's another issue here.</p><p>GIULIANI: No, they shouldn't be open. But in any event, this can be open. I tell you, when the -- they're going to be -- well, they don't get embarrassed, you know.</p><p>When this turns out not to be true they're going to move on to did he have four parking tickets that he didn't pay.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is there any way we're going to see accountability for things like the Clinton campaign financing foreign accusations against Mr. Trump, all of these things, the Russia collusion situation, where Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier. I mean, there's all this other stuff that the media refuses to focus on.</p><p>GIULIANI: If there's not an investigation of these two things, the five, six million that Hunter Biden got from a crooked Ukrainian company and the father getting him out in which there were at least four or five witness in Ukraine are ready to -- they've been ready to testify for a year. And our ambassador there was blocking them from coming to the United States. They've been trying to get this information to the FBI for a year.</p><p>There's also an FBI agent involved. The FBI agent who is investigating the allegations about dirt on the Trump campaign, she's now working for George Soros. She was working for George Soros back then. Soros' NGO was involved in this whole thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But are you going to be able to make the case to make sure to cut through all of this in the face of such skepticism about President Trump coming from the media and the Democrats.</p><p>I mean, going into 2020, this is going to -- things like this will keep coming up. How is the president going to --</p><p>GIULIANI: If they -- if they -- if they can talk their way out of the 1.5 billion, then we don't have a system of justice in the country anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And people won't trust the DOJ unless we see accountability from Russia. I don't know --</p><p>GIULIANI: Do you know how much money Agnew got when he was in the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We don't know.</p><p>GIULIANI: $10,000. $1.5 billion for the son of the vice president and the son of the Secretary of State is a massive Obama --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. I am back with the personal attorney for President Trump, former New York City Mayor, Mayor Rudy Giuliani.</p><p>And Rudy, when we went to the break it was abrupt. You're basically saying you think this is a positive for President Trump because you're putting a spotlight on Biden.</p><p>GIULIANI: It's the only way you can get this out. I mean, the only way that they would cover this story is by punching the president in the face and then the president deflects the punch which he's done, the story has come way down from where it was and then he hits them with a right hand that's much more powerful than their punch.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But they're not covering it.</p><p>GIULIANI: And by the way, they're covering it. Yesterday --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're not covering Biden and what Biden did to China and then Ukraine.</p><p>GIULIANI: Yes, they are. Every one of the newspapers had articles about it yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>GIULIANI: Biden was asked about it for the first time on Saturday. Biden was asked about it on Sunday. You start asking Biden, he's going to fall apart.</p><p>And Maria, it's not over. There's a lot more evidence I'm going to put out. I put one out today, money laundering. I've got a bigger one for tomorrow, a big one for the day after.</p><p>And on China -- on China, if they can escape China, we literally don't have a system of justice left in this country. $1.5 billion when you are negotiating with China on sensitive issues and your family gets enriched with an investment in a private equity fund.</p><p>Now why did China give the money -- why would China give the money to a drug challenged private equity owner except to influence his father. They didn't make money on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick, Adam Schiff wants to see --</p><p>GIULIANI: And the Obama administration did nothing about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Adam Schiff wants to see the whistleblower complaint. Why not send --</p><p>GIULIANI: I wouldn't give Adam Schiff anything. Adam Schiff said yesterday --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why not? Why not just give the whistleblower complaint?</p><p>GIULIANI: Because you make it hard on these phonies. Adam Schiff yesterday said that if the president held back military aid and therefore he has to be impeached, but he didn't read the newspaper that day.</p><p>The story about holding back the military that now turns out to be untrue. That isn't part of the conversation. It was clarified. The whistleblower probably doesn't even know the conversation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And no comment about when Adam Schiff is actually going to take a look at the wrongdoing done in 2016 in terms of Peter Strzok and Andrew McCabe. No comment there.</p><p>GIULIANI: I would never ever go in front of a judge that's fixed. Would you?</p><p>Well, Adam Schiff is fixed, he's completely dishonest. Yesterday he made a fool out of himself when he said the president has to be impeached because he held back military aid.</p><p>Two weeks ago the president gave the military aid and the conversation doesn't involve military aid.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. You're expecting all of this to continue to be talked about in terms of what Hunter Biden did and you're not going to --</p><p>GIULIANI: They more they want to talk about Ukraine the better. Then I'd like to start talking about China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you're not going to give the whistleblower complaint to the Intel.</p><p>GIULIANI: It's not up to me. That's a matter of the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rudy Giuliani, good to see you sir.</p><p>GIULIANI: That's their strategy, not mine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Rudy Giuliani there.</p><p>Coming up, worries at WeWork, we're going to talk about it. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. More trouble for WeWork. Some company board members are now reportedly pushing CEO Adam Neumann out. Susan Li with the story right now, Susan.</p><p>LI: Big shareholder, Softbank apparently leading the charge with some of these directors looking to oust Adam Neumann, and this is after they delayed that IPO last week where the valuation was sliced by two-thirds and also allegations of drug use that came up in this Wall Street Journal report at the end of last week.</p><p>So Masa Son, the biggest shareholder in Softbank apparently losing their patience and wanting to move Adam Neumann on to a non-executive chairman role.</p><p>Now Adam Neumann before the IPO also there were allegations of misuse of funds and selling off his shares and borrowing against his stake in the company. So some say, well, maybe let's move him on, kind of like Travis Kalanick ahead of the Uber IPO, move him onto a nonexecutive role.</p><p>But there's a bit of a problem with this since we have Adam Neumann of course has -- he has the super voting rights and basically he can eliminate any proposal that comes up to the board. So whether or not you know, he will be leaving WeWork when it hits the market, if it hits the market this year, because there are doubts whether or not still IPO in 2019 at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Investors need to understand what super voting rights mean before they invest in a company.</p><p>LI: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They need to understand this. I don't -- I don't know that everybody does.</p><p>FREEMAN: And it's interesting here because he's got this overwhelming control but he needs Softbank, he needs their money to keep going, doesn't he?</p><p>LI: Yes, well, you're burning $1.6 billion, that's the loss they had last year, that's pretty much equivalent to their revenue, those are not great metrics by the way when you're trying to sell shares to the market, right?</p><p>PAYNE: You know, and that's the big thing, right. Those super voting rights are great but when you need cash, you need cash and that's where, you know, Softbank to this point basically has the final say in my opinion.</p><p>PEEK: I understand, heard -- I was hearing an interview I think on another network about how basically panning all new IPOs using this as an example, I thought that was really out of -- you know, inappropriate.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: I mean, really. Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Susan, thank you.</p><p>LI: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you, Susan Li.</p><p>Still ahead the Trump campaign and the U.N., Press Secretary and Communications Director for President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, Stephanie Grisham is here, next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019092302cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X41-7T51-DXH2-64SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 23, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0005A3F</classCode><className>SAUDI ARAMCO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

Whatever he did, he did on his own.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WALLACE:  What do we know about President Trump's involvement in hush money  payments of two women during the 2016 campaign?  And what does Michael  Cohen's cooperation mean for the special counsel investigation?  We'll ask  the president's lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then -- </p><p>TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.   I will take the mantle.  I will be the one to shut it down.  I'm not going  to blame you for it.  </p><p>WALLACE:  The president deals with a divided Washington and a possible  government shutdown over his border wall.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  Perhaps he doesn't understand people  leave their paychecks.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel if we're headed for compromise or  confrontation.  </p><p>Plus -- </p><p>BILL GATES, GATES FOUNDATSION:  The U.S.'s engagement in Africa and around  the world, there are many reasons we should maintain that.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We'll talk with Bill Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation  about what he feels is a shrinking U.S. role in dealing with global poverty  and public health.  </p><p>All right now on \"FOX News Sunday\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE:  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.  </p><p>We begin with breaking news.  A federal judge has ruled the entire  Affordable Care Act invalid.  Obamacare will remain in place pending appeal  and both President Trump and Democrats are calling for Congress to pass new  legislation.  We'll get to all that a little later.  </p><p>But first, the president is already dealing with a possible government  shutdown that's now just five days away.  Meanwhile, prosecutors are  producing more of the evidence that led former members of Mr. Trump's inner  circle to plead guilty, evidence that implicates the president.  </p><p>Let's get the latest from Kevin Corke live at the White House -- Kevin.  </p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, even for an administration  accustomed to seismic shifts in the news cycle, it was without a doubt a  tumultuous week.  But few headlines could prove as potentially damaging to  the Trump White House than those involving former members of the  president's inner circle.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  Three of whom are facing time in prison for a variety of misdeeds,  but none involving so-called Russian collusion.  Former national security  adviser, General Michael Flynn, faces sentencing Tuesday for lying to  federal investigators.  The special counsel's office recommending he get no  jail time even as it has faced charges that the general was entrapped and  inappropriately questioned.  </p><p>Meanwhile, in his first televised interview since being sentenced to three  years behind bar, the president's former fixer, attorney Michael Cohen,  claimed he repeatedly lied for Mr. Trump over the years and he would set up  payments to women to help aid his 2016 campaign, a claim strongly denied by  the White House.  </p><p>TRUMP:  I will take the mantle of shutting down and I'm going to shut it  down for border security.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  But we believe you shouldn't shut it  down.</p><p>CORKE:  An Oval Office meeting with leading Democrats this week did little  to quell fears of a potential partial government shutdown over the  president's insistence that there would be funding for a border wall,  something Democrats say they won't pay for.  A work stoppage that could  come in a week in which backers of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare,  consider their next move in the wake of a federal judge's ruling that the  law is unconstitutional.  </p><p>TRUMP:  -- that the Supreme Court upholds, we'll be sitting down with the  Democrats and we will get great health care for our people.  Let's say  repeal and replace.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  That ruling by District Court Judge Reed O'Connor, Chris, does not  impact Obamacare recipients in the short term, but it does set up a  potential high court battle and that is a debate White House officials  would love to have -- Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thanks.  </p><p>WALLACE:  And joining me now from New York, the president's lead lawyer,  Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p>Mayor, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\".  </p><p>RUDY GUILIANI, LEAD LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you  -- thank you, Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's start with Michael Cohen's allegation that President Trump  directed him to commit a criminal campaign finance violation.  Here first  was the president and then Mr. Cohen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I never directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did  on his own.  He's a lawyer.  A lawyer who represents a client is supposed  to do the right thing.  </p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  He directed me to make the  payments, he directed me to become involved in these matters.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  Question.  Did Mr. Trump direct Michael Cohen to pay off these  two women or not?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No, the truth is actually what Cohen testified to under oath  before Congress and what he repeated numerous times on surreptitious tape  recordings that he made, which is that the president didn't know about this  until some time into it, he did find out about it and eventually reimburse  him.  But, you know, this is a hard thing to do, but lawyers do this all  the time.  </p><p>But, Chris, even if it were true, it's not a crime.  The payment -- the  payment of money in a situation like this has been covered in the Edwards  case.  Not only the acquittal and hung jury in the Edwards case, but the  fact that the FEC looked at those Edwards violations and determined they  weren't violations --   </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>WALLACE:  I promise we're going to get to that in a minute, but let's get  to the simple fact, question of whether the president directed Cohen --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- to make these --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- payments or not.  </p><p>Cohen says that the president is not to be believed.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>COHEN:  The man doesn't tell the truth.  And it's sad that I should take  responsibility for his dirty deeds.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Wow.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor -- Mayor --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  That's some lawyer.  That is some lawyer.  He was the lawyer in  that situation.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>WALLACE:  But does the president tell the truth or not?   </p><p>GIULIANI:  The president is telling the truth, yes.  This man is lying.  </p><p>Now, is that a big surprise to you, that Michael Cohen is lying?  The man  got up in front of the judge and said I was a fiercely loyal to Donald  Trump.  Nonsense he was fiercely loyal to him, he taped him, lied to him,  revealed the tape and did something a lawyer I've never heard ever did --  tape record his own client.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But -- but, sir --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  He sat there with Chris Cuomo, told him he wasn't being taped,  showed him a drawer (ph), and he lied to him and taped him for two hours.   The man is a complete pathological liar that cannot be believed.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But, sir, let's -- let's turn to --   </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GIULIANI:  And they'll never put him on a witness stand.  They will never - - Chris --   </p><p>WALLACE:  Yes, but let me ask you --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  -- they will never put him on a witness stand.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I understand.  But does the question -- the real question is the  credibility of the president, not the credibility of Michael Cohen --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No, no --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let me just finish.  The president has changed his story  repeatedly about whether or not he knew about hush money.  Here is what he  said on Air Force One -- the president said on Air Force One this April,  eight months ago.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>REPORTER:  Mr. President, did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy  Daniels?</p><p>TRUMP:  No.  No.  What else?  </p><p>REPORTER:  Then why did Michael Cohen make those if there was no truth to  her allegations?  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.  Michael is my attorney and  you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.   </p><p>REPORTER:  Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?  </p><p>TRUMP:  No, I don't know.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  The president said he doesn't know anything about any payments,  but in one of those tapes that you're talking about where Cohen  surreptitiously taped the president -- this is back in September of 2016 --  here are the president and Cohen discussing a potential --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>WALLACE:  Let's listen to the tape first.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Sure, sure.  I remember it well.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>COHEN:  I'm all over that.  And I spoke to Allen about it.  When it comes  time for the financing, which will be --   </p><p>TRUMP:  Wait a sec, what financing?  </p><p>COHEN:  Well, I'll have to pay --  </p><p>TRUMP:  Pay with cash --  </p><p>COHEN:  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  So which is it?  Did the president know about the hush money  payments or not?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris, there's an intervening event that you're not talking  about.  I know this really well because I got criticized for revealing this  when I first came into the case.  Nobody really understood why I was doing  it.  </p><p>When I first came into the case, we went through the whole case.  The  president saw some notes and documents, thought about it, and I went out  and said, no, there was an intervening conversation after the payments took  place and before the revelations you're talking about on Air Force One.</p><p>The president did talk to Cohen or to people in between and they arranged  to reimburse Cohen.  This was after the payment was made, after it was  over, after the campaign was over.</p><p>WALLACE:  But -- but there's --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  They're talking about a conversation, sir, in September of 2016  during the campaign.  The president is clearly aware that David Pecker, the  head of \"National Enquirer\" had paid off Karen McDougal and they're talking  about reimbursing McDougal --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Well, you know, that's --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- or reimbursing Pecker for that payment.</p><p>GIULIANI:  But there's a -- there's a big difference here.  That was a -  that was a conversation he was asked, middle of the campaign, I was with  him back then in the middle of the campaign, he's working 18 hours a day.   I wasn't able to remember a lot of things that happened in September of  2016.  He was asked it one time.  </p><p>When he sat down with his lawyer and went through it in great detail and  saw things that could refresh his recollection, we immediately corrected  it.</p><p>Nobody pushed us, nobody found it, we found it.  And we corrected it and I  got criticized like crazy for doing it.</p><p>WALLACE:  So you're saying --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  By the time this came out, we all knew --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- the fact -- I mean, the -- according both to Cohen and to  Pecker, the -- again, he's the head of -- or was the head of National  Enquirer, they say they were in a meeting with Donald Trump --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris, Chris, Chris --  </p><p>WALLACE:   -- in the summer of 2016 in which --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- they discussed the payment to Karen McDougal.</p><p>GIULIANI:  We're talking about something that doesn't matter.  I mean,  whether - whether it happened or didn't happen, it's not illegal.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  You're moving shells around on me.  Either it happened or it  didn't happen.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But that's what lawyers do all the time.  You argue in the  alternative.  I'm telling it --  </p><p>WALLACE:  But I'm asking you for the truth, sir.</p><p>GIULIANI:  I'm telling you definitively -- well, I -- I want the truth too.   And the truth is, yes, the tape-recorded conversation did take place.  It  exonerates the president.  The president tells Cohen, do it by check.  </p><p>I'm sorry, I prosecuted thousands of crimes, never prosecuted one where  they wanted to hide something, they did it by check.  </p><p>Make sure we pay him back.  They paid him back.  That's what that  conversation's all about.  It exonerates him.</p><p>I'd play that conversation in front of any jury in America and I'd cross- examine Cohen in front of any jury in America.</p><p>WALLACE:  OK, here's what you're telling --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But I -- but very important; Cohen did not plead guilty to  conspiracy to violate the campaign finance laws.  If they were going to use  him as a witness against anybody, you always make them plea guilty to a  conspiracy so you can fill the conspiracy in.  </p><p>He pled guilty to a singular crime of violating the campaign finance laws.   Not a conspiracy.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yes, but the statement is full of references to individual one  who is Donald Trump.  Here's what you told the --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p>WALLACE:  Here's what you told \"The Daily Beast\" this week.  I want to put  it up on the screen.  </p><p>Nobody got killed.  Nobody got robbed.  This was not a big crime.</p><p>Mayor, what's the threshold between a crime and a big crime?</p><p>GIULIANI:  My statement there was about the prosecutor's view of it, not  mine.  Mr. Swinger (ph) who wrote that, actually corrected that, to say  that that was taken out of context.  My point was, there was no crime.  </p><p>But even if you take the prosecutor's viewpoint, this prosecutor was  appointed -- both of them, right, looking at collusion, no collusion.   Looking at obstruction --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sir, this was the Southern  District of New York.  This is not -- has nothing to do with collusion --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But now you're --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- or obstruction of justice, there --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Now, you're - they're part of the Department of Justice -- he's  not being investigated --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I understand it's a separate prosecutor.  I'm sure -- I'm sure  when you were the --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, this guy -- this guy is going back --  </p><p>WALLACE:  I'm sure - I'm sure when you were the U.S. attorney for the  Southern District --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  And this guy is going back --  </p><p>WALLACE:  You didn't take orders from somebody in Washington who had  nothing to do with the attorney general.  You were your own -- they used to  call it a sovereign district of New York, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  The person -- the person in charge of this investigation, Chris,  is Rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.  He is  the boss of Mueller and he is the boss of the Southern District of New  York.  He's the one that determined, let's move it over here.  He put it  there in the Southern District of New York and keeps supervision of it.</p><p>WALLACE:  I know --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  So don't give me that.</p><p>WALLACE:  But they're not --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  But they're not -- they're not working for --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  There is one Justice Department --- yes they are.  They're  working for the same Rod -- Rod Rosenstein's going to make the decision,  not Mueller, about what to do with this case.</p><p>WALLACE:  Right, and not Mueller.</p><p>GIULIANI:  And this is a witch-hunt.  They are going back now -- they're  going back to 1982, 1983.  They're going through business records.  My  goodness, they went from collusion to obstruction, no evidence -- now  campaign finance, no violation of the law.  </p><p>No matter who's right about what they said, it's no violation of the law.   And now --  </p><p>WALLACE:  The president -- I -- I want to -- I want to move on.  You're --  you're very a effective lawyer, but I've got -- I've got to move on, sir.  </p><p>President Trump --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  You wanted the truth.  That's the truth.  The truth is it's not  a violation of the law.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I want -- I want the truth in a limited amount of time.  </p><p>President Trump talked this week about whether or not General Flynn lied to  the FBI.  Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  They took a general that they said didn't lie, and they convinced  him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal.  And now, they're  recommending no time.  You know why?  Because they're embarrassed that  they've got caught.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Does the president believe Michael Flynn lied or not?</p><p>GIULIANI:  I don't know if Michael Flynn lied or not.  You got two  contradictory things.  You've got the FBI saying at the time that he wasn't  lying.  And then we have no explanation and the guy pleads guilty to lying.  </p><p>So, I -- I mean, I don't know what happened in between.  I do know they  treated Flynn in a way that came very close to --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I'm asking a simple -- I'm asking a simple question.  And the  reason I ask is I want to put up a tweet from the president a year ago, in  December of 2017, when he says this: I had to fire General Flynn because he  lied to the vice president and the FBI.  He has pled guilty to those lies.</p><p>The president a year ago seemed to know that Flynn has lied.  Now, he's not  so sure.</p><p>GIULIANI:  The president doesn't know that he lied.  The president -- the  president --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  But he -- he knows what you knew at the time.  The man pled  guilty to lying.  He did --  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, he knows -- he knows what -- he knows what Flynn said to his  vice president.</p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, but that was a lie, but that's not a crime.</p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I understand but I didn't ask if it was a crime, I asked  whether it was a lie.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris -- Chris, you're going all over the place and you're  really confusing people.  Look, first of all --  </p><p>WALLACE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>GIULIANI:  You are -- you are -- you are -- you are -- you are, really --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  I didn't ask if it was a crime.  I asked whether  it was a lie and he told the same lie to the FBI and to the vice president.   And you're quite right, lying to the vice president isn't a lie, it's not  very good -- but lying to the FBI --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  -- is a crime.</p><p>GIULIANI:  Right.  And the more important thing about what the president  knew or didn't know -- because this doesn't involve the president in terms  of him being involved in any kind of conspiracy or anything else -- it's  like if it's reported that one of my assistants when I was a U.S. attorney  lied to the court, how do I know if he did or he didn't?  He knows what he  reads.  The man pled guilty to lying --  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK.  I got -- I got one minute --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  -- so, yes.  He didn't know at the time -- I didn't know at the  time -- I didn't know at the time that the FBI had previously concluded he  was telling the truth.</p><p>WALLACE:  I got a --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  I didn't know he had been deprived of a lawyer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, you're confusing people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GIULIANI:  I'm not confusing people.</p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask you --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  The man was railroaded.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- three last quick questions.</p><p>GIULIANI:  He was railroaded.</p><p>WALLACE:  There are -- there are reports now that the special counsel is  interested again in interviewing the president.  Has his office reached out  to you about sitting down for an in-person interview with the president?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes.  There are several unpaid parking tickets that night --  back in 1986, '87 that haven't been explained.  You know, we've got to --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Seriously?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Seriously, unpaid parking tickets --  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, no.</p><p>GIULIANI:  It was a movie theater.  He didn't pay the proper fee.</p><p>WALLACE:  Is the special counsel -- does he want to interview the  president?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, good luck.  Good luck.  After what they did to Flynn, the  way they trapped him into perjury and no sentence for him, 14 days for  Papadopoulos.  I did better on traffic violations than they did with  Papadopoulos.  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, when you say good luck, you're saying no way, no interview?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  They're a joke.  Over my dead body, but you know, I could be  dead.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do they want to speak to the president?</p><p>GIULIANI:  I do have -- I do have other lawyer -- I am disgusted with the  tactics they have used in this case.  What they did to General Flynn should  result in discipline.  They're the ones who are violating the law.  </p><p>They're looking at a non-crime collusion, the other guys are looking at a  non-crime campaign violations, which are not violations.  And they are the  ones who are violating the law, the rules, the ethics and nobody wants to  look at them.  They destroyed Strzok and Page's texts, 19,000 texts.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  If he had destroyed 19,000 texts, they'd put him in jail.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Even though they can't because he's the president.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor Giuliani.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Thank you.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  I got a little --   </p><p>WALLACE:  No, listen, I love it and please come back.  To be continued.  </p><p>Thank you for your time.  Always good to talk to you, sir.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Thank you.  Thank you. </p><p>WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what a  judge's Obamacare ruling could mean for millions of Americans.  </p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump saying  he'd be proud to shut down the government over a border wall.  Just go to  Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  A big, big victory by a highly respected judge.  Highly, highly  respected in Texas and on the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we  will get great, great health care for our people.  We'll have to sit down  with the Democrats to do it but I'm sure they want to do it also.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  President Trump praising the ruling from the federal judge  striking down the entire Obamacare law.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group.  Fox News senior political analyst  Brit Hume, columnist for \"The Hill\", Juan Williams, Julie Pace, Washington  bureau chief for \"The Associated Press\" and Marc Short, former director of  legislative affairs for President Trump.  </p><p>Well, Brit, the federal judge said Obamacare is invalid because Congress  has taken out the tax penalty as part of the individual mandate, which is  the way that it passed through the Supreme Court in the first place.  But  we should point out the law stays in effect pending appeal.  </p><p>What do you think of the ruling and how do you think this plays  politically?  </p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, remember, this is a  trial court judge.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Right.</p><p>HUME:  So, this is subject to appeal to appellate court and perhaps on the  Supreme Court.  I think it's an interesting legal argument whether because  of the invalidation of the zeroing out of the penalty was the whole law  therefore is invalid.  I think you can hear good, legal arguments on both  sides of that issue but I think we're nowhere near the last of this and  because the judge did not issue an injunction that shuts it down.  As you  point out, Obamacare will remain in place -- what's left of Obamacare  remains in place for the foreseeable future.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But how does it play politically, given the fact there are  certain parts of Obamacare that people didn't like, like the individual  mandate.  On the other hand, there are lot of parts of it that people did  like pre-existing conditions --  </p><p>HUME:  Right. </p><p>WALLACE:  And that's according to the judge's ruling would be out, too.   </p><p>HUME:  It would be out but it won't be out now and it won't be out soon, in  my judgment.  So, I think the political effect will depend on the actual  practical effect and there is no practical effect for the time being.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Juan, the president and Republicans ran in 2016 on  the idea of repeal and replace Obamacare, which they thought was a good  issue for them.  Democrats won in 2018 on the argument the Republicans want  to take away your pre-existing conditions.  </p><p>So, how do you think this is going to cut, particularly given the fact as  Brit Hume says, it's not going to have a practical effect, it's not going  to take effect for some months, maybe a year as it goes to the courts.  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think you can see  already this morning, Republicans are on their heels, not really saying  much about this while you have Nancy Pelosi and potentially incoming  speaker of the house saying Democrats will defend it.  Chris Murphy, the  senator from Connecticut, saying it's a five-alarm fire.  I think clearly  Democrats see themselves in a position where they are on the offensive with  the voters about this.  If you take away Obamacare, you know, after how  many -- 70 votes by Republicans to repeal it, didn't work even with the  Republican majority, Chris.</p><p>It's not only that you would do away with things like pre-existing  conditions, you would drive up premiums for everybody.  Our health care  system would be in chaos.  So, I think that what you get here is  Republicans right now including President Trump, who initially tweeted  great, great, are saying we need a bipartisan collaboration here to make  health care work.  </p><p>That's a different tone from Republicans and I think it's very telling  about who is politically at risk here.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Marc, you're wrinkling your brow.  </p><p>MARC SHORT, FORMER DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Well, I think, look, Republicans won in 2010 and 2014 and 2016 in large  part on a promise to repeal Obamacare and now somehow the media are saying  it's an albatross on Republicans.  It's been a political win for  Republicans.  </p><p>WALLACE:  If you look at the polls, Obamacare has become more popular.  </p><p>SHORT:  And you know why, Chris?  Because the last two years, from 2013 to  2017, premiums went up 105 percent across the country.  In the last year,  they've gone up 5 percent.  They used to be 50 percent of the counties in  the United States had one insurer, and that was it.  That's been fixed.   All counties now have more than one insurer.</p><p>Because this administration has provided more choice for people, they have  actually helped to stabilize the markets.  That doesn't mean forcing people  to buy a product they don't want is a good policy.  </p><p>JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:  But in terms of the fallout from this  ruling potentially, one thing you're definitely not hearing from the  Republicans after this judge's ruling is any interest in going back to the  drawing board and starting from scratch.  If -- ultimately, this move  through the court that Obamacare fully is repealed, you do not have a lot  of Republicans who want to spend 2019 deep in the weeds on health care.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Let me switch, I'll tell you what they're going to spend at the  end of 2018 on.  There is the real threat now of a partial government  shutdown that would start at midnight this Friday.  Here's how that played  out this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,  because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that  have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.  So I will take  the mantle.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  He is taking full responsibility for  the Trump shutdown.  Perhaps he doesn't understand people need their  paychecks.  Maybe that's not the life he leads.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the  president saying that he would be proud to shutdown the government, we got  this on Facebook from Linda Rector.  </p><p>Why is shutting down the government not something to be proud of if it  means protecting the country?  That's exactly what we elected the president  to do. </p><p>Marc, Juan, how do you answer Linda?  And two, as a person who until last  July used to deal with Congress for the White House, for President Trump,  what do you think is going to happen?  Will there be a shutdown?  Will they  kick it down the can into January?  </p><p>SHORT:  If there were a shutdown, it would be different the very previous  ones.  This government has already funded all the men and women serving in  uniform.  It has funded all the entitlement checks.  It will keep the parts  of (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>So, the average American wouldn't even recognize the shutdown other than  the fact that it would be a media story, Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait, there's about 30 percent of the government that gets shut  down and I think 30 to 40 percent of the employees.  </p><p>SHORT:  And every time there's been a shutdown, every employee has been  paid back in full.  So I think the average person is not going to feel it  in the immediate future.  </p><p>Having said that, I still think you're going to find a compromise that  comes together before the end of the week.  I think the president has got  to look to find ways to fund this out of military construction dollars.   They'll create a separate problem later, because Democrats object to that.  </p><p>But last year, we secured the first new funding, $1.6 billion for the wall  in ten years.  Democrats come on your show and say we oppose any funding  for the wall.  They've already agreed to it.  It's already 1.6 in this  year.  </p><p>All we're not arguing about is not what they are, it's how much it costs,  and it's a matter of whether they can notified (ph) being at 1.6. </p><p>WALLACE:  That's an old joke.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let's gather here, everybody.  </p><p>So, Julie, shutdown or not?  </p><p>PACE:  I think all signs point to, as Marc says, some kind of compromise.   I think we'll have a tense couple of days.  This is normally how the  pattern of these shutdowns play out, but both Republicans and Democrats  that I talked on Capitol Hill last week have very little interest in a  shutdown.  They have very little interest in staying in Washington for  Christmas which is ultimately what this comes down to a lot of times.  </p><p>I do think that the president might be itching for a shutdown.  But I  ultimately think he will sign on if there is some kind of compromise that  gets some amount of wall funding and he can punt towards the military to  see if that's another option for building the wall.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask about another issue, which is the  president on Friday afternoon named a acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney,  and it's already come out that during the 2016 campaign, during a debate  right after the \"Access Hollywood\" came out, a debate with his Democratic  candidate, this is before he joined the Trump administration as OMB  director, he said this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF:  Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump,  doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact I think he's a  terrible human being.  But the choice on the other side is just as bad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Well --  </p><p>PACE:  Here we are.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do you think that creates problems for Mulvaney?  </p><p>PACE:  I think Mulvaney has been really strategic over the last couple of  years.  He has found a way to work with the president.  He's been very  loyal to the president since he's taken his job as OMB director.  So much  so that Trump keeps trying to give him other jobs in addition to chief of  staff.  </p><p>I do think that it's interesting that Mulvaney is leaving himself an out by  taking on the acting chief of staff role and keeping his job as OMB  director, if this doesn't work out for either side, he's got a fallback  option within the administration.  But Mulvaney kind of falls into a  category like a Lindsey Graham, who was also critical of the president  during the campaign, even after he became the nominee but has found a way  to work with him in office.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Brit, after Nick Ayers turned the president down, the vice  president's chief of staff, and then Chris Christie turned the president  down, he almost had to name somebody, didn't he?  This was getting a little  embarrassing.  </p><p>HUME:  He was like the guy who couldn't get a date for the prom and he  finally got Mulvaney, who was already on board to join in.  But Mulvaney is  a good choice.  He's a very able guy, seasoned and experience, knows the  issues, knows the policies, knows the government.  So -- </p><p>WALLACE:  I'll say something else, he is a happy warrior.  He's a guy who - - he's a positive guy.  He is also a guy who might come on Sunday talk  shows, which John Kelly treated us like the plague.  </p><p>HUME:  He wasn't interested.  </p><p>I would add this.  There's some talk that Trump doesn't need to chief of  staff, he should be his own, that is really nonsense because Trump needs  help from people who really know this town, know its ways, know the  details, know the issues, and he has been at important time, willing to  accept advice from those people to his benefit.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right, panel, we have to take a break here.  But stay right  here.  </p><p>When we come back, as new evidence implicates the president, what are the  chances Democrats will move pursuing impeachment?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Coming up, the president sounds off on the  Mueller investigation, as his former fixer is sentenced to prison. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nobody, except for me, would  be looked at like this. Nobody. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll get our Sunday panel's read on how serious the president's  legal troubles really are, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What he did was all unrelated  to me except for the two campaign finance charges that are not criminal and  shouldn't have been on there. They put that on to embarrass me. They put  those two charges on to embarrass me. </p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I told the truth. I took  responsibility for my actions. And instead of him taking responsibility for  his actions, what does he do? He attacks my family. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: President Trump and his former fixer, Michael Cohen, taking shots  at each other after Cohen received a three-year prison sentence for a  number of crimes, including making hush money payments during the 2016  campaign.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel. </p><p>Julie, there are reports, and we hear these from time to time, the  president is more and more consumed by the special counsel investigation,  especially as former allies like Michael Cohen and the publisher of \"The  National Enquirer\" are providing evidence against him. </p><p>What do you hear your sources? </p><p>JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": So I think it is indisputable that the  president is consumed by these investigations. You really don't need any  secret sources on this. You just need to look at his -- at his Twitter  feed. He is following the twists and turns of this extremely closely. And  as people who are close to him get caught up in this, he gets more  agitated. And I think now we are seeing that almost every aspect of his  life, over the last several years, is now under some level of  investigation. His administration, his campaign, the inauguration, and his  businesses. </p><p>And the business piece of this is, I think, the one that is getting to the  president the most because, yes, being president is part of his identity,  but actually being this successful businessman is almost more important to  him in some ways. It's how he has defined himself for decades. And it's his  children's legacy. They are at the top of this -- at this business. And any  sign that his business could crumble, that past business dealings could be  swept up in this investigation, is incredibly personal to him. </p><p>WALLACE: Marc.</p><p>MARC SHORT, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR: I agree  100 percent with Julie. I think that what's unfortunate here is that you  have what begins as a special prosecutor focus on collusion in Russia. And  as Julie just said, it's about every part of his life. We end up saying,  instead of investigating a crime, we're investigating a person. And  Republicans and civil libertarians used to oppose that motion after Iran  Contra. Then they fell in love with it during the Whitewater years because  they said it was a land deal but it became something about an affair with  an intern. </p><p>And it's a problem. It's a problem where we have prosecutors going all  over. And I think -- </p><p>WALLACE: But how about -- how about the argument that is made, gee, we  didn't hear Republicans complain about it when it happened to Bill Clinton? </p><p>SHORT: I agree 100 percent. I'm saying -- I'm saying Republicans as well  have been hypocritical on this. There used to be a group of strong, civil  libertarians who would recognize the problem of special prosecutors. And --  probably this is now the -- what's been born of that fruit. </p><p>WALLACE: All right, so far the only alleged crime that the president is  specifically linked to is not collusion, is not obstruction of justice, it  involves campaign finance violations, alleged campaign finance violations. </p><p>Here is how Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler, the incoming chair of the  House Judiciary Committee, responded to that this week. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERRY NADLER (D-NY), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, RANKING MEMBER: Well, they  would be impeachable offenses. Whether they are important enough to justify  an impeachment is a different question. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Brit, how persuaded are you that if President Trump directed these  payments, these hush money payments, as Michael Cohen says he did, that it  was a campaign finance violation on his part, a criminal violation? And,  two, what do you think of the likelihood that the House and the wisdom of  the House proceeding to impeachment on campaign finance violation? </p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it's a little hard to  imagine a president being impeached for a campaign finance violation. Most  of these violations are handled as civil matters and result in fines. And  they are, you know, widespread, rampant. Obama had a -- the Obama campaign  had to pay a big fine.</p><p>I don't -- I just don't think the House of Representatives, even such  ardent Democrats as Jerry Nadler, will go there. The greater worry is that  some other charge comes out when Mueller finally gets his ore in with his  report and says whatever he says. And that, I think, Chris, raises an  intriguing question, which is this, how far will these House investigations  go if Mueller doesn't find something very serious about the president? My  thought is, it probably takes the wind out of their sails, but we'll have  to wait and see. But, on balance, I don't think campaign finance is going  to dislodge him. </p><p>WALLACE: When you look at all of this and, you know, as we say, there is  still no hard evidence of collusion, no hard evidence of obstruction of  justice, but the wall do seem to be moving in on the president on a lot of  fronts. </p><p>HUME: Well, I don't think the Mueller report is likely to be -- to sing the  president's praises. But that's not what he needs. What he needs is kind of  an -- of a -- of a report that says, you know does not outline some major  crime. And if that happens, I mean I think it changes the atmosphere  dramatically, both legally and politically, because I think it's -- and if  he is vindicated on no collusion, which is what he's been saying, I don't  think the -- I've never thought that collusion was the central point of  this investigation. </p><p>Remember, when it started, Chris, it was a counterintelligence  investigation with the FBI acting as an intelligence agency to determine  what Russia actually did. And if you go back and look at the letter  authorizing Mueller's appointment, it says -- it mentions that it picks up  that investigation and then says, he's also authorized to find out if there  was collaboration between the two. That was always a subset of the overall  investigation. And if it turns out to be a subset with no crime alleged in  the final report, I think it's a huge boost for the president. </p><p>WALLACE: Juan.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the Democratic  base is so inflamed by Trump, by his behavior overall, I think they -- they  would think that Democrats weren't, in fact, holding up to their  constitutional responsivities if they did not consider impeachment. So you  get the --</p><p>WALLACE: Even on campaign finance violations? </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, what we -- what did we learn this week? He wants to  say it's just Michael Cohen making these outrageous claims because Cohen  wants a better deal from the prosecutors. But, in fat, we hear from David  Packer at \"National Enquirer,\" same thing happened. We hear from \"The Wall  Street Journal,\" the president was in the room. So if -- potentially he  would be an unindicted coconspirator while his president because nobody  thinks you can indict the president. But that doesn't mean that you can't  go to the Congress and say, let's look at this and see -- </p><p>WALLACE: Do you really think that would be wise for Democrats to do? And  this -- this is speculative.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, that's a separate issue. That's a separate issue. </p><p>WALLACE: OK. Well, that's my question, though.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK. Well, if the question was --</p><p>WALLACE: Would it be wise for them to do it if that's all that there is? </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think that's -- no. And I think that what you're  going to see, and you already see this from, by the way, Jerry Nadler, but  also from Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, as the say, they're not interested  right now. But the base of the party, is what I was trying to say to you,  Chris, is going to be putting pressure there because they think that, in  fact, Democrats had been too docile in dealing with Trump and they want --  they want them to come and have the --</p><p>WALLACE: They want blood?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, because, guess what, you've saw a blue wave, 40 seats  switch hands, and the number -- you know, health care was clearly  important. But also a check on Trump was very important to voters. </p><p>WALLACE: And every indication is -- everybody keeps saying this  investigation is going to be over the end of the year. </p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't see it. </p><p>WALLACE: I always say, pick the over, right? </p><p>PACE: Right. We -- we don't know what else Mueller has. I think this could  go well into next year and really line up with some of these congressional  investigation. </p><p>WALLACE: Thank you, panel. </p><p>Up next we sit down with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, head of the Gates  Foundation. In the era of America first, he worries about a shrinking U.S.  role in dealing with global poverty and public health.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest  private charitable fund, giving $46 billion in grants since its founding in  2000 and literally saving millions of lives. The Microsoft co-founder came  to Washington this week to make the case for American leadership and the  need for foreign aid in the era of America first. When we sat down at the  Chamber of Commerce, that's where we began. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER AND PHILANTHROPIST: There was a  recommendation by the executive branch to make fairly substantial cuts U.S.  aid budget. And, fortunately, the Congress took that proposal, which would  have meant cutting people off from those HIV medicines, and they decided to  maintain the foreign aid levels. </p><p>WALLACE: Your wife Melinda recently talked about -- and I want to quote her  directly -- how incredibly disappointing it is to see U.S. leadership  deteriorating and the view of the U.S. deteriorating because of some of the  egregious things that have been said by this current administration. What's  she talking about? </p><p>GATES: I hope I know. The -- I think the particular episode there was  talking about Africa and the conditions in Africa in a -- not in a positive  way. Sort of characterizing the entire continent. But, in any case --</p><p>WALLACE: Your talk about the blank countries? </p><p>GATES: Exactly. In the U.S. engagement in Africa and around the world,  there are many reasons we should maintain that. Just a pure security point  of view alone would justify this level of expenditure. </p><p>Now, for many people, the humanitarian part of it is also there and that  part is dramatic. And so it is disappointing when it feels like the U.S. is  being short-term and the U.S. is only thinking about its interest in a very  narrow way and not being the leader that says, now, we -- you know, we are  going to help these countries get so that they can -- can take care of  themselves. </p><p>WALLACE: The president's mantra is America first. You seem to be suggesting  that in terms of America's interests you've got to look a long way beyond  America first. </p><p>GATES: Well, I think that the broad definition of our interests, including  investing in allies and not viewing every transaction as one that we have  to maximize our benefit, taking, you know, world institutions and have them  just focus on the United States. What we did, in terms of the post-World  War II institutions has been a fantastic thing. That included having a  common view of the future with our western allies. </p><p>If you really follow that line of thinking, the idea of helping Africa, of  working on an HIV vaccine to stop the AIDS crisis, you just wouldn't do it.  And -- and yet I feel, even in that narrow framework of, OK, I only care  about what -- how U.S. citizens do, even in that framework, these  institutions, these alliances, these investments in innovation are  overwhelmingly smart things to do. </p><p>WALLACE: Since the year 2000, a billion people have lifted themselves from  what you define as extreme poverty. And you say that the first wave was in  China and the second wave was in India. Before we get to places where the  wave hasn't hit yet, what happened in those places? </p><p>GATES: One of the first things you want to do in these countries is raise  agricultural productivity. All of the Asian miracles, even going back to  Taiwan and Japan, South Korea, involved more than tripling agricultural  output per person so you could free up that labor and move it into the  cities. And if you had the right infrastructure, educational investment,  then you've got a manufacturing sector of the economy and slowly but surely  you'd get a very large middle class. </p><p>WALLACE: You talk about the successes, the waves in China and India, and  then there's Africa. You say that by 2050, 86 percent -- 86 percent of the  extremely poor people in the world will live in Africa and, in fact, 40  percent will live in just two countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo  and Nigeria. </p><p>What's holding them back? </p><p>GATES: They're starting at very low levels of infrastructure, very low  level of property. And one of the things that drives those numbers you  mentioned is the very high population growth. And so they account for  double the portions of births you'd expect. By the end of the century, the  majority of births in the world will take place in Africa. </p><p>Africa has to demand our attention. That's where extreme poverty is still  tough. That's where stability is difficult to achieve. And, you know, we've  got to go after things like these neglected diseases, malaria. We've got to  help them with infrastructure. It's really, in terms of our humanity of  helping the poorest, Africa's where we'll be most tested. </p><p>WALLACE: How do you even begin to address these concentrations of misery? </p><p>GATES: Well, one of the great achievements in development history was what  was called the green revolution where new varieties of the cereal (ph)  crops, corn, which everyone else calls maize, rice and wheat. In a period  where people thought India would experience mass starvation because the  agricultural output went up, they were actually able to improve the  nutrition even when their population was growing. We need to do that same  thing for Africa. </p><p>WALLACE: It seems that climate change could be the accelerant to all of the  bad things in terms of agricultural productivity, global health,  instability, extreme poverty. Talk about that. </p><p>GATES: Yes. For a country like the U.S., that's northern, you know, climate  change will change things. We'll have more hot days, more forest fires. But  it's not a threat to our survival. </p><p>In Africa, where you are completely dependent on the rain coming, whereas  there been in the past about one out of 12 years you'll have a failed  harvest, the prediction is that we be closer to one out of four years  because of the higher temperature and the -- the -- unfortunately, with  climate change, you -- not only is it hotter, but the rain comes all at  once, or it doesn't come for long periods of time. So if you want to say,  where are you going to get millions of deaths because of climate change  between now and the end of the century, you don't look to the United  States. Yes, you'll have some forest fires and there will be some deaths.  But the -- the significant numbers are in these very, very poor countries  because of the subsistence farming. </p><p>WALLACE: What do you say to those who say it's not climate change, it's  weather, and that the -- the man -- the human component is questionable? </p><p>GATES: That's impressive if somebody can say that out loud. The --the  amount of --</p><p>WALLACE: Have you been -- have you been to Washington? </p><p>GATES: The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is a super measurable thing.  It's important not to over claim what we know because that undermines the  whole discussion., But the general warming and the mechanism of that  warming has to do with CO2 and methane emissions. That's -- that's really  not a question. </p><p>WALLACE: I want to talk to you about toilets. Since 2011, the Gates  Foundation has launched to reinvent the toilet challenge. Explain, one, why  that's so important, and, two, again, dealing with the specifics, what have  been some of your successes and failures along the way? </p><p>GATES: In many of these poor countries, the capital cost of building that  sewer, it's just never going to happen. And so the solution would be to,  instead of using that sewer, to have something in the toilet itself, which  is essentially the processing facility. We have ten different universities  whose designs we funded. So we put in several hundred million dollars. And  now we've gotten it to the point where we have a lot of commercial  companies who say, OK, that approach looks promising. </p><p>Now, the price of this toilet, that does the processing, is still ten times  more expensive. It's about, you know, $10,000 per toilet right now. We need  to get it into these tough parts, the slums of these African cities. We  need it to be more like a thousand dollars. </p><p>WALLACE: I want to ask about your -- your old job. There's something of a  backlash here in Washington against big tech. The growing feeling in  Washington is that big tech does not do enough to protect users' privacy  and that it shows political bias. Do you see merit in either of those  arguments? </p><p>GATES: I went through an episode in the late '90s where Microsoft was  subject to government investigation. </p><p>WALLACE: We remember. </p><p>GATES: And so in a way this is -- in a small way now it's less Microsoft  now, but it's broad. </p><p>Yes, the government should be talking to these companies about what they  do. There's nothing inappropriate. </p><p>I was naive. I didn't have an office in Washington, D.C. I thought that was  a good thing and I even bragged about it. I later came to regret that. </p><p>So these -- I'm sure these guys are learning better than I did that they  need to come back here and start a dialogue. And there will be new types of  regulations for these companies. </p><p>WALLACE: And you don't have a problem with that? I mean you think that's  appropriate?</p><p>GATES: Well, the notion that there will be privacy regulations, that makes  a lot of sense. The notion that this ability to identify anyone that were  going to think about how do businesses get to use that and how does the  government use that, it makes a lot of sense. </p><p>WALLACE: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are right now jockeying for which is  going to be the most highly valued company in the world in terms of market  capitalization. At the close of the market on Friday, Microsoft was number  one at over $800 billion, Apple, $799.5 billion. Does that give you any  pleasure? </p><p>GATES: You know, when I was starting Microsoft in my 20s, the idea that we  could create a company that was -- you know, would beat IBM, you know,  because they were the big monolith and, you know, we understood software  and they didn't. And we believed in these cute, small machines to empower  individuals and they believed in these big machines. It was kind of mythic  that we were going to beat IBM.</p><p>By the time Microsoft valuation passed IBM, which is now, you know, 15  years ago, it didn't feel like that big of a victory. And so you really --  it's really better to define yourself by an aspiration. You know, can  software improve education? Can software help, you know, medical care costs  in the U.S. just keep going up dramatically? Can software play a role  there?.</p><p>So, yes, I'm very proud of Microsoft and the vision that software and  technology would make a big thing.

Who in the president's inner circle is next to  fall?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Let me tell you, I never  directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did on his own.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WALLACE:  What do we know about President Trump's involvement in hush money  payments of two women during the 2016 campaign?  And what does Michael  Cohen's cooperation mean for the special counsel investigation?  We'll ask  the president's lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then -- </p><p>TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.   I will take the mantle.  I will be the one to shut it down.  I'm not going  to blame you for it.  </p><p>WALLACE:  The president deals with a divided Washington and a possible  government shutdown over his border wall.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  Perhaps he doesn't understand people  leave their paychecks.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel if we're headed for compromise or  confrontation.  </p><p>Plus -- </p><p>BILL GATES, GATES FOUNDATSION:  The U.S.'s engagement in Africa and around  the world, there are many reasons we should maintain that.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We'll talk with Bill Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation  about what he feels is a shrinking U.S. role in dealing with global poverty  and public health.  </p><p>All right now on \"FOX News Sunday\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE:  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.  </p><p>We begin with breaking news.  A federal judge has ruled the entire  Affordable Care Act invalid.  Obamacare will remain in place pending appeal  and both President Trump and Democrats are calling for Congress to pass new  legislation.  We'll get to all that a little later.  </p><p>But first, the president is already dealing with a possible government  shutdown that's now just five days away.  Meanwhile, prosecutors are  producing more of the evidence that led former members of Mr. Trump's inner  circle to plead guilty, evidence that implicates the president.  </p><p>Let's get the latest from Kevin Corke live at the White House -- Kevin.  </p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, even for an administration  accustomed to seismic shifts in the news cycle, it was without a doubt a  tumultuous week.  But few headlines could prove as potentially damaging to  the Trump White House than those involving former members of the  president's inner circle.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  Three of whom are facing time in prison for a variety of misdeeds,  but none involving so-called Russian collusion.  Former national security  adviser, General Michael Flynn, faces sentencing Tuesday for lying to  federal investigators.  The special counsel's office recommending he get no  jail time even as it has faced charges that the general was entrapped and  inappropriately questioned.  </p><p>Meanwhile, in his first televised interview since being sentenced to three  years behind bar, the president's former fixer, attorney Michael Cohen,  claimed he repeatedly lied for Mr. Trump over the years and he would set up  payments to women to help aid his 2016 campaign, a claim strongly denied by  the White House.  </p><p>TRUMP:  I will take the mantle of shutting down and I'm going to shut it  down for border security.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  But we believe you shouldn't shut it  down.</p><p>CORKE:  An Oval Office meeting with leading Democrats this week did little  to quell fears of a potential partial government shutdown over the  president's insistence that there would be funding for a border wall,  something Democrats say they won't pay for.  A work stoppage that could  come in a week in which backers of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare,  consider their next move in the wake of a federal judge's ruling that the  law is unconstitutional.  </p><p>TRUMP:  -- that the Supreme Court upholds, we'll be sitting down with the  Democrats and we will get great health care for our people.  Let's say  repeal and replace.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  That ruling by District Court Judge Reed O'Connor, Chris, does not  impact Obamacare recipients in the short term, but it does set up a  potential high court battle and that is a debate White House officials  would love to have -- Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thanks.  </p><p>WALLACE:  And joining me now from New York, the president's lead lawyer,  Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p>Mayor, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\".  </p><p>RUDY GUILIANI, LEAD LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you  -- thank you, Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's start with Michael Cohen's allegation that President Trump  directed him to commit a criminal campaign finance violation.  Here first  was the president and then Mr. Cohen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I never directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did  on his own.  He's a lawyer.  A lawyer who represents a client is supposed  to do the right thing.  </p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  He directed me to make the  payments, he directed me to become involved in these matters.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  Question.  Did Mr. Trump direct Michael Cohen to pay off these  two women or not?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No, the truth is actually what Cohen testified to under oath  before Congress and what he repeated numerous times on surreptitious tape  recordings that he made, which is that the president didn't know about this  until some time into it, he did find out about it and eventually reimburse  him.  But, you know, this is a hard thing to do, but lawyers do this all  the time.  </p><p>But, Chris, even if it were true, it's not a crime.  The payment -- the  payment of money in a situation like this has been covered in the Edwards  case.  Not only the acquittal and hung jury in the Edwards case, but the  fact that the FEC looked at those Edwards violations and determined they  weren't violations --   </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>WALLACE:  I promise we're going to get to that in a minute, but let's get  to the simple fact, question of whether the president directed Cohen --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- to make these --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- payments or not.  </p><p>Cohen says that the president is not to be believed.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>COHEN:  The man doesn't tell the truth.  And it's sad that I should take  responsibility for his dirty deeds.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Wow.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor -- Mayor --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  That's some lawyer.  That is some lawyer.  He was the lawyer in  that situation.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>WALLACE:  But does the president tell the truth or not?   </p><p>GIULIANI:  The president is telling the truth, yes.  This man is lying.  </p><p>Now, is that a big surprise to you, that Michael Cohen is lying?  The man  got up in front of the judge and said I was a fiercely loyal to Donald  Trump.  Nonsense he was fiercely loyal to him, he taped him, lied to him,  revealed the tape and did something a lawyer I've never heard ever did --  tape record his own client.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But -- but, sir --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  He sat there with Chris Cuomo, told him he wasn't being taped,  showed him a drawer (ph), and he lied to him and taped him for two hours.   The man is a complete pathological liar that cannot be believed.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But, sir, let's -- let's turn to --   </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GIULIANI:  And they'll never put him on a witness stand.  They will never - - Chris --   </p><p>WALLACE:  Yes, but let me ask you --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  -- they will never put him on a witness stand.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I understand.  But does the question -- the real question is the  credibility of the president, not the credibility of Michael Cohen --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No, no --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let me just finish.  The president has changed his story  repeatedly about whether or not he knew about hush money.  Here is what he  said on Air Force One -- the president said on Air Force One this April,  eight months ago.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>REPORTER:  Mr. President, did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy  Daniels?</p><p>TRUMP:  No.  No.  What else?  </p><p>REPORTER:  Then why did Michael Cohen make those if there was no truth to  her allegations?  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.  Michael is my attorney and  you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.   </p><p>REPORTER:  Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?  </p><p>TRUMP:  No, I don't know.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  The president said he doesn't know anything about any payments,  but in one of those tapes that you're talking about where Cohen  surreptitiously taped the president -- this is back in September of 2016 --  here are the president and Cohen discussing a potential --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>WALLACE:  Let's listen to the tape first.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Sure, sure.  I remember it well.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>COHEN:  I'm all over that.  And I spoke to Allen about it.  When it comes  time for the financing, which will be --   </p><p>TRUMP:  Wait a sec, what financing?  </p><p>COHEN:  Well, I'll have to pay --  </p><p>TRUMP:  Pay with cash --  </p><p>COHEN:  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  So which is it?  Did the president know about the hush money  payments or not?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris, there's an intervening event that you're not talking  about.  I know this really well because I got criticized for revealing this  when I first came into the case.  Nobody really understood why I was doing  it.  </p><p>When I first came into the case, we went through the whole case.  The  president saw some notes and documents, thought about it, and I went out  and said, no, there was an intervening conversation after the payments took  place and before the revelations you're talking about on Air Force One.</p><p>The president did talk to Cohen or to people in between and they arranged  to reimburse Cohen.  This was after the payment was made, after it was  over, after the campaign was over.</p><p>WALLACE:  But -- but there's --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  They're talking about a conversation, sir, in September of 2016  during the campaign.  The president is clearly aware that David Pecker, the  head of \"National Enquirer\" had paid off Karen McDougal and they're talking  about reimbursing McDougal --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Well, you know, that's --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- or reimbursing Pecker for that payment.</p><p>GIULIANI:  But there's a -- there's a big difference here.  That was a -  that was a conversation he was asked, middle of the campaign, I was with  him back then in the middle of the campaign, he's working 18 hours a day.   I wasn't able to remember a lot of things that happened in September of  2016.  He was asked it one time.  </p><p>When he sat down with his lawyer and went through it in great detail and  saw things that could refresh his recollection, we immediately corrected  it.</p><p>Nobody pushed us, nobody found it, we found it.  And we corrected it and I  got criticized like crazy for doing it.</p><p>WALLACE:  So you're saying --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  By the time this came out, we all knew --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- the fact -- I mean, the -- according both to Cohen and to  Pecker, the -- again, he's the head of -- or was the head of National  Enquirer, they say they were in a meeting with Donald Trump --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris, Chris, Chris --  </p><p>WALLACE:   -- in the summer of 2016 in which --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- they discussed the payment to Karen McDougal.</p><p>GIULIANI:  We're talking about something that doesn't matter.  I mean,  whether - whether it happened or didn't happen, it's not illegal.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  You're moving shells around on me.  Either it happened or it  didn't happen.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But that's what lawyers do all the time.  You argue in the  alternative.  I'm telling it --  </p><p>WALLACE:  But I'm asking you for the truth, sir.</p><p>GIULIANI:  I'm telling you definitively -- well, I -- I want the truth too.   And the truth is, yes, the tape-recorded conversation did take place.  It  exonerates the president.  The president tells Cohen, do it by check.  </p><p>I'm sorry, I prosecuted thousands of crimes, never prosecuted one where  they wanted to hide something, they did it by check.  </p><p>Make sure we pay him back.  They paid him back.  That's what that  conversation's all about.  It exonerates him.</p><p>I'd play that conversation in front of any jury in America and I'd cross- examine Cohen in front of any jury in America.</p><p>WALLACE:  OK, here's what you're telling --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But I -- but very important; Cohen did not plead guilty to  conspiracy to violate the campaign finance laws.  If they were going to use  him as a witness against anybody, you always make them plea guilty to a  conspiracy so you can fill the conspiracy in.  </p><p>He pled guilty to a singular crime of violating the campaign finance laws.   Not a conspiracy.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yes, but the statement is full of references to individual one  who is Donald Trump.  Here's what you told the --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p>WALLACE:  Here's what you told \"The Daily Beast\" this week.  I want to put  it up on the screen.  </p><p>Nobody got killed.  Nobody got robbed.  This was not a big crime.</p><p>Mayor, what's the threshold between a crime and a big crime?</p><p>GIULIANI:  My statement there was about the prosecutor's view of it, not  mine.  Mr. Swinger (ph) who wrote that, actually corrected that, to say  that that was taken out of context.  My point was, there was no crime.  </p><p>But even if you take the prosecutor's viewpoint, this prosecutor was  appointed -- both of them, right, looking at collusion, no collusion.   Looking at obstruction --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sir, this was the Southern  District of New York.  This is not -- has nothing to do with collusion --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But now you're --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- or obstruction of justice, there --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Now, you're - they're part of the Department of Justice -- he's  not being investigated --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I understand it's a separate prosecutor.  I'm sure -- I'm sure  when you were the --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, this guy -- this guy is going back --  </p><p>WALLACE:  I'm sure - I'm sure when you were the U.S. attorney for the  Southern District --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  And this guy is going back --  </p><p>WALLACE:  You didn't take orders from somebody in Washington who had  nothing to do with the attorney general.  You were your own -- they used to  call it a sovereign district of New York, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  The person -- the person in charge of this investigation, Chris,  is Rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.  He is  the boss of Mueller and he is the boss of the Southern District of New  York.  He's the one that determined, let's move it over here.  He put it  there in the Southern District of New York and keeps supervision of it.</p><p>WALLACE:  I know --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  So don't give me that.</p><p>WALLACE:  But they're not --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  But they're not -- they're not working for --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  There is one Justice Department --- yes they are.  They're  working for the same Rod -- Rod Rosenstein's going to make the decision,  not Mueller, about what to do with this case.</p><p>WALLACE:  Right, and not Mueller.</p><p>GIULIANI:  And this is a witch-hunt.  They are going back now -- they're  going back to 1982, 1983.  They're going through business records.  My  goodness, they went from collusion to obstruction, no evidence -- now  campaign finance, no violation of the law.  </p><p>No matter who's right about what they said, it's no violation of the law.   And now --  </p><p>WALLACE:  The president -- I -- I want to -- I want to move on.  You're --  you're very a effective lawyer, but I've got -- I've got to move on, sir.  </p><p>President Trump --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  You wanted the truth.  That's the truth.  The truth is it's not  a violation of the law.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I want -- I want the truth in a limited amount of time.  </p><p>President Trump talked this week about whether or not General Flynn lied to  the FBI.  Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  They took a general that they said didn't lie, and they convinced  him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal.  And now, they're  recommending no time.  You know why?  Because they're embarrassed that  they've got caught.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Does the president believe Michael Flynn lied or not?</p><p>GIULIANI:  I don't know if Michael Flynn lied or not.  You got two  contradictory things.  You've got the FBI saying at the time that he wasn't  lying.  And then we have no explanation and the guy pleads guilty to lying.  </p><p>So, I -- I mean, I don't know what happened in between.  I do know they  treated Flynn in a way that came very close to --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I'm asking a simple -- I'm asking a simple question.  And the  reason I ask is I want to put up a tweet from the president a year ago, in  December of 2017, when he says this: I had to fire General Flynn because he  lied to the vice president and the FBI.  He has pled guilty to those lies.</p><p>The president a year ago seemed to know that Flynn has lied.  Now, he's not  so sure.</p><p>GIULIANI:  The president doesn't know that he lied.  The president -- the  president --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  But he -- he knows what you knew at the time.  The man pled  guilty to lying.  He did --  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, he knows -- he knows what -- he knows what Flynn said to his  vice president.</p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, but that was a lie, but that's not a crime.</p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I understand but I didn't ask if it was a crime, I asked  whether it was a lie.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris -- Chris, you're going all over the place and you're  really confusing people.  Look, first of all --  </p><p>WALLACE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>GIULIANI:  You are -- you are -- you are -- you are -- you are, really --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  I didn't ask if it was a crime.  I asked whether  it was a lie and he told the same lie to the FBI and to the vice president.   And you're quite right, lying to the vice president isn't a lie, it's not  very good -- but lying to the FBI --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  -- is a crime.</p><p>GIULIANI:  Right.  And the more important thing about what the president  knew or didn't know -- because this doesn't involve the president in terms  of him being involved in any kind of conspiracy or anything else -- it's  like if it's reported that one of my assistants when I was a U.S. attorney  lied to the court, how do I know if he did or he didn't?  He knows what he  reads.  The man pled guilty to lying --  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK.  I got -- I got one minute --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  -- so, yes.  He didn't know at the time -- I didn't know at the  time -- I didn't know at the time that the FBI had previously concluded he  was telling the truth.</p><p>WALLACE:  I got a --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  I didn't know he had been deprived of a lawyer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, you're confusing people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GIULIANI:  I'm not confusing people.</p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask you --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  The man was railroaded.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- three last quick questions.</p><p>GIULIANI:  He was railroaded.</p><p>WALLACE:  There are -- there are reports now that the special counsel is  interested again in interviewing the president.  Has his office reached out  to you about sitting down for an in-person interview with the president?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes.  There are several unpaid parking tickets that night --  back in 1986, '87 that haven't been explained.  You know, we've got to --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Seriously?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Seriously, unpaid parking tickets --  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, no.</p><p>GIULIANI:  It was a movie theater.  He didn't pay the proper fee.</p><p>WALLACE:  Is the special counsel -- does he want to interview the  president?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, good luck.  Good luck.  After what they did to Flynn, the  way they trapped him into perjury and no sentence for him, 14 days for  Papadopoulos.  I did better on traffic violations than they did with  Papadopoulos.  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, when you say good luck, you're saying no way, no interview?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  They're a joke.  Over my dead body, but you know, I could be  dead.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do they want to speak to the president?</p><p>GIULIANI:  I do have -- I do have other lawyer -- I am disgusted with the  tactics they have used in this case.  What they did to General Flynn should  result in discipline.  They're the ones who are violating the law.  </p><p>They're looking at a non-crime collusion, the other guys are looking at a  non-crime campaign violations, which are not violations.  And they are the  ones who are violating the law, the rules, the ethics and nobody wants to  look at them.  They destroyed Strzok and Page's texts, 19,000 texts.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  If he had destroyed 19,000 texts, they'd put him in jail.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Even though they can't because he's the president.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor Giuliani.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Thank you.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  I got a little --   </p><p>WALLACE:  No, listen, I love it and please come back.  To be continued.  </p><p>Thank you for your time.  Always good to talk to you, sir.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Thank you.  Thank you. </p><p>WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what a  judge's Obamacare ruling could mean for millions of Americans.  </p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump saying  he'd be proud to shut down the government over a border wall.  Just go to  Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  A big, big victory by a highly respected judge.  Highly, highly  respected in Texas and on the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we  will get great, great health care for our people.  We'll have to sit down  with the Democrats to do it but I'm sure they want to do it also.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  President Trump praising the ruling from the federal judge  striking down the entire Obamacare law.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group.  Fox News senior political analyst  Brit Hume, columnist for \"The Hill\", Juan Williams, Julie Pace, Washington  bureau chief for \"The Associated Press\" and Marc Short, former director of  legislative affairs for President Trump.  </p><p>Well, Brit, the federal judge said Obamacare is invalid because Congress  has taken out the tax penalty as part of the individual mandate, which is  the way that it passed through the Supreme Court in the first place.  But  we should point out the law stays in effect pending appeal.  </p><p>What do you think of the ruling and how do you think this plays  politically?  </p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, remember, this is a  trial court judge.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Right.</p><p>HUME:  So, this is subject to appeal to appellate court and perhaps on the  Supreme Court.  I think it's an interesting legal argument whether because  of the invalidation of the zeroing out of the penalty was the whole law  therefore is invalid.  I think you can hear good, legal arguments on both  sides of that issue but I think we're nowhere near the last of this and  because the judge did not issue an injunction that shuts it down.  As you  point out, Obamacare will remain in place -- what's left of Obamacare  remains in place for the foreseeable future.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But how does it play politically, given the fact there are  certain parts of Obamacare that people didn't like, like the individual  mandate.  On the other hand, there are lot of parts of it that people did  like pre-existing conditions --  </p><p>HUME:  Right. </p><p>WALLACE:  And that's according to the judge's ruling would be out, too.   </p><p>HUME:  It would be out but it won't be out now and it won't be out soon, in  my judgment.  So, I think the political effect will depend on the actual  practical effect and there is no practical effect for the time being.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Juan, the president and Republicans ran in 2016 on  the idea of repeal and replace Obamacare, which they thought was a good  issue for them.  Democrats won in 2018 on the argument the Republicans want  to take away your pre-existing conditions.  </p><p>So, how do you think this is going to cut, particularly given the fact as  Brit Hume says, it's not going to have a practical effect, it's not going  to take effect for some months, maybe a year as it goes to the courts.  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think you can see  already this morning, Republicans are on their heels, not really saying  much about this while you have Nancy Pelosi and potentially incoming  speaker of the house saying Democrats will defend it.  Chris Murphy, the  senator from Connecticut, saying it's a five-alarm fire.  I think clearly  Democrats see themselves in a position where they are on the offensive with  the voters about this.  If you take away Obamacare, you know, after how  many -- 70 votes by Republicans to repeal it, didn't work even with the  Republican majority, Chris.</p><p>It's not only that you would do away with things like pre-existing  conditions, you would drive up premiums for everybody.  Our health care  system would be in chaos.  So, I think that what you get here is  Republicans right now including President Trump, who initially tweeted  great, great, are saying we need a bipartisan collaboration here to make  health care work.  </p><p>That's a different tone from Republicans and I think it's very telling  about who is politically at risk here.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Marc, you're wrinkling your brow.  </p><p>MARC SHORT, FORMER DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Well, I think, look, Republicans won in 2010 and 2014 and 2016 in large  part on a promise to repeal Obamacare and now somehow the media are saying  it's an albatross on Republicans.  It's been a political win for  Republicans.  </p><p>WALLACE:  If you look at the polls, Obamacare has become more popular.  </p><p>SHORT:  And you know why, Chris?  Because the last two years, from 2013 to  2017, premiums went up 105 percent across the country.  In the last year,  they've gone up 5 percent.  They used to be 50 percent of the counties in  the United States had one insurer, and that was it.  That's been fixed.   All counties now have more than one insurer.</p><p>Because this administration has provided more choice for people, they have  actually helped to stabilize the markets.  That doesn't mean forcing people  to buy a product they don't want is a good policy.  </p><p>JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:  But in terms of the fallout from this  ruling potentially, one thing you're definitely not hearing from the  Republicans after this judge's ruling is any interest in going back to the  drawing board and starting from scratch.  If -- ultimately, this move  through the court that Obamacare fully is repealed, you do not have a lot  of Republicans who want to spend 2019 deep in the weeds on health care.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Let me switch, I'll tell you what they're going to spend at the  end of 2018 on.  There is the real threat now of a partial government  shutdown that would start at midnight this Friday.  Here's how that played  out this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,  because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that  have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.  So I will take  the mantle.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  He is taking full responsibility for  the Trump shutdown.  Perhaps he doesn't understand people need their  paychecks.  Maybe that's not the life he leads.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the  president saying that he would be proud to shutdown the government, we got  this on Facebook from Linda Rector.  </p><p>Why is shutting down the government not something to be proud of if it  means protecting the country?  That's exactly what we elected the president  to do. </p><p>Marc, Juan, how do you answer Linda?  And two, as a person who until last  July used to deal with Congress for the White House, for President Trump,  what do you think is going to happen?  Will there be a shutdown?  Will they  kick it down the can into January?  </p><p>SHORT:  If there were a shutdown, it would be different the very previous  ones.  This government has already funded all the men and women serving in  uniform.  It has funded all the entitlement checks.  It will keep the parts  of (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>So, the average American wouldn't even recognize the shutdown other than  the fact that it would be a media story, Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait, there's about 30 percent of the government that gets shut  down and I think 30 to 40 percent of the employees.  </p><p>SHORT:  And every time there's been a shutdown, every employee has been  paid back in full.  So I think the average person is not going to feel it  in the immediate future.  </p><p>Having said that, I still think you're going to find a compromise that  comes together before the end of the week.  I think the president has got  to look to find ways to fund this out of military construction dollars.   They'll create a separate problem later, because Democrats object to that.  </p><p>But last year, we secured the first new funding, $1.6 billion for the wall  in ten years.  Democrats come on your show and say we oppose any funding  for the wall.  They've already agreed to it.  It's already 1.6 in this  year.  </p><p>All we're not arguing about is not what they are, it's how much it costs,  and it's a matter of whether they can notified (ph) being at 1.6. </p><p>WALLACE:  That's an old joke.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let's gather here, everybody.  </p><p>So, Julie, shutdown or not?  </p><p>PACE:  I think all signs point to, as Marc says, some kind of compromise.   I think we'll have a tense couple of days.  This is normally how the  pattern of these shutdowns play out, but both Republicans and Democrats  that I talked on Capitol Hill last week have very little interest in a  shutdown.  They have very little interest in staying in Washington for  Christmas which is ultimately what this comes down to a lot of times.  </p><p>I do think that the president might be itching for a shutdown.  But I  ultimately think he will sign on if there is some kind of compromise that  gets some amount of wall funding and he can punt towards the military to  see if that's another option for building the wall.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask about another issue, which is the  president on Friday afternoon named a acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney,  and it's already come out that during the 2016 campaign, during a debate  right after the \"Access Hollywood\" came out, a debate with his Democratic  candidate, this is before he joined the Trump administration as OMB  director, he said this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF:  Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump,  doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact I think he's a  terrible human being.  But the choice on the other side is just as bad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Well --  </p><p>PACE:  Here we are.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do you think that creates problems for Mulvaney?  </p><p>PACE:  I think Mulvaney has been really strategic over the last couple of  years.  He has found a way to work with the president.  He's been very  loyal to the president since he's taken his job as OMB director.  So much  so that Trump keeps trying to give him other jobs in addition to chief of  staff.  </p><p>I do think that it's interesting that Mulvaney is leaving himself an out by  taking on the acting chief of staff role and keeping his job as OMB  director, if this doesn't work out for either side, he's got a fallback  option within the administration.  But Mulvaney kind of falls into a  category like a Lindsey Graham, who was also critical of the president  during the campaign, even after he became the nominee but has found a way  to work with him in office.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Brit, after Nick Ayers turned the president down, the vice  president's chief of staff, and then Chris Christie turned the president  down, he almost had to name somebody, didn't he?  This was getting a little  embarrassing.  </p><p>HUME:  He was like the guy who couldn't get a date for the prom and he  finally got Mulvaney, who was already on board to join in.  But Mulvaney is  a good choice.  He's a very able guy, seasoned and experience, knows the  issues, knows the policies, knows the government.  So -- </p><p>WALLACE:  I'll say something else, he is a happy warrior.  He's a guy who - - he's a positive guy.  He is also a guy who might come on Sunday talk  shows, which John Kelly treated us like the plague.  </p><p>HUME:  He wasn't interested.  </p><p>I would add this.  There's some talk that Trump doesn't need to chief of  staff, he should be his own, that is really nonsense because Trump needs  help from people who really know this town, know its ways, know the  details, know the issues, and he has been at important time, willing to  accept advice from those people to his benefit.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right, panel, we have to take a break here.  But stay right  here.  </p><p>When we come back, as new evidence implicates the president, what are the  chances Democrats will move pursuing impeachment?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Coming up, the president sounds off on the  Mueller investigation, as his former fixer is sentenced to prison. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nobody, except for me, would  be looked at like this. Nobody. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll get our Sunday panel's read on how serious the president's  legal troubles really are, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What he did was all unrelated  to me except for the two campaign finance charges that are not criminal and  shouldn't have been on there. They put that on to embarrass me. They put  those two charges on to embarrass me. </p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I told the truth. I took  responsibility for my actions. And instead of him taking responsibility for  his actions, what does he do? He attacks my family. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: President Trump and his former fixer, Michael Cohen, taking shots  at each other after Cohen received a three-year prison sentence for a  number of crimes, including making hush money payments during the 2016  campaign.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel. </p><p>Julie, there are reports, and we hear these from time to time, the  president is more and more consumed by the special counsel investigation,  especially as former allies like Michael Cohen and the publisher of \"The  National Enquirer\" are providing evidence against him. </p><p>What do you hear your sources? </p><p>JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": So I think it is indisputable that the  president is consumed by these investigations. You really don't need any  secret sources on this. You just need to look at his -- at his Twitter  feed. He is following the twists and turns of this extremely closely. And  as people who are close to him get caught up in this, he gets more  agitated. And I think now we are seeing that almost every aspect of his  life, over the last several years, is now under some level of  investigation. His administration, his campaign, the inauguration, and his  businesses. </p><p>And the business piece of this is, I think, the one that is getting to the  president the most because, yes, being president is part of his identity,  but actually being this successful businessman is almost more important to  him in some ways. It's how he has defined himself for decades. And it's his  children's legacy. They are at the top of this -- at this business. And any  sign that his business could crumble, that past business dealings could be  swept up in this investigation, is incredibly personal to him. </p><p>WALLACE: Marc.</p><p>MARC SHORT, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR: I agree  100 percent with Julie. I think that what's unfortunate here is that you  have what begins as a special prosecutor focus on collusion in Russia. And  as Julie just said, it's about every part of his life. We end up saying,  instead of investigating a crime, we're investigating a person. And  Republicans and civil libertarians used to oppose that motion after Iran  Contra. Then they fell in love with it during the Whitewater years because  they said it was a land deal but it became something about an affair with  an intern. </p><p>And it's a problem. It's a problem where we have prosecutors going all  over. And I think -- </p><p>WALLACE: But how about -- how about the argument that is made, gee, we  didn't hear Republicans complain about it when it happened to Bill Clinton? </p><p>SHORT: I agree 100 percent. I'm saying -- I'm saying Republicans as well  have been hypocritical on this. There used to be a group of strong, civil  libertarians who would recognize the problem of special prosecutors. And --  probably this is now the -- what's been born of that fruit. </p><p>WALLACE: All right, so far the only alleged crime that the president is  specifically linked to is not collusion, is not obstruction of justice, it  involves campaign finance violations, alleged campaign finance violations. </p><p>Here is how Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler, the incoming chair of the  House Judiciary Committee, responded to that this week. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERRY NADLER (D-NY), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, RANKING MEMBER: Well, they  would be impeachable offenses. Whether they are important enough to justify  an impeachment is a different question. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Brit, how persuaded are you that if President Trump directed these  payments, these hush money payments, as Michael Cohen says he did, that it  was a campaign finance violation on his part, a criminal violation? And,  two, what do you think of the likelihood that the House and the wisdom of  the House proceeding to impeachment on campaign finance violation? </p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it's a little hard to  imagine a president being impeached for a campaign finance violation. Most  of these violations are handled as civil matters and result in fines. And  they are, you know, widespread, rampant. Obama had a -- the Obama campaign  had to pay a big fine.</p><p>I don't -- I just don't think the House of Representatives, even such  ardent Democrats as Jerry Nadler, will go there. The greater worry is that  some other charge comes out when Mueller finally gets his ore in with his  report and says whatever he says. And that, I think, Chris, raises an  intriguing question, which is this, how far will these House investigations  go if Mueller doesn't find something very serious about the president? My  thought is, it probably takes the wind out of their sails, but we'll have  to wait and see. But, on balance, I don't think campaign finance is going  to dislodge him. </p><p>WALLACE: When you look at all of this and, you know, as we say, there is  still no hard evidence of collusion, no hard evidence of obstruction of  justice, but the wall do seem to be moving in on the president on a lot of  fronts. </p><p>HUME: Well, I don't think the Mueller report is likely to be -- to sing the  president's praises. But that's not what he needs. What he needs is kind of  an -- of a -- of a report that says, you know does not outline some major  crime. And if that happens, I mean I think it changes the atmosphere  dramatically, both legally and politically, because I think it's -- and if  he is vindicated on no collusion, which is what he's been saying, I don't  think the -- I've never thought that collusion was the central point of  this investigation. </p><p>Remember, when it started, Chris, it was a counterintelligence  investigation with the FBI acting as an intelligence agency to determine  what Russia actually did. And if you go back and look at the letter  authorizing Mueller's appointment, it says -- it mentions that it picks up  that investigation and then says, he's also authorized to find out if there  was collaboration between the two. That was always a subset of the overall  investigation. And if it turns out to be a subset with no crime alleged in  the final report, I think it's a huge boost for the president. </p><p>WALLACE: Juan.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the Democratic  base is so inflamed by Trump, by his behavior overall, I think they -- they  would think that Democrats weren't, in fact, holding up to their  constitutional responsivities if they did not consider impeachment. So you  get the --</p><p>WALLACE: Even on campaign finance violations? </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, what we -- what did we learn this week? He wants to  say it's just Michael Cohen making these outrageous claims because Cohen  wants a better deal from the prosecutors. But, in fat, we hear from David  Packer at \"National Enquirer,\" same thing happened. We hear from \"The Wall  Street Journal,\" the president was in the room. So if -- potentially he  would be an unindicted coconspirator while his president because nobody  thinks you can indict the president. But that doesn't mean that you can't  go to the Congress and say, let's look at this and see -- </p><p>WALLACE: Do you really think that would be wise for Democrats to do? And  this -- this is speculative.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, that's a separate issue. That's a separate issue. </p><p>WALLACE: OK. Well, that's my question, though.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK. Well, if the question was --</p><p>WALLACE: Would it be wise for them to do it if that's all that there is? </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think that's -- no. And I think that what you're  going to see, and you already see this from, by the way, Jerry Nadler, but  also from Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, as the say, they're not interested  right now. But the base of the party, is what I was trying to say to you,  Chris, is going to be putting pressure there because they think that, in  fact, Democrats had been too docile in dealing with Trump and they want --  they want them to come and have the --</p><p>WALLACE: They want blood?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, because, guess what, you've saw a blue wave, 40 seats  switch hands, and the number -- you know, health care was clearly  important. But also a check on Trump was very important to voters. </p><p>WALLACE: And every indication is -- everybody keeps saying this  investigation is going to be over the end of the year. </p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't see it. </p><p>WALLACE: I always say, pick the over, right? </p><p>PACE: Right. We -- we don't know what else Mueller has. I think this could  go well into next year and really line up with some of these congressional  investigation. </p><p>WALLACE: Thank you, panel. </p><p>Up next we sit down with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, head of the Gates  Foundation. In the era of America first, he worries about a shrinking U.S.  role in dealing with global poverty and public health.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest  private charitable fund, giving $46 billion in grants since its founding in  2000 and literally saving millions of lives. The Microsoft co-founder came  to Washington this week to make the case for American leadership and the  need for foreign aid in the era of America first. When we sat down at the  Chamber of Commerce, that's where we began. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER AND PHILANTHROPIST: There was a  recommendation by the executive branch to make fairly substantial cuts U.S.  aid budget. And, fortunately, the Congress took that proposal, which would  have meant cutting people off from those HIV medicines, and they decided to  maintain the foreign aid levels. </p><p>WALLACE: Your wife Melinda recently talked about -- and I want to quote her  directly -- how incredibly disappointing it is to see U.S. leadership  deteriorating and the view of the U.S. deteriorating because of some of the  egregious things that have been said by this current administration. What's  she talking about? </p><p>GATES: I hope I know. The -- I think the particular episode there was  talking about Africa and the conditions in Africa in a -- not in a positive  way. Sort of characterizing the entire continent. But, in any case --</p><p>WALLACE: Your talk about the blank countries? </p><p>GATES: Exactly. In the U.S. engagement in Africa and around the world,  there are many reasons we should maintain that. Just a pure security point  of view alone would justify this level of expenditure. </p><p>Now, for many people, the humanitarian part of it is also there and that  part is dramatic. And so it is disappointing when it feels like the U.S. is  being short-term and the U.S. is only thinking about its interest in a very  narrow way and not being the leader that says, now, we -- you know, we are  going to help these countries get so that they can -- can take care of  themselves. </p><p>WALLACE: The president's mantra is America first. You seem to be suggesting  that in terms of America's interests you've got to look a long way beyond  America first. </p><p>GATES: Well, I think that the broad definition of our interests, including  investing in allies and not viewing every transaction as one that we have  to maximize our benefit, taking, you know, world institutions and have them  just focus on the United States. What we did, in terms of the post-World  War II institutions has been a fantastic thing. That included having a  common view of the future with our western allies. </p><p>If you really follow that line of thinking, the idea of helping Africa, of  working on an HIV vaccine to stop the AIDS crisis, you just wouldn't do it.  And -- and yet I feel, even in that narrow framework of, OK, I only care  about what -- how U.S. citizens do, even in that framework, these  institutions, these alliances, these investments in innovation are  overwhelmingly smart things to do. </p><p>WALLACE: Since the year 2000, a billion people have lifted themselves from  what you define as extreme poverty. And you say that the first wave was in  China and the second wave was in India. Before we get to places where the  wave hasn't hit yet, what happened in those places? </p><p>GATES: One of the first things you want to do in these countries is raise  agricultural productivity. All of the Asian miracles, even going back to  Taiwan and Japan, South Korea, involved more than tripling agricultural  output per person so you could free up that labor and move it into the  cities. And if you had the right infrastructure, educational investment,  then you've got a manufacturing sector of the economy and slowly but surely  you'd get a very large middle class. </p><p>WALLACE: You talk about the successes, the waves in China and India, and  then there's Africa. You say that by 2050, 86 percent -- 86 percent of the  extremely poor people in the world will live in Africa and, in fact, 40  percent will live in just two countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo  and Nigeria. </p><p>What's holding them back? </p><p>GATES: They're starting at very low levels of infrastructure, very low  level of property. And one of the things that drives those numbers you  mentioned is the very high population growth. And so they account for  double the portions of births you'd expect. By the end of the century, the  majority of births in the world will take place in Africa. </p><p>Africa has to demand our attention. That's where extreme poverty is still  tough. That's where stability is difficult to achieve. And, you know, we've  got to go after things like these neglected diseases, malaria. We've got to  help them with infrastructure. It's really, in terms of our humanity of  helping the poorest, Africa's where we'll be most tested. </p><p>WALLACE: How do you even begin to address these concentrations of misery? </p><p>GATES: Well, one of the great achievements in development history was what  was called the green revolution where new varieties of the cereal (ph)  crops, corn, which everyone else calls maize, rice and wheat. In a period  where people thought India would experience mass starvation because the  agricultural output went up, they were actually able to improve the  nutrition even when their population was growing. We need to do that same  thing for Africa. </p><p>WALLACE: It seems that climate change could be the accelerant to all of the  bad things in terms of agricultural productivity, global health,  instability, extreme poverty. Talk about that. </p><p>GATES: Yes. For a country like the U.S., that's northern, you know, climate  change will change things. We'll have more hot days, more forest fires. But  it's not a threat to our survival. </p><p>In Africa, where you are completely dependent on the rain coming, whereas  there been in the past about one out of 12 years you'll have a failed  harvest, the prediction is that we be closer to one out of four years  because of the higher temperature and the -- the -- unfortunately, with  climate change, you -- not only is it hotter, but the rain comes all at  once, or it doesn't come for long periods of time. So if you want to say,  where are you going to get millions of deaths because of climate change  between now and the end of the century, you don't look to the United  States. Yes, you'll have some forest fires and there will be some deaths.  But the -- the significant numbers are in these very, very poor countries  because of the subsistence farming. </p><p>WALLACE: What do you say to those who say it's not climate change, it's  weather, and that the -- the man -- the human component is questionable? </p><p>GATES: That's impressive if somebody can say that out loud. The --the  amount of --</p><p>WALLACE: Have you been -- have you been to Washington? </p><p>GATES: The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is a super measurable thing.  It's important not to over claim what we know because that undermines the  whole discussion., But the general warming and the mechanism of that  warming has to do with CO2 and methane emissions. That's -- that's really  not a question. </p><p>WALLACE: I want to talk to you about toilets. Since 2011, the Gates  Foundation has launched to reinvent the toilet challenge. Explain, one, why  that's so important, and, two, again, dealing with the specifics, what have  been some of your successes and failures along the way? </p><p>GATES: In many of these poor countries, the capital cost of building that  sewer, it's just never going to happen. And so the solution would be to,  instead of using that sewer, to have something in the toilet itself, which  is essentially the processing facility. We have ten different universities  whose designs we funded. So we put in several hundred million dollars. And  now we've gotten it to the point where we have a lot of commercial  companies who say, OK, that approach looks promising. </p><p>Now, the price of this toilet, that does the processing, is still ten times  more expensive. It's about, you know, $10,000 per toilet right now. We need  to get it into these tough parts, the slums of these African cities. We  need it to be more like a thousand dollars. </p><p>WALLACE: I want to ask about your -- your old job. There's something of a  backlash here in Washington against big tech. The growing feeling in  Washington is that big tech does not do enough to protect users' privacy  and that it shows political bias. Do you see merit in either of those  arguments? </p><p>GATES: I went through an episode in the late '90s where Microsoft was  subject to government investigation. </p><p>WALLACE: We remember. </p><p>GATES: And so in a way this is -- in a small way now it's less Microsoft  now, but it's broad. </p><p>Yes, the government should be talking to these companies about what they  do. There's nothing inappropriate. </p><p>I was naive. I didn't have an office in Washington, D.C. I thought that was  a good thing and I even bragged about it. I later came to regret that. </p><p>So these -- I'm sure these guys are learning better than I did that they  need to come back here and start a dialogue. And there will be new types of  regulations for these companies. </p><p>WALLACE: And you don't have a problem with that? I mean you think that's  appropriate?</p><p>GATES: Well, the notion that there will be privacy regulations, that makes  a lot of sense. The notion that this ability to identify anyone that were  going to think about how do businesses get to use that and how does the  government use that, it makes a lot of sense. </p><p>WALLACE: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are right now jockeying for which is  going to be the most highly valued company in the world in terms of market  capitalization. At the close of the market on Friday, Microsoft was number  one at over $800 billion, Apple, $799.5 billion. Does that give you any  pleasure? </p><p>GATES: You know, when I was starting Microsoft in my 20s, the idea that we  could create a company that was -- you know, would beat IBM, you know,  because they were the big monolith and, you know, we understood software  and they didn't. And we believed in these cute, small machines to empower  individuals and they believed in these big machines. It was kind of mythic  that we were going to beat IBM.</p><p>By the time Microsoft valuation passed IBM, which is now, you know, 15  years ago, it didn't feel like that big of a victory. And so you really --  it's really better to define yourself by an aspiration. You know, can  software improve education? Can software help, you know, medical care costs  in the U.S. just keep going up dramatically? Can software play a role  there?.</p><p>So, yes, I'm very proud of Microsoft and the vision that software and  technology would make a big thing. You know, it's led to the most valuable,  the five most valuable companies being these tech companies. So I do think  it's an vindication (ph) of the importance of technology, which now is  coming with a lot of responsibilities as well. </p><p>WALLACE: Bill, it's an honor to talk to you again. </p><p>GATES: Thank you. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: And if you want to learn more about the remarkable work Bill and  Melinda Gates are doing, you can find their link at foxnewssunday.com. </p><p>Up next, a final word. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel for the latest on  a potential end of year government shutdown. </p><p>And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Who in the president's inner circle is next to  fall?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Let me tell you, I never  directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did on his own.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> WALLACE:  What do we know about President Trump's involvement in hush money  payments of two women during the 2016 campaign?  And what does Michael  Cohen's cooperation mean for the special counsel investigation?  We'll ask  the president's lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Then -- </p><p> TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.   I will take the mantle.  I will be the one to shut it down.  I'm not going  to blame you for it.  </p><p> WALLACE:  The president deals with a divided Washington and a possible  government shutdown over his border wall.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  Perhaps he doesn't understand people  leave their paychecks.  </p><p> WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel if we're headed for compromise or  confrontation.  </p><p> Plus -- </p><p> BILL GATES, GATES FOUNDATSION:  The U.S.'s engagement in Africa and around  the world, there are many reasons we should maintain that.  </p><p> WALLACE:  We'll talk with Bill Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation  about what he feels is a shrinking U.S. role in dealing with global poverty  and public health.  </p><p> All right now on \"FOX News Sunday\".</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE:  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.  </p><p> We begin with breaking news.  A federal judge has ruled the entire  Affordable Care Act invalid.  Obamacare will remain in place pending appeal  and both President Trump and Democrats are calling for Congress to pass new  legislation.  We'll get to all that a little later.  </p><p> But first, the president is already dealing with a possible government  shutdown that's now just five days away.  Meanwhile, prosecutors are  producing more of the evidence that led former members of Mr. Trump's inner  circle to plead guilty, evidence that implicates the president.  </p><p> Let's get the latest from Kevin Corke live at the White House -- Kevin.  </p><p> KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, even for an administration  accustomed to seismic shifts in the news cycle, it was without a doubt a  tumultuous week.  But few headlines could prove as potentially damaging to  the Trump White House than those involving former members of the  president's inner circle.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CORKE:  Three of whom are facing time in prison for a variety of misdeeds,  but none involving so-called Russian collusion.  Former national security  adviser, General Michael Flynn, faces sentencing Tuesday for lying to  federal investigators.  The special counsel's office recommending he get no  jail time even as it has faced charges that the general was entrapped and  inappropriately questioned.  </p><p> Meanwhile, in his first televised interview since being sentenced to three  years behind bar, the president's former fixer, attorney Michael Cohen,  claimed he repeatedly lied for Mr. Trump over the years and he would set up  payments to women to help aid his 2016 campaign, a claim strongly denied by  the White House.  </p><p> TRUMP:  I will take the mantle of shutting down and I'm going to shut it  down for border security.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  But we believe you shouldn't shut it  down.</p><p> CORKE:  An Oval Office meeting with leading Democrats this week did little  to quell fears of a potential partial government shutdown over the  president's insistence that there would be funding for a border wall,  something Democrats say they won't pay for.  A work stoppage that could  come in a week in which backers of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare,  consider their next move in the wake of a federal judge's ruling that the  law is unconstitutional.  </p><p> TRUMP:  -- that the Supreme Court upholds, we'll be sitting down with the  Democrats and we will get great health care for our people.  Let's say  repeal and replace.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CORKE:  That ruling by District Court Judge Reed O'Connor, Chris, does not  impact Obamacare recipients in the short term, but it does set up a  potential high court battle and that is a debate White House officials  would love to have -- Chris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thanks.  </p><p> WALLACE:  And joining me now from New York, the president's lead lawyer,  Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p> Mayor, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\".  </p><p> RUDY GUILIANI, LEAD LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you  -- thank you, Chris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's start with Michael Cohen's allegation that President Trump  directed him to commit a criminal campaign finance violation.  Here first  was the president and then Mr. Cohen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I never directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did  on his own.  He's a lawyer.  A lawyer who represents a client is supposed  to do the right thing.  </p><p> MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  He directed me to make the  payments, he directed me to become involved in these matters.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  Question.  Did Mr. Trump direct Michael Cohen to pay off these  two women or not?  </p><p> GIULIANI:  No, the truth is actually what Cohen testified to under oath  before Congress and what he repeated numerous times on surreptitious tape  recordings that he made, which is that the president didn't know about this  until some time into it, he did find out about it and eventually reimburse  him.  But, you know, this is a hard thing to do, but lawyers do this all  the time.  </p><p> But, Chris, even if it were true, it's not a crime.  The payment -- the  payment of money in a situation like this has been covered in the Edwards  case.  Not only the acquittal and hung jury in the Edwards case, but the  fact that the FEC looked at those Edwards violations and determined they  weren't violations --   </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> WALLACE:  I promise we're going to get to that in a minute, but let's get  to the simple fact, question of whether the president directed Cohen --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- to make these --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- payments or not.  </p><p> Cohen says that the president is not to be believed.  Here he is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> COHEN:  The man doesn't tell the truth.  And it's sad that I should take  responsibility for his dirty deeds.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Wow.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor -- Mayor --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  That's some lawyer.  That is some lawyer.  He was the lawyer in  that situation.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> WALLACE:  But does the president tell the truth or not?   </p><p> GIULIANI:  The president is telling the truth, yes.  This man is lying.  </p><p> Now, is that a big surprise to you, that Michael Cohen is lying?  The man  got up in front of the judge and said I was a fiercely loyal to Donald  Trump.  Nonsense he was fiercely loyal to him, he taped him, lied to him,  revealed the tape and did something a lawyer I've never heard ever did --  tape record his own client.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But -- but, sir --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  He sat there with Chris Cuomo, told him he wasn't being taped,  showed him a drawer (ph), and he lied to him and taped him for two hours.   The man is a complete pathological liar that cannot be believed.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But, sir, let's -- let's turn to --   </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> GIULIANI:  And they'll never put him on a witness stand.  They will never - - Chris --   </p><p> WALLACE:  Yes, but let me ask you --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  -- they will never put him on a witness stand.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I understand.  But does the question -- the real question is the  credibility of the president, not the credibility of Michael Cohen --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  No, no --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let me just finish.  The president has changed his story  repeatedly about whether or not he knew about hush money.  Here is what he  said on Air Force One -- the president said on Air Force One this April,  eight months ago.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> REPORTER:  Mr. President, did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy  Daniels?</p><p> TRUMP:  No.  No.  What else?  </p><p> REPORTER:  Then why did Michael Cohen make those if there was no truth to  her allegations?  </p><p> TRUMP:  Well, you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.  Michael is my attorney and  you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.   </p><p> REPORTER:  Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?  </p><p> TRUMP:  No, I don't know.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  The president said he doesn't know anything about any payments,  but in one of those tapes that you're talking about where Cohen  surreptitiously taped the president -- this is back in September of 2016 --  here are the president and Cohen discussing a potential --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> WALLACE:  Let's listen to the tape first.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Sure, sure.  I remember it well.  </p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p> COHEN:  I'm all over that.  And I spoke to Allen about it.  When it comes  time for the financing, which will be --   </p><p> TRUMP:  Wait a sec, what financing?  </p><p> COHEN:  Well, I'll have to pay --  </p><p> TRUMP:  Pay with cash --  </p><p> COHEN:  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  </p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  So which is it?  Did the president know about the hush money  payments or not?  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Chris, there's an intervening event that you're not talking  about.  I know this really well because I got criticized for revealing this  when I first came into the case.  Nobody really understood why I was doing  it.  </p><p> When I first came into the case, we went through the whole case.  The  president saw some notes and documents, thought about it, and I went out  and said, no, there was an intervening conversation after the payments took  place and before the revelations you're talking about on Air Force One.</p><p> The president did talk to Cohen or to people in between and they arranged  to reimburse Cohen.  This was after the payment was made, after it was  over, after the campaign was over.</p><p> WALLACE:  But -- but there's --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  They're talking about a conversation, sir, in September of 2016  during the campaign.  The president is clearly aware that David Pecker, the  head of \"National Enquirer\" had paid off Karen McDougal and they're talking  about reimbursing McDougal --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Well, you know, that's --  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- or reimbursing Pecker for that payment.</p><p> GIULIANI:  But there's a -- there's a big difference here.  That was a -  that was a conversation he was asked, middle of the campaign, I was with  him back then in the middle of the campaign, he's working 18 hours a day.   I wasn't able to remember a lot of things that happened in September of  2016.  He was asked it one time.  </p><p> When he sat down with his lawyer and went through it in great detail and  saw things that could refresh his recollection, we immediately corrected  it.</p><p> Nobody pushed us, nobody found it, we found it.  And we corrected it and I  got criticized like crazy for doing it.</p><p> WALLACE:  So you're saying --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  By the time this came out, we all knew --  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- the fact -- I mean, the -- according both to Cohen and to  Pecker, the -- again, he's the head of -- or was the head of National  Enquirer, they say they were in a meeting with Donald Trump --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Chris, Chris, Chris --  </p><p> WALLACE:   -- in the summer of 2016 in which --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p> WALLACE:  -- they discussed the payment to Karen McDougal.</p><p> GIULIANI:  We're talking about something that doesn't matter.  I mean,  whether - whether it happened or didn't happen, it's not illegal.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  You're moving shells around on me.  Either it happened or it  didn't happen.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  But that's what lawyers do all the time.  You argue in the  alternative.  I'm telling it --  </p><p> WALLACE:  But I'm asking you for the truth, sir.</p><p> GIULIANI:  I'm telling you definitively -- well, I -- I want the truth too.   And the truth is, yes, the tape-recorded conversation did take place.  It  exonerates the president.  The president tells Cohen, do it by check.  </p><p> I'm sorry, I prosecuted thousands of crimes, never prosecuted one where  they wanted to hide something, they did it by check.  </p><p> Make sure we pay him back.  They paid him back.  That's what that  conversation's all about.  It exonerates him.</p><p> I'd play that conversation in front of any jury in America and I'd cross- examine Cohen in front of any jury in America.</p><p> WALLACE:  OK, here's what you're telling --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  But I -- but very important; Cohen did not plead guilty to  conspiracy to violate the campaign finance laws.  If they were going to use  him as a witness against anybody, you always make them plea guilty to a  conspiracy so you can fill the conspiracy in.  </p><p> He pled guilty to a singular crime of violating the campaign finance laws.   Not a conspiracy.</p><p> WALLACE:  Yes, but the statement is full of references to individual one  who is Donald Trump.  Here's what you told the --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p> WALLACE:  Here's what you told \"The Daily Beast\" this week.  I want to put  it up on the screen.  </p><p> Nobody got killed.  Nobody got robbed.  This was not a big crime.</p><p> Mayor, what's the threshold between a crime and a big crime?</p><p> GIULIANI:  My statement there was about the prosecutor's view of it, not  mine.  Mr. Swinger (ph) who wrote that, actually corrected that, to say  that that was taken out of context.  My point was, there was no crime.  </p><p> But even if you take the prosecutor's viewpoint, this prosecutor was  appointed -- both of them, right, looking at collusion, no collusion.   Looking at obstruction --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sir, this was the Southern  District of New York.  This is not -- has nothing to do with collusion --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  But now you're --  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- or obstruction of justice, there --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Now, you're - they're part of the Department of Justice -- he's  not being investigated --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I understand it's a separate prosecutor.  I'm sure -- I'm sure  when you were the --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes, this guy -- this guy is going back --  </p><p> WALLACE:  I'm sure - I'm sure when you were the U.S. attorney for the  Southern District --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  And this guy is going back --  </p><p> WALLACE:  You didn't take orders from somebody in Washington who had  nothing to do with the attorney general.  You were your own -- they used to  call it a sovereign district of New York, sir.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  The person -- the person in charge of this investigation, Chris,  is Rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.  He is  the boss of Mueller and he is the boss of the Southern District of New  York.  He's the one that determined, let's move it over here.  He put it  there in the Southern District of New York and keeps supervision of it.</p><p> WALLACE:  I know --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  So don't give me that.</p><p> WALLACE:  But they're not --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  But they're not -- they're not working for --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  There is one Justice Department --- yes they are.  They're  working for the same Rod -- Rod Rosenstein's going to make the decision,  not Mueller, about what to do with this case.</p><p> WALLACE:  Right, and not Mueller.</p><p> GIULIANI:  And this is a witch-hunt.  They are going back now -- they're  going back to 1982, 1983.  They're going through business records.  My  goodness, they went from collusion to obstruction, no evidence -- now  campaign finance, no violation of the law.  </p><p> No matter who's right about what they said, it's no violation of the law.   And now --  </p><p> WALLACE:  The president -- I -- I want to -- I want to move on.  You're --  you're very a effective lawyer, but I've got -- I've got to move on, sir.  </p><p> President Trump --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  You wanted the truth.  That's the truth.  The truth is it's not  a violation of the law.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I want -- I want the truth in a limited amount of time.  </p><p> President Trump talked this week about whether or not General Flynn lied to  the FBI.  Here he is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  They took a general that they said didn't lie, and they convinced  him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal.  And now, they're  recommending no time.  You know why?  Because they're embarrassed that  they've got caught.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Does the president believe Michael Flynn lied or not?</p><p> GIULIANI:  I don't know if Michael Flynn lied or not.  You got two  contradictory things.  You've got the FBI saying at the time that he wasn't  lying.  And then we have no explanation and the guy pleads guilty to lying.  </p><p> So, I -- I mean, I don't know what happened in between.  I do know they  treated Flynn in a way that came very close to --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I'm asking a simple -- I'm asking a simple question.  And the  reason I ask is I want to put up a tweet from the president a year ago, in  December of 2017, when he says this: I had to fire General Flynn because he  lied to the vice president and the FBI.  He has pled guilty to those lies.</p><p> The president a year ago seemed to know that Flynn has lied.  Now, he's not  so sure.</p><p> GIULIANI:  The president doesn't know that he lied.  The president -- the  president --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  But he -- he knows what you knew at the time.  The man pled  guilty to lying.  He did --  </p><p> WALLACE:  No, he knows -- he knows what -- he knows what Flynn said to his  vice president.</p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes, but that was a lie, but that's not a crime.</p><p> WALLACE:  Well, I understand but I didn't ask if it was a crime, I asked  whether it was a lie.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  Chris -- Chris, you're going all over the place and you're  really confusing people.  Look, first of all --  </p><p> WALLACE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> GIULIANI:  You are -- you are -- you are -- you are -- you are, really --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  I didn't ask if it was a crime.  I asked whether  it was a lie and he told the same lie to the FBI and to the vice president.   And you're quite right, lying to the vice president isn't a lie, it's not  very good -- but lying to the FBI --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  -- is a crime.</p><p> GIULIANI:  Right.  And the more important thing about what the president  knew or didn't know -- because this doesn't involve the president in terms  of him being involved in any kind of conspiracy or anything else -- it's  like if it's reported that one of my assistants when I was a U.S. attorney  lied to the court, how do I know if he did or he didn't?  He knows what he  reads.  The man pled guilty to lying --  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK.  I got -- I got one minute --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  -- so, yes.  He didn't know at the time -- I didn't know at the  time -- I didn't know at the time that the FBI had previously concluded he  was telling the truth.</p><p> WALLACE:  I got a --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  I didn't know he had been deprived of a lawyer.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor, you're confusing people.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GIULIANI:  I'm not confusing people.</p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask you --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  The man was railroaded.</p><p> WALLACE:  -- three last quick questions.</p><p> GIULIANI:  He was railroaded.</p><p> WALLACE:  There are -- there are reports now that the special counsel is  interested again in interviewing the president.  Has his office reached out  to you about sitting down for an in-person interview with the president?</p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes.  There are several unpaid parking tickets that night --  back in 1986, '87 that haven't been explained.  You know, we've got to --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Seriously?</p><p> GIULIANI:  Seriously, unpaid parking tickets --  </p><p> WALLACE:  No, no, no.</p><p> GIULIANI:  It was a movie theater.  He didn't pay the proper fee.</p><p> WALLACE:  Is the special counsel -- does he want to interview the  president?  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes, good luck.  Good luck.  After what they did to Flynn, the  way they trapped him into perjury and no sentence for him, 14 days for  Papadopoulos.  I did better on traffic violations than they did with  Papadopoulos.  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, when you say good luck, you're saying no way, no interview?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  They're a joke.  Over my dead body, but you know, I could be  dead.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Do they want to speak to the president?</p><p> GIULIANI:  I do have -- I do have other lawyer -- I am disgusted with the  tactics they have used in this case.  What they did to General Flynn should  result in discipline.  They're the ones who are violating the law.  </p><p> They're looking at a non-crime collusion, the other guys are looking at a  non-crime campaign violations, which are not violations.  And they are the  ones who are violating the law, the rules, the ethics and nobody wants to  look at them.  They destroyed Strzok and Page's texts, 19,000 texts.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  If he had destroyed 19,000 texts, they'd put him in jail.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Even though they can't because he's the president.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor Giuliani.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Thank you.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  I got a little --   </p><p> WALLACE:  No, listen, I love it and please come back.  To be continued.  </p><p> Thank you for your time.  Always good to talk to you, sir.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Thank you.  Thank you. </p><p> WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what a  judge's Obamacare ruling could mean for millions of Americans.  </p><p> Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump saying  he'd be proud to shut down the government over a border wall.  Just go to  Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  A big, big victory by a highly respected judge.  Highly, highly  respected in Texas and on the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we  will get great, great health care for our people.  We'll have to sit down  with the Democrats to do it but I'm sure they want to do it also.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  President Trump praising the ruling from the federal judge  striking down the entire Obamacare law.</p><p> And it's time now for our Sunday group.  Fox News senior political analyst  Brit Hume, columnist for \"The Hill\", Juan Williams, Julie Pace, Washington  bureau chief for \"The Associated Press\" and Marc Short, former director of  legislative affairs for President Trump.  </p><p> Well, Brit, the federal judge said Obamacare is invalid because Congress  has taken out the tax penalty as part of the individual mandate, which is  the way that it passed through the Supreme Court in the first place.  But  we should point out the law stays in effect pending appeal.  </p><p> What do you think of the ruling and how do you think this plays  politically?  </p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, remember, this is a  trial court judge.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Right.</p><p> HUME:  So, this is subject to appeal to appellate court and perhaps on the  Supreme Court.  I think it's an interesting legal argument whether because  of the invalidation of the zeroing out of the penalty was the whole law  therefore is invalid.  I think you can hear good, legal arguments on both  sides of that issue but I think we're nowhere near the last of this and  because the judge did not issue an injunction that shuts it down.  As you  point out, Obamacare will remain in place -- what's left of Obamacare  remains in place for the foreseeable future.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But how does it play politically, given the fact there are  certain parts of Obamacare that people didn't like, like the individual  mandate.  On the other hand, there are lot of parts of it that people did  like pre-existing conditions --  </p><p> HUME:  Right. </p><p> WALLACE:  And that's according to the judge's ruling would be out, too.   </p><p> HUME:  It would be out but it won't be out now and it won't be out soon, in  my judgment.  So, I think the political effect will depend on the actual  practical effect and there is no practical effect for the time being.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Juan, the president and Republicans ran in 2016 on  the idea of repeal and replace Obamacare, which they thought was a good  issue for them.  Democrats won in 2018 on the argument the Republicans want  to take away your pre-existing conditions.  </p><p> So, how do you think this is going to cut, particularly given the fact as  Brit Hume says, it's not going to have a practical effect, it's not going  to take effect for some months, maybe a year as it goes to the courts.  </p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think you can see  already this morning, Republicans are on their heels, not really saying  much about this while you have Nancy Pelosi and potentially incoming  speaker of the house saying Democrats will defend it.  Chris Murphy, the  senator from Connecticut, saying it's a five-alarm fire.  I think clearly  Democrats see themselves in a position where they are on the offensive with  the voters about this.  If you take away Obamacare, you know, after how  many -- 70 votes by Republicans to repeal it, didn't work even with the  Republican majority, Chris.</p><p> It's not only that you would do away with things like pre-existing  conditions, you would drive up premiums for everybody.  Our health care  system would be in chaos.  So, I think that what you get here is  Republicans right now including President Trump, who initially tweeted  great, great, are saying we need a bipartisan collaboration here to make  health care work.  </p><p> That's a different tone from Republicans and I think it's very telling  about who is politically at risk here.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Marc, you're wrinkling your brow.  </p><p> MARC SHORT, FORMER DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Well, I think, look, Republicans won in 2010 and 2014 and 2016 in large  part on a promise to repeal Obamacare and now somehow the media are saying  it's an albatross on Republicans.  It's been a political win for  Republicans.  </p><p> WALLACE:  If you look at the polls, Obamacare has become more popular.  </p><p> SHORT:  And you know why, Chris?  Because the last two years, from 2013 to  2017, premiums went up 105 percent across the country.  In the last year,  they've gone up 5 percent.  They used to be 50 percent of the counties in  the United States had one insurer, and that was it.  That's been fixed.   All counties now have more than one insurer.</p><p> Because this administration has provided more choice for people, they have  actually helped to stabilize the markets.  That doesn't mean forcing people  to buy a product they don't want is a good policy.  </p><p> JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:  But in terms of the fallout from this  ruling potentially, one thing you're definitely not hearing from the  Republicans after this judge's ruling is any interest in going back to the  drawing board and starting from scratch.  If -- ultimately, this move  through the court that Obamacare fully is repealed, you do not have a lot  of Republicans who want to spend 2019 deep in the weeds on health care.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Let me switch, I'll tell you what they're going to spend at the  end of 2018 on.  There is the real threat now of a partial government  shutdown that would start at midnight this Friday.  Here's how that played  out this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,  because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that  have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.  So I will take  the mantle.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  He is taking full responsibility for  the Trump shutdown.  Perhaps he doesn't understand people need their  paychecks.  Maybe that's not the life he leads.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the  president saying that he would be proud to shutdown the government, we got  this on Facebook from Linda Rector.  </p><p> Why is shutting down the government not something to be proud of if it  means protecting the country?  That's exactly what we elected the president  to do. </p><p> Marc, Juan, how do you answer Linda?  And two, as a person who until last  July used to deal with Congress for the White House, for President Trump,  what do you think is going to happen?  Will there be a shutdown?  Will they  kick it down the can into January?  </p><p> SHORT:  If there were a shutdown, it would be different the very previous  ones.  This government has already funded all the men and women serving in  uniform.  It has funded all the entitlement checks.  It will keep the parts  of (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> So, the average American wouldn't even recognize the shutdown other than  the fact that it would be a media story, Chris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Wait, there's about 30 percent of the government that gets shut  down and I think 30 to 40 percent of the employees.  </p><p> SHORT:  And every time there's been a shutdown, every employee has been  paid back in full.  So I think the average person is not going to feel it  in the immediate future.  </p><p> Having said that, I still think you're going to find a compromise that  comes together before the end of the week.  I think the president has got  to look to find ways to fund this out of military construction dollars.   They'll create a separate problem later, because Democrats object to that.  </p><p> But last year, we secured the first new funding, $1.6 billion for the wall  in ten years.  Democrats come on your show and say we oppose any funding  for the wall.  They've already agreed to it.  It's already 1.6 in this  year.  </p><p> All we're not arguing about is not what they are, it's how much it costs,  and it's a matter of whether they can notified (ph) being at 1.6. </p><p> WALLACE:  That's an old joke.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let's gather here, everybody.  </p><p> So, Julie, shutdown or not?  </p><p> PACE:  I think all signs point to, as Marc says, some kind of compromise.   I think we'll have a tense couple of days.  This is normally how the  pattern of these shutdowns play out, but both Republicans and Democrats  that I talked on Capitol Hill last week have very little interest in a  shutdown.  They have very little interest in staying in Washington for  Christmas which is ultimately what this comes down to a lot of times.  </p><p> I do think that the president might be itching for a shutdown.  But I  ultimately think he will sign on if there is some kind of compromise that  gets some amount of wall funding and he can punt towards the military to  see if that's another option for building the wall.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask about another issue, which is the  president on Friday afternoon named a acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney,  and it's already come out that during the 2016 campaign, during a debate  right after the \"Access Hollywood\" came out, a debate with his Democratic  candidate, this is before he joined the Trump administration as OMB  director, he said this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MICK MULVANEY, ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF:  Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump,  doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact I think he's a  terrible human being.  But the choice on the other side is just as bad.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Well --  </p><p> PACE:  Here we are.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Do you think that creates problems for Mulvaney?  </p><p> PACE:  I think Mulvaney has been really strategic over the last couple of  years.  He has found a way to work with the president.  He's been very  loyal to the president since he's taken his job as OMB director.  So much  so that Trump keeps trying to give him other jobs in addition to chief of  staff.  </p><p> I do think that it's interesting that Mulvaney is leaving himself an out by  taking on the acting chief of staff role and keeping his job as OMB  director, if this doesn't work out for either side, he's got a fallback  option within the administration.  But Mulvaney kind of falls into a  category like a Lindsey Graham, who was also critical of the president  during the campaign, even after he became the nominee but has found a way  to work with him in office.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Brit, after Nick Ayers turned the president down, the vice  president's chief of staff, and then Chris Christie turned the president  down, he almost had to name somebody, didn't he?  This was getting a little  embarrassing.  </p><p> HUME:  He was like the guy who couldn't get a date for the prom and he  finally got Mulvaney, who was already on board to join in.  But Mulvaney is  a good choice.  He's a very able guy, seasoned and experience, knows the  issues, knows the policies, knows the government.  So -- </p><p> WALLACE:  I'll say something else, he is a happy warrior.  He's a guy who - - he's a positive guy.  He is also a guy who might come on Sunday talk  shows, which John Kelly treated us like the plague.  </p><p> HUME:  He wasn't interested.  </p><p> I would add this.  There's some talk that Trump doesn't need to chief of  staff, he should be his own, that is really nonsense because Trump needs  help from people who really know this town, know its ways, know the  details, know the issues, and he has been at important time, willing to  accept advice from those people to his benefit.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right, panel, we have to take a break here.  But stay right  here.  </p><p> When we come back, as new evidence implicates the president, what are the  chances Democrats will move pursuing impeachment?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Coming up, the president sounds off on the  Mueller investigation, as his former fixer is sentenced to prison. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nobody, except for me, would  be looked at like this. Nobody. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: We'll get our Sunday panel's read on how serious the president's  legal troubles really are, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What he did was all unrelated  to me except for the two campaign finance charges that are not criminal and  shouldn't have been on there. They put that on to embarrass me. They put  those two charges on to embarrass me. </p><p> MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I told the truth. I took  responsibility for my actions. And instead of him taking responsibility for  his actions, what does he do? He attacks my family. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: President Trump and his former fixer, Michael Cohen, taking shots  at each other after Cohen received a three-year prison sentence for a  number of crimes, including making hush money payments during the 2016  campaign.</p><p> And we're back now with the panel. </p><p> Julie, there are reports, and we hear these from time to time, the  president is more and more consumed by the special counsel investigation,  especially as former allies like Michael Cohen and the publisher of \"The  National Enquirer\" are providing evidence against him. </p><p> What do you hear your sources? </p><p> JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": So I think it is indisputable that the  president is consumed by these investigations. You really don't need any  secret sources on this. You just need to look at his -- at his Twitter  feed. He is following the twists and turns of this extremely closely. And  as people who are close to him get caught up in this, he gets more  agitated. And I think now we are seeing that almost every aspect of his  life, over the last several years, is now under some level of  investigation. His administration, his campaign, the inauguration, and his  businesses. </p><p> And the business piece of this is, I think, the one that is getting to the  president the most because, yes, being president is part of his identity,  but actually being this successful businessman is almost more important to  him in some ways. It's how he has defined himself for decades. And it's his  children's legacy. They are at the top of this -- at this business. And any  sign that his business could crumble, that past business dealings could be  swept up in this investigation, is incredibly personal to him. </p><p> WALLACE: Marc.</p><p> MARC SHORT, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR: I agree  100 percent with Julie. I think that what's unfortunate here is that you  have what begins as a special prosecutor focus on collusion in Russia. And  as Julie just said, it's about every part of his life. We end up saying,  instead of investigating a crime, we're investigating a person. And  Republicans and civil libertarians used to oppose that motion after Iran  Contra. Then they fell in love with it during the Whitewater years because  they said it was a land deal but it became something about an affair with  an intern. </p><p> And it's a problem. It's a problem where we have prosecutors going all  over. And I think -- </p><p> WALLACE: But how about -- how about the argument that is made, gee, we  didn't hear Republicans complain about it when it happened to Bill Clinton? </p><p> SHORT: I agree 100 percent. I'm saying -- I'm saying Republicans as well  have been hypocritical on this. There used to be a group of strong, civil  libertarians who would recognize the problem of special prosecutors. And --  probably this is now the -- what's been born of that fruit. </p><p> WALLACE: All right, so far the only alleged crime that the president is  specifically linked to is not collusion, is not obstruction of justice, it  involves campaign finance violations, alleged campaign finance violations. </p><p> Here is how Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler, the incoming chair of the  House Judiciary Committee, responded to that this week. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JERRY NADLER (D-NY), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, RANKING MEMBER: Well, they  would be impeachable offenses. Whether they are important enough to justify  an impeachment is a different question. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Brit, how persuaded are you that if President Trump directed these  payments, these hush money payments, as Michael Cohen says he did, that it  was a campaign finance violation on his part, a criminal violation? And,  two, what do you think of the likelihood that the House and the wisdom of  the House proceeding to impeachment on campaign finance violation? </p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it's a little hard to  imagine a president being impeached for a campaign finance violation. Most  of these violations are handled as civil matters and result in fines. And  they are, you know, widespread, rampant. Obama had a -- the Obama campaign  had to pay a big fine.</p><p> I don't -- I just don't think the House of Representatives, even such  ardent Democrats as Jerry Nadler, will go there. The greater worry is that  some other charge comes out when Mueller finally gets his ore in with his  report and says whatever he says. And that, I think, Chris, raises an  intriguing question, which is this, how far will these House investigations  go if Mueller doesn't find something very serious about the president? My  thought is, it probably takes the wind out of their sails, but we'll have  to wait and see. But, on balance, I don't think campaign finance is going  to dislodge him. </p><p> WALLACE: When you look at all of this and, you know, as we say, there is  still no hard evidence of collusion, no hard evidence of obstruction of  justice, but the wall do seem to be moving in on the president on a lot of  fronts. </p><p> HUME: Well, I don't think the Mueller report is likely to be -- to sing the  president's praises. But that's not what he needs. What he needs is kind of  an -- of a -- of a report that says, you know does not outline some major  crime. And if that happens, I mean I think it changes the atmosphere  dramatically, both legally and politically, because I think it's -- and if  he is vindicated on no collusion, which is what he's been saying, I don't  think the -- I've never thought that collusion was the central point of  this investigation. </p><p> Remember, when it started, Chris, it was a counterintelligence  investigation with the FBI acting as an intelligence agency to determine  what Russia actually did. And if you go back and look at the letter  authorizing Mueller's appointment, it says -- it mentions that it picks up  that investigation and then says, he's also authorized to find out if there  was collaboration between the two. That was always a subset of the overall  investigation. And if it turns out to be a subset with no crime alleged in  the final report, I think it's a huge boost for the president. </p><p> WALLACE: Juan.</p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the Democratic  base is so inflamed by Trump, by his behavior overall, I think they -- they  would think that Democrats weren't, in fact, holding up to their  constitutional responsivities if they did not consider impeachment. So you  get the --</p><p> WALLACE: Even on campaign finance violations? </p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, what we -- what did we learn this week? He wants to  say it's just Michael Cohen making these outrageous claims because Cohen  wants a better deal from the prosecutors. But, in fat, we hear from David  Packer at \"National Enquirer,\" same thing happened. We hear from \"The Wall  Street Journal,\" the president was in the room. So if -- potentially he  would be an unindicted coconspirator while his president because nobody  thinks you can indict the president. But that doesn't mean that you can't  go to the Congress and say, let's look at this and see -- </p><p> WALLACE: Do you really think that would be wise for Democrats to do? And  this -- this is speculative.</p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, that's a separate issue. That's a separate issue. </p><p> WALLACE: OK. Well, that's my question, though.</p><p> WILLIAMS: OK. Well, if the question was --</p><p> WALLACE: Would it be wise for them to do it if that's all that there is? </p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think that's -- no. And I think that what you're  going to see, and you already see this from, by the way, Jerry Nadler, but  also from Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, as the say, they're not interested  right now. But the base of the party, is what I was trying to say to you,  Chris, is going to be putting pressure there because they think that, in  fact, Democrats had been too docile in dealing with Trump and they want --  they want them to come and have the --</p><p> WALLACE: They want blood?</p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, because, guess what, you've saw a blue wave, 40 seats  switch hands, and the number -- you know, health care was clearly  important. But also a check on Trump was very important to voters. </p><p> WALLACE: And every indication is -- everybody keeps saying this  investigation is going to be over the end of the year. </p><p> WILLIAMS: I don't see it. </p><p> WALLACE: I always say, pick the over, right? </p><p> PACE: Right. We -- we don't know what else Mueller has. I think this could  go well into next year and really line up with some of these congressional  investigation. </p><p> WALLACE: Thank you, panel. </p><p> Up next we sit down with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, head of the Gates  Foundation. In the era of America first, he worries about a shrinking U.S.  role in dealing with global poverty and public health.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest  private charitable fund, giving $46 billion in grants since its founding in  2000 and literally saving millions of lives. The Microsoft co-founder came  to Washington this week to make the case for American leadership and the  need for foreign aid in the era of America first. When we sat down at the  Chamber of Commerce, that's where we began. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER AND PHILANTHROPIST: There was a  recommendation by the executive branch to make fairly substantial cuts U.S.  aid budget. And, fortunately, the Congress took that proposal, which would  have meant cutting people off from those HIV medicines, and they decided to  maintain the foreign aid levels. </p><p> WALLACE: Your wife Melinda recently talked about -- and I want to quote her  directly -- how incredibly disappointing it is to see U.S. leadership  deteriorating and the view of the U.S. deteriorating because of some of the  egregious things that have been said by this current administration. What's  she talking about? </p><p> GATES: I hope I know. The -- I think the particular episode there was  talking about Africa and the conditions in Africa in a -- not in a positive  way. Sort of characterizing the entire continent. But, in any case --</p><p> WALLACE: Your talk about the blank countries? </p><p> GATES: Exactly. In the U.S. engagement in Africa and around the world,  there are many reasons we should maintain that. Just a pure security point  of view alone would justify this level of expenditure. </p><p> Now, for many people, the humanitarian part of it is also there and that  part is dramatic. And so it is disappointing when it feels like the U.S. is  being short-term and the U.S. is only thinking about its interest in a very  narrow way and not being the leader that says, now, we -- you know, we are  going to help these countries get so that they can -- can take care of  themselves. </p><p> WALLACE: The president's mantra is America first. You seem to be suggesting  that in terms of America's interests you've got to look a long way beyond  America first. </p><p> GATES: Well, I think that the broad definition of our interests, including  investing in allies and not viewing every transaction as one that we have  to maximize our benefit, taking, you know, world institutions and have them  just focus on the United States. What we did, in terms of the post-World  War II institutions has been a fantastic thing. That included having a  common view of the future with our western allies. </p><p> If you really follow that line of thinking, the idea of helping Africa, of  working on an HIV vaccine to stop the AIDS crisis, you just wouldn't do it.  And -- and yet I feel, even in that narrow framework of, OK, I only care  about what -- how U.S. citizens do, even in that framework, these  institutions, these alliances, these investments in innovation are  overwhelmingly smart things to do. </p><p> WALLACE: Since the year 2000, a billion people have lifted themselves from  what you define as extreme poverty. And you say that the first wave was in  China and the second wave was in India. Before we get to places where the  wave hasn't hit yet, what happened in those places? </p><p> GATES: One of the first things you want to do in these countries is raise  agricultural productivity. All of the Asian miracles, even going back to  Taiwan and Japan, South Korea, involved more than tripling agricultural  output per person so you could free up that labor and move it into the  cities. And if you had the right infrastructure, educational investment,  then you've got a manufacturing sector of the economy and slowly but surely  you'd get a very large middle class. </p><p> WALLACE: You talk about the successes, the waves in China and India, and  then there's Africa. You say that by 2050, 86 percent -- 86 percent of the  extremely poor people in the world will live in Africa and, in fact, 40  percent will live in just two countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo  and Nigeria. </p><p> What's holding them back? </p><p> GATES: They're starting at very low levels of infrastructure, very low  level of property. And one of the things that drives those numbers you  mentioned is the very high population growth. And so they account for  double the portions of births you'd expect. By the end of the century, the  majority of births in the world will take place in Africa. </p><p> Africa has to demand our attention. That's where extreme poverty is still  tough. That's where stability is difficult to achieve. And, you know, we've  got to go after things like these neglected diseases, malaria. We've got to  help them with infrastructure. It's really, in terms of our humanity of  helping the poorest, Africa's where we'll be most tested. </p><p> WALLACE: How do you even begin to address these concentrations of misery? </p><p> GATES: Well, one of the great achievements in development history was what  was called the green revolution where new varieties of the cereal (ph)  crops, corn, which everyone else calls maize, rice and wheat. In a period  where people thought India would experience mass starvation because the  agricultural output went up, they were actually able to improve the  nutrition even when their population was growing. We need to do that same  thing for Africa. </p><p> WALLACE: It seems that climate change could be the accelerant to all of the  bad things in terms of agricultural productivity, global health,  instability, extreme poverty. Talk about that. </p><p> GATES: Yes. For a country like the U.S., that's northern, you know, climate  change will change things. We'll have more hot days, more forest fires. But  it's not a threat to our survival. </p><p> In Africa, where you are completely dependent on the rain coming, whereas  there been in the past about one out of 12 years you'll have a failed  harvest, the prediction is that we be closer to one out of four years  because of the higher temperature and the -- the -- unfortunately, with  climate change, you -- not only is it hotter, but the rain comes all at  once, or it doesn't come for long periods of time. So if you want to say,  where are you going to get millions of deaths because of climate change  between now and the end of the century, you don't look to the United  States. Yes, you'll have some forest fires and there will be some deaths.  But the -- the significant numbers are in these very, very poor countries  because of the subsistence farming. </p><p> WALLACE: What do you say to those who say it's not climate change, it's  weather, and that the -- the man -- the human component is questionable? </p><p> GATES: That's impressive if somebody can say that out loud. The --the  amount of --</p><p> WALLACE: Have you been -- have you been to Washington? </p><p> GATES: The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is a super measurable thing.  It's important not to over claim what we know because that undermines the  whole discussion., But the general warming and the mechanism of that  warming has to do with CO2 and methane emissions. That's -- that's really  not a question. </p><p> WALLACE: I want to talk to you about toilets. Since 2011, the Gates  Foundation has launched to reinvent the toilet challenge. Explain, one, why  that's so important, and, two, again, dealing with the specifics, what have  been some of your successes and failures along the way? </p><p> GATES: In many of these poor countries, the capital cost of building that  sewer, it's just never going to happen. And so the solution would be to,  instead of using that sewer, to have something in the toilet itself, which  is essentially the processing facility. We have ten different universities  whose designs we funded. So we put in several hundred million dollars. And  now we've gotten it to the point where we have a lot of commercial  companies who say, OK, that approach looks promising. </p><p> Now, the price of this toilet, that does the processing, is still ten times  more expensive. It's about, you know, $10,000 per toilet right now. We need  to get it into these tough parts, the slums of these African cities. We  need it to be more like a thousand dollars. </p><p> WALLACE: I want to ask about your -- your old job. There's something of a  backlash here in Washington against big tech. The growing feeling in  Washington is that big tech does not do enough to protect users' privacy  and that it shows political bias. Do you see merit in either of those  arguments? </p><p> GATES: I went through an episode in the late '90s where Microsoft was  subject to government investigation. </p><p> WALLACE: We remember. </p><p> GATES: And so in a way this is -- in a small way now it's less Microsoft  now, but it's broad. </p><p> Yes, the government should be talking to these companies about what they  do. There's nothing inappropriate. </p><p> I was naive. I didn't have an office in Washington, D.C. I thought that was  a good thing and I even bragged about it. I later came to regret that. </p><p> So these -- I'm sure these guys are learning better than I did that they  need to come back here and start a dialogue. And there will be new types of  regulations for these companies. </p><p> WALLACE: And you don't have a problem with that? I mean you think that's  appropriate?</p><p> GATES: Well, the notion that there will be privacy regulations, that makes  a lot of sense. The notion that this ability to identify anyone that were  going to think about how do businesses get to use that and how does the  government use that, it makes a lot of sense. </p><p> WALLACE: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are right now jockeying for which is  going to be the most highly valued company in the world in terms of market  capitalization. At the close of the market on Friday, Microsoft was number  one at over $800 billion, Apple, $799.5 billion. Does that give you any  pleasure? </p><p> GATES: You know, when I was starting Microsoft in my 20s, the idea that we  could create a company that was -- you know, would beat IBM, you know,  because they were the big monolith and, you know, we understood software  and they didn't. And we believed in these cute, small machines to empower  individuals and they believed in these big machines. It was kind of mythic  that we were going to beat IBM.</p><p> By the time Microsoft valuation passed IBM, which is now, you know, 15  years ago, it didn't feel like that big of a victory. And so you really --  it's really better to define yourself by an aspiration. You know, can  software improve education? Can software help, you know, medical care costs  in the U.S. just keep going up dramatically? Can software play a role  there?.</p><p> So, yes, I'm very proud of Microsoft and the vision that software and  technology would make a big thing. You know, it's led to the most valuable,  the five most valuable companies being these tech companies. So I do think  it's an vindication (ph) of the importance of technology, which now is  coming with a lot of responsibilities as well. </p><p> WALLACE: Bill, it's an honor to talk to you again. </p><p> GATES: Thank you. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE: And if you want to learn more about the remarkable work Bill and  Melinda Gates are doing, you can find their link at foxnewssunday.com. </p><p> Up next, a final word. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: Stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel for the latest on  a potential end of year government shutdown. </p><p> And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Who in the president's inner circle is next to  fall?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Let me tell you, I never  directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did on his own.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> WALLACE:  What do we know about President Trump's involvement in hush money  payments of two women during the 2016 campaign?  And what does Michael  Cohen's cooperation mean for the special counsel investigation?  We'll ask  the president's lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Then -- </p><p> TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.   I will take the mantle.  I will be the one to shut it down.  I'm not going  to blame you for it.  </p><p> WALLACE:  The president deals with a divided Washington and a possible  government shutdown over his border wall.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  Perhaps he doesn't understand people  leave their paychecks.  </p><p> WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel if we're headed for compromise or  confrontation.  </p><p> Plus -- </p><p> BILL GATES, GATES FOUNDATSION:  The U.S.'s engagement in Africa and around  the world, there are many reasons we should maintain that.  </p><p> WALLACE:  We'll talk with Bill Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation  about what he feels is a shrinking U.S. role in dealing with global poverty  and public health.  </p><p> All right now on \"FOX News Sunday\".</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE:  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.  </p><p> We begin with breaking news.  A federal judge has ruled the entire  Affordable Care Act invalid.  Obamacare will remain in place pending appeal  and both President Trump and Democrats are calling for Congress to pass new  legislation.  We'll get to all that a little later.  </p><p> But first, the president is already dealing with a possible government  shutdown that's now just five days away.  Meanwhile, prosecutors are  producing more of the evidence that led former members of Mr. Trump's inner  circle to plead guilty, evidence that implicates the president.  </p><p> Let's get the latest from Kevin Corke live at the White House -- Kevin.  </p><p> KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, even for an administration  accustomed to seismic shifts in the news cycle, it was without a doubt a  tumultuous week.  But few headlines could prove as potentially damaging to  the Trump White House than those involving former members of the  president's inner circle.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CORKE:  Three of whom are facing time in prison for a variety of misdeeds,  but none involving so-called Russian collusion.  Former national security  adviser, General Michael Flynn, faces sentencing Tuesday for lying to  federal investigators.  The special counsel's office recommending he get no  jail time even as it has faced charges that the general was entrapped and  inappropriately questioned.  </p><p> Meanwhile, in his first televised interview since being sentenced to three  years behind bar, the president's former fixer, attorney Michael Cohen,  claimed he repeatedly lied for Mr. Trump over the years and he would set up  payments to women to help aid his 2016 campaign, a claim strongly denied by  the White House.  </p><p> TRUMP:  I will take the mantle of shutting down and I'm going to shut it  down for border security.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  But we believe you shouldn't shut it  down.</p><p> CORKE:  An Oval Office meeting with leading Democrats this week did little  to quell fears of a potential partial government shutdown over the  president's insistence that there would be funding for a border wall,  something Democrats say they won't pay for.  A work stoppage that could  come in a week in which backers of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare,  consider their next move in the wake of a federal judge's ruling that the  law is unconstitutional.  </p><p> TRUMP:  -- that the Supreme Court upholds, we'll be sitting down with the  Democrats and we will get great health care for our people.  Let's say  repeal and replace.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CORKE:  That ruling by District Court Judge Reed O'Connor, Chris, does not  impact Obamacare recipients in the short term, but it does set up a  potential high court battle and that is a debate White House officials  would love to have -- Chris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thanks.  </p><p> WALLACE:  And joining me now from New York, the president's lead lawyer,  Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p> Mayor, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\".  </p><p> RUDY GUILIANI, LEAD LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you  -- thank you, Chris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's start with Michael Cohen's allegation that President Trump  directed him to commit a criminal campaign finance violation.  Here first  was the president and then Mr. Cohen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I never directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did  on his own.  He's a lawyer.  A lawyer who represents a client is supposed  to do the right thing.  </p><p> MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  He directed me to make the  payments, he directed me to become involved in these matters.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  Question.  Did Mr. Trump direct Michael Cohen to pay off these  two women or not?  </p><p> GIULIANI:  No, the truth is actually what Cohen testified to under oath  before Congress and what he repeated numerous times on surreptitious tape  recordings that he made, which is that the president didn't know about this  until some time into it, he did find out about it and eventually reimburse  him.  But, you know, this is a hard thing to do, but lawyers do this all  the time.  </p><p> But, Chris, even if it were true, it's not a crime.  The payment -- the  payment of money in a situation like this has been covered in the Edwards  case.  Not only the acquittal and hung jury in the Edwards case, but the  fact that the FEC looked at those Edwards violations and determined they  weren't violations --   </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> WALLACE:  I promise we're going to get to that in a minute, but let's get  to the simple fact, question of whether the president directed Cohen --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- to make these --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- payments or not.  </p><p> Cohen says that the president is not to be believed.  Here he is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> COHEN:  The man doesn't tell the truth.  And it's sad that I should take  responsibility for his dirty deeds.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Wow.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor -- Mayor --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  That's some lawyer.  That is some lawyer.  He was the lawyer in  that situation.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> WALLACE:  But does the president tell the truth or not?   </p><p> GIULIANI:  The president is telling the truth, yes.  This man is lying.  </p><p> Now, is that a big surprise to you, that Michael Cohen is lying?  The man  got up in front of the judge and said I was a fiercely loyal to Donald  Trump.  Nonsense he was fiercely loyal to him, he taped him, lied to him,  revealed the tape and did something a lawyer I've never heard ever did --  tape record his own client.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But -- but, sir --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  He sat there with Chris Cuomo, told him he wasn't being taped,  showed him a drawer (ph), and he lied to him and taped him for two hours.   The man is a complete pathological liar that cannot be believed.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But, sir, let's -- let's turn to --   </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> GIULIANI:  And they'll never put him on a witness stand.  They will never - - Chris --   </p><p> WALLACE:  Yes, but let me ask you --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  -- they will never put him on a witness stand.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I understand.  But does the question -- the real question is the  credibility of the president, not the credibility of Michael Cohen --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  No, no --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let me just finish.  The president has changed his story  repeatedly about whether or not he knew about hush money.  Here is what he  said on Air Force One -- the president said on Air Force One this April,  eight months ago.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> REPORTER:  Mr. President, did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy  Daniels?</p><p> TRUMP:  No.  No.  What else?  </p><p> REPORTER:  Then why did Michael Cohen make those if there was no truth to  her allegations?  </p><p> TRUMP:  Well, you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.  Michael is my attorney and  you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.   </p><p> REPORTER:  Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?  </p><p> TRUMP:  No, I don't know.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  The president said he doesn't know anything about any payments,  but in one of those tapes that you're talking about where Cohen  surreptitiously taped the president -- this is back in September of 2016 --  here are the president and Cohen discussing a potential --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> WALLACE:  Let's listen to the tape first.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Sure, sure.  I remember it well.  </p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p> COHEN:  I'm all over that.  And I spoke to Allen about it.  When it comes  time for the financing, which will be --   </p><p> TRUMP:  Wait a sec, what financing?  </p><p> COHEN:  Well, I'll have to pay --  </p><p> TRUMP:  Pay with cash --  </p><p> COHEN:  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  </p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  So which is it?  Did the president know about the hush money  payments or not?  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Chris, there's an intervening event that you're not talking  about.  I know this really well because I got criticized for revealing this  when I first came into the case.  Nobody really understood why I was doing  it.  </p><p> When I first came into the case, we went through the whole case.  The  president saw some notes and documents, thought about it, and I went out  and said, no, there was an intervening conversation after the payments took  place and before the revelations you're talking about on Air Force One.</p><p> The president did talk to Cohen or to people in between and they arranged  to reimburse Cohen.  This was after the payment was made, after it was  over, after the campaign was over.</p><p> WALLACE:  But -- but there's --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  They're talking about a conversation, sir, in September of 2016  during the campaign.  The president is clearly aware that David Pecker, the  head of \"National Enquirer\" had paid off Karen McDougal and they're talking  about reimbursing McDougal --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Well, you know, that's --  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- or reimbursing Pecker for that payment.</p><p> GIULIANI:  But there's a -- there's a big difference here.  That was a -  that was a conversation he was asked, middle of the campaign, I was with  him back then in the middle of the campaign, he's working 18 hours a day.   I wasn't able to remember a lot of things that happened in September of  2016.  He was asked it one time.  </p><p> When he sat down with his lawyer and went through it in great detail and  saw things that could refresh his recollection, we immediately corrected  it.</p><p> Nobody pushed us, nobody found it, we found it.  And we corrected it and I  got criticized like crazy for doing it.</p><p> WALLACE:  So you're saying --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  By the time this came out, we all knew --  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- the fact -- I mean, the -- according both to Cohen and to  Pecker, the -- again, he's the head of -- or was the head of National  Enquirer, they say they were in a meeting with Donald Trump --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Chris, Chris, Chris --  </p><p> WALLACE:   -- in the summer of 2016 in which --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p> WALLACE:  -- they discussed the payment to Karen McDougal.</p><p> GIULIANI:  We're talking about something that doesn't matter.  I mean,  whether - whether it happened or didn't happen, it's not illegal.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  You're moving shells around on me.  Either it happened or it  didn't happen.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  But that's what lawyers do all the time.  You argue in the  alternative.  I'm telling it --  </p><p> WALLACE:  But I'm asking you for the truth, sir.</p><p> GIULIANI:  I'm telling you definitively -- well, I -- I want the truth too.   And the truth is, yes, the tape-recorded conversation did take place.  It  exonerates the president.  The president tells Cohen, do it by check.  </p><p> I'm sorry, I prosecuted thousands of crimes, never prosecuted one where  they wanted to hide something, they did it by check.  </p><p> Make sure we pay him back.  They paid him back.  That's what that  conversation's all about.  It exonerates him.</p><p> I'd play that conversation in front of any jury in America and I'd cross- examine Cohen in front of any jury in America.</p><p> WALLACE:  OK, here's what you're telling --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  But I -- but very important; Cohen did not plead guilty to  conspiracy to violate the campaign finance laws.  If they were going to use  him as a witness against anybody, you always make them plea guilty to a  conspiracy so you can fill the conspiracy in.  </p><p> He pled guilty to a singular crime of violating the campaign finance laws.   Not a conspiracy.</p><p> WALLACE:  Yes, but the statement is full of references to individual one  who is Donald Trump.  Here's what you told the --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p> WALLACE:  Here's what you told \"The Daily Beast\" this week.  I want to put  it up on the screen.  </p><p> Nobody got killed.  Nobody got robbed.  This was not a big crime.</p><p> Mayor, what's the threshold between a crime and a big crime?</p><p> GIULIANI:  My statement there was about the prosecutor's view of it, not  mine.  Mr. Swinger (ph) who wrote that, actually corrected that, to say  that that was taken out of context.  My point was, there was no crime.  </p><p> But even if you take the prosecutor's viewpoint, this prosecutor was  appointed -- both of them, right, looking at collusion, no collusion.   Looking at obstruction --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sir, this was the Southern  District of New York.  This is not -- has nothing to do with collusion --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  But now you're --  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- or obstruction of justice, there --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Now, you're - they're part of the Department of Justice -- he's  not being investigated --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I understand it's a separate prosecutor.  I'm sure -- I'm sure  when you were the --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes, this guy -- this guy is going back --  </p><p> WALLACE:  I'm sure - I'm sure when you were the U.S. attorney for the  Southern District --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  And this guy is going back --  </p><p> WALLACE:  You didn't take orders from somebody in Washington who had  nothing to do with the attorney general.  You were your own -- they used to  call it a sovereign district of New York, sir.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  The person -- the person in charge of this investigation, Chris,  is Rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.  He is  the boss of Mueller and he is the boss of the Southern District of New  York.  He's the one that determined, let's move it over here.  He put it  there in the Southern District of New York and keeps supervision of it.</p><p> WALLACE:  I know --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  So don't give me that.</p><p> WALLACE:  But they're not --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  But they're not -- they're not working for --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  There is one Justice Department --- yes they are.  They're  working for the same Rod -- Rod Rosenstein's going to make the decision,  not Mueller, about what to do with this case.</p><p> WALLACE:  Right, and not Mueller.</p><p> GIULIANI:  And this is a witch-hunt.  They are going back now -- they're  going back to 1982, 1983.  They're going through business records.  My  goodness, they went from collusion to obstruction, no evidence -- now  campaign finance, no violation of the law.  </p><p> No matter who's right about what they said, it's no violation of the law.   And now --  </p><p> WALLACE:  The president -- I -- I want to -- I want to move on.  You're --  you're very a effective lawyer, but I've got -- I've got to move on, sir.  </p><p> President Trump --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  You wanted the truth.  That's the truth.  The truth is it's not  a violation of the law.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I want -- I want the truth in a limited amount of time.  </p><p> President Trump talked this week about whether or not General Flynn lied to  the FBI.  Here he is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  They took a general that they said didn't lie, and they convinced  him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal.  And now, they're  recommending no time.  You know why?  Because they're embarrassed that  they've got caught.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Does the president believe Michael Flynn lied or not?</p><p> GIULIANI:  I don't know if Michael Flynn lied or not.  You got two  contradictory things.  You've got the FBI saying at the time that he wasn't  lying.  And then we have no explanation and the guy pleads guilty to lying.  </p><p> So, I -- I mean, I don't know what happened in between.  I do know they  treated Flynn in a way that came very close to --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I'm asking a simple -- I'm asking a simple question.  And the  reason I ask is I want to put up a tweet from the president a year ago, in  December of 2017, when he says this: I had to fire General Flynn because he  lied to the vice president and the FBI.  He has pled guilty to those lies.</p><p> The president a year ago seemed to know that Flynn has lied.  Now, he's not  so sure.</p><p> GIULIANI:  The president doesn't know that he lied.  The president -- the  president --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  But he -- he knows what you knew at the time.  The man pled  guilty to lying.  He did --  </p><p> WALLACE:  No, he knows -- he knows what -- he knows what Flynn said to his  vice president.</p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes, but that was a lie, but that's not a crime.</p><p> WALLACE:  Well, I understand but I didn't ask if it was a crime, I asked  whether it was a lie.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  Chris -- Chris, you're going all over the place and you're  really confusing people.  Look, first of all --  </p><p> WALLACE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> GIULIANI:  You are -- you are -- you are -- you are -- you are, really --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  I didn't ask if it was a crime.  I asked whether  it was a lie and he told the same lie to the FBI and to the vice president.   And you're quite right, lying to the vice president isn't a lie, it's not  very good -- but lying to the FBI --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  -- is a crime.</p><p> GIULIANI:  Right.  And the more important thing about what the president  knew or didn't know -- because this doesn't involve the president in terms  of him being involved in any kind of conspiracy or anything else -- it's  like if it's reported that one of my assistants when I was a U.S. attorney  lied to the court, how do I know if he did or he didn't?  He knows what he  reads.  The man pled guilty to lying --  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK.  I got -- I got one minute --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  -- so, yes.  He didn't know at the time -- I didn't know at the  time -- I didn't know at the time that the FBI had previously concluded he  was telling the truth.</p><p> WALLACE:  I got a --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  I didn't know he had been deprived of a lawyer.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor, you're confusing people.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GIULIANI:  I'm not confusing people.</p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask you --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  The man was railroaded.</p><p> WALLACE:  -- three last quick questions.</p><p> GIULIANI:  He was railroaded.</p><p> WALLACE:  There are -- there are reports now that the special counsel is  interested again in interviewing the president.  Has his office reached out  to you about sitting down for an in-person interview with the president?</p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes.  There are several unpaid parking tickets that night --  back in 1986, '87 that haven't been explained.  You know, we've got to --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Seriously?</p><p> GIULIANI:  Seriously, unpaid parking tickets --  </p><p> WALLACE:  No, no, no.</p><p> GIULIANI:  It was a movie theater.  He didn't pay the proper fee.</p><p> WALLACE:  Is the special counsel -- does he want to interview the  president?  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes, good luck.  Good luck.  After what they did to Flynn, the  way they trapped him into perjury and no sentence for him, 14 days for  Papadopoulos.  I did better on traffic violations than they did with  Papadopoulos.  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, when you say good luck, you're saying no way, no interview?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  They're a joke.  Over my dead body, but you know, I could be  dead.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Do they want to speak to the president?</p><p> GIULIANI:  I do have -- I do have other lawyer -- I am disgusted with the  tactics they have used in this case.  What they did to General Flynn should  result in discipline.  They're the ones who are violating the law.  </p><p> They're looking at a non-crime collusion, the other guys are looking at a  non-crime campaign violations, which are not violations.  And they are the  ones who are violating the law, the rules, the ethics and nobody wants to  look at them.  They destroyed Strzok and Page's texts, 19,000 texts.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  If he had destroyed 19,000 texts, they'd put him in jail.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Even though they can't because he's the president.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor Giuliani.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Thank you.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  I got a little --   </p><p> WALLACE:  No, listen, I love it and please come back.  To be continued.  </p><p> Thank you for your time.  Always good to talk to you, sir.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Thank you.  Thank you. </p><p> WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what a  judge's Obamacare ruling could mean for millions of Americans.  </p><p> Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump saying  he'd be proud to shut down the government over a border wall.  Just go to  Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  A big, big victory by a highly respected judge.  Highly, highly  respected in Texas and on the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we  will get great, great health care for our people.  We'll have to sit down  with the Democrats to do it but I'm sure they want to do it also.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  President Trump praising the ruling from the federal judge  striking down the entire Obamacare law.</p><p> And it's time now for our Sunday group.  Fox News senior political analyst  Brit Hume, columnist for \"The Hill\", Juan Williams, Julie Pace, Washington  bureau chief for \"The Associated Press\" and Marc Short, former director of  legislative affairs for President Trump.  </p><p> Well, Brit, the federal judge said Obamacare is invalid because Congress  has taken out the tax penalty as part of the individual mandate, which is  the way that it passed through the Supreme Court in the first place.  But  we should point out the law stays in effect pending appeal.  </p><p> What do you think of the ruling and how do you think this plays  politically?  </p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, remember, this is a  trial court judge.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Right.</p><p> HUME:  So, this is subject to appeal to appellate court and perhaps on the  Supreme Court.  I think it's an interesting legal argument whether because  of the invalidation of the zeroing out of the penalty was the whole law  therefore is invalid.  I think you can hear good, legal arguments on both  sides of that issue but I think we're nowhere near the last of this and  because the judge did not issue an injunction that shuts it down.  As you  point out, Obamacare will remain in place -- what's left of Obamacare  remains in place for the foreseeable future.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But how does it play politically, given the fact there are  certain parts of Obamacare that people didn't like, like the individual  mandate.  On the other hand, there are lot of parts of it that people did  like pre-existing conditions --  </p><p> HUME:  Right. </p><p> WALLACE:  And that's according to the judge's ruling would be out, too.   </p><p> HUME:  It would be out but it won't be out now and it won't be out soon, in  my judgment.  So, I think the political effect will depend on the actual  practical effect and there is no practical effect for the time being.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Juan, the president and Republicans ran in 2016 on  the idea of repeal and replace Obamacare, which they thought was a good  issue for them.  Democrats won in 2018 on the argument the Republicans want  to take away your pre-existing conditions.  </p><p> So, how do you think this is going to cut, particularly given the fact as  Brit Hume says, it's not going to have a practical effect, it's not going  to take effect for some months, maybe a year as it goes to the courts.  </p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think you can see  already this morning, Republicans are on their heels, not really saying  much about this while you have Nancy Pelosi and potentially incoming  speaker of the house saying Democrats will defend it.  Chris Murphy, the  senator from Connecticut, saying it's a five-alarm fire.  I think clearly  Democrats see themselves in a position where they are on the offensive with  the voters about this.  If you take away Obamacare, you know, after how  many -- 70 votes by Republicans to repeal it, didn't work even with the  Republican majority, Chris.</p><p> It's not only that you would do away with things like pre-existing  conditions, you would drive up premiums for everybody.  Our health care  system would be in chaos.  So, I think that what you get here is  Republicans right now including President Trump, who initially tweeted  great, great, are saying we need a bipartisan collaboration here to make  health care work.  </p><p> That's a different tone from Republicans and I think it's very telling  about who is politically at risk here.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Marc, you're wrinkling your brow.  </p><p> MARC SHORT, FORMER DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Well, I think, look, Republicans won in 2010 and 2014 and 2016 in large  part on a promise to repeal Obamacare and now somehow the media are saying  it's an albatross on Republicans.  It's been a political win for  Republicans.  </p><p> WALLACE:  If you look at the polls, Obamacare has become more popular.  </p><p> SHORT:  And you know why, Chris?  Because the last two years, from 2013 to  2017, premiums went up 105 percent across the country.  In the last year,  they've gone up 5 percent.  They used to be 50 percent of the counties in  the United States had one insurer, and that was it.  That's been fixed.   All counties now have more than one insurer.</p><p> Because this administration has provided more choice for people, they have  actually helped to stabilize the markets.  That doesn't mean forcing people  to buy a product they don't want is a good policy.  </p><p> JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:  But in terms of the fallout from this  ruling potentially, one thing you're definitely not hearing from the  Republicans after this judge's ruling is any interest in going back to the  drawing board and starting from scratch.  If -- ultimately, this move  through the court that Obamacare fully is repealed, you do not have a lot  of Republicans who want to spend 2019 deep in the weeds on health care.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Let me switch, I'll tell you what they're going to spend at the  end of 2018 on.  There is the real threat now of a partial government  shutdown that would start at midnight this Friday.  Here's how that played  out this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,  because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that  have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.  So I will take  the mantle.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  He is taking full responsibility for  the Trump shutdown.  Perhaps he doesn't understand people need their  paychecks.  Maybe that's not the life he leads.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the  president saying that he would be proud to shutdown the government, we got  this on Facebook from Linda Rector.  </p><p> Why is shutting down the government not something to be proud of if it  means protecting the country?  That's exactly what we elected the president  to do. </p><p> Marc, Juan, how do you answer Linda?  And two, as a person who until last  July used to deal with Congress for the White House, for President Trump,  what do you think is going to happen?  Will there be a shutdown?  Will they  kick it down the can into January?  </p><p> SHORT:  If there were a shutdown, it would be different the very previous  ones.  This government has already funded all the men and women serving in  uniform.  It has funded all the entitlement checks.  It will keep the parts  of (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> So, the average American wouldn't even recognize the shutdown other than  the fact that it would be a media story, Chris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Wait, there's about 30 percent of the government that gets shut  down and I think 30 to 40 percent of the employees.  </p><p> SHORT:  And every time there's been a shutdown, every employee has been  paid back in full.  So I think the average person is not going to feel it  in the immediate future.  </p><p> Having said that, I still think you're going to find a compromise that  comes together before the end of the week.  I think the president has got  to look to find ways to fund this out of military construction dollars.   They'll create a separate problem later, because Democrats object to that.  </p><p> But last year, we secured the first new funding, $1.6 billion for the wall  in ten years.  Democrats come on your show and say we oppose any funding  for the wall.  They've already agreed to it.  It's already 1.6 in this  year.  </p><p> All we're not arguing about is not what they are, it's how much it costs,  and it's a matter of whether they can notified (ph) being at 1.6. </p><p> WALLACE:  That's an old joke.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let's gather here, everybody.  </p><p> So, Julie, shutdown or not?  </p><p> PACE:  I think all signs point to, as Marc says, some kind of compromise.   I think we'll have a tense couple of days.  This is normally how the  pattern of these shutdowns play out, but both Republicans and Democrats  that I talked on Capitol Hill last week have very little interest in a  shutdown.  They have very little interest in staying in Washington for  Christmas which is ultimately what this comes down to a lot of times.  </p><p> I do think that the president might be itching for a shutdown.  But I  ultimately think he will sign on if there is some kind of compromise that  gets some amount of wall funding and he can punt towards the military to  see if that's another option for building the wall.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask about another issue, which is the  president on Friday afternoon named a acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney,  and it's already come out that during the 2016 campaign, during a debate  right after the \"Access Hollywood\" came out, a debate with his Democratic  candidate, this is before he joined the Trump administration as OMB  director, he said this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MICK MULVANEY, ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF:  Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump,  doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact I think he's a  terrible human being.  But the choice on the other side is just as bad.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Well --  </p><p> PACE:  Here we are.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Do you think that creates problems for Mulvaney?  </p><p> PACE:  I think Mulvaney has been really strategic over the last couple of  years.  He has found a way to work with the president.  He's been very  loyal to the president since he's taken his job as OMB director.  So much  so that Trump keeps trying to give him other jobs in addition to chief of  staff.  </p><p> I do think that it's interesting that Mulvaney is leaving himself an out by  taking on the acting chief of staff role and keeping his job as OMB  director, if this doesn't work out for either side, he's got a fallback  option within the administration.  But Mulvaney kind of falls into a  category like a Lindsey Graham, who was also critical of the president  during the campaign, even after he became the nominee but has found a way  to work with him in office.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Brit, after Nick Ayers turned the president down, the vice  president's chief of staff, and then Chris Christie turned the president  down, he almost had to name somebody, didn't he?  This was getting a little  embarrassing.  </p><p> HUME:  He was like the guy who couldn't get a date for the prom and he  finally got Mulvaney, who was already on board to join in.  But Mulvaney is  a good choice.  He's a very able guy, seasoned and experience, knows the  issues, knows the policies, knows the government.  So -- </p><p> WALLACE:  I'll say something else, he is a happy warrior.  He's a guy who - - he's a positive guy.  He is also a guy who might come on Sunday talk  shows, which John Kelly treated us like the plague.  </p><p> HUME:  He wasn't interested.  </p><p> I would add this.  There's some talk that Trump doesn't need to chief of  staff, he should be his own, that is really nonsense because Trump needs  help from people who really know this town, know its ways, know the  details, know the issues, and he has been at important time, willing to  accept advice from those people to his benefit.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right, panel, we have to take a break here.  But stay right  here.  </p><p> When we come back, as new evidence implicates the president, what are the  chances Democrats will move pursuing impeachment?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Coming up, the president sounds off on the  Mueller investigation, as his former fixer is sentenced to prison. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nobody, except for me, would  be looked at like this. Nobody. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: We'll get our Sunday panel's read on how serious the president's  legal troubles really are, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What he did was all unrelated  to me except for the two campaign finance charges that are not criminal and  shouldn't have been on there. They put that on to embarrass me. They put  those two charges on to embarrass me. </p><p> MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I told the truth. I took  responsibility for my actions. And instead of him taking responsibility for  his actions, what does he do? He attacks my family. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: President Trump and his former fixer, Michael Cohen, taking shots  at each other after Cohen received a three-year prison sentence for a  number of crimes, including making hush money payments during the 2016  campaign.</p><p> And we're back now with the panel. </p><p> Julie, there are reports, and we hear these from time to time, the  president is more and more consumed by the special counsel investigation,  especially as former allies like Michael Cohen and the publisher of \"The  National Enquirer\" are providing evidence against him. </p><p> What do you hear your sources? </p><p> JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": So I think it is indisputable that the  president is consumed by these investigations. You really don't need any  secret sources on this. You just need to look at his -- at his Twitter  feed. He is following the twists and turns of this extremely closely. And  as people who are close to him get caught up in this, he gets more  agitated. And I think now we are seeing that almost every aspect of his  life, over the last several years, is now under some level of  investigation. His administration, his campaign, the inauguration, and his  businesses. </p><p> And the business piece of this is, I think, the one that is getting to the  president the most because, yes, being president is part of his identity,  but actually being this successful businessman is almost more important to  him in some ways. It's how he has defined himself for decades. And it's his  children's legacy. They are at the top of this -- at this business. And any  sign that his business could crumble, that past business dealings could be  swept up in this investigation, is incredibly personal to him. </p><p> WALLACE: Marc.</p><p> MARC SHORT, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR: I agree  100 percent with Julie. I think that what's unfortunate here is that you  have what begins as a special prosecutor focus on collusion in Russia. And  as Julie just said, it's about every part of his life. We end up saying,  instead of investigating a crime, we're investigating a person. And  Republicans and civil libertarians used to oppose that motion after Iran  Contra. Then they fell in love with it during the Whitewater years because  they said it was a land deal but it became something about an affair with  an intern. </p><p> And it's a problem. It's a problem where we have prosecutors going all  over. And I think -- </p><p> WALLACE: But how about -- how about the argument that is made, gee, we  didn't hear Republicans complain about it when it happened to Bill Clinton? </p><p> SHORT: I agree 100 percent. I'm saying -- I'm saying Republicans as well  have been hypocritical on this. There used to be a group of strong, civil  libertarians who would recognize the problem of special prosecutors. And --  probably this is now the -- what's been born of that fruit. </p><p> WALLACE: All right, so far the only alleged crime that the president is  specifically linked to is not collusion, is not obstruction of justice, it  involves campaign finance violations, alleged campaign finance violations. </p><p> Here is how Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler, the incoming chair of the  House Judiciary Committee, responded to that this week. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JERRY NADLER (D-NY), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, RANKING MEMBER: Well, they  would be impeachable offenses. Whether they are important enough to justify  an impeachment is a different question. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Brit, how persuaded are you that if President Trump directed these  payments, these hush money payments, as Michael Cohen says he did, that it  was a campaign finance violation on his part, a criminal violation? And,  two, what do you think of the likelihood that the House and the wisdom of  the House proceeding to impeachment on campaign finance violation? </p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it's a little hard to  imagine a president being impeached for a campaign finance violation. Most  of these violations are handled as civil matters and result in fines. And  they are, you know, widespread, rampant. Obama had a -- the Obama campaign  had to pay a big fine.</p><p> I don't -- I just don't think the House of Representatives, even such  ardent Democrats as Jerry Nadler, will go there. The greater worry is that  some other charge comes out when Mueller finally gets his ore in with his  report and says whatever he says. And that, I think, Chris, raises an  intriguing question, which is this, how far will these House investigations  go if Mueller doesn't find something very serious about the president? My  thought is, it probably takes the wind out of their sails, but we'll have  to wait and see. But, on balance, I don't think campaign finance is going  to dislodge him. </p><p> WALLACE: When you look at all of this and, you know, as we say, there is  still no hard evidence of collusion, no hard evidence of obstruction of  justice, but the wall do seem to be moving in on the president on a lot of  fronts. </p><p> HUME: Well, I don't think the Mueller report is likely to be -- to sing the  president's praises. But that's not what he needs. What he needs is kind of  an -- of a -- of a report that says, you know does not outline some major  crime. And if that happens, I mean I think it changes the atmosphere  dramatically, both legally and politically, because I think it's -- and if  he is vindicated on no collusion, which is what he's been saying, I don't  think the -- I've never thought that collusion was the central point of  this investigation. </p><p> Remember, when it started, Chris, it was a counterintelligence  investigation with the FBI acting as an intelligence agency to determine  what Russia actually did. And if you go back and look at the letter  authorizing Mueller's appointment, it says -- it mentions that it picks up  that investigation and then says, he's also authorized to find out if there  was collaboration between the two. That was always a subset of the overall  investigation. And if it turns out to be a subset with no crime alleged in  the final report, I think it's a huge boost for the president. </p><p> WALLACE: Juan.</p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the Democratic  base is so inflamed by Trump, by his behavior overall, I think they -- they  would think that Democrats weren't, in fact, holding up to their  constitutional responsivities if they did not consider impeachment. So you  get the --</p><p> WALLACE: Even on campaign finance violations? </p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, what we -- what did we learn this week? He wants to  say it's just Michael Cohen making these outrageous claims because Cohen  wants a better deal from the prosecutors. But, in fat, we hear from David  Packer at \"National Enquirer,\" same thing happened. We hear from \"The Wall  Street Journal,\" the president was in the room. So if -- potentially he  would be an unindicted coconspirator while his president because nobody  thinks you can indict the president. But that doesn't mean that you can't  go to the Congress and say, let's look at this and see -- </p><p> WALLACE: Do you really think that would be wise for Democrats to do? And  this -- this is speculative.</p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, that's a separate issue. That's a separate issue. </p><p> WALLACE: OK. Well, that's my question, though.</p><p> WILLIAMS: OK. Well, if the question was --</p><p> WALLACE: Would it be wise for them to do it if that's all that there is? </p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think that's -- no. And I think that what you're  going to see, and you already see this from, by the way, Jerry Nadler, but  also from Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, as the say, they're not interested  right now. But the base of the party, is what I was trying to say to you,  Chris, is going to be putting pressure there because they think that, in  fact, Democrats had been too docile in dealing with Trump and they want --  they want them to come and have the --</p><p> WALLACE: They want blood?</p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, because, guess what, you've saw a blue wave, 40 seats  switch hands, and the number -- you know, health care was clearly  important. But also a check on Trump was very important to voters. </p><p> WALLACE: And every indication is -- everybody keeps saying this  investigation is going to be over the end of the year. </p><p> WILLIAMS: I don't see it. </p><p> WALLACE: I always say, pick the over, right? </p><p> PACE: Right. We -- we don't know what else Mueller has. I think this could  go well into next year and really line up with some of these congressional  investigation. </p><p> WALLACE: Thank you, panel. </p><p> Up next we sit down with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, head of the Gates  Foundation. In the era of America first, he worries about a shrinking U.S.  role in dealing with global poverty and public health.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest  private charitable fund, giving $46 billion in grants since its founding in  2000 and literally saving millions of lives. The Microsoft co-founder came  to Washington this week to make the case for American leadership and the  need for foreign aid in the era of America first. When we sat down at the  Chamber of Commerce, that's where we began. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER AND PHILANTHROPIST: There was a  recommendation by the executive branch to make fairly substantial cuts U.S.  aid budget. And, fortunately, the Congress took that proposal, which would  have meant cutting people off from those HIV medicines, and they decided to  maintain the foreign aid levels. </p><p> WALLACE: Your wife Melinda recently talked about -- and I want to quote her  directly -- how incredibly disappointing it is to see U.S. leadership  deteriorating and the view of the U.S. deteriorating because of some of the  egregious things that have been said by this current administration. What's  she talking about? </p><p> GATES: I hope I know. The -- I think the particular episode there was  talking about Africa and the conditions in Africa in a -- not in a positive  way. Sort of characterizing the entire continent. But, in any case --</p><p> WALLACE: Your talk about the blank countries? </p><p> GATES: Exactly. In the U.S. engagement in Africa and around the world,  there are many reasons we should maintain that. Just a pure security point  of view alone would justify this level of expenditure. </p><p> Now, for many people, the humanitarian part of it is also there and that  part is dramatic. And so it is disappointing when it feels like the U.S. is  being short-term and the U.S. is only thinking about its interest in a very  narrow way and not being the leader that says, now, we -- you know, we are  going to help these countries get so that they can -- can take care of  themselves. </p><p> WALLACE: The president's mantra is America first. You seem to be suggesting  that in terms of America's interests you've got to look a long way beyond  America first. </p><p> GATES: Well, I think that the broad definition of our interests, including  investing in allies and not viewing every transaction as one that we have  to maximize our benefit, taking, you know, world institutions and have them  just focus on the United States. What we did, in terms of the post-World  War II institutions has been a fantastic thing. That included having a  common view of the future with our western allies. </p><p> If you really follow that line of thinking, the idea of helping Africa, of  working on an HIV vaccine to stop the AIDS crisis, you just wouldn't do it.  And -- and yet I feel, even in that narrow framework of, OK, I only care  about what -- how U.S. citizens do, even in that framework, these  institutions, these alliances, these investments in innovation are  overwhelmingly smart things to do. </p><p> WALLACE: Since the year 2000, a billion people have lifted themselves from  what you define as extreme poverty. And you say that the first wave was in  China and the second wave was in India. Before we get to places where the  wave hasn't hit yet, what happened in those places? </p><p> GATES: One of the first things you want to do in these countries is raise  agricultural productivity. All of the Asian miracles, even going back to  Taiwan and Japan, South Korea, involved more than tripling agricultural  output per person so you could free up that labor and move it into the  cities. And if you had the right infrastructure, educational investment,  then you've got a manufacturing sector of the economy and slowly but surely  you'd get a very large middle class. </p><p> WALLACE: You talk about the successes, the waves in China and India, and  then there's Africa. You say that by 2050, 86 percent -- 86 percent of the  extremely poor people in the world will live in Africa and, in fact, 40  percent will live in just two countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo  and Nigeria. </p><p> What's holding them back? </p><p> GATES: They're starting at very low levels of infrastructure, very low  level of property. And one of the things that drives those numbers you  mentioned is the very high population growth. And so they account for  double the portions of births you'd expect. By the end of the century, the  majority of births in the world will take place in Africa. </p><p> Africa has to demand our attention. That's where extreme poverty is still  tough. That's where stability is difficult to achieve. And, you know, we've  got to go after things like these neglected diseases, malaria. We've got to  help them with infrastructure. It's really, in terms of our humanity of  helping the poorest, Africa's where we'll be most tested. </p><p> WALLACE: How do you even begin to address these concentrations of misery? </p><p> GATES: Well, one of the great achievements in development history was what  was called the green revolution where new varieties of the cereal (ph)  crops, corn, which everyone else calls maize, rice and wheat. In a period  where people thought India would experience mass starvation because the  agricultural output went up, they were actually able to improve the  nutrition even when their population was growing. We need to do that same  thing for Africa. </p><p> WALLACE: It seems that climate change could be the accelerant to all of the  bad things in terms of agricultural productivity, global health,  instability, extreme poverty. Talk about that. </p><p> GATES: Yes. For a country like the U.S., that's northern, you know, climate  change will change things. We'll have more hot days, more forest fires. But  it's not a threat to our survival. </p><p> In Africa, where you are completely dependent on the rain coming, whereas  there been in the past about one out of 12 years you'll have a failed  harvest, the prediction is that we be closer to one out of four years  because of the higher temperature and the -- the -- unfortunately, with  climate change, you -- not only is it hotter, but the rain comes all at  once, or it doesn't come for long periods of time. So if you want to say,  where are you going to get millions of deaths because of climate change  between now and the end of the century, you don't look to the United  States. Yes, you'll have some forest fires and there will be some deaths.  But the -- the significant numbers are in these very, very poor countries  because of the subsistence farming. </p><p> WALLACE: What do you say to those who say it's not climate change, it's  weather, and that the -- the man -- the human component is questionable? </p><p> GATES: That's impressive if somebody can say that out loud. The --the  amount of --</p><p> WALLACE: Have you been -- have you been to Washington? </p><p> GATES: The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is a super measurable thing.  It's important not to over claim what we know because that undermines the  whole discussion., But the general warming and the mechanism of that  warming has to do with CO2 and methane emissions. That's -- that's really  not a question. </p><p> WALLACE: I want to talk to you about toilets. Since 2011, the Gates  Foundation has launched to reinvent the toilet challenge. Explain, one, why  that's so important, and, two, again, dealing with the specifics, what have  been some of your successes and failures along the way? </p><p> GATES: In many of these poor countries, the capital cost of building that  sewer, it's just never going to happen. And so the solution would be to,  instead of using that sewer, to have something in the toilet itself, which  is essentially the processing facility. We have ten different universities  whose designs we funded. So we put in several hundred million dollars. And  now we've gotten it to the point where we have a lot of commercial  companies who say, OK, that approach looks promising. </p><p> Now, the price of this toilet, that does the processing, is still ten times  more expensive. It's about, you know, $10,000 per toilet right now. We need  to get it into these tough parts, the slums of these African cities. We  need it to be more like a thousand dollars. </p><p> WALLACE: I want to ask about your -- your old job. There's something of a  backlash here in Washington against big tech. The growing feeling in  Washington is that big tech does not do enough to protect users' privacy  and that it shows political bias. Do you see merit in either of those  arguments? </p><p> GATES: I went through an episode in the late '90s where Microsoft was  subject to government investigation. </p><p> WALLACE: We remember. </p><p> GATES: And so in a way this is -- in a small way now it's less Microsoft  now, but it's broad. </p><p> Yes, the government should be talking to these companies about what they  do. There's nothing inappropriate. </p><p> I was naive. I didn't have an office in Washington, D.C. I thought that was  a good thing and I even bragged about it. I later came to regret that. </p><p> So these -- I'm sure these guys are learning better than I did that they  need to come back here and start a dialogue. And there will be new types of  regulations for these companies. </p><p> WALLACE: And you don't have a problem with that? I mean you think that's  appropriate?</p><p> GATES: Well, the notion that there will be privacy regulations, that makes  a lot of sense. The notion that this ability to identify anyone that were  going to think about how do businesses get to use that and how does the  government use that, it makes a lot of sense. </p><p> WALLACE: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are right now jockeying for which is  going to be the most highly valued company in the world in terms of market  capitalization. At the close of the market on Friday, Microsoft was number  one at over $800 billion, Apple, $799.5 billion. Does that give you any  pleasure? </p><p> GATES: You know, when I was starting Microsoft in my 20s, the idea that we  could create a company that was -- you know, would beat IBM, you know,  because they were the big monolith and, you know, we understood software  and they didn't. And we believed in these cute, small machines to empower  individuals and they believed in these big machines. It was kind of mythic  that we were going to beat IBM.</p><p> By the time Microsoft valuation passed IBM, which is now, you know, 15  years ago, it didn't feel like that big of a victory. And so you really --  it's really better to define yourself by an aspiration. You know, can  software improve education? Can software help, you know, medical care costs  in the U.S. just keep going up dramatically? Can software play a role  there?.</p><p> So, yes, I'm very proud of Microsoft and the vision that software and  technology would make a big thing. You know, it's led to the most valuable,  the five most valuable companies being these tech companies. So I do think  it's an vindication (ph) of the importance of technology, which now is  coming with a lot of responsibilities as well. </p><p> WALLACE: Bill, it's an honor to talk to you again. </p><p> GATES: Thank you. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE: And if you want to learn more about the remarkable work Bill and  Melinda Gates are doing, you can find their link at foxnewssunday.com. </p><p> Up next, a final word. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: Stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel for the latest on  a potential end of year government shutdown. </p><p> And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Who in the president's inner circle is next to  fall?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Let me tell you, I never  directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did on his own.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> WALLACE:  What do we know about President Trump's involvement in hush money  payments of two women during the 2016 campaign?  And what does Michael  Cohen's cooperation mean for the special counsel investigation?  We'll ask  the president's lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Then -- </p><p> TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.   I will take the mantle.  I will be the one to shut it down.  I'm not going  to blame you for it.  </p><p> WALLACE:  The president deals with a divided Washington and a possible  government shutdown over his border wall.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  Perhaps he doesn't understand people  leave their paychecks.  </p><p> WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel if we're headed for compromise or  confrontation.  </p><p> Plus -- </p><p> BILL GATES, GATES FOUNDATSION:  The U.S.'s engagement in Africa and around  the world, there are many reasons we should maintain that.  </p><p> WALLACE:  We'll talk with Bill Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation  about what he feels is a shrinking U.S. role in dealing with global poverty  and public health.  </p><p> All right now on \"FOX News Sunday\".</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE:  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.  </p><p> We begin with breaking news.  A federal judge has ruled the entire  Affordable Care Act invalid.  Obamacare will remain in place pending appeal  and both President Trump and Democrats are calling for Congress to pass new  legislation.  We'll get to all that a little later.  </p><p> But first, the president is already dealing with a possible government  shutdown that's now just five days away.  Meanwhile, prosecutors are  producing more of the evidence that led former members of Mr. Trump's inner  circle to plead guilty, evidence that implicates the president.  </p><p> Let's get the latest from Kevin Corke live at the White House -- Kevin.  </p><p> KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, even for an administration  accustomed to seismic shifts in the news cycle, it was without a doubt a  tumultuous week.  But few headlines could prove as potentially damaging to  the Trump White House than those involving former members of the  president's inner circle.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CORKE:  Three of whom are facing time in prison for a variety of misdeeds,  but none involving so-called Russian collusion.  Former national security  adviser, General Michael Flynn, faces sentencing Tuesday for lying to  federal investigators.  The special counsel's office recommending he get no  jail time even as it has faced charges that the general was entrapped and  inappropriately questioned.  </p><p> Meanwhile, in his first televised interview since being sentenced to three  years behind bar, the president's former fixer, attorney Michael Cohen,  claimed he repeatedly lied for Mr. Trump over the years and he would set up  payments to women to help aid his 2016 campaign, a claim strongly denied by  the White House.  </p><p> TRUMP:  I will take the mantle of shutting down and I'm going to shut it  down for border security.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  But we believe you shouldn't shut it  down.</p><p> CORKE:  An Oval Office meeting with leading Democrats this week did little  to quell fears of a potential partial government shutdown over the  president's insistence that there would be funding for a border wall,  something Democrats say they won't pay for.  A work stoppage that could  come in a week in which backers of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare,  consider their next move in the wake of a federal judge's ruling that the  law is unconstitutional.  </p><p> TRUMP:  -- that the Supreme Court upholds, we'll be sitting down with the  Democrats and we will get great health care for our people.  Let's say  repeal and replace.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CORKE:  That ruling by District Court Judge Reed O'Connor, Chris, does not  impact Obamacare recipients in the short term, but it does set up a  potential high court battle and that is a debate White House officials  would love to have -- Chris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thanks.  </p><p> WALLACE:  And joining me now from New York, the president's lead lawyer,  Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p> Mayor, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\".  </p><p> RUDY GUILIANI, LEAD LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you  -- thank you, Chris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's start with Michael Cohen's allegation that President Trump  directed him to commit a criminal campaign finance violation.  Here first  was the president and then Mr. Cohen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I never directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did  on his own.  He's a lawyer.  A lawyer who represents a client is supposed  to do the right thing.  </p><p> MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  He directed me to make the  payments, he directed me to become involved in these matters.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  Question.  Did Mr. Trump direct Michael Cohen to pay off these  two women or not?  </p><p> GIULIANI:  No, the truth is actually what Cohen testified to under oath  before Congress and what he repeated numerous times on surreptitious tape  recordings that he made, which is that the president didn't know about this  until some time into it, he did find out about it and eventually reimburse  him.  But, you know, this is a hard thing to do, but lawyers do this all  the time.  </p><p> But, Chris, even if it were true, it's not a crime.  The payment -- the  payment of money in a situation like this has been covered in the Edwards  case.  Not only the acquittal and hung jury in the Edwards case, but the  fact that the FEC looked at those Edwards violations and determined they  weren't violations --   </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> WALLACE:  I promise we're going to get to that in a minute, but let's get  to the simple fact, question of whether the president directed Cohen --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- to make these --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- payments or not.  </p><p> Cohen says that the president is not to be believed.  Here he is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> COHEN:  The man doesn't tell the truth.  And it's sad that I should take  responsibility for his dirty deeds.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Wow.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor -- Mayor --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  That's some lawyer.  That is some lawyer.  He was the lawyer in  that situation.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> WALLACE:  But does the president tell the truth or not?   </p><p> GIULIANI:  The president is telling the truth, yes.  This man is lying.  </p><p> Now, is that a big surprise to you, that Michael Cohen is lying?  The man  got up in front of the judge and said I was a fiercely loyal to Donald  Trump.  Nonsense he was fiercely loyal to him, he taped him, lied to him,  revealed the tape and did something a lawyer I've never heard ever did --  tape record his own client.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But -- but, sir --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  He sat there with Chris Cuomo, told him he wasn't being taped,  showed him a drawer (ph), and he lied to him and taped him for two hours.   The man is a complete pathological liar that cannot be believed.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But, sir, let's -- let's turn to --   </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> GIULIANI:  And they'll never put him on a witness stand.  They will never - - Chris --   </p><p> WALLACE:  Yes, but let me ask you --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  -- they will never put him on a witness stand.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I understand.  But does the question -- the real question is the  credibility of the president, not the credibility of Michael Cohen --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  No, no --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let me just finish.  The president has changed his story  repeatedly about whether or not he knew about hush money.  Here is what he  said on Air Force One -- the president said on Air Force One this April,  eight months ago.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> REPORTER:  Mr. President, did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy  Daniels?</p><p> TRUMP:  No.  No.  What else?  </p><p> REPORTER:  Then why did Michael Cohen make those if there was no truth to  her allegations?  </p><p> TRUMP:  Well, you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.  Michael is my attorney and  you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.   </p><p> REPORTER:  Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?  </p><p> TRUMP:  No, I don't know.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  The president said he doesn't know anything about any payments,  but in one of those tapes that you're talking about where Cohen  surreptitiously taped the president -- this is back in September of 2016 --  here are the president and Cohen discussing a potential --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> WALLACE:  Let's listen to the tape first.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Sure, sure.  I remember it well.  </p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p> COHEN:  I'm all over that.  And I spoke to Allen about it.  When it comes  time for the financing, which will be --   </p><p> TRUMP:  Wait a sec, what financing?  </p><p> COHEN:  Well, I'll have to pay --  </p><p> TRUMP:  Pay with cash --  </p><p> COHEN:  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  </p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  So which is it?  Did the president know about the hush money  payments or not?  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Chris, there's an intervening event that you're not talking  about.  I know this really well because I got criticized for revealing this  when I first came into the case.  Nobody really understood why I was doing  it.  </p><p> When I first came into the case, we went through the whole case.  The  president saw some notes and documents, thought about it, and I went out  and said, no, there was an intervening conversation after the payments took  place and before the revelations you're talking about on Air Force One.</p><p> The president did talk to Cohen or to people in between and they arranged  to reimburse Cohen.  This was after the payment was made, after it was  over, after the campaign was over.</p><p> WALLACE:  But -- but there's --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  They're talking about a conversation, sir, in September of 2016  during the campaign.  The president is clearly aware that David Pecker, the  head of \"National Enquirer\" had paid off Karen McDougal and they're talking  about reimbursing McDougal --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Well, you know, that's --  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- or reimbursing Pecker for that payment.</p><p> GIULIANI:  But there's a -- there's a big difference here.  That was a -  that was a conversation he was asked, middle of the campaign, I was with  him back then in the middle of the campaign, he's working 18 hours a day.   I wasn't able to remember a lot of things that happened in September of  2016.  He was asked it one time.  </p><p> When he sat down with his lawyer and went through it in great detail and  saw things that could refresh his recollection, we immediately corrected  it.</p><p> Nobody pushed us, nobody found it, we found it.  And we corrected it and I  got criticized like crazy for doing it.</p><p> WALLACE:  So you're saying --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  By the time this came out, we all knew --  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- the fact -- I mean, the -- according both to Cohen and to  Pecker, the -- again, he's the head of -- or was the head of National  Enquirer, they say they were in a meeting with Donald Trump --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Chris, Chris, Chris --  </p><p> WALLACE:   -- in the summer of 2016 in which --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p> WALLACE:  -- they discussed the payment to Karen McDougal.</p><p> GIULIANI:  We're talking about something that doesn't matter.  I mean,  whether - whether it happened or didn't happen, it's not illegal.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  You're moving shells around on me.  Either it happened or it  didn't happen.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  But that's what lawyers do all the time.  You argue in the  alternative.  I'm telling it --  </p><p> WALLACE:  But I'm asking you for the truth, sir.</p><p> GIULIANI:  I'm telling you definitively -- well, I -- I want the truth too.   And the truth is, yes, the tape-recorded conversation did take place.  It  exonerates the president.  The president tells Cohen, do it by check.  </p><p> I'm sorry, I prosecuted thousands of crimes, never prosecuted one where  they wanted to hide something, they did it by check.  </p><p> Make sure we pay him back.  They paid him back.  That's what that  conversation's all about.  It exonerates him.</p><p> I'd play that conversation in front of any jury in America and I'd cross- examine Cohen in front of any jury in America.</p><p> WALLACE:  OK, here's what you're telling --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  But I -- but very important; Cohen did not plead guilty to  conspiracy to violate the campaign finance laws.  If they were going to use  him as a witness against anybody, you always make them plea guilty to a  conspiracy so you can fill the conspiracy in.  </p><p> He pled guilty to a singular crime of violating the campaign finance laws.   Not a conspiracy.</p><p> WALLACE:  Yes, but the statement is full of references to individual one  who is Donald Trump.  Here's what you told the --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p> WALLACE:  Here's what you told \"The Daily Beast\" this week.  I want to put  it up on the screen.  </p><p> Nobody got killed.  Nobody got robbed.  This was not a big crime.</p><p> Mayor, what's the threshold between a crime and a big crime?</p><p> GIULIANI:  My statement there was about the prosecutor's view of it, not  mine.  Mr. Swinger (ph) who wrote that, actually corrected that, to say  that that was taken out of context.  My point was, there was no crime.  </p><p> But even if you take the prosecutor's viewpoint, this prosecutor was  appointed -- both of them, right, looking at collusion, no collusion.   Looking at obstruction --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sir, this was the Southern  District of New York.  This is not -- has nothing to do with collusion --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  But now you're --  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- or obstruction of justice, there --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Now, you're - they're part of the Department of Justice -- he's  not being investigated --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I understand it's a separate prosecutor.  I'm sure -- I'm sure  when you were the --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes, this guy -- this guy is going back --  </p><p> WALLACE:  I'm sure - I'm sure when you were the U.S. attorney for the  Southern District --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  And this guy is going back --  </p><p> WALLACE:  You didn't take orders from somebody in Washington who had  nothing to do with the attorney general.  You were your own -- they used to  call it a sovereign district of New York, sir.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  The person -- the person in charge of this investigation, Chris,  is Rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.  He is  the boss of Mueller and he is the boss of the Southern District of New  York.  He's the one that determined, let's move it over here.  He put it  there in the Southern District of New York and keeps supervision of it.</p><p> WALLACE:  I know --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  So don't give me that.</p><p> WALLACE:  But they're not --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  But they're not -- they're not working for --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  There is one Justice Department --- yes they are.  They're  working for the same Rod -- Rod Rosenstein's going to make the decision,  not Mueller, about what to do with this case.</p><p> WALLACE:  Right, and not Mueller.</p><p> GIULIANI:  And this is a witch-hunt.  They are going back now -- they're  going back to 1982, 1983.  They're going through business records.  My  goodness, they went from collusion to obstruction, no evidence -- now  campaign finance, no violation of the law.  </p><p> No matter who's right about what they said, it's no violation of the law.   And now --  </p><p> WALLACE:  The president -- I -- I want to -- I want to move on.  You're --  you're very a effective lawyer, but I've got -- I've got to move on, sir.  </p><p> President Trump --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  You wanted the truth.  That's the truth.  The truth is it's not  a violation of the law.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I want -- I want the truth in a limited amount of time.  </p><p> President Trump talked this week about whether or not General Flynn lied to  the FBI.  Here he is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  They took a general that they said didn't lie, and they convinced  him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal.  And now, they're  recommending no time.  You know why?  Because they're embarrassed that  they've got caught.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Does the president believe Michael Flynn lied or not?</p><p> GIULIANI:  I don't know if Michael Flynn lied or not.  You got two  contradictory things.  You've got the FBI saying at the time that he wasn't  lying.  And then we have no explanation and the guy pleads guilty to lying.  </p><p> So, I -- I mean, I don't know what happened in between.  I do know they  treated Flynn in a way that came very close to --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I'm asking a simple -- I'm asking a simple question.  And the  reason I ask is I want to put up a tweet from the president a year ago, in  December of 2017, when he says this: I had to fire General Flynn because he  lied to the vice president and the FBI.  He has pled guilty to those lies.</p><p> The president a year ago seemed to know that Flynn has lied.  Now, he's not  so sure.</p><p> GIULIANI:  The president doesn't know that he lied.  The president -- the  president --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  But he -- he knows what you knew at the time.  The man pled  guilty to lying.  He did --  </p><p> WALLACE:  No, he knows -- he knows what -- he knows what Flynn said to his  vice president.</p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes, but that was a lie, but that's not a crime.</p><p> WALLACE:  Well, I understand but I didn't ask if it was a crime, I asked  whether it was a lie.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  Chris -- Chris, you're going all over the place and you're  really confusing people.  Look, first of all --  </p><p> WALLACE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> GIULIANI:  You are -- you are -- you are -- you are -- you are, really --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  I didn't ask if it was a crime.  I asked whether  it was a lie and he told the same lie to the FBI and to the vice president.   And you're quite right, lying to the vice president isn't a lie, it's not  very good -- but lying to the FBI --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  -- is a crime.</p><p> GIULIANI:  Right.  And the more important thing about what the president  knew or didn't know -- because this doesn't involve the president in terms  of him being involved in any kind of conspiracy or anything else -- it's  like if it's reported that one of my assistants when I was a U.S. attorney  lied to the court, how do I know if he did or he didn't?  He knows what he  reads.  The man pled guilty to lying --  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK.  I got -- I got one minute --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  -- so, yes.  He didn't know at the time -- I didn't know at the  time -- I didn't know at the time that the FBI had previously concluded he  was telling the truth.</p><p> WALLACE:  I got a --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  I didn't know he had been deprived of a lawyer.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor, you're confusing people.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GIULIANI:  I'm not confusing people.</p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask you --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  The man was railroaded.</p><p> WALLACE:  -- three last quick questions.</p><p> GIULIANI:  He was railroaded.</p><p> WALLACE:  There are -- there are reports now that the special counsel is  interested again in interviewing the president.  Has his office reached out  to you about sitting down for an in-person interview with the president?</p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes.  There are several unpaid parking tickets that night --  back in 1986, '87 that haven't been explained.  You know, we've got to --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Seriously?</p><p> GIULIANI:  Seriously, unpaid parking tickets --  </p><p> WALLACE:  No, no, no.</p><p> GIULIANI:  It was a movie theater.  He didn't pay the proper fee.</p><p> WALLACE:  Is the special counsel -- does he want to interview the  president?  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes, good luck.  Good luck.  After what they did to Flynn, the  way they trapped him into perjury and no sentence for him, 14 days for  Papadopoulos.  I did better on traffic violations than they did with  Papadopoulos.  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, when you say good luck, you're saying no way, no interview?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  They're a joke.  Over my dead body, but you know, I could be  dead.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Do they want to speak to the president?</p><p> GIULIANI:  I do have -- I do have other lawyer -- I am disgusted with the  tactics they have used in this case.  What they did to General Flynn should  result in discipline.  They're the ones who are violating the law.  </p><p> They're looking at a non-crime collusion, the other guys are looking at a  non-crime campaign violations, which are not violations.  And they are the  ones who are violating the law, the rules, the ethics and nobody wants to  look at them.  They destroyed Strzok and Page's texts, 19,000 texts.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  If he had destroyed 19,000 texts, they'd put him in jail.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Even though they can't because he's the president.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor Giuliani.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Thank you.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  I got a little --   </p><p> WALLACE:  No, listen, I love it and please come back.  To be continued.  </p><p> Thank you for your time.  Always good to talk to you, sir.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Thank you.  Thank you. </p><p> WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what a  judge's Obamacare ruling could mean for millions of Americans.  </p><p> Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump saying  he'd be proud to shut down the government over a border wall.  Just go to  Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  A big, big victory by a highly respected judge.  Highly, highly  respected in Texas and on the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we  will get great, great health care for our people.  We'll have to sit down  with the Democrats to do it but I'm sure they want to do it also.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  President Trump praising the ruling from the federal judge  striking down the entire Obamacare law.</p><p> And it's time now for our Sunday group.  Fox News senior political analyst  Brit Hume, columnist for \"The Hill\", Juan Williams, Julie Pace, Washington  bureau chief for \"The Associated Press\" and Marc Short, former director of  legislative affairs for President Trump.  </p><p> Well, Brit, the federal judge said Obamacare is invalid because Congress  has taken out the tax penalty as part of the individual mandate, which is  the way that it passed through the Supreme Court in the first place.  But  we should point out the law stays in effect pending appeal.  </p><p> What do you think of the ruling and how do you think this plays  politically?  </p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, remember, this is a  trial court judge.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Right.</p><p> HUME:  So, this is subject to appeal to appellate court and perhaps on the  Supreme Court.  I think it's an interesting legal argument whether because  of the invalidation of the zeroing out of the penalty was the whole law  therefore is invalid.  I think you can hear good, legal arguments on both  sides of that issue but I think we're nowhere near the last of this and  because the judge did not issue an injunction that shuts it down.  As you  point out, Obamacare will remain in place -- what's left of Obamacare  remains in place for the foreseeable future.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But how does it play politically, given the fact there are  certain parts of Obamacare that people didn't like, like the individual  mandate.  On the other hand, there are lot of parts of it that people did  like pre-existing conditions --  </p><p> HUME:  Right. </p><p> WALLACE:  And that's according to the judge's ruling would be out, too.   </p><p> HUME:  It would be out but it won't be out now and it won't be out soon, in  my judgment.  So, I think the political effect will depend on the actual  practical effect and there is no practical effect for the time being.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Juan, the president and Republicans ran in 2016 on  the idea of repeal and replace Obamacare, which they thought was a good  issue for them.  Democrats won in 2018 on the argument the Republicans want  to take away your pre-existing conditions.  </p><p> So, how do you think this is going to cut, particularly given the fact as  Brit Hume says, it's not going to have a practical effect, it's not going  to take effect for some months, maybe a year as it goes to the courts.  </p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think you can see  already this morning, Republicans are on their heels, not really saying  much about this while you have Nancy Pelosi and potentially incoming  speaker of the house saying Democrats will defend it.  Chris Murphy, the  senator from Connecticut, saying it's a five-alarm fire.  I think clearly  Democrats see themselves in a position where they are on the offensive with  the voters about this.  If you take away Obamacare, you know, after how  many -- 70 votes by Republicans to repeal it, didn't work even with the  Republican majority, Chris.</p><p> It's not only that you would do away with things like pre-existing  conditions, you would drive up premiums for everybody.  Our health care  system would be in chaos.  So, I think that what you get here is  Republicans right now including President Trump, who initially tweeted  great, great, are saying we need a bipartisan collaboration here to make  health care work.  </p><p> That's a different tone from Republicans and I think it's very telling  about who is politically at risk here.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Marc, you're wrinkling your brow.  </p><p> MARC SHORT, FORMER DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Well, I think, look, Republicans won in 2010 and 2014 and 2016 in large  part on a promise to repeal Obamacare and now somehow the media are saying  it's an albatross on Republicans.  It's been a political win for  Republicans.  </p><p> WALLACE:  If you look at the polls, Obamacare has become more popular.  </p><p> SHORT:  And you know why, Chris?  Because the last two years, from 2013 to  2017, premiums went up 105 percent across the country.  In the last year,  they've gone up 5 percent.  They used to be 50 percent of the counties in  the United States had one insurer, and that was it.  That's been fixed.   All counties now have more than one insurer.</p><p> Because this administration has provided more choice for people, they have  actually helped to stabilize the markets.  That doesn't mean forcing people  to buy a product they don't want is a good policy.  </p><p> JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:  But in terms of the fallout from this  ruling potentially, one thing you're definitely not hearing from the  Republicans after this judge's ruling is any interest in going back to the  drawing board and starting from scratch.  If -- ultimately, this move  through the court that Obamacare fully is repealed, you do not have a lot  of Republicans who want to spend 2019 deep in the weeds on health care.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Let me switch, I'll tell you what they're going to spend at the  end of 2018 on.  There is the real threat now of a partial government  shutdown that would start at midnight this Friday.  Here's how that played  out this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,  because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that  have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.  So I will take  the mantle.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  He is taking full responsibility for  the Trump shutdown.  Perhaps he doesn't understand people need their  paychecks.  Maybe that's not the life he leads.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the  president saying that he would be proud to shutdown the government, we got  this on Facebook from Linda Rector.  </p><p> Why is shutting down the government not something to be proud of if it  means protecting the country?  That's exactly what we elected the president  to do. </p><p> Marc, Juan, how do you answer Linda?  And two, as a person who until last  July used to deal with Congress for the White House, for President Trump,  what do you think is going to happen?  Will there be a shutdown?  Will they  kick it down the can into January?  </p><p> SHORT:  If there were a shutdown, it would be different the very previous  ones.  This government has already funded all the men and women serving in  uniform.  It has funded all the entitlement checks.  It will keep the parts  of (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> So, the average American wouldn't even recognize the shutdown other than  the fact that it would be a media story, Chris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Wait, there's about 30 percent of the government that gets shut  down and I think 30 to 40 percent of the employees.  </p><p> SHORT:  And every time there's been a shutdown, every employee has been  paid back in full.  So I think the average person is not going to feel it  in the immediate future.  </p><p> Having said that, I still think you're going to find a compromise that  comes together before the end of the week.  I think the president has got  to look to find ways to fund this out of military construction dollars.   They'll create a separate problem later, because Democrats object to that.  </p><p> But last year, we secured the first new funding, $1.6 billion for the wall  in ten years.  Democrats come on your show and say we oppose any funding  for the wall.  They've already agreed to it.  It's already 1.6 in this  year.  </p><p> All we're not arguing about is not what they are, it's how much it costs,  and it's a matter of whether they can notified (ph) being at 1.6. </p><p> WALLACE:  That's an old joke.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let's gather here, everybody.  </p><p> So, Julie, shutdown or not?  </p><p> PACE:  I think all signs point to, as Marc says, some kind of compromise.   I think we'll have a tense couple of days.  This is normally how the  pattern of these shutdowns play out, but both Republicans and Democrats  that I talked on Capitol Hill last week have very little interest in a  shutdown.  They have very little interest in staying in Washington for  Christmas which is ultimately what this comes down to a lot of times.  </p><p> I do think that the president might be itching for a shutdown.  But I  ultimately think he will sign on if there is some kind of compromise that  gets some amount of wall funding and he can punt towards the military to  see if that's another option for building the wall.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask about another issue, which is the  president on Friday afternoon named a acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney,  and it's already come out that during the 2016 campaign, during a debate  right after the \"Access Hollywood\" came out, a debate with his Democratic  candidate, this is before he joined the Trump administration as OMB  director, he said this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MICK MULVANEY, ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF:  Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump,  doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact I think he's a  terrible human being.  But the choice on the other side is just as bad.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Well --  </p><p> PACE:  Here we are.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Do you think that creates problems for Mulvaney?  </p><p> PACE:  I think Mulvaney has been really strategic over the last couple of  years.  He has found a way to work with the president.  He's been very  loyal to the president since he's taken his job as OMB director.  So much  so that Trump keeps trying to give him other jobs in addition to chief of  staff.  </p><p> I do think that it's interesting that Mulvaney is leaving himself an out by  taking on the acting chief of staff role and keeping his job as OMB  director, if this doesn't work out for either side, he's got a fallback  option within the administration.  But Mulvaney kind of falls into a  category like a Lindsey Graham, who was also critical of the president  during the campaign, even after he became the nominee but has found a way  to work with him in office.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Brit, after Nick Ayers turned the president down, the vice  president's chief of staff, and then Chris Christie turned the president  down, he almost had to name somebody, didn't he?  This was getting a little  embarrassing.  </p><p> HUME:  He was like the guy who couldn't get a date for the prom and he  finally got Mulvaney, who was already on board to join in.  But Mulvaney is  a good choice.  He's a very able guy, seasoned and experience, knows the  issues, knows the policies, knows the government.  So -- </p><p> WALLACE:  I'll say something else, he is a happy warrior.  He's a guy who - - he's a positive guy.  He is also a guy who might come on Sunday talk  shows, which John Kelly treated us like the plague.  </p><p> HUME:  He wasn't interested.  </p><p> I would add this.  There's some talk that Trump doesn't need to chief of  staff, he should be his own, that is really nonsense because Trump needs  help from people who really know this town, know its ways, know the  details, know the issues, and he has been at important time, willing to  accept advice from those people to his benefit.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right, panel, we have to take a break here.  But stay right  here.  </p><p> When we come back, as new evidence implicates the president, what are the  chances Democrats will move pursuing impeachment?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Coming up, the president sounds off on the  Mueller investigation, as his former fixer is sentenced to prison. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nobody, except for me, would  be looked at like this. Nobody. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: We'll get our Sunday panel's read on how serious the president's  legal troubles really are, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What he did was all unrelated  to me except for the two campaign finance charges that are not criminal and  shouldn't have been on there. They put that on to embarrass me. They put  those two charges on to embarrass me. </p><p> MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I told the truth. I took  responsibility for my actions. And instead of him taking responsibility for  his actions, what does he do? He attacks my family. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: President Trump and his former fixer, Michael Cohen, taking shots  at each other after Cohen received a three-year prison sentence for a  number of crimes, including making hush money payments during the 2016  campaign.</p><p> And we're back now with the panel. </p><p> Julie, there are reports, and we hear these from time to time, the  president is more and more consumed by the special counsel investigation,  especially as former allies like Michael Cohen and the publisher of \"The  National Enquirer\" are providing evidence against him. </p><p> What do you hear your sources? </p><p> JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": So I think it is indisputable that the  president is consumed by these investigations. You really don't need any  secret sources on this. You just need to look at his -- at his Twitter  feed. He is following the twists and turns of this extremely closely. And  as people who are close to him get caught up in this, he gets more  agitated. And I think now we are seeing that almost every aspect of his  life, over the last several years, is now under some level of  investigation. His administration, his campaign, the inauguration, and his  businesses. </p><p> And the business piece of this is, I think, the one that is getting to the  president the most because, yes, being president is part of his identity,  but actually being this successful businessman is almost more important to  him in some ways. It's how he has defined himself for decades. And it's his  children's legacy. They are at the top of this -- at this business. And any  sign that his business could crumble, that past business dealings could be  swept up in this investigation, is incredibly personal to him. </p><p> WALLACE: Marc.</p><p> MARC SHORT, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR: I agree  100 percent with Julie. I think that what's unfortunate here is that you  have what begins as a special prosecutor focus on collusion in Russia. And  as Julie just said, it's about every part of his life. We end up saying,  instead of investigating a crime, we're investigating a person. And  Republicans and civil libertarians used to oppose that motion after Iran  Contra. Then they fell in love with it during the Whitewater years because  they said it was a land deal but it became something about an affair with  an intern. </p><p> And it's a problem. It's a problem where we have prosecutors going all  over. And I think -- </p><p> WALLACE: But how about -- how about the argument that is made, gee, we  didn't hear Republicans complain about it when it happened to Bill Clinton? </p><p> SHORT: I agree 100 percent. I'm saying -- I'm saying Republicans as well  have been hypocritical on this. There used to be a group of strong, civil  libertarians who would recognize the problem of special prosecutors. And --  probably this is now the -- what's been born of that fruit. </p><p> WALLACE: All right, so far the only alleged crime that the president is  specifically linked to is not collusion, is not obstruction of justice, it  involves campaign finance violations, alleged campaign finance violations. </p><p> Here is how Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler, the incoming chair of the  House Judiciary Committee, responded to that this week. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JERRY NADLER (D-NY), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, RANKING MEMBER: Well, they  would be impeachable offenses. Whether they are important enough to justify  an impeachment is a different question. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Brit, how persuaded are you that if President Trump directed these  payments, these hush money payments, as Michael Cohen says he did, that it  was a campaign finance violation on his part, a criminal violation? And,  two, what do you think of the likelihood that the House and the wisdom of  the House proceeding to impeachment on campaign finance violation? </p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it's a little hard to  imagine a president being impeached for a campaign finance violation. Most  of these violations are handled as civil matters and result in fines. And  they are, you know, widespread, rampant. Obama had a -- the Obama campaign  had to pay a big fine.</p><p> I don't -- I just don't think the House of Representatives, even such  ardent Democrats as Jerry Nadler, will go there. The greater worry is that  some other charge comes out when Mueller finally gets his ore in with his  report and says whatever he says. And that, I think, Chris, raises an  intriguing question, which is this, how far will these House investigations  go if Mueller doesn't find something very serious about the president? My  thought is, it probably takes the wind out of their sails, but we'll have  to wait and see. But, on balance, I don't think campaign finance is going  to dislodge him. </p><p> WALLACE: When you look at all of this and, you know, as we say, there is  still no hard evidence of collusion, no hard evidence of obstruction of  justice, but the wall do seem to be moving in on the president on a lot of  fronts. </p><p> HUME: Well, I don't think the Mueller report is likely to be -- to sing the  president's praises. But that's not what he needs. What he needs is kind of  an -- of a -- of a report that says, you know does not outline some major  crime. And if that happens, I mean I think it changes the atmosphere  dramatically, both legally and politically, because I think it's -- and if  he is vindicated on no collusion, which is what he's been saying, I don't  think the -- I've never thought that collusion was the central point of  this investigation. </p><p> Remember, when it started, Chris, it was a counterintelligence  investigation with the FBI acting as an intelligence agency to determine  what Russia actually did. And if you go back and look at the letter  authorizing Mueller's appointment, it says -- it mentions that it picks up  that investigation and then says, he's also authorized to find out if there  was collaboration between the two. That was always a subset of the overall  investigation. And if it turns out to be a subset with no crime alleged in  the final report, I think it's a huge boost for the president. </p><p> WALLACE: Juan.</p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the Democratic  base is so inflamed by Trump, by his behavior overall, I think they -- they  would think that Democrats weren't, in fact, holding up to their  constitutional responsivities if they did not consider impeachment. So you  get the --</p><p> WALLACE: Even on campaign finance violations? </p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, what we -- what did we learn this week? He wants to  say it's just Michael Cohen making these outrageous claims because Cohen  wants a better deal from the prosecutors. But, in fat, we hear from David  Packer at \"National Enquirer,\" same thing happened. We hear from \"The Wall  Street Journal,\" the president was in the room. So if -- potentially he  would be an unindicted coconspirator while his president because nobody  thinks you can indict the president. But that doesn't mean that you can't  go to the Congress and say, let's look at this and see -- </p><p> WALLACE: Do you really think that would be wise for Democrats to do? And  this -- this is speculative.</p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, that's a separate issue. That's a separate issue. </p><p> WALLACE: OK. Well, that's my question, though.</p><p> WILLIAMS: OK. Well, if the question was --</p><p> WALLACE: Would it be wise for them to do it if that's all that there is? </p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think that's -- no. And I think that what you're  going to see, and you already see this from, by the way, Jerry Nadler, but  also from Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, as the say, they're not interested  right now. But the base of the party, is what I was trying to say to you,  Chris, is going to be putting pressure there because they think that, in  fact, Democrats had been too docile in dealing with Trump and they want --  they want them to come and have the --</p><p> WALLACE: They want blood?</p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, because, guess what, you've saw a blue wave, 40 seats  switch hands, and the number -- you know, health care was clearly  important. But also a check on Trump was very important to voters. </p><p> WALLACE: And every indication is -- everybody keeps saying this  investigation is going to be over the end of the year. </p><p> WILLIAMS: I don't see it. </p><p> WALLACE: I always say, pick the over, right? </p><p> PACE: Right. We -- we don't know what else Mueller has. I think this could  go well into next year and really line up with some of these congressional  investigation. </p><p> WALLACE: Thank you, panel. </p><p> Up next we sit down with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, head of the Gates  Foundation. In the era of America first, he worries about a shrinking U.S.  role in dealing with global poverty and public health.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest  private charitable fund, giving $46 billion in grants since its founding in  2000 and literally saving millions of lives. The Microsoft co-founder came  to Washington this week to make the case for American leadership and the  need for foreign aid in the era of America first. When we sat down at the  Chamber of Commerce, that's where we began. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER AND PHILANTHROPIST: There was a  recommendation by the executive branch to make fairly substantial cuts U.S.  aid budget. And, fortunately, the Congress took that proposal, which would  have meant cutting people off from those HIV medicines, and they decided to  maintain the foreign aid levels. </p><p> WALLACE: Your wife Melinda recently talked about -- and I want to quote her  directly -- how incredibly disappointing it is to see U.S. leadership  deteriorating and the view of the U.S. deteriorating because of some of the  egregious things that have been said by this current administration. What's  she talking about? </p><p> GATES: I hope I know. The -- I think the particular episode there was  talking about Africa and the conditions in Africa in a -- not in a positive  way. Sort of characterizing the entire continent. But, in any case --</p><p> WALLACE: Your talk about the blank countries? </p><p> GATES: Exactly. In the U.S. engagement in Africa and around the world,  there are many reasons we should maintain that. Just a pure security point  of view alone would justify this level of expenditure. </p><p> Now, for many people, the humanitarian part of it is also there and that  part is dramatic. And so it is disappointing when it feels like the U.S. is  being short-term and the U.S. is only thinking about its interest in a very  narrow way and not being the leader that says, now, we -- you know, we are  going to help these countries get so that they can -- can take care of  themselves. </p><p> WALLACE: The president's mantra is America first. You seem to be suggesting  that in terms of America's interests you've got to look a long way beyond  America first. </p><p> GATES: Well, I think that the broad definition of our interests, including  investing in allies and not viewing every transaction as one that we have  to maximize our benefit, taking, you know, world institutions and have them  just focus on the United States. What we did, in terms of the post-World  War II institutions has been a fantastic thing. That included having a  common view of the future with our western allies. </p><p> If you really follow that line of thinking, the idea of helping Africa, of  working on an HIV vaccine to stop the AIDS crisis, you just wouldn't do it.  And -- and yet I feel, even in that narrow framework of, OK, I only care  about what -- how U.S. citizens do, even in that framework, these  institutions, these alliances, these investments in innovation are  overwhelmingly smart things to do. </p><p> WALLACE: Since the year 2000, a billion people have lifted themselves from  what you define as extreme poverty. And you say that the first wave was in  China and the second wave was in India. Before we get to places where the  wave hasn't hit yet, what happened in those places? </p><p> GATES: One of the first things you want to do in these countries is raise  agricultural productivity. All of the Asian miracles, even going back to  Taiwan and Japan, South Korea, involved more than tripling agricultural  output per person so you could free up that labor and move it into the  cities. And if you had the right infrastructure, educational investment,  then you've got a manufacturing sector of the economy and slowly but surely  you'd get a very large middle class. </p><p> WALLACE: You talk about the successes, the waves in China and India, and  then there's Africa. You say that by 2050, 86 percent -- 86 percent of the  extremely poor people in the world will live in Africa and, in fact, 40  percent will live in just two countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo  and Nigeria. </p><p> What's holding them back? </p><p> GATES: They're starting at very low levels of infrastructure, very low  level of property. And one of the things that drives those numbers you  mentioned is the very high population growth. And so they account for  double the portions of births you'd expect. By the end of the century, the  majority of births in the world will take place in Africa. </p><p> Africa has to demand our attention. That's where extreme poverty is still  tough. That's where stability is difficult to achieve. And, you know, we've  got to go after things like these neglected diseases, malaria. We've got to  help them with infrastructure. It's really, in terms of our humanity of  helping the poorest, Africa's where we'll be most tested. </p><p> WALLACE: How do you even begin to address these concentrations of misery? </p><p> GATES: Well, one of the great achievements in development history was what  was called the green revolution where new varieties of the cereal (ph)  crops, corn, which everyone else calls maize, rice and wheat. In a period  where people thought India would experience mass starvation because the  agricultural output went up, they were actually able to improve the  nutrition even when their population was growing. We need to do that same  thing for Africa. </p><p> WALLACE: It seems that climate change could be the accelerant to all of the  bad things in terms of agricultural productivity, global health,  instability, extreme poverty. Talk about that. </p><p> GATES: Yes. For a country like the U.S., that's northern, you know, climate  change will change things. We'll have more hot days, more forest fires. But  it's not a threat to our survival. </p><p> In Africa, where you are completely dependent on the rain coming, whereas  there been in the past about one out of 12 years you'll have a failed  harvest, the prediction is that we be closer to one out of four years  because of the higher temperature and the -- the -- unfortunately, with  climate change, you -- not only is it hotter, but the rain comes all at  once, or it doesn't come for long periods of time. So if you want to say,  where are you going to get millions of deaths because of climate change  between now and the end of the century, you don't look to the United  States. Yes, you'll have some forest fires and there will be some deaths.  But the -- the significant numbers are in these very, very poor countries  because of the subsistence farming. </p><p> WALLACE: What do you say to those who say it's not climate change, it's  weather, and that the -- the man -- the human component is questionable? </p><p> GATES: That's impressive if somebody can say that out loud. The --the  amount of --</p><p> WALLACE: Have you been -- have you been to Washington? </p><p> GATES: The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is a super measurable thing.  It's important not to over claim what we know because that undermines the  whole discussion., But the general warming and the mechanism of that  warming has to do with CO2 and methane emissions. That's -- that's really  not a question. </p><p> WALLACE: I want to talk to you about toilets. Since 2011, the Gates  Foundation has launched to reinvent the toilet challenge. Explain, one, why  that's so important, and, two, again, dealing with the specifics, what have  been some of your successes and failures along the way? </p><p> GATES: In many of these poor countries, the capital cost of building that  sewer, it's just never going to happen. And so the solution would be to,  instead of using that sewer, to have something in the toilet itself, which  is essentially the processing facility. We have ten different universities  whose designs we funded. So we put in several hundred million dollars. And  now we've gotten it to the point where we have a lot of commercial  companies who say, OK, that approach looks promising. </p><p> Now, the price of this toilet, that does the processing, is still ten times  more expensive. It's about, you know, $10,000 per toilet right now. We need  to get it into these tough parts, the slums of these African cities. We  need it to be more like a thousand dollars. </p><p> WALLACE: I want to ask about your -- your old job. There's something of a  backlash here in Washington against big tech. The growing feeling in  Washington is that big tech does not do enough to protect users' privacy  and that it shows political bias. Do you see merit in either of those  arguments? </p><p> GATES: I went through an episode in the late '90s where Microsoft was  subject to government investigation. </p><p> WALLACE: We remember. </p><p> GATES: And so in a way this is -- in a small way now it's less Microsoft  now, but it's broad. </p><p> Yes, the government should be talking to these companies about what they  do. There's nothing inappropriate. </p><p> I was naive. I didn't have an office in Washington, D.C. I thought that was  a good thing and I even bragged about it. I later came to regret that. </p><p> So these -- I'm sure these guys are learning better than I did that they  need to come back here and start a dialogue. And there will be new types of  regulations for these companies. </p><p> WALLACE: And you don't have a problem with that? I mean you think that's  appropriate?</p><p> GATES: Well, the notion that there will be privacy regulations, that makes  a lot of sense. The notion that this ability to identify anyone that were  going to think about how do businesses get to use that and how does the  government use that, it makes a lot of sense. </p><p> WALLACE: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are right now jockeying for which is  going to be the most highly valued company in the world in terms of market  capitalization. At the close of the market on Friday, Microsoft was number  one at over $800 billion, Apple, $799.5 billion. Does that give you any  pleasure? </p><p> GATES: You know, when I was starting Microsoft in my 20s, the idea that we  could create a company that was -- you know, would beat IBM, you know,  because they were the big monolith and, you know, we understood software  and they didn't. And we believed in these cute, small machines to empower  individuals and they believed in these big machines. It was kind of mythic  that we were going to beat IBM.</p><p> By the time Microsoft valuation passed IBM, which is now, you know, 15  years ago, it didn't feel like that big of a victory. And so you really --  it's really better to define yourself by an aspiration. You know, can  software improve education? Can software help, you know, medical care costs  in the U.S. just keep going up dramatically? Can software play a role  there?.</p><p> So, yes, I'm very proud of Microsoft and the vision that software and  technology would make a big thing. You know, it's led to the most valuable,  the five most valuable companies being these tech companies. So I do think  it's an vindication (ph) of the importance of technology, which now is  coming with a lot of responsibilities as well. </p><p> WALLACE: Bill, it's an honor to talk to you again. </p><p> GATES: Thank you. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE: And if you want to learn more about the remarkable work Bill and  Melinda Gates are doing, you can find their link at foxnewssunday.com. </p><p> Up next, a final word. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: Stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel for the latest on  a potential end of year government shutdown. </p><p> And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Who in the president's inner circle is next to  fall?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Let me tell you, I never  directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did on his own.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WALLACE:  What do we know about President Trump's involvement in hush money  payments of two women during the 2016 campaign?  And what does Michael  Cohen's cooperation mean for the special counsel investigation?  We'll ask  the president's lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then -- </p><p>TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.   I will take the mantle.  I will be the one to shut it down.  I'm not going  to blame you for it.  </p><p>WALLACE:  The president deals with a divided Washington and a possible  government shutdown over his border wall.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  Perhaps he doesn't understand people  leave their paychecks.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel if we're headed for compromise or  confrontation.  </p><p>Plus -- </p><p>BILL GATES, GATES FOUNDATSION:  The U.S.'s engagement in Africa and around  the world, there are many reasons we should maintain that.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We'll talk with Bill Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation  about what he feels is a shrinking U.S. role in dealing with global poverty  and public health.  </p><p>All right now on \"FOX News Sunday\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE:  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.  </p><p>We begin with breaking news.  A federal judge has ruled the entire  Affordable Care Act invalid.  Obamacare will remain in place pending appeal  and both President Trump and Democrats are calling for Congress to pass new  legislation.  We'll get to all that a little later.  </p><p>But first, the president is already dealing with a possible government  shutdown that's now just five days away.  Meanwhile, prosecutors are  producing more of the evidence that led former members of Mr. Trump's inner  circle to plead guilty, evidence that implicates the president.  </p><p>Let's get the latest from Kevin Corke live at the White House -- Kevin.  </p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, even for an administration  accustomed to seismic shifts in the news cycle, it was without a doubt a  tumultuous week.  But few headlines could prove as potentially damaging to  the Trump White House than those involving former members of the  president's inner circle.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  Three of whom are facing time in prison for a variety of misdeeds,  but none involving so-called Russian collusion.  Former national security  adviser, General Michael Flynn, faces sentencing Tuesday for lying to  federal investigators.  The special counsel's office recommending he get no  jail time even as it has faced charges that the general was entrapped and  inappropriately questioned.  </p><p>Meanwhile, in his first televised interview since being sentenced to three  years behind bar, the president's former fixer, attorney Michael Cohen,  claimed he repeatedly lied for Mr. Trump over the years and he would set up  payments to women to help aid his 2016 campaign, a claim strongly denied by  the White House.  </p><p>TRUMP:  I will take the mantle of shutting down and I'm going to shut it  down for border security.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  But we believe you shouldn't shut it  down.</p><p>CORKE:  An Oval Office meeting with leading Democrats this week did little  to quell fears of a potential partial government shutdown over the  president's insistence that there would be funding for a border wall,  something Democrats say they won't pay for.  A work stoppage that could  come in a week in which backers of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare,  consider their next move in the wake of a federal judge's ruling that the  law is unconstitutional.  </p><p>TRUMP:  -- that the Supreme Court upholds, we'll be sitting down with the  Democrats and we will get great health care for our people.  Let's say  repeal and replace.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  That ruling by District Court Judge Reed O'Connor, Chris, does not  impact Obamacare recipients in the short term, but it does set up a  potential high court battle and that is a debate White House officials  would love to have -- Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thanks.  </p><p>WALLACE:  And joining me now from New York, the president's lead lawyer,  Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p>Mayor, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\".  </p><p>RUDY GUILIANI, LEAD LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you  -- thank you, Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's start with Michael Cohen's allegation that President Trump  directed him to commit a criminal campaign finance violation.  Here first  was the president and then Mr. Cohen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I never directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did  on his own.  He's a lawyer.  A lawyer who represents a client is supposed  to do the right thing.  </p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  He directed me to make the  payments, he directed me to become involved in these matters.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  Question.  Did Mr. Trump direct Michael Cohen to pay off these  two women or not?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No, the truth is actually what Cohen testified to under oath  before Congress and what he repeated numerous times on surreptitious tape  recordings that he made, which is that the president didn't know about this  until some time into it, he did find out about it and eventually reimburse  him.  But, you know, this is a hard thing to do, but lawyers do this all  the time.  </p><p>But, Chris, even if it were true, it's not a crime.  The payment -- the  payment of money in a situation like this has been covered in the Edwards  case.  Not only the acquittal and hung jury in the Edwards case, but the  fact that the FEC looked at those Edwards violations and determined they  weren't violations --   </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>WALLACE:  I promise we're going to get to that in a minute, but let's get  to the simple fact, question of whether the president directed Cohen --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- to make these --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- payments or not.  </p><p>Cohen says that the president is not to be believed.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>COHEN:  The man doesn't tell the truth.  And it's sad that I should take  responsibility for his dirty deeds.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Wow.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor -- Mayor --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  That's some lawyer.  That is some lawyer.  He was the lawyer in  that situation.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>WALLACE:  But does the president tell the truth or not?   </p><p>GIULIANI:  The president is telling the truth, yes.  This man is lying.  </p><p>Now, is that a big surprise to you, that Michael Cohen is lying?  The man  got up in front of the judge and said I was a fiercely loyal to Donald  Trump.  Nonsense he was fiercely loyal to him, he taped him, lied to him,  revealed the tape and did something a lawyer I've never heard ever did --  tape record his own client.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But -- but, sir --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  He sat there with Chris Cuomo, told him he wasn't being taped,  showed him a drawer (ph), and he lied to him and taped him for two hours.   The man is a complete pathological liar that cannot be believed.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But, sir, let's -- let's turn to --   </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GIULIANI:  And they'll never put him on a witness stand.  They will never - - Chris --   </p><p>WALLACE:  Yes, but let me ask you --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  -- they will never put him on a witness stand.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I understand.  But does the question -- the real question is the  credibility of the president, not the credibility of Michael Cohen --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No, no --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let me just finish.  The president has changed his story  repeatedly about whether or not he knew about hush money.  Here is what he  said on Air Force One -- the president said on Air Force One this April,  eight months ago.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>REPORTER:  Mr. President, did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy  Daniels?</p><p>TRUMP:  No.  No.  What else?  </p><p>REPORTER:  Then why did Michael Cohen make those if there was no truth to  her allegations?  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.  Michael is my attorney and  you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.   </p><p>REPORTER:  Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?  </p><p>TRUMP:  No, I don't know.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  The president said he doesn't know anything about any payments,  but in one of those tapes that you're talking about where Cohen  surreptitiously taped the president -- this is back in September of 2016 --  here are the president and Cohen discussing a potential --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>WALLACE:  Let's listen to the tape first.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Sure, sure.  I remember it well.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>COHEN:  I'm all over that.  And I spoke to Allen about it.  When it comes  time for the financing, which will be --   </p><p>TRUMP:  Wait a sec, what financing?  </p><p>COHEN:  Well, I'll have to pay --  </p><p>TRUMP:  Pay with cash --  </p><p>COHEN:  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  So which is it?  Did the president know about the hush money  payments or not?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris, there's an intervening event that you're not talking  about.  I know this really well because I got criticized for revealing this  when I first came into the case.  Nobody really understood why I was doing  it.  </p><p>When I first came into the case, we went through the whole case.  The  president saw some notes and documents, thought about it, and I went out  and said, no, there was an intervening conversation after the payments took  place and before the revelations you're talking about on Air Force One.</p><p>The president did talk to Cohen or to people in between and they arranged  to reimburse Cohen.  This was after the payment was made, after it was  over, after the campaign was over.</p><p>WALLACE:  But -- but there's --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  They're talking about a conversation, sir, in September of 2016  during the campaign.  The president is clearly aware that David Pecker, the  head of \"National Enquirer\" had paid off Karen McDougal and they're talking  about reimbursing McDougal --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Well, you know, that's --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- or reimbursing Pecker for that payment.</p><p>GIULIANI:  But there's a -- there's a big difference here.  That was a -  that was a conversation he was asked, middle of the campaign, I was with  him back then in the middle of the campaign, he's working 18 hours a day.   I wasn't able to remember a lot of things that happened in September of  2016.  He was asked it one time.  </p><p>When he sat down with his lawyer and went through it in great detail and  saw things that could refresh his recollection, we immediately corrected  it.</p><p>Nobody pushed us, nobody found it, we found it.  And we corrected it and I  got criticized like crazy for doing it.</p><p>WALLACE:  So you're saying --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  By the time this came out, we all knew --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- the fact -- I mean, the -- according both to Cohen and to  Pecker, the -- again, he's the head of -- or was the head of National  Enquirer, they say they were in a meeting with Donald Trump --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris, Chris, Chris --  </p><p>WALLACE:   -- in the summer of 2016 in which --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- they discussed the payment to Karen McDougal.</p><p>GIULIANI:  We're talking about something that doesn't matter.  I mean,  whether - whether it happened or didn't happen, it's not illegal.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  You're moving shells around on me.  Either it happened or it  didn't happen.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But that's what lawyers do all the time.  You argue in the  alternative.  I'm telling it --  </p><p>WALLACE:  But I'm asking you for the truth, sir.</p><p>GIULIANI:  I'm telling you definitively -- well, I -- I want the truth too.   And the truth is, yes, the tape-recorded conversation did take place.  It  exonerates the president.  The president tells Cohen, do it by check.  </p><p>I'm sorry, I prosecuted thousands of crimes, never prosecuted one where  they wanted to hide something, they did it by check.  </p><p>Make sure we pay him back.  They paid him back.  That's what that  conversation's all about.  It exonerates him.</p><p>I'd play that conversation in front of any jury in America and I'd cross- examine Cohen in front of any jury in America.</p><p>WALLACE:  OK, here's what you're telling --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But I -- but very important; Cohen did not plead guilty to  conspiracy to violate the campaign finance laws.  If they were going to use  him as a witness against anybody, you always make them plea guilty to a  conspiracy so you can fill the conspiracy in.  </p><p>He pled guilty to a singular crime of violating the campaign finance laws.   Not a conspiracy.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yes, but the statement is full of references to individual one  who is Donald Trump.  Here's what you told the --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p>WALLACE:  Here's what you told \"The Daily Beast\" this week.  I want to put  it up on the screen.  </p><p>Nobody got killed.  Nobody got robbed.  This was not a big crime.</p><p>Mayor, what's the threshold between a crime and a big crime?</p><p>GIULIANI:  My statement there was about the prosecutor's view of it, not  mine.  Mr. Swinger (ph) who wrote that, actually corrected that, to say  that that was taken out of context.  My point was, there was no crime.  </p><p>But even if you take the prosecutor's viewpoint, this prosecutor was  appointed -- both of them, right, looking at collusion, no collusion.   Looking at obstruction --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sir, this was the Southern  District of New York.  This is not -- has nothing to do with collusion --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But now you're --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- or obstruction of justice, there --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Now, you're - they're part of the Department of Justice -- he's  not being investigated --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I understand it's a separate prosecutor.  I'm sure -- I'm sure  when you were the --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, this guy -- this guy is going back --  </p><p>WALLACE:  I'm sure - I'm sure when you were the U.S. attorney for the  Southern District --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  And this guy is going back --  </p><p>WALLACE:  You didn't take orders from somebody in Washington who had  nothing to do with the attorney general.  You were your own -- they used to  call it a sovereign district of New York, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  The person -- the person in charge of this investigation, Chris,  is Rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.  He is  the boss of Mueller and he is the boss of the Southern District of New  York.  He's the one that determined, let's move it over here.  He put it  there in the Southern District of New York and keeps supervision of it.</p><p>WALLACE:  I know --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  So don't give me that.</p><p>WALLACE:  But they're not --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  But they're not -- they're not working for --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  There is one Justice Department --- yes they are.  They're  working for the same Rod -- Rod Rosenstein's going to make the decision,  not Mueller, about what to do with this case.</p><p>WALLACE:  Right, and not Mueller.</p><p>GIULIANI:  And this is a witch-hunt.  They are going back now -- they're  going back to 1982, 1983.  They're going through business records.  My  goodness, they went from collusion to obstruction, no evidence -- now  campaign finance, no violation of the law.  </p><p>No matter who's right about what they said, it's no violation of the law.   And now --  </p><p>WALLACE:  The president -- I -- I want to -- I want to move on.  You're --  you're very a effective lawyer, but I've got -- I've got to move on, sir.  </p><p>President Trump --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  You wanted the truth.  That's the truth.  The truth is it's not  a violation of the law.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I want -- I want the truth in a limited amount of time.  </p><p>President Trump talked this week about whether or not General Flynn lied to  the FBI.  Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  They took a general that they said didn't lie, and they convinced  him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal.  And now, they're  recommending no time.  You know why?  Because they're embarrassed that  they've got caught.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Does the president believe Michael Flynn lied or not?</p><p>GIULIANI:  I don't know if Michael Flynn lied or not.  You got two  contradictory things.  You've got the FBI saying at the time that he wasn't  lying.  And then we have no explanation and the guy pleads guilty to lying.  </p><p>So, I -- I mean, I don't know what happened in between.  I do know they  treated Flynn in a way that came very close to --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I'm asking a simple -- I'm asking a simple question.  And the  reason I ask is I want to put up a tweet from the president a year ago, in  December of 2017, when he says this: I had to fire General Flynn because he  lied to the vice president and the FBI.  He has pled guilty to those lies.</p><p>The president a year ago seemed to know that Flynn has lied.  Now, he's not  so sure.</p><p>GIULIANI:  The president doesn't know that he lied.  The president -- the  president --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  But he -- he knows what you knew at the time.  The man pled  guilty to lying.  He did --  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, he knows -- he knows what -- he knows what Flynn said to his  vice president.</p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, but that was a lie, but that's not a crime.</p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I understand but I didn't ask if it was a crime, I asked  whether it was a lie.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris -- Chris, you're going all over the place and you're  really confusing people.  Look, first of all --  </p><p>WALLACE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>GIULIANI:  You are -- you are -- you are -- you are -- you are, really --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  I didn't ask if it was a crime.  I asked whether  it was a lie and he told the same lie to the FBI and to the vice president.   And you're quite right, lying to the vice president isn't a lie, it's not  very good -- but lying to the FBI --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  -- is a crime.</p><p>GIULIANI:  Right.  And the more important thing about what the president  knew or didn't know -- because this doesn't involve the president in terms  of him being involved in any kind of conspiracy or anything else -- it's  like if it's reported that one of my assistants when I was a U.S. attorney  lied to the court, how do I know if he did or he didn't?  He knows what he  reads.  The man pled guilty to lying --  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK.  I got -- I got one minute --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  -- so, yes.  He didn't know at the time -- I didn't know at the  time -- I didn't know at the time that the FBI had previously concluded he  was telling the truth.</p><p>WALLACE:  I got a --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  I didn't know he had been deprived of a lawyer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, you're confusing people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GIULIANI:  I'm not confusing people.</p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask you --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  The man was railroaded.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- three last quick questions.</p><p>GIULIANI:  He was railroaded.</p><p>WALLACE:  There are -- there are reports now that the special counsel is  interested again in interviewing the president.  Has his office reached out  to you about sitting down for an in-person interview with the president?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes.  There are several unpaid parking tickets that night --  back in 1986, '87 that haven't been explained.  You know, we've got to --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Seriously?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Seriously, unpaid parking tickets --  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, no.</p><p>GIULIANI:  It was a movie theater.  He didn't pay the proper fee.</p><p>WALLACE:  Is the special counsel -- does he want to interview the  president?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, good luck.  Good luck.  After what they did to Flynn, the  way they trapped him into perjury and no sentence for him, 14 days for  Papadopoulos.  I did better on traffic violations than they did with  Papadopoulos.  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, when you say good luck, you're saying no way, no interview?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  They're a joke.  Over my dead body, but you know, I could be  dead.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do they want to speak to the president?</p><p>GIULIANI:  I do have -- I do have other lawyer -- I am disgusted with the  tactics they have used in this case.  What they did to General Flynn should  result in discipline.  They're the ones who are violating the law.  </p><p>They're looking at a non-crime collusion, the other guys are looking at a  non-crime campaign violations, which are not violations.  And they are the  ones who are violating the law, the rules, the ethics and nobody wants to  look at them.  They destroyed Strzok and Page's texts, 19,000 texts.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  If he had destroyed 19,000 texts, they'd put him in jail.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Even though they can't because he's the president.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor Giuliani.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Thank you.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  I got a little --   </p><p>WALLACE:  No, listen, I love it and please come back.  To be continued.  </p><p>Thank you for your time.  Always good to talk to you, sir.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Thank you.  Thank you. </p><p>WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what a  judge's Obamacare ruling could mean for millions of Americans.  </p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump saying  he'd be proud to shut down the government over a border wall.  Just go to  Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  A big, big victory by a highly respected judge.  Highly, highly  respected in Texas and on the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we  will get great, great health care for our people.  We'll have to sit down  with the Democrats to do it but I'm sure they want to do it also.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  President Trump praising the ruling from the federal judge  striking down the entire Obamacare law.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group.  Fox News senior political analyst  Brit Hume, columnist for \"The Hill\", Juan Williams, Julie Pace, Washington  bureau chief for \"The Associated Press\" and Marc Short, former director of  legislative affairs for President Trump.  </p><p>Well, Brit, the federal judge said Obamacare is invalid because Congress  has taken out the tax penalty as part of the individual mandate, which is  the way that it passed through the Supreme Court in the first place.  But  we should point out the law stays in effect pending appeal.  </p><p>What do you think of the ruling and how do you think this plays  politically?  </p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, remember, this is a  trial court judge.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Right.</p><p>HUME:  So, this is subject to appeal to appellate court and perhaps on the  Supreme Court.  I think it's an interesting legal argument whether because  of the invalidation of the zeroing out of the penalty was the whole law  therefore is invalid.  I think you can hear good, legal arguments on both  sides of that issue but I think we're nowhere near the last of this and  because the judge did not issue an injunction that shuts it down.  As you  point out, Obamacare will remain in place -- what's left of Obamacare  remains in place for the foreseeable future.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But how does it play politically, given the fact there are  certain parts of Obamacare that people didn't like, like the individual  mandate.  On the other hand, there are lot of parts of it that people did  like pre-existing conditions --  </p><p>HUME:  Right. </p><p>WALLACE:  And that's according to the judge's ruling would be out, too.   </p><p>HUME:  It would be out but it won't be out now and it won't be out soon, in  my judgment.  So, I think the political effect will depend on the actual  practical effect and there is no practical effect for the time being.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Juan, the president and Republicans ran in 2016 on  the idea of repeal and replace Obamacare, which they thought was a good  issue for them.  Democrats won in 2018 on the argument the Republicans want  to take away your pre-existing conditions.  </p><p>So, how do you think this is going to cut, particularly given the fact as  Brit Hume says, it's not going to have a practical effect, it's not going  to take effect for some months, maybe a year as it goes to the courts.  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think you can see  already this morning, Republicans are on their heels, not really saying  much about this while you have Nancy Pelosi and potentially incoming  speaker of the house saying Democrats will defend it.  Chris Murphy, the  senator from Connecticut, saying it's a five-alarm fire.  I think clearly  Democrats see themselves in a position where they are on the offensive with  the voters about this.  If you take away Obamacare, you know, after how  many -- 70 votes by Republicans to repeal it, didn't work even with the  Republican majority, Chris.</p><p>It's not only that you would do away with things like pre-existing  conditions, you would drive up premiums for everybody.  Our health care  system would be in chaos.  So, I think that what you get here is  Republicans right now including President Trump, who initially tweeted  great, great, are saying we need a bipartisan collaboration here to make  health care work.  </p><p>That's a different tone from Republicans and I think it's very telling  about who is politically at risk here.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Marc, you're wrinkling your brow.  </p><p>MARC SHORT, FORMER DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Well, I think, look, Republicans won in 2010 and 2014 and 2016 in large  part on a promise to repeal Obamacare and now somehow the media are saying  it's an albatross on Republicans.  It's been a political win for  Republicans.  </p><p>WALLACE:  If you look at the polls, Obamacare has become more popular.  </p><p>SHORT:  And you know why, Chris?  Because the last two years, from 2013 to  2017, premiums went up 105 percent across the country.  In the last year,  they've gone up 5 percent.  They used to be 50 percent of the counties in  the United States had one insurer, and that was it.  That's been fixed.   All counties now have more than one insurer.</p><p>Because this administration has provided more choice for people, they have  actually helped to stabilize the markets.  That doesn't mean forcing people  to buy a product they don't want is a good policy.  </p><p>JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:  But in terms of the fallout from this  ruling potentially, one thing you're definitely not hearing from the  Republicans after this judge's ruling is any interest in going back to the  drawing board and starting from scratch.  If -- ultimately, this move  through the court that Obamacare fully is repealed, you do not have a lot  of Republicans who want to spend 2019 deep in the weeds on health care.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Let me switch, I'll tell you what they're going to spend at the  end of 2018 on.  There is the real threat now of a partial government  shutdown that would start at midnight this Friday.  Here's how that played  out this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,  because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that  have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.  So I will take  the mantle.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  He is taking full responsibility for  the Trump shutdown.  Perhaps he doesn't understand people need their  paychecks.  Maybe that's not the life he leads.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the  president saying that he would be proud to shutdown the government, we got  this on Facebook from Linda Rector.  </p><p>Why is shutting down the government not something to be proud of if it  means protecting the country?  That's exactly what we elected the president  to do. </p><p>Marc, Juan, how do you answer Linda?  And two, as a person who until last  July used to deal with Congress for the White House, for President Trump,  what do you think is going to happen?  Will there be a shutdown?  Will they  kick it down the can into January?  </p><p>SHORT:  If there were a shutdown, it would be different the very previous  ones.  This government has already funded all the men and women serving in  uniform.  It has funded all the entitlement checks.  It will keep the parts  of (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>So, the average American wouldn't even recognize the shutdown other than  the fact that it would be a media story, Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait, there's about 30 percent of the government that gets shut  down and I think 30 to 40 percent of the employees.  </p><p>SHORT:  And every time there's been a shutdown, every employee has been  paid back in full.  So I think the average person is not going to feel it  in the immediate future.  </p><p>Having said that, I still think you're going to find a compromise that  comes together before the end of the week.  I think the president has got  to look to find ways to fund this out of military construction dollars.   They'll create a separate problem later, because Democrats object to that.  </p><p>But last year, we secured the first new funding, $1.6 billion for the wall  in ten years.  Democrats come on your show and say we oppose any funding  for the wall.  They've already agreed to it.  It's already 1.6 in this  year.  </p><p>All we're not arguing about is not what they are, it's how much it costs,  and it's a matter of whether they can notified (ph) being at 1.6. </p><p>WALLACE:  That's an old joke.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let's gather here, everybody.  </p><p>So, Julie, shutdown or not?  </p><p>PACE:  I think all signs point to, as Marc says, some kind of compromise.   I think we'll have a tense couple of days.  This is normally how the  pattern of these shutdowns play out, but both Republicans and Democrats  that I talked on Capitol Hill last week have very little interest in a  shutdown.  They have very little interest in staying in Washington for  Christmas which is ultimately what this comes down to a lot of times.  </p><p>I do think that the president might be itching for a shutdown.  But I  ultimately think he will sign on if there is some kind of compromise that  gets some amount of wall funding and he can punt towards the military to  see if that's another option for building the wall.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask about another issue, which is the  president on Friday afternoon named a acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney,  and it's already come out that during the 2016 campaign, during a debate  right after the \"Access Hollywood\" came out, a debate with his Democratic  candidate, this is before he joined the Trump administration as OMB  director, he said this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF:  Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump,  doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact I think he's a  terrible human being.  But the choice on the other side is just as bad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Well --  </p><p>PACE:  Here we are.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do you think that creates problems for Mulvaney?  </p><p>PACE:  I think Mulvaney has been really strategic over the last couple of  years.  He has found a way to work with the president.  He's been very  loyal to the president since he's taken his job as OMB director.  So much  so that Trump keeps trying to give him other jobs in addition to chief of  staff.  </p><p>I do think that it's interesting that Mulvaney is leaving himself an out by  taking on the acting chief of staff role and keeping his job as OMB  director, if this doesn't work out for either side, he's got a fallback  option within the administration.  But Mulvaney kind of falls into a  category like a Lindsey Graham, who was also critical of the president  during the campaign, even after he became the nominee but has found a way  to work with him in office.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Brit, after Nick Ayers turned the president down, the vice  president's chief of staff, and then Chris Christie turned the president  down, he almost had to name somebody, didn't he?  This was getting a little  embarrassing.  </p><p>HUME:  He was like the guy who couldn't get a date for the prom and he  finally got Mulvaney, who was already on board to join in.  But Mulvaney is  a good choice.  He's a very able guy, seasoned and experience, knows the  issues, knows the policies, knows the government.  So -- </p><p>WALLACE:  I'll say something else, he is a happy warrior.  He's a guy who - - he's a positive guy.  He is also a guy who might come on Sunday talk  shows, which John Kelly treated us like the plague.  </p><p>HUME:  He wasn't interested.  </p><p>I would add this.  There's some talk that Trump doesn't need to chief of  staff, he should be his own, that is really nonsense because Trump needs  help from people who really know this town, know its ways, know the  details, know the issues, and he has been at important time, willing to  accept advice from those people to his benefit.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right, panel, we have to take a break here.  But stay right  here.  </p><p>When we come back, as new evidence implicates the president, what are the  chances Democrats will move pursuing impeachment?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Coming up, the president sounds off on the  Mueller investigation, as his former fixer is sentenced to prison. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nobody, except for me, would  be looked at like this. Nobody. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll get our Sunday panel's read on how serious the president's  legal troubles really are, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What he did was all unrelated  to me except for the two campaign finance charges that are not criminal and  shouldn't have been on there. They put that on to embarrass me. They put  those two charges on to embarrass me. </p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I told the truth. I took  responsibility for my actions. And instead of him taking responsibility for  his actions, what does he do? He attacks my family. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: President Trump and his former fixer, Michael Cohen, taking shots  at each other after Cohen received a three-year prison sentence for a  number of crimes, including making hush money payments during the 2016  campaign.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel. </p><p>Julie, there are reports, and we hear these from time to time, the  president is more and more consumed by the special counsel investigation,  especially as former allies like Michael Cohen and the publisher of \"The  National Enquirer\" are providing evidence against him. </p><p>What do you hear your sources? </p><p>JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": So I think it is indisputable that the  president is consumed by these investigations. You really don't need any  secret sources on this. You just need to look at his -- at his Twitter  feed. He is following the twists and turns of this extremely closely. And  as people who are close to him get caught up in this, he gets more  agitated. And I think now we are seeing that almost every aspect of his  life, over the last several years, is now under some level of  investigation. His administration, his campaign, the inauguration, and his  businesses. </p><p>And the business piece of this is, I think, the one that is getting to the  president the most because, yes, being president is part of his identity,  but actually being this successful businessman is almost more important to  him in some ways. It's how he has defined himself for decades. And it's his  children's legacy. They are at the top of this -- at this business. And any  sign that his business could crumble, that past business dealings could be  swept up in this investigation, is incredibly personal to him. </p><p>WALLACE: Marc.</p><p>MARC SHORT, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR: I agree  100 percent with Julie. I think that what's unfortunate here is that you  have what begins as a special prosecutor focus on collusion in Russia. And  as Julie just said, it's about every part of his life. We end up saying,  instead of investigating a crime, we're investigating a person. And  Republicans and civil libertarians used to oppose that motion after Iran  Contra. Then they fell in love with it during the Whitewater years because  they said it was a land deal but it became something about an affair with  an intern. </p><p>And it's a problem. It's a problem where we have prosecutors going all  over. And I think -- </p><p>WALLACE: But how about -- how about the argument that is made, gee, we  didn't hear Republicans complain about it when it happened to Bill Clinton? </p><p>SHORT: I agree 100 percent. I'm saying -- I'm saying Republicans as well  have been hypocritical on this. There used to be a group of strong, civil  libertarians who would recognize the problem of special prosecutors. And --  probably this is now the -- what's been born of that fruit. </p><p>WALLACE: All right, so far the only alleged crime that the president is  specifically linked to is not collusion, is not obstruction of justice, it  involves campaign finance violations, alleged campaign finance violations. </p><p>Here is how Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler, the incoming chair of the  House Judiciary Committee, responded to that this week. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERRY NADLER (D-NY), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, RANKING MEMBER: Well, they  would be impeachable offenses. Whether they are important enough to justify  an impeachment is a different question. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Brit, how persuaded are you that if President Trump directed these  payments, these hush money payments, as Michael Cohen says he did, that it  was a campaign finance violation on his part, a criminal violation? And,  two, what do you think of the likelihood that the House and the wisdom of  the House proceeding to impeachment on campaign finance violation? </p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it's a little hard to  imagine a president being impeached for a campaign finance violation. Most  of these violations are handled as civil matters and result in fines. And  they are, you know, widespread, rampant. Obama had a -- the Obama campaign  had to pay a big fine.</p><p>I don't -- I just don't think the House of Representatives, even such  ardent Democrats as Jerry Nadler, will go there. The greater worry is that  some other charge comes out when Mueller finally gets his ore in with his  report and says whatever he says. And that, I think, Chris, raises an  intriguing question, which is this, how far will these House investigations  go if Mueller doesn't find something very serious about the president? My  thought is, it probably takes the wind out of their sails, but we'll have  to wait and see. But, on balance, I don't think campaign finance is going  to dislodge him. </p><p>WALLACE: When you look at all of this and, you know, as we say, there is  still no hard evidence of collusion, no hard evidence of obstruction of  justice, but the wall do seem to be moving in on the president on a lot of  fronts. </p><p>HUME: Well, I don't think the Mueller report is likely to be -- to sing the  president's praises. But that's not what he needs. What he needs is kind of  an -- of a -- of a report that says, you know does not outline some major  crime. And if that happens, I mean I think it changes the atmosphere  dramatically, both legally and politically, because I think it's -- and if  he is vindicated on no collusion, which is what he's been saying, I don't  think the -- I've never thought that collusion was the central point of  this investigation. </p><p>Remember, when it started, Chris, it was a counterintelligence  investigation with the FBI acting as an intelligence agency to determine  what Russia actually did. And if you go back and look at the letter  authorizing Mueller's appointment, it says -- it mentions that it picks up  that investigation and then says, he's also authorized to find out if there  was collaboration between the two. That was always a subset of the overall  investigation. And if it turns out to be a subset with no crime alleged in  the final report, I think it's a huge boost for the president. </p><p>WALLACE: Juan.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the Democratic  base is so inflamed by Trump, by his behavior overall, I think they -- they  would think that Democrats weren't, in fact, holding up to their  constitutional responsivities if they did not consider impeachment. So you  get the --</p><p>WALLACE: Even on campaign finance violations? </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, what we -- what did we learn this week? He wants to  say it's just Michael Cohen making these outrageous claims because Cohen  wants a better deal from the prosecutors. But, in fat, we hear from David  Packer at \"National Enquirer,\" same thing happened. We hear from \"The Wall  Street Journal,\" the president was in the room. So if -- potentially he  would be an unindicted coconspirator while his president because nobody  thinks you can indict the president. But that doesn't mean that you can't  go to the Congress and say, let's look at this and see -- </p><p>WALLACE: Do you really think that would be wise for Democrats to do? And  this -- this is speculative.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, that's a separate issue. That's a separate issue. </p><p>WALLACE: OK. Well, that's my question, though.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK. Well, if the question was --</p><p>WALLACE: Would it be wise for them to do it if that's all that there is? </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think that's -- no. And I think that what you're  going to see, and you already see this from, by the way, Jerry Nadler, but  also from Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, as the say, they're not interested  right now. But the base of the party, is what I was trying to say to you,  Chris, is going to be putting pressure there because they think that, in  fact, Democrats had been too docile in dealing with Trump and they want --  they want them to come and have the --</p><p>WALLACE: They want blood?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, because, guess what, you've saw a blue wave, 40 seats  switch hands, and the number -- you know, health care was clearly  important. But also a check on Trump was very important to voters. </p><p>WALLACE: And every indication is -- everybody keeps saying this  investigation is going to be over the end of the year. </p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't see it. </p><p>WALLACE: I always say, pick the over, right? </p><p>PACE: Right. We -- we don't know what else Mueller has. I think this could  go well into next year and really line up with some of these congressional  investigation. </p><p>WALLACE: Thank you, panel. </p><p>Up next we sit down with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, head of the Gates  Foundation. In the era of America first, he worries about a shrinking U.S.  role in dealing with global poverty and public health.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest  private charitable fund, giving $46 billion in grants since its founding in  2000 and literally saving millions of lives. The Microsoft co-founder came  to Washington this week to make the case for American leadership and the  need for foreign aid in the era of America first. When we sat down at the  Chamber of Commerce, that's where we began. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER AND PHILANTHROPIST: There was a  recommendation by the executive branch to make fairly substantial cuts U.S.  aid budget. And, fortunately, the Congress took that proposal, which would  have meant cutting people off from those HIV medicines, and they decided to  maintain the foreign aid levels. </p><p>WALLACE: Your wife Melinda recently talked about -- and I want to quote her  directly -- how incredibly disappointing it is to see U.S. leadership  deteriorating and the view of the U.S. deteriorating because of some of the  egregious things that have been said by this current administration. What's  she talking about? </p><p>GATES: I hope I know. The -- I think the particular episode there was  talking about Africa and the conditions in Africa in a -- not in a positive  way. Sort of characterizing the entire continent. But, in any case --</p><p>WALLACE: Your talk about the blank countries? </p><p>GATES: Exactly. In the U.S. engagement in Africa and around the world,  there are many reasons we should maintain that. Just a pure security point  of view alone would justify this level of expenditure. </p><p>Now, for many people, the humanitarian part of it is also there and that  part is dramatic. And so it is disappointing when it feels like the U.S. is  being short-term and the U.S. is only thinking about its interest in a very  narrow way and not being the leader that says, now, we -- you know, we are  going to help these countries get so that they can -- can take care of  themselves. </p><p>WALLACE: The president's mantra is America first. You seem to be suggesting  that in terms of America's interests you've got to look a long way beyond  America first. </p><p>GATES: Well, I think that the broad definition of our interests, including  investing in allies and not viewing every transaction as one that we have  to maximize our benefit, taking, you know, world institutions and have them  just focus on the United States. What we did, in terms of the post-World  War II institutions has been a fantastic thing. That included having a  common view of the future with our western allies. </p><p>If you really follow that line of thinking, the idea of helping Africa, of  working on an HIV vaccine to stop the AIDS crisis, you just wouldn't do it.  And -- and yet I feel, even in that narrow framework of, OK, I only care  about what -- how U.S. citizens do, even in that framework, these  institutions, these alliances, these investments in innovation are  overwhelmingly smart things to do. </p><p>WALLACE: Since the year 2000, a billion people have lifted themselves from  what you define as extreme poverty. And you say that the first wave was in  China and the second wave was in India. Before we get to places where the  wave hasn't hit yet, what happened in those places? </p><p>GATES: One of the first things you want to do in these countries is raise  agricultural productivity. All of the Asian miracles, even going back to  Taiwan and Japan, South Korea, involved more than tripling agricultural  output per person so you could free up that labor and move it into the  cities. And if you had the right infrastructure, educational investment,  then you've got a manufacturing sector of the economy and slowly but surely  you'd get a very large middle class. </p><p>WALLACE: You talk about the successes, the waves in China and India, and  then there's Africa. You say that by 2050, 86 percent -- 86 percent of the  extremely poor people in the world will live in Africa and, in fact, 40  percent will live in just two countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo  and Nigeria. </p><p>What's holding them back? </p><p>GATES: They're starting at very low levels of infrastructure, very low  level of property. And one of the things that drives those numbers you  mentioned is the very high population growth. And so they account for  double the portions of births you'd expect. By the end of the century, the  majority of births in the world will take place in Africa. </p><p>Africa has to demand our attention. That's where extreme poverty is still  tough. That's where stability is difficult to achieve. And, you know, we've  got to go after things like these neglected diseases, malaria. We've got to  help them with infrastructure. It's really, in terms of our humanity of  helping the poorest, Africa's where we'll be most tested. </p><p>WALLACE: How do you even begin to address these concentrations of misery? </p><p>GATES: Well, one of the great achievements in development history was what  was called the green revolution where new varieties of the cereal (ph)  crops, corn, which everyone else calls maize, rice and wheat. In a period  where people thought India would experience mass starvation because the  agricultural output went up, they were actually able to improve the  nutrition even when their population was growing. We need to do that same  thing for Africa. </p><p>WALLACE: It seems that climate change could be the accelerant to all of the  bad things in terms of agricultural productivity, global health,  instability, extreme poverty. Talk about that. </p><p>GATES: Yes. For a country like the U.S., that's northern, you know, climate  change will change things. We'll have more hot days, more forest fires. But  it's not a threat to our survival. </p><p>In Africa, where you are completely dependent on the rain coming, whereas  there been in the past about one out of 12 years you'll have a failed  harvest, the prediction is that we be closer to one out of four years  because of the higher temperature and the -- the -- unfortunately, with  climate change, you -- not only is it hotter, but the rain comes all at  once, or it doesn't come for long periods of time. So if you want to say,  where are you going to get millions of deaths because of climate change  between now and the end of the century, you don't look to the United  States. Yes, you'll have some forest fires and there will be some deaths.  But the -- the significant numbers are in these very, very poor countries  because of the subsistence farming. </p><p>WALLACE: What do you say to those who say it's not climate change, it's  weather, and that the -- the man -- the human component is questionable? </p><p>GATES: That's impressive if somebody can say that out loud. The --the  amount of --</p><p>WALLACE: Have you been -- have you been to Washington? </p><p>GATES: The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is a super measurable thing.  It's important not to over claim what we know because that undermines the  whole discussion., But the general warming and the mechanism of that  warming has to do with CO2 and methane emissions. That's -- that's really  not a question. </p><p>WALLACE: I want to talk to you about toilets. Since 2011, the Gates  Foundation has launched to reinvent the toilet challenge. Explain, one, why  that's so important, and, two, again, dealing with the specifics, what have  been some of your successes and failures along the way? </p><p>GATES: In many of these poor countries, the capital cost of building that  sewer, it's just never going to happen. And so the solution would be to,  instead of using that sewer, to have something in the toilet itself, which  is essentially the processing facility. We have ten different universities  whose designs we funded. So we put in several hundred million dollars. And  now we've gotten it to the point where we have a lot of commercial  companies who say, OK, that approach looks promising. </p><p>Now, the price of this toilet, that does the processing, is still ten times  more expensive. It's about, you know, $10,000 per toilet right now. We need  to get it into these tough parts, the slums of these African cities. We  need it to be more like a thousand dollars. </p><p>WALLACE: I want to ask about your -- your old job. There's something of a  backlash here in Washington against big tech. The growing feeling in  Washington is that big tech does not do enough to protect users' privacy  and that it shows political bias. Do you see merit in either of those  arguments? </p><p>GATES: I went through an episode in the late '90s where Microsoft was  subject to government investigation. </p><p>WALLACE: We remember. </p><p>GATES: And so in a way this is -- in a small way now it's less Microsoft  now, but it's broad. </p><p>Yes, the government should be talking to these companies about what they  do. There's nothing inappropriate. </p><p>I was naive. I didn't have an office in Washington, D.C. I thought that was  a good thing and I even bragged about it. I later came to regret that. </p><p>So these -- I'm sure these guys are learning better than I did that they  need to come back here and start a dialogue. And there will be new types of  regulations for these companies. </p><p>WALLACE: And you don't have a problem with that? I mean you think that's  appropriate?</p><p>GATES: Well, the notion that there will be privacy regulations, that makes  a lot of sense. The notion that this ability to identify anyone that were  going to think about how do businesses get to use that and how does the  government use that, it makes a lot of sense. </p><p>WALLACE: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are right now jockeying for which is  going to be the most highly valued company in the world in terms of market  capitalization. At the close of the market on Friday, Microsoft was number  one at over $800 billion, Apple, $799.5 billion. Does that give you any  pleasure? </p><p>GATES: You know, when I was starting Microsoft in my 20s, the idea that we  could create a company that was -- you know, would beat IBM, you know,  because they were the big monolith and, you know, we understood software  and they didn't. And we believed in these cute, small machines to empower  individuals and they believed in these big machines. It was kind of mythic  that we were going to beat IBM.</p><p>By the time Microsoft valuation passed IBM, which is now, you know, 15  years ago, it didn't feel like that big of a victory. And so you really --  it's really better to define yourself by an aspiration. You know, can  software improve education? Can software help, you know, medical care costs  in the U.S. just keep going up dramatically? Can software play a role  there?.</p><p>So, yes, I'm very proud of Microsoft and the vision that software and  technology would make a big thing. You know, it's led to the most valuable,  the five most valuable companies being these tech companies. So I do think  it's an vindication (ph) of the importance of technology, which now is  coming with a lot of responsibilities as well. </p><p>WALLACE: Bill, it's an honor to talk to you again. </p><p>GATES: Thank you. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: And if you want to learn more about the remarkable work Bill and  Melinda Gates are doing, you can find their link at foxnewssunday.com. </p><p>Up next, a final word. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel for the latest on  a potential end of year government shutdown. </p><p>And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Who in the president's inner circle is next to  fall?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Let me tell you, I never  directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did on his own.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> WALLACE:  What do we know about President Trump's involvement in hush money  payments of two women during the 2016 campaign?  And what does Michael  Cohen's cooperation mean for the special counsel investigation?  We'll ask  the president's lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Then -- </p><p> TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.   I will take the mantle.  I will be the one to shut it down.  I'm not going  to blame you for it.  </p><p> WALLACE:  The president deals with a divided Washington and a possible  government shutdown over his border wall.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  Perhaps he doesn't understand people  leave their paychecks.  </p><p> WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel if we're headed for compromise or  confrontation.  </p><p> Plus -- </p><p> BILL GATES, GATES FOUNDATSION:  The U.S.'s engagement in Africa and around  the world, there are many reasons we should maintain that.  </p><p> WALLACE:  We'll talk with Bill Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation  about what he feels is a shrinking U.S. role in dealing with global poverty  and public health.  </p><p> All right now on \"FOX News Sunday\".</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE:  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.  </p><p> We begin with breaking news.  A federal judge has ruled the entire  Affordable Care Act invalid.  Obamacare will remain in place pending appeal  and both President Trump and Democrats are calling for Congress to pass new  legislation.  We'll get to all that a little later.  </p><p> But first, the president is already dealing with a possible government  shutdown that's now just five days away.  Meanwhile, prosecutors are  producing more of the evidence that led former members of Mr. Trump's inner  circle to plead guilty, evidence that implicates the president.  </p><p> Let's get the latest from Kevin Corke live at the White House -- Kevin.  </p><p> KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, even for an administration  accustomed to seismic shifts in the news cycle, it was without a doubt a  tumultuous week.  But few headlines could prove as potentially damaging to  the Trump White House than those involving former members of the  president's inner circle.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CORKE:  Three of whom are facing time in prison for a variety of misdeeds,  but none involving so-called Russian collusion.  Former national security  adviser, General Michael Flynn, faces sentencing Tuesday for lying to  federal investigators.  The special counsel's office recommending he get no  jail time even as it has faced charges that the general was entrapped and  inappropriately questioned.  </p><p> Meanwhile, in his first televised interview since being sentenced to three  years behind bar, the president's former fixer, attorney Michael Cohen,  claimed he repeatedly lied for Mr. Trump over the years and he would set up  payments to women to help aid his 2016 campaign, a claim strongly denied by  the White House.  </p><p> TRUMP:  I will take the mantle of shutting down and I'm going to shut it  down for border security.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  But we believe you shouldn't shut it  down.</p><p> CORKE:  An Oval Office meeting with leading Democrats this week did little  to quell fears of a potential partial government shutdown over the  president's insistence that there would be funding for a border wall,  something Democrats say they won't pay for.  A work stoppage that could  come in a week in which backers of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare,  consider their next move in the wake of a federal judge's ruling that the  law is unconstitutional.  </p><p> TRUMP:  -- that the Supreme Court upholds, we'll be sitting down with the  Democrats and we will get great health care for our people.  Let's say  repeal and replace.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CORKE:  That ruling by District Court Judge Reed O'Connor, Chris, does not  impact Obamacare recipients in the short term, but it does set up a  potential high court battle and that is a debate White House officials  would love to have -- Chris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thanks.  </p><p> WALLACE:  And joining me now from New York, the president's lead lawyer,  Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p> Mayor, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\".  </p><p> RUDY GUILIANI, LEAD LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you  -- thank you, Chris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's start with Michael Cohen's allegation that President Trump  directed him to commit a criminal campaign finance violation.  Here first  was the president and then Mr. Cohen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I never directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did  on his own.  He's a lawyer.  A lawyer who represents a client is supposed  to do the right thing.  </p><p> MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  He directed me to make the  payments, he directed me to become involved in these matters.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  Question.  Did Mr. Trump direct Michael Cohen to pay off these  two women or not?  </p><p> GIULIANI:  No, the truth is actually what Cohen testified to under oath  before Congress and what he repeated numerous times on surreptitious tape  recordings that he made, which is that the president didn't know about this  until some time into it, he did find out about it and eventually reimburse  him.  But, you know, this is a hard thing to do, but lawyers do this all  the time.  </p><p> But, Chris, even if it were true, it's not a crime.  The payment -- the  payment of money in a situation like this has been covered in the Edwards  case.  Not only the acquittal and hung jury in the Edwards case, but the  fact that the FEC looked at those Edwards violations and determined they  weren't violations --   </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> WALLACE:  I promise we're going to get to that in a minute, but let's get  to the simple fact, question of whether the president directed Cohen --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- to make these --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- payments or not.  </p><p> Cohen says that the president is not to be believed.  Here he is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> COHEN:  The man doesn't tell the truth.  And it's sad that I should take  responsibility for his dirty deeds.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Wow.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor -- Mayor --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  That's some lawyer.  That is some lawyer.  He was the lawyer in  that situation.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> WALLACE:  But does the president tell the truth or not?   </p><p> GIULIANI:  The president is telling the truth, yes.  This man is lying.  </p><p> Now, is that a big surprise to you, that Michael Cohen is lying?  The man  got up in front of the judge and said I was a fiercely loyal to Donald  Trump.  Nonsense he was fiercely loyal to him, he taped him, lied to him,  revealed the tape and did something a lawyer I've never heard ever did --  tape record his own client.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But -- but, sir --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  He sat there with Chris Cuomo, told him he wasn't being taped,  showed him a drawer (ph), and he lied to him and taped him for two hours.   The man is a complete pathological liar that cannot be believed.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But, sir, let's -- let's turn to --   </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> GIULIANI:  And they'll never put him on a witness stand.  They will never - - Chris --   </p><p> WALLACE:  Yes, but let me ask you --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  -- they will never put him on a witness stand.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I understand.  But does the question -- the real question is the  credibility of the president, not the credibility of Michael Cohen --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  No, no --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let me just finish.  The president has changed his story  repeatedly about whether or not he knew about hush money.  Here is what he  said on Air Force One -- the president said on Air Force One this April,  eight months ago.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> REPORTER:  Mr. President, did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy  Daniels?</p><p> TRUMP:  No.  No.  What else?  </p><p> REPORTER:  Then why did Michael Cohen make those if there was no truth to  her allegations?  </p><p> TRUMP:  Well, you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.  Michael is my attorney and  you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.   </p><p> REPORTER:  Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?  </p><p> TRUMP:  No, I don't know.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  The president said he doesn't know anything about any payments,  but in one of those tapes that you're talking about where Cohen  surreptitiously taped the president -- this is back in September of 2016 --  here are the president and Cohen discussing a potential --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> WALLACE:  Let's listen to the tape first.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Sure, sure.  I remember it well.  </p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p> COHEN:  I'm all over that.  And I spoke to Allen about it.  When it comes  time for the financing, which will be --   </p><p> TRUMP:  Wait a sec, what financing?  </p><p> COHEN:  Well, I'll have to pay --  </p><p> TRUMP:  Pay with cash --  </p><p> COHEN:  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  </p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p> WALLACE:  So which is it?  Did the president know about the hush money  payments or not?  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Chris, there's an intervening event that you're not talking  about.  I know this really well because I got criticized for revealing this  when I first came into the case.  Nobody really understood why I was doing  it.  </p><p> When I first came into the case, we went through the whole case.  The  president saw some notes and documents, thought about it, and I went out  and said, no, there was an intervening conversation after the payments took  place and before the revelations you're talking about on Air Force One.</p><p> The president did talk to Cohen or to people in between and they arranged  to reimburse Cohen.  This was after the payment was made, after it was  over, after the campaign was over.</p><p> WALLACE:  But -- but there's --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  They're talking about a conversation, sir, in September of 2016  during the campaign.  The president is clearly aware that David Pecker, the  head of \"National Enquirer\" had paid off Karen McDougal and they're talking  about reimbursing McDougal --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Well, you know, that's --  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- or reimbursing Pecker for that payment.</p><p> GIULIANI:  But there's a -- there's a big difference here.  That was a -  that was a conversation he was asked, middle of the campaign, I was with  him back then in the middle of the campaign, he's working 18 hours a day.   I wasn't able to remember a lot of things that happened in September of  2016.  He was asked it one time.  </p><p> When he sat down with his lawyer and went through it in great detail and  saw things that could refresh his recollection, we immediately corrected  it.</p><p> Nobody pushed us, nobody found it, we found it.  And we corrected it and I  got criticized like crazy for doing it.</p><p> WALLACE:  So you're saying --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  By the time this came out, we all knew --  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- the fact -- I mean, the -- according both to Cohen and to  Pecker, the -- again, he's the head of -- or was the head of National  Enquirer, they say they were in a meeting with Donald Trump --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Chris, Chris, Chris --  </p><p> WALLACE:   -- in the summer of 2016 in which --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p> WALLACE:  -- they discussed the payment to Karen McDougal.</p><p> GIULIANI:  We're talking about something that doesn't matter.  I mean,  whether - whether it happened or didn't happen, it's not illegal.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  You're moving shells around on me.  Either it happened or it  didn't happen.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  But that's what lawyers do all the time.  You argue in the  alternative.  I'm telling it --  </p><p> WALLACE:  But I'm asking you for the truth, sir.</p><p> GIULIANI:  I'm telling you definitively -- well, I -- I want the truth too.   And the truth is, yes, the tape-recorded conversation did take place.  It  exonerates the president.  The president tells Cohen, do it by check.  </p><p> I'm sorry, I prosecuted thousands of crimes, never prosecuted one where  they wanted to hide something, they did it by check.  </p><p> Make sure we pay him back.  They paid him back.  That's what that  conversation's all about.  It exonerates him.</p><p> I'd play that conversation in front of any jury in America and I'd cross- examine Cohen in front of any jury in America.</p><p> WALLACE:  OK, here's what you're telling --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  But I -- but very important; Cohen did not plead guilty to  conspiracy to violate the campaign finance laws.  If they were going to use  him as a witness against anybody, you always make them plea guilty to a  conspiracy so you can fill the conspiracy in.  </p><p> He pled guilty to a singular crime of violating the campaign finance laws.   Not a conspiracy.</p><p> WALLACE:  Yes, but the statement is full of references to individual one  who is Donald Trump.  Here's what you told the --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p> WALLACE:  Here's what you told \"The Daily Beast\" this week.  I want to put  it up on the screen.  </p><p> Nobody got killed.  Nobody got robbed.  This was not a big crime.</p><p> Mayor, what's the threshold between a crime and a big crime?</p><p> GIULIANI:  My statement there was about the prosecutor's view of it, not  mine.  Mr. Swinger (ph) who wrote that, actually corrected that, to say  that that was taken out of context.  My point was, there was no crime.  </p><p> But even if you take the prosecutor's viewpoint, this prosecutor was  appointed -- both of them, right, looking at collusion, no collusion.   Looking at obstruction --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sir, this was the Southern  District of New York.  This is not -- has nothing to do with collusion --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  But now you're --  </p><p> WALLACE:  -- or obstruction of justice, there --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Now, you're - they're part of the Department of Justice -- he's  not being investigated --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I understand it's a separate prosecutor.  I'm sure -- I'm sure  when you were the --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes, this guy -- this guy is going back --  </p><p> WALLACE:  I'm sure - I'm sure when you were the U.S. attorney for the  Southern District --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  And this guy is going back --  </p><p> WALLACE:  You didn't take orders from somebody in Washington who had  nothing to do with the attorney general.  You were your own -- they used to  call it a sovereign district of New York, sir.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  The person -- the person in charge of this investigation, Chris,  is Rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.  He is  the boss of Mueller and he is the boss of the Southern District of New  York.  He's the one that determined, let's move it over here.  He put it  there in the Southern District of New York and keeps supervision of it.</p><p> WALLACE:  I know --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  So don't give me that.</p><p> WALLACE:  But they're not --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  But they're not -- they're not working for --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  There is one Justice Department --- yes they are.  They're  working for the same Rod -- Rod Rosenstein's going to make the decision,  not Mueller, about what to do with this case.</p><p> WALLACE:  Right, and not Mueller.</p><p> GIULIANI:  And this is a witch-hunt.  They are going back now -- they're  going back to 1982, 1983.  They're going through business records.  My  goodness, they went from collusion to obstruction, no evidence -- now  campaign finance, no violation of the law.  </p><p> No matter who's right about what they said, it's no violation of the law.   And now --  </p><p> WALLACE:  The president -- I -- I want to -- I want to move on.  You're --  you're very a effective lawyer, but I've got -- I've got to move on, sir.  </p><p> President Trump --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  You wanted the truth.  That's the truth.  The truth is it's not  a violation of the law.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I want -- I want the truth in a limited amount of time.  </p><p> President Trump talked this week about whether or not General Flynn lied to  the FBI.  Here he is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  They took a general that they said didn't lie, and they convinced  him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal.  And now, they're  recommending no time.  You know why?  Because they're embarrassed that  they've got caught.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Does the president believe Michael Flynn lied or not?</p><p> GIULIANI:  I don't know if Michael Flynn lied or not.  You got two  contradictory things.  You've got the FBI saying at the time that he wasn't  lying.  And then we have no explanation and the guy pleads guilty to lying.  </p><p> So, I -- I mean, I don't know what happened in between.  I do know they  treated Flynn in a way that came very close to --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  I'm asking a simple -- I'm asking a simple question.  And the  reason I ask is I want to put up a tweet from the president a year ago, in  December of 2017, when he says this: I had to fire General Flynn because he  lied to the vice president and the FBI.  He has pled guilty to those lies.</p><p> The president a year ago seemed to know that Flynn has lied.  Now, he's not  so sure.</p><p> GIULIANI:  The president doesn't know that he lied.  The president -- the  president --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  But he -- he knows what you knew at the time.  The man pled  guilty to lying.  He did --  </p><p> WALLACE:  No, he knows -- he knows what -- he knows what Flynn said to his  vice president.</p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes, but that was a lie, but that's not a crime.</p><p> WALLACE:  Well, I understand but I didn't ask if it was a crime, I asked  whether it was a lie.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  Chris -- Chris, you're going all over the place and you're  really confusing people.  Look, first of all --  </p><p> WALLACE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> GIULIANI:  You are -- you are -- you are -- you are -- you are, really --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  I didn't ask if it was a crime.  I asked whether  it was a lie and he told the same lie to the FBI and to the vice president.   And you're quite right, lying to the vice president isn't a lie, it's not  very good -- but lying to the FBI --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  -- is a crime.</p><p> GIULIANI:  Right.  And the more important thing about what the president  knew or didn't know -- because this doesn't involve the president in terms  of him being involved in any kind of conspiracy or anything else -- it's  like if it's reported that one of my assistants when I was a U.S. attorney  lied to the court, how do I know if he did or he didn't?  He knows what he  reads.  The man pled guilty to lying --  </p><p> WALLACE:  OK.  I got -- I got one minute --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  -- so, yes.  He didn't know at the time -- I didn't know at the  time -- I didn't know at the time that the FBI had previously concluded he  was telling the truth.</p><p> WALLACE:  I got a --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  I didn't know he had been deprived of a lawyer.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor, you're confusing people.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GIULIANI:  I'm not confusing people.</p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask you --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  The man was railroaded.</p><p> WALLACE:  -- three last quick questions.</p><p> GIULIANI:  He was railroaded.</p><p> WALLACE:  There are -- there are reports now that the special counsel is  interested again in interviewing the president.  Has his office reached out  to you about sitting down for an in-person interview with the president?</p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes.  There are several unpaid parking tickets that night --  back in 1986, '87 that haven't been explained.  You know, we've got to --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Seriously?</p><p> GIULIANI:  Seriously, unpaid parking tickets --  </p><p> WALLACE:  No, no, no.</p><p> GIULIANI:  It was a movie theater.  He didn't pay the proper fee.</p><p> WALLACE:  Is the special counsel -- does he want to interview the  president?  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes, good luck.  Good luck.  After what they did to Flynn, the  way they trapped him into perjury and no sentence for him, 14 days for  Papadopoulos.  I did better on traffic violations than they did with  Papadopoulos.  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, when you say good luck, you're saying no way, no interview?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GIULIANI:  They're a joke.  Over my dead body, but you know, I could be  dead.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Do they want to speak to the president?</p><p> GIULIANI:  I do have -- I do have other lawyer -- I am disgusted with the  tactics they have used in this case.  What they did to General Flynn should  result in discipline.  They're the ones who are violating the law.  </p><p> They're looking at a non-crime collusion, the other guys are looking at a  non-crime campaign violations, which are not violations.  And they are the  ones who are violating the law, the rules, the ethics and nobody wants to  look at them.  They destroyed Strzok and Page's texts, 19,000 texts.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor --   </p><p> GIULIANI:  If he had destroyed 19,000 texts, they'd put him in jail.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor --  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Even though they can't because he's the president.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Mayor Giuliani.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Yes.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Thank you.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  I got a little --   </p><p> WALLACE:  No, listen, I love it and please come back.  To be continued.  </p><p> Thank you for your time.  Always good to talk to you, sir.  </p><p> GIULIANI:  Thank you.  Thank you. </p><p> WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what a  judge's Obamacare ruling could mean for millions of Americans.  </p><p> Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump saying  he'd be proud to shut down the government over a border wall.  Just go to  Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  A big, big victory by a highly respected judge.  Highly, highly  respected in Texas and on the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we  will get great, great health care for our people.  We'll have to sit down  with the Democrats to do it but I'm sure they want to do it also.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  President Trump praising the ruling from the federal judge  striking down the entire Obamacare law.</p><p> And it's time now for our Sunday group.  Fox News senior political analyst  Brit Hume, columnist for \"The Hill\", Juan Williams, Julie Pace, Washington  bureau chief for \"The Associated Press\" and Marc Short, former director of  legislative affairs for President Trump.  </p><p> Well, Brit, the federal judge said Obamacare is invalid because Congress  has taken out the tax penalty as part of the individual mandate, which is  the way that it passed through the Supreme Court in the first place.  But  we should point out the law stays in effect pending appeal.  </p><p> What do you think of the ruling and how do you think this plays  politically?  </p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, remember, this is a  trial court judge.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Right.</p><p> HUME:  So, this is subject to appeal to appellate court and perhaps on the  Supreme Court.  I think it's an interesting legal argument whether because  of the invalidation of the zeroing out of the penalty was the whole law  therefore is invalid.  I think you can hear good, legal arguments on both  sides of that issue but I think we're nowhere near the last of this and  because the judge did not issue an injunction that shuts it down.  As you  point out, Obamacare will remain in place -- what's left of Obamacare  remains in place for the foreseeable future.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But how does it play politically, given the fact there are  certain parts of Obamacare that people didn't like, like the individual  mandate.  On the other hand, there are lot of parts of it that people did  like pre-existing conditions --  </p><p> HUME:  Right. </p><p> WALLACE:  And that's according to the judge's ruling would be out, too.   </p><p> HUME:  It would be out but it won't be out now and it won't be out soon, in  my judgment.  So, I think the political effect will depend on the actual  practical effect and there is no practical effect for the time being.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Juan, the president and Republicans ran in 2016 on  the idea of repeal and replace Obamacare, which they thought was a good  issue for them.  Democrats won in 2018 on the argument the Republicans want  to take away your pre-existing conditions.  </p><p> So, how do you think this is going to cut, particularly given the fact as  Brit Hume says, it's not going to have a practical effect, it's not going  to take effect for some months, maybe a year as it goes to the courts.  </p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think you can see  already this morning, Republicans are on their heels, not really saying  much about this while you have Nancy Pelosi and potentially incoming  speaker of the house saying Democrats will defend it.  Chris Murphy, the  senator from Connecticut, saying it's a five-alarm fire.  I think clearly  Democrats see themselves in a position where they are on the offensive with  the voters about this.  If you take away Obamacare, you know, after how  many -- 70 votes by Republicans to repeal it, didn't work even with the  Republican majority, Chris.</p><p> It's not only that you would do away with things like pre-existing  conditions, you would drive up premiums for everybody.  Our health care  system would be in chaos.  So, I think that what you get here is  Republicans right now including President Trump, who initially tweeted  great, great, are saying we need a bipartisan collaboration here to make  health care work.  </p><p> That's a different tone from Republicans and I think it's very telling  about who is politically at risk here.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Marc, you're wrinkling your brow.  </p><p> MARC SHORT, FORMER DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Well, I think, look, Republicans won in 2010 and 2014 and 2016 in large  part on a promise to repeal Obamacare and now somehow the media are saying  it's an albatross on Republicans.  It's been a political win for  Republicans.  </p><p> WALLACE:  If you look at the polls, Obamacare has become more popular.  </p><p> SHORT:  And you know why, Chris?  Because the last two years, from 2013 to  2017, premiums went up 105 percent across the country.  In the last year,  they've gone up 5 percent.  They used to be 50 percent of the counties in  the United States had one insurer, and that was it.  That's been fixed.   All counties now have more than one insurer.</p><p> Because this administration has provided more choice for people, they have  actually helped to stabilize the markets.  That doesn't mean forcing people  to buy a product they don't want is a good policy.  </p><p> JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:  But in terms of the fallout from this  ruling potentially, one thing you're definitely not hearing from the  Republicans after this judge's ruling is any interest in going back to the  drawing board and starting from scratch.  If -- ultimately, this move  through the court that Obamacare fully is repealed, you do not have a lot  of Republicans who want to spend 2019 deep in the weeds on health care.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Let me switch, I'll tell you what they're going to spend at the  end of 2018 on.  There is the real threat now of a partial government  shutdown that would start at midnight this Friday.  Here's how that played  out this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,  because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that  have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.  So I will take  the mantle.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  He is taking full responsibility for  the Trump shutdown.  Perhaps he doesn't understand people need their  paychecks.  Maybe that's not the life he leads.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the  president saying that he would be proud to shutdown the government, we got  this on Facebook from Linda Rector.  </p><p> Why is shutting down the government not something to be proud of if it  means protecting the country?  That's exactly what we elected the president  to do. </p><p> Marc, Juan, how do you answer Linda?  And two, as a person who until last  July used to deal with Congress for the White House, for President Trump,  what do you think is going to happen?  Will there be a shutdown?  Will they  kick it down the can into January?  </p><p> SHORT:  If there were a shutdown, it would be different the very previous  ones.  This government has already funded all the men and women serving in  uniform.  It has funded all the entitlement checks.  It will keep the parts  of (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> So, the average American wouldn't even recognize the shutdown other than  the fact that it would be a media story, Chris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Wait, there's about 30 percent of the government that gets shut  down and I think 30 to 40 percent of the employees.  </p><p> SHORT:  And every time there's been a shutdown, every employee has been  paid back in full.  So I think the average person is not going to feel it  in the immediate future.  </p><p> Having said that, I still think you're going to find a compromise that  comes together before the end of the week.  I think the president has got  to look to find ways to fund this out of military construction dollars.   They'll create a separate problem later, because Democrats object to that.  </p><p> But last year, we secured the first new funding, $1.6 billion for the wall  in ten years.  Democrats come on your show and say we oppose any funding  for the wall.  They've already agreed to it.  It's already 1.6 in this  year.  </p><p> All we're not arguing about is not what they are, it's how much it costs,  and it's a matter of whether they can notified (ph) being at 1.6. </p><p> WALLACE:  That's an old joke.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let's gather here, everybody.  </p><p> So, Julie, shutdown or not?  </p><p> PACE:  I think all signs point to, as Marc says, some kind of compromise.   I think we'll have a tense couple of days.  This is normally how the  pattern of these shutdowns play out, but both Republicans and Democrats  that I talked on Capitol Hill last week have very little interest in a  shutdown.  They have very little interest in staying in Washington for  Christmas which is ultimately what this comes down to a lot of times.  </p><p> I do think that the president might be itching for a shutdown.  But I  ultimately think he will sign on if there is some kind of compromise that  gets some amount of wall funding and he can punt towards the military to  see if that's another option for building the wall.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask about another issue, which is the  president on Friday afternoon named a acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney,  and it's already come out that during the 2016 campaign, during a debate  right after the \"Access Hollywood\" came out, a debate with his Democratic  candidate, this is before he joined the Trump administration as OMB  director, he said this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MICK MULVANEY, ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF:  Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump,  doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact I think he's a  terrible human being.  But the choice on the other side is just as bad.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Well --  </p><p> PACE:  Here we are.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Do you think that creates problems for Mulvaney?  </p><p> PACE:  I think Mulvaney has been really strategic over the last couple of  years.  He has found a way to work with the president.  He's been very  loyal to the president since he's taken his job as OMB director.  So much  so that Trump keeps trying to give him other jobs in addition to chief of  staff.  </p><p> I do think that it's interesting that Mulvaney is leaving himself an out by  taking on the acting chief of staff role and keeping his job as OMB  director, if this doesn't work out for either side, he's got a fallback  option within the administration.  But Mulvaney kind of falls into a  category like a Lindsey Graham, who was also critical of the president  during the campaign, even after he became the nominee but has found a way  to work with him in office.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Brit, after Nick Ayers turned the president down, the vice  president's chief of staff, and then Chris Christie turned the president  down, he almost had to name somebody, didn't he?  This was getting a little  embarrassing.  </p><p> HUME:  He was like the guy who couldn't get a date for the prom and he  finally got Mulvaney, who was already on board to join in.  But Mulvaney is  a good choice.  He's a very able guy, seasoned and experience, knows the  issues, knows the policies, knows the government.  So -- </p><p> WALLACE:  I'll say something else, he is a happy warrior.  He's a guy who - - he's a positive guy.  He is also a guy who might come on Sunday talk  shows, which John Kelly treated us like the plague.  </p><p> HUME:  He wasn't interested.  </p><p> I would add this.  There's some talk that Trump doesn't need to chief of  staff, he should be his own, that is really nonsense because Trump needs  help from people who really know this town, know its ways, know the  details, know the issues, and he has been at important time, willing to  accept advice from those people to his benefit.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right, panel, we have to take a break here.  But stay right  here.  </p><p> When we come back, as new evidence implicates the president, what are the  chances Democrats will move pursuing impeachment?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Coming up, the president sounds off on the  Mueller investigation, as his former fixer is sentenced to prison. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nobody, except for me, would  be looked at like this. Nobody. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: We'll get our Sunday panel's read on how serious the president's  legal troubles really are, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What he did was all unrelated  to me except for the two campaign finance charges that are not criminal and  shouldn't have been on there. They put that on to embarrass me. They put  those two charges on to embarrass me. </p><p> MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I told the truth. I took  responsibility for my actions. And instead of him taking responsibility for  his actions, what does he do? He attacks my family. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: President Trump and his former fixer, Michael Cohen, taking shots  at each other after Cohen received a three-year prison sentence for a  number of crimes, including making hush money payments during the 2016  campaign.</p><p> And we're back now with the panel. </p><p> Julie, there are reports, and we hear these from time to time, the  president is more and more consumed by the special counsel investigation,  especially as former allies like Michael Cohen and the publisher of \"The  National Enquirer\" are providing evidence against him. </p><p> What do you hear your sources? </p><p> JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": So I think it is indisputable that the  president is consumed by these investigations. You really don't need any  secret sources on this. You just need to look at his -- at his Twitter  feed. He is following the twists and turns of this extremely closely. And  as people who are close to him get caught up in this, he gets more  agitated. And I think now we are seeing that almost every aspect of his  life, over the last several years, is now under some level of  investigation. His administration, his campaign, the inauguration, and his  businesses. </p><p> And the business piece of this is, I think, the one that is getting to the  president the most because, yes, being president is part of his identity,  but actually being this successful businessman is almost more important to  him in some ways. It's how he has defined himself for decades. And it's his  children's legacy. They are at the top of this -- at this business. And any  sign that his business could crumble, that past business dealings could be  swept up in this investigation, is incredibly personal to him. </p><p> WALLACE: Marc.</p><p> MARC SHORT, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR: I agree  100 percent with Julie. I think that what's unfortunate here is that you  have what begins as a special prosecutor focus on collusion in Russia. And  as Julie just said, it's about every part of his life. We end up saying,  instead of investigating a crime, we're investigating a person. And  Republicans and civil libertarians used to oppose that motion after Iran  Contra. Then they fell in love with it during the Whitewater years because  they said it was a land deal but it became something about an affair with  an intern. </p><p> And it's a problem. It's a problem where we have prosecutors going all  over. And I think -- </p><p> WALLACE: But how about -- how about the argument that is made, gee, we  didn't hear Republicans complain about it when it happened to Bill Clinton? </p><p> SHORT: I agree 100 percent. I'm saying -- I'm saying Republicans as well  have been hypocritical on this. There used to be a group of strong, civil  libertarians who would recognize the problem of special prosecutors. And --  probably this is now the -- what's been born of that fruit. </p><p> WALLACE: All right, so far the only alleged crime that the president is  specifically linked to is not collusion, is not obstruction of justice, it  involves campaign finance violations, alleged campaign finance violations. </p><p> Here is how Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler, the incoming chair of the  House Judiciary Committee, responded to that this week. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JERRY NADLER (D-NY), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, RANKING MEMBER: Well, they  would be impeachable offenses. Whether they are important enough to justify  an impeachment is a different question. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Brit, how persuaded are you that if President Trump directed these  payments, these hush money payments, as Michael Cohen says he did, that it  was a campaign finance violation on his part, a criminal violation? And,  two, what do you think of the likelihood that the House and the wisdom of  the House proceeding to impeachment on campaign finance violation? </p><p> BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it's a little hard to  imagine a president being impeached for a campaign finance violation. Most  of these violations are handled as civil matters and result in fines. And  they are, you know, widespread, rampant. Obama had a -- the Obama campaign  had to pay a big fine.</p><p> I don't -- I just don't think the House of Representatives, even such  ardent Democrats as Jerry Nadler, will go there. The greater worry is that  some other charge comes out when Mueller finally gets his ore in with his  report and says whatever he says. And that, I think, Chris, raises an  intriguing question, which is this, how far will these House investigations  go if Mueller doesn't find something very serious about the president? My  thought is, it probably takes the wind out of their sails, but we'll have  to wait and see. But, on balance, I don't think campaign finance is going  to dislodge him. </p><p> WALLACE: When you look at all of this and, you know, as we say, there is  still no hard evidence of collusion, no hard evidence of obstruction of  justice, but the wall do seem to be moving in on the president on a lot of  fronts. </p><p> HUME: Well, I don't think the Mueller report is likely to be -- to sing the  president's praises. But that's not what he needs. What he needs is kind of  an -- of a -- of a report that says, you know does not outline some major  crime. And if that happens, I mean I think it changes the atmosphere  dramatically, both legally and politically, because I think it's -- and if  he is vindicated on no collusion, which is what he's been saying, I don't  think the -- I've never thought that collusion was the central point of  this investigation. </p><p> Remember, when it started, Chris, it was a counterintelligence  investigation with the FBI acting as an intelligence agency to determine  what Russia actually did. And if you go back and look at the letter  authorizing Mueller's appointment, it says -- it mentions that it picks up  that investigation and then says, he's also authorized to find out if there  was collaboration between the two. That was always a subset of the overall  investigation. And if it turns out to be a subset with no crime alleged in  the final report, I think it's a huge boost for the president. </p><p> WALLACE: Juan.</p><p> JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the Democratic  base is so inflamed by Trump, by his behavior overall, I think they -- they  would think that Democrats weren't, in fact, holding up to their  constitutional responsivities if they did not consider impeachment. So you  get the --</p><p> WALLACE: Even on campaign finance violations? </p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, what we -- what did we learn this week? He wants to  say it's just Michael Cohen making these outrageous claims because Cohen  wants a better deal from the prosecutors. But, in fat, we hear from David  Packer at \"National Enquirer,\" same thing happened. We hear from \"The Wall  Street Journal,\" the president was in the room. So if -- potentially he  would be an unindicted coconspirator while his president because nobody  thinks you can indict the president. But that doesn't mean that you can't  go to the Congress and say, let's look at this and see -- </p><p> WALLACE: Do you really think that would be wise for Democrats to do? And  this -- this is speculative.</p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, that's a separate issue. That's a separate issue. </p><p> WALLACE: OK. Well, that's my question, though.</p><p> WILLIAMS: OK. Well, if the question was --</p><p> WALLACE: Would it be wise for them to do it if that's all that there is? </p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think that's -- no. And I think that what you're  going to see, and you already see this from, by the way, Jerry Nadler, but  also from Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, as the say, they're not interested  right now. But the base of the party, is what I was trying to say to you,  Chris, is going to be putting pressure there because they think that, in  fact, Democrats had been too docile in dealing with Trump and they want --  they want them to come and have the --</p><p> WALLACE: They want blood?</p><p> WILLIAMS: Well, because, guess what, you've saw a blue wave, 40 seats  switch hands, and the number -- you know, health care was clearly  important. But also a check on Trump was very important to voters. </p><p> WALLACE: And every indication is -- everybody keeps saying this  investigation is going to be over the end of the year. </p><p> WILLIAMS: I don't see it. </p><p> WALLACE: I always say, pick the over, right? </p><p> PACE: Right. We -- we don't know what else Mueller has. I think this could  go well into next year and really line up with some of these congressional  investigation. </p><p> WALLACE: Thank you, panel. </p><p> Up next we sit down with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, head of the Gates  Foundation. In the era of America first, he worries about a shrinking U.S.  role in dealing with global poverty and public health.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest  private charitable fund, giving $46 billion in grants since its founding in  2000 and literally saving millions of lives. The Microsoft co-founder came  to Washington this week to make the case for American leadership and the  need for foreign aid in the era of America first. When we sat down at the  Chamber of Commerce, that's where we began. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER AND PHILANTHROPIST: There was a  recommendation by the executive branch to make fairly substantial cuts U.S.  aid budget. And, fortunately, the Congress took that proposal, which would  have meant cutting people off from those HIV medicines, and they decided to  maintain the foreign aid levels. </p><p> WALLACE: Your wife Melinda recently talked about -- and I want to quote her  directly -- how incredibly disappointing it is to see U.S. leadership  deteriorating and the view of the U.S. deteriorating because of some of the  egregious things that have been said by this current administration. What's  she talking about? </p><p> GATES: I hope I know. The -- I think the particular episode there was  talking about Africa and the conditions in Africa in a -- not in a positive  way. Sort of characterizing the entire continent. But, in any case --</p><p> WALLACE: Your talk about the blank countries? </p><p> GATES: Exactly. In the U.S. engagement in Africa and around the world,  there are many reasons we should maintain that. Just a pure security point  of view alone would justify this level of expenditure. </p><p> Now, for many people, the humanitarian part of it is also there and that  part is dramatic. And so it is disappointing when it feels like the U.S. is  being short-term and the U.S. is only thinking about its interest in a very  narrow way and not being the leader that says, now, we -- you know, we are  going to help these countries get so that they can -- can take care of  themselves. </p><p> WALLACE: The president's mantra is America first. You seem to be suggesting  that in terms of America's interests you've got to look a long way beyond  America first. </p><p> GATES: Well, I think that the broad definition of our interests, including  investing in allies and not viewing every transaction as one that we have  to maximize our benefit, taking, you know, world institutions and have them  just focus on the United States. What we did, in terms of the post-World  War II institutions has been a fantastic thing. That included having a  common view of the future with our western allies. </p><p> If you really follow that line of thinking, the idea of helping Africa, of  working on an HIV vaccine to stop the AIDS crisis, you just wouldn't do it.  And -- and yet I feel, even in that narrow framework of, OK, I only care  about what -- how U.S. citizens do, even in that framework, these  institutions, these alliances, these investments in innovation are  overwhelmingly smart things to do. </p><p> WALLACE: Since the year 2000, a billion people have lifted themselves from  what you define as extreme poverty. And you say that the first wave was in  China and the second wave was in India. Before we get to places where the  wave hasn't hit yet, what happened in those places? </p><p> GATES: One of the first things you want to do in these countries is raise  agricultural productivity. All of the Asian miracles, even going back to  Taiwan and Japan, South Korea, involved more than tripling agricultural  output per person so you could free up that labor and move it into the  cities. And if you had the right infrastructure, educational investment,  then you've got a manufacturing sector of the economy and slowly but surely  you'd get a very large middle class. </p><p> WALLACE: You talk about the successes, the waves in China and India, and  then there's Africa. You say that by 2050, 86 percent -- 86 percent of the  extremely poor people in the world will live in Africa and, in fact, 40  percent will live in just two countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo  and Nigeria. </p><p> What's holding them back? </p><p> GATES: They're starting at very low levels of infrastructure, very low  level of property. And one of the things that drives those numbers you  mentioned is the very high population growth. And so they account for  double the portions of births you'd expect. By the end of the century, the  majority of births in the world will take place in Africa. </p><p> Africa has to demand our attention. That's where extreme poverty is still  tough. That's where stability is difficult to achieve. And, you know, we've  got to go after things like these neglected diseases, malaria. We've got to  help them with infrastructure. It's really, in terms of our humanity of  helping the poorest, Africa's where we'll be most tested. </p><p> WALLACE: How do you even begin to address these concentrations of misery? </p><p> GATES: Well, one of the great achievements in development history was what  was called the green revolution where new varieties of the cereal (ph)  crops, corn, which everyone else calls maize, rice and wheat. In a period  where people thought India would experience mass starvation because the  agricultural output went up, they were actually able to improve the  nutrition even when their population was growing. We need to do that same  thing for Africa. </p><p> WALLACE: It seems that climate change could be the accelerant to all of the  bad things in terms of agricultural productivity, global health,  instability, extreme poverty. Talk about that. </p><p> GATES: Yes. For a country like the U.S., that's northern, you know, climate  change will change things. We'll have more hot days, more forest fires. But  it's not a threat to our survival. </p><p> In Africa, where you are completely dependent on the rain coming, whereas  there been in the past about one out of 12 years you'll have a failed  harvest, the prediction is that we be closer to one out of four years  because of the higher temperature and the -- the -- unfortunately, with  climate change, you -- not only is it hotter, but the rain comes all at  once, or it doesn't come for long periods of time. So if you want to say,  where are you going to get millions of deaths because of climate change  between now and the end of the century, you don't look to the United  States. Yes, you'll have some forest fires and there will be some deaths.  But the -- the significant numbers are in these very, very poor countries  because of the subsistence farming. </p><p> WALLACE: What do you say to those who say it's not climate change, it's  weather, and that the -- the man -- the human component is questionable? </p><p> GATES: That's impressive if somebody can say that out loud. The --the  amount of --</p><p> WALLACE: Have you been -- have you been to Washington? </p><p> GATES: The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is a super measurable thing.  It's important not to over claim what we know because that undermines the  whole discussion., But the general warming and the mechanism of that  warming has to do with CO2 and methane emissions. That's -- that's really  not a question. </p><p> WALLACE: I want to talk to you about toilets. Since 2011, the Gates  Foundation has launched to reinvent the toilet challenge. Explain, one, why  that's so important, and, two, again, dealing with the specifics, what have  been some of your successes and failures along the way? </p><p> GATES: In many of these poor countries, the capital cost of building that  sewer, it's just never going to happen. And so the solution would be to,  instead of using that sewer, to have something in the toilet itself, which  is essentially the processing facility. We have ten different universities  whose designs we funded. So we put in several hundred million dollars. And  now we've gotten it to the point where we have a lot of commercial  companies who say, OK, that approach looks promising. </p><p> Now, the price of this toilet, that does the processing, is still ten times  more expensive. It's about, you know, $10,000 per toilet right now. We need  to get it into these tough parts, the slums of these African cities. We  need it to be more like a thousand dollars. </p><p> WALLACE: I want to ask about your -- your old job. There's something of a  backlash here in Washington against big tech. The growing feeling in  Washington is that big tech does not do enough to protect users' privacy  and that it shows political bias. Do you see merit in either of those  arguments? </p><p> GATES: I went through an episode in the late '90s where Microsoft was  subject to government investigation. </p><p> WALLACE: We remember. </p><p> GATES: And so in a way this is -- in a small way now it's less Microsoft  now, but it's broad. </p><p> Yes, the government should be talking to these companies about what they  do. There's nothing inappropriate. </p><p> I was naive. I didn't have an office in Washington, D.C. I thought that was  a good thing and I even bragged about it. I later came to regret that. </p><p> So these -- I'm sure these guys are learning better than I did that they  need to come back here and start a dialogue. And there will be new types of  regulations for these companies. </p><p> WALLACE: And you don't have a problem with that? I mean you think that's  appropriate?</p><p> GATES: Well, the notion that there will be privacy regulations, that makes  a lot of sense. The notion that this ability to identify anyone that were  going to think about how do businesses get to use that and how does the  government use that, it makes a lot of sense. </p><p> WALLACE: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are right now jockeying for which is  going to be the most highly valued company in the world in terms of market  capitalization. At the close of the market on Friday, Microsoft was number  one at over $800 billion, Apple, $799.5 billion. Does that give you any  pleasure? </p><p> GATES: You know, when I was starting Microsoft in my 20s, the idea that we  could create a company that was -- you know, would beat IBM, you know,  because they were the big monolith and, you know, we understood software  and they didn't. And we believed in these cute, small machines to empower  individuals and they believed in these big machines. It was kind of mythic  that we were going to beat IBM.</p><p> By the time Microsoft valuation passed IBM, which is now, you know, 15  years ago, it didn't feel like that big of a victory. And so you really --  it's really better to define yourself by an aspiration. You know, can  software improve education? Can software help, you know, medical care costs  in the U.S. just keep going up dramatically? Can software play a role  there?.</p><p> So, yes, I'm very proud of Microsoft and the vision that software and  technology would make a big thing. You know, it's led to the most valuable,  the five most valuable companies being these tech companies. So I do think  it's an vindication (ph) of the importance of technology, which now is  coming with a lot of responsibilities as well. </p><p> WALLACE: Bill, it's an honor to talk to you again. </p><p> GATES: Thank you. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE: And if you want to learn more about the remarkable work Bill and  Melinda Gates are doing, you can find their link at foxnewssunday.com. </p><p> Up next, a final word. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: Stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel for the latest on  a potential end of year government shutdown. </p><p> And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

A federal judge has ruled the entire Affordable Care Act invalid. Obamacare will remain in place pending appeal and both President Trump and Democrats are calling for Congress to pass new legislation. We'll get to all that a little later.</p><p>But first, the president is already dealing with a possible government shutdown that's now just five days away. Meanwhile, prosecutors are producing more of the evidence that led former members of Mr. Trump's inner circle to plead guilty, evidence that implicates the president.</p><p>Let's get the latest from Kevin Corke live at the White House -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, even for an administration accustomed to seismic shifts in the news cycle, it was without a doubt a tumultuous week. But few headlines could prove as potentially damaging to the Trump White House than those involving former members of the president's inner circle.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE: Three of whom are facing time in prison for a variety of misdeeds, but none involving so-called Russian collusion. Former national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, faces sentencing Tuesday for lying to federal investigators. The special counsel's office recommending he get no jail time even as it has faced charges that the general was entrapped and inappropriately questioned.</p><p>Meanwhile, in his first televised interview since being sentenced to three years behind bar, the president's former fixer, attorney Michael Cohen, claimed he repeatedly lied for Mr. Trump over the years and he would set up payments to women to help aid his 2016 campaign, a claim strongly denied by the White House.</p><p>TRUMP: I will take the mantle of shutting down and I'm going to shut it down for border security.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: But we believe you shouldn't shut it down.</p><p>CORKE: An Oval Office meeting with leading Democrats this week did little to quell fears of a potential partial government shutdown over the president's insistence that there would be funding for a border wall, something Democrats say they won't pay for. A work stoppage that could come in a week in which backers of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, consider their next move in the wake of a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional.</p><p>TRUMP: -- that the Supreme Court upholds, we'll be sitting down with the Democrats and we will get great health care for our people. Let's say repeal and replace.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE: That ruling by District Court Judge Reed O'Connor, Chris, does not impact Obamacare recipients in the short term, but it does set up a potential high court battle and that is a debate White House officials would love to have -- Chris.</p><p>WALLACE: Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thanks.</p><p>WALLACE: And joining me now from New York, the president's lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.</p><p>Mayor, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\".</p><p>RUDY GUILIANI, LEAD LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you -- thank you, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's start with Michael Cohen's allegation that President Trump directed him to commit a criminal campaign finance violation. Here first was the president and then Mr. Cohen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I never directed him to do anything wrong. Whatever he did, he did on his own. He's a lawyer. A lawyer who represents a client is supposed to do the right thing.</p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP: He directed me to make the payments, he directed me to become involved in these matters.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Question. Did Mr. Trump direct Michael Cohen to pay off these two women or not?</p><p>GIULIANI: No, the truth is actually what Cohen testified to under oath before Congress and what he repeated numerous times on surreptitious tape recordings that he made, which is that the president didn't know about this until some time into it, he did find out about it and eventually reimburse him. But, you know, this is a hard thing to do, but lawyers do this all the time.</p><p>But, Chris, even if it were true, it's not a crime. The payment -- the payment of money in a situation like this has been covered in the Edwards case. Not only the acquittal and hung jury in the Edwards case, but the fact that the FEC looked at those Edwards violations and determined they weren't violations --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: I promise we're going to get to that in a minute, but let's get to the simple fact, question of whether the president directed Cohen --</p><p>GIULIANI: No.</p><p>WALLACE: -- to make these --</p><p>GIULIANI: No.</p><p>WALLACE: -- payments or not.</p><p>Cohen says that the president is not to be believed. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COHEN: The man doesn't tell the truth. And it's sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIULIANI: Wow.</p><p>WALLACE: Mayor -- Mayor --</p><p>GIULIANI: That's some lawyer. That is some lawyer. He was the lawyer in that situation.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: But does the president tell the truth or not?</p><p>GIULIANI: The president is telling the truth, yes. This man is lying.</p><p>Now, is that a big surprise to you, that Michael Cohen is lying? The man got up in front of the judge and said I was a fiercely loyal to Donald Trump. Nonsense he was fiercely loyal to him, he taped him, lied to him, revealed the tape and did something a lawyer I've never heard ever did -- tape record his own client.</p><p>WALLACE: But -- but, sir --</p><p>GIULIANI: He sat there with Chris Cuomo, told him he wasn't being taped, showed him a drawer (ph), and he lied to him and taped him for two hours. The man is a complete pathological liar that cannot be believed.</p><p>WALLACE: But, sir, let's -- let's turn to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: And they'll never put him on a witness stand. They will never - - Chris --</p><p>WALLACE: Yes, but let me ask you --</p><p>GIULIANI: -- they will never put him on a witness stand.</p><p>WALLACE: I understand. But does the question -- the real question is the credibility of the president, not the credibility of Michael Cohen --</p><p>GIULIANI: No, no --</p><p>WALLACE: Let me just finish. The president has changed his story repeatedly about whether or not he knew about hush money. Here is what he said on Air Force One -- the president said on Air Force One this April, eight months ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REPORTER: Mr. President, did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?</p><p>TRUMP: No. No. What else?</p><p>REPORTER: Then why did Michael Cohen make those if there was no truth to her allegations?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, you'll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney and you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.</p><p>REPORTER: Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?</p><p>TRUMP: No, I don't know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: The president said he doesn't know anything about any payments, but in one of those tapes that you're talking about where Cohen surreptitiously taped the president -- this is back in September of 2016 -- here are the president and Cohen discussing a potential --</p><p>GIULIANI: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>WALLACE: Let's listen to the tape first.</p><p>GIULIANI: Sure, sure. I remember it well.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>COHEN: I'm all over that. And I spoke to Allen about it. When it comes time for the financing, which will be --</p><p>TRUMP: Wait a sec, what financing?</p><p>COHEN: Well, I'll have to pay --</p><p>TRUMP: Pay with cash --</p><p>COHEN: No. No, no, no, no, no.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: So which is it? Did the president know about the hush money payments or not?</p><p>GIULIANI: Chris, there's an intervening event that you're not talking about. I know this really well because I got criticized for revealing this when I first came into the case. Nobody really understood why I was doing it.</p><p>When I first came into the case, we went through the whole case. The president saw some notes and documents, thought about it, and I went out and said, no, there was an intervening conversation after the payments took place and before the revelations you're talking about on Air Force One.</p><p>The president did talk to Cohen or to people in between and they arranged to reimburse Cohen. This was after the payment was made, after it was over, after the campaign was over.</p><p>WALLACE: But -- but there's --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: They're talking about a conversation, sir, in September of 2016 during the campaign. The president is clearly aware that David Pecker, the head of \"National Enquirer\" had paid off Karen McDougal and they're talking about reimbursing McDougal --</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, you know, that's --</p><p>WALLACE: -- or reimbursing Pecker for that payment.</p><p>GIULIANI: But there's a -- there's a big difference here. That was a - that was a conversation he was asked, middle of the campaign, I was with him back then in the middle of the campaign, he's working 18 hours a day. I wasn't able to remember a lot of things that happened in September of 2016. He was asked it one time.</p><p>When he sat down with his lawyer and went through it in great detail and saw things that could refresh his recollection, we immediately corrected it.</p><p>Nobody pushed us, nobody found it, we found it. And we corrected it and I got criticized like crazy for doing it.</p><p>WALLACE: So you're saying --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: By the time this came out, we all knew --</p><p>WALLACE: -- the fact -- I mean, the -- according both to Cohen and to Pecker, the -- again, he's the head of -- or was the head of National Enquirer, they say they were in a meeting with Donald Trump --</p><p>GIULIANI: Chris, Chris, Chris --</p><p>WALLACE: -- in the summer of 2016 in which --</p><p>GIULIANI: It doesn't matter.</p><p>WALLACE: -- they discussed the payment to Karen McDougal.</p><p>GIULIANI: We're talking about something that doesn't matter. I mean, whether - whether it happened or didn't happen, it's not illegal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: You're moving shells around on me. Either it happened or it didn't happen.</p><p>GIULIANI: But that's what lawyers do all the time. You argue in the alternative. I'm telling it --</p><p>WALLACE: But I'm asking you for the truth, sir.</p><p>GIULIANI: I'm telling you definitively -- well, I -- I want the truth too. And the truth is, yes, the tape-recorded conversation did take place. It exonerates the president. The president tells Cohen, do it by check.</p><p>I'm sorry, I prosecuted thousands of crimes, never prosecuted one where they wanted to hide something, they did it by check.</p><p>Make sure we pay him back. They paid him back. That's what that conversation's all about. It exonerates him.</p><p>I'd play that conversation in front of any jury in America and I'd cross- examine Cohen in front of any jury in America.</p><p>WALLACE: OK, here's what you're telling --</p><p>GIULIANI: But I -- but very important; Cohen did not plead guilty to conspiracy to violate the campaign finance laws. If they were going to use him as a witness against anybody, you always make them plea guilty to a conspiracy so you can fill the conspiracy in.</p><p>He pled guilty to a singular crime of violating the campaign finance laws. Not a conspiracy.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes, but the statement is full of references to individual one who is Donald Trump. Here's what you told the --</p><p>GIULIANI: It doesn't matter.</p><p>WALLACE: Here's what you told \"The Daily Beast\" this week. I want to put it up on the screen.</p><p>Nobody got killed. Nobody got robbed. This was not a big crime.</p><p>Mayor, what's the threshold between a crime and a big crime?</p><p>GIULIANI: My statement there was about the prosecutor's view of it, not mine. Mr. Swinger (ph) who wrote that, actually corrected that, to say that that was taken out of context. My point was, there was no crime.</p><p>But even if you take the prosecutor's viewpoint, this prosecutor was appointed -- both of them, right, looking at collusion, no collusion. Looking at obstruction --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Sir, this was the Southern District of New York. This is not -- has nothing to do with collusion --</p><p>GIULIANI: But now you're --</p><p>WALLACE: -- or obstruction of justice, there --</p><p>GIULIANI: Now, you're - they're part of the Department of Justice -- he's not being investigated --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: I understand it's a separate prosecutor. I'm sure -- I'm sure when you were the --</p><p>GIULIANI: Yes, this guy -- this guy is going back --</p><p>WALLACE: I'm sure - I'm sure when you were the U.S. attorney for the Southern District --</p><p>GIULIANI: And this guy is going back --</p><p>WALLACE: You didn't take orders from somebody in Washington who had nothing to do with the attorney general. You were your own -- they used to call it a sovereign district of New York, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: The person -- the person in charge of this investigation, Chris, is Rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General of the United States. He is the boss of Mueller and he is the boss of the Southern District of New York. He's the one that determined, let's move it over here. He put it there in the Southern District of New York and keeps supervision of it.</p><p>WALLACE: I know --</p><p>GIULIANI: So don't give me that.</p><p>WALLACE: But they're not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: But they're not -- they're not working for --</p><p>GIULIANI: There is one Justice Department --- yes they are. They're working for the same Rod -- Rod Rosenstein's going to make the decision, not Mueller, about what to do with this case.</p><p>WALLACE: Right, and not Mueller.</p><p>GIULIANI: And this is a witch-hunt. They are going back now -- they're going back to 1982, 1983. They're going through business records. My goodness, they went from collusion to obstruction, no evidence -- now campaign finance, no violation of the law.</p><p>No matter who's right about what they said, it's no violation of the law. And now --</p><p>WALLACE: The president -- I -- I want to -- I want to move on. You're -- you're very a effective lawyer, but I've got -- I've got to move on, sir.</p><p>President Trump --</p><p>GIULIANI: You wanted the truth. That's the truth. The truth is it's not a violation of the law.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: I want -- I want the truth in a limited amount of time.</p><p>President Trump talked this week about whether or not General Flynn lied to the FBI. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: They took a general that they said didn't lie, and they convinced him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal. And now, they're recommending no time. You know why? Because they're embarrassed that they've got caught.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Does the president believe Michael Flynn lied or not?</p><p>GIULIANI: I don't know if Michael Flynn lied or not. You got two contradictory things. You've got the FBI saying at the time that he wasn't lying. And then we have no explanation and the guy pleads guilty to lying.</p><p>So, I -- I mean, I don't know what happened in between. I do know they treated Flynn in a way that came very close to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: I'm asking a simple -- I'm asking a simple question. And the reason I ask is I want to put up a tweet from the president a year ago, in December of 2017, when he says this: I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the vice president and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies.</p><p>The president a year ago seemed to know that Flynn has lied. Now, he's not so sure.</p><p>GIULIANI: The president doesn't know that he lied. The president -- the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: But he -- he knows what you knew at the time. The man pled guilty to lying. He did --</p><p>WALLACE: No, he knows -- he knows what -- he knows what Flynn said to his vice president.</p><p>GIULIANI: Yes, but that was a lie, but that's not a crime.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, I understand but I didn't ask if it was a crime, I asked whether it was a lie.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: Chris -- Chris, you're going all over the place and you're really confusing people. Look, first of all --</p><p>WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>GIULIANI: You are -- you are -- you are -- you are -- you are, really --</p><p>WALLACE: Wait a minute. I didn't ask if it was a crime. I asked whether it was a lie and he told the same lie to the FBI and to the vice president. And you're quite right, lying to the vice president isn't a lie, it's not very good -- but lying to the FBI --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: -- is a crime.</p><p>GIULIANI: Right. And the more important thing about what the president knew or didn't know -- because this doesn't involve the president in terms of him being involved in any kind of conspiracy or anything else -- it's like if it's reported that one of my assistants when I was a U.S. attorney lied to the court, how do I know if he did or he didn't? He knows what he reads. The man pled guilty to lying --</p><p>WALLACE: OK. I got -- I got one minute --</p><p>GIULIANI: -- so, yes. He didn't know at the time -- I didn't know at the time -- I didn't know at the time that the FBI had previously concluded he was telling the truth.</p><p>WALLACE: I got a --</p><p>GIULIANI: I didn't know he had been deprived of a lawyer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: Mayor, you're confusing people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GIULIANI: I'm not confusing people.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. Let me ask you --</p><p>GIULIANI: The man was railroaded.</p><p>WALLACE: -- three last quick questions.</p><p>GIULIANI: He was railroaded.</p><p>WALLACE: There are -- there are reports now that the special counsel is interested again in interviewing the president. Has his office reached out to you about sitting down for an in-person interview with the president?</p><p>GIULIANI: Yes. There are several unpaid parking tickets that night -- back in 1986, '87 that haven't been explained. You know, we've got to --</p><p>WALLACE: Seriously?</p><p>GIULIANI: Seriously, unpaid parking tickets --</p><p>WALLACE: No, no, no.</p><p>GIULIANI: It was a movie theater. He didn't pay the proper fee.</p><p>WALLACE: Is the special counsel -- does he want to interview the president?</p><p>GIULIANI: Yes, good luck. Good luck. After what they did to Flynn, the way they trapped him into perjury and no sentence for him, 14 days for Papadopoulos. I did better on traffic violations than they did with Papadopoulos.</p><p>WALLACE: So, when you say good luck, you're saying no way, no interview?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI: They're a joke. Over my dead body, but you know, I could be dead.</p><p>WALLACE: Do they want to speak to the president?</p><p>GIULIANI: I do have -- I do have other lawyer -- I am disgusted with the tactics they have used in this case. What they did to General Flynn should result in discipline. They're the ones who are violating the law.</p><p>They're looking at a non-crime collusion, the other guys are looking at a non-crime campaign violations, which are not violations. And they are the ones who are violating the law, the rules, the ethics and nobody wants to look at them. They destroyed Strzok and Page's texts, 19,000 texts.</p><p>WALLACE: Mayor --</p><p>GIULIANI: If he had destroyed 19,000 texts, they'd put him in jail.</p><p>WALLACE: Mayor --</p><p>GIULIANI: Even though they can't because he's the president.</p><p>WALLACE: Mayor Giuliani.</p><p>GIULIANI: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: Thank you.</p><p>GIULIANI: I got a little --</p><p>WALLACE: No, listen, I love it and please come back. To be continued.</p><p>Thank you for your time. Always good to talk to you, sir.</p><p>GIULIANI: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what a judge's Obamacare ruling could mean for millions of Americans.</p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump saying he'd be proud to shut down the government over a border wall. Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: A big, big victory by a highly respected judge. Highly, highly respected in Texas and on the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we will get great, great health care for our people. We'll have to sit down with the Democrats to do it but I'm sure they want to do it also.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: President Trump praising the ruling from the federal judge striking down the entire Obamacare law.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group. Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume, columnist for \"The Hill\", Juan Williams, Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief for \"The Associated Press\" and Marc Short, former director of legislative affairs for President Trump.</p><p>Well, Brit, the federal judge said Obamacare is invalid because Congress has taken out the tax penalty as part of the individual mandate, which is the way that it passed through the Supreme Court in the first place. But we should point out the law stays in effect pending appeal.</p><p>What do you think of the ruling and how do you think this plays politically?</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, remember, this is a trial court judge.</p><p>WALLACE: Right.</p><p>HUME: So, this is subject to appeal to appellate court and perhaps on the Supreme Court. I think it's an interesting legal argument whether because of the invalidation of the zeroing out of the penalty was the whole law therefore is invalid. I think you can hear good, legal arguments on both sides of that issue but I think we're nowhere near the last of this and because the judge did not issue an injunction that shuts it down. As you point out, Obamacare will remain in place -- what's left of Obamacare remains in place for the foreseeable future.</p><p>WALLACE: But how does it play politically, given the fact there are certain parts of Obamacare that people didn't like, like the individual mandate. On the other hand, there are lot of parts of it that people did like pre-existing conditions --</p><p>HUME: Right.</p><p>WALLACE: And that's according to the judge's ruling would be out, too.</p><p>HUME: It would be out but it won't be out now and it won't be out soon, in my judgment. So, I think the political effect will depend on the actual practical effect and there is no practical effect for the time being.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. Juan, the president and Republicans ran in 2016 on the idea of repeal and replace Obamacare, which they thought was a good issue for them. Democrats won in 2018 on the argument the Republicans want to take away your pre-existing conditions.</p><p>So, how do you think this is going to cut, particularly given the fact as Brit Hume says, it's not going to have a practical effect, it's not going to take effect for some months, maybe a year as it goes to the courts.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think you can see already this morning, Republicans are on their heels, not really saying much about this while you have Nancy Pelosi and potentially incoming speaker of the house saying Democrats will defend it. Chris Murphy, the senator from Connecticut, saying it's a five-alarm fire. I think clearly Democrats see themselves in a position where they are on the offensive with the voters about this. If you take away Obamacare, you know, after how many -- 70 votes by Republicans to repeal it, didn't work even with the Republican majority, Chris.</p><p>It's not only that you would do away with things like pre-existing conditions, you would drive up premiums for everybody. Our health care system would be in chaos. So, I think that what you get here is Republicans right now including President Trump, who initially tweeted great, great, are saying we need a bipartisan collaboration here to make health care work.</p><p>That's a different tone from Republicans and I think it's very telling about who is politically at risk here.</p><p>WALLACE: Marc, you're wrinkling your brow.</p><p>MARC SHORT, FORMER DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I think, look, Republicans won in 2010 and 2014 and 2016 in large part on a promise to repeal Obamacare and now somehow the media are saying it's an albatross on Republicans. It's been a political win for Republicans.</p><p>WALLACE: If you look at the polls, Obamacare has become more popular.</p><p>SHORT: And you know why, Chris? Because the last two years, from 2013 to 2017, premiums went up 105 percent across the country. In the last year, they've gone up 5 percent. They used to be 50 percent of the counties in the United States had one insurer, and that was it. That's been fixed. All counties now have more than one insurer.</p><p>Because this administration has provided more choice for people, they have actually helped to stabilize the markets. That doesn't mean forcing people to buy a product they don't want is a good policy.</p><p>JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: But in terms of the fallout from this ruling potentially, one thing you're definitely not hearing from the Republicans after this judge's ruling is any interest in going back to the drawing board and starting from scratch. If -- ultimately, this move through the court that Obamacare fully is repealed, you do not have a lot of Republicans who want to spend 2019 deep in the weeds on health care.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE: Let me switch, I'll tell you what they're going to spend at the end of 2018 on. There is the real threat now of a partial government shutdown that would start at midnight this Friday. Here's how that played out this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. So I will take the mantle.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA: He is taking full responsibility for the Trump shutdown. Perhaps he doesn't understand people need their paychecks. Maybe that's not the life he leads.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the president saying that he would be proud to shutdown the government, we got this on Facebook from Linda Rector.</p><p>Why is shutting down the government not something to be proud of if it means protecting the country? That's exactly what we elected the president to do.</p><p>Marc, Juan, how do you answer Linda? And two, as a person who until last July used to deal with Congress for the White House, for President Trump, what do you think is going to happen? Will there be a shutdown? Will they kick it down the can into January?</p><p>SHORT: If there were a shutdown, it would be different the very previous ones. This government has already funded all the men and women serving in uniform. It has funded all the entitlement checks. It will keep the parts of (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>So, the average American wouldn't even recognize the shutdown other than the fact that it would be a media story, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE: Wait, there's about 30 percent of the government that gets shut down and I think 30 to 40 percent of the employees.</p><p>SHORT: And every time there's been a shutdown, every employee has been paid back in full. So I think the average person is not going to feel it in the immediate future.</p><p>Having said that, I still think you're going to find a compromise that comes together before the end of the week. I think the president has got to look to find ways to fund this out of military construction dollars. They'll create a separate problem later, because Democrats object to that.</p><p>But last year, we secured the first new funding, $1.6 billion for the wall in ten years. Democrats come on your show and say we oppose any funding for the wall. They've already agreed to it. It's already 1.6 in this year.</p><p>All we're not arguing about is not what they are, it's how much it costs, and it's a matter of whether they can notified (ph) being at 1.6.</p><p>WALLACE: That's an old joke.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE: All right. Let's gather here, everybody.</p><p>So, Julie, shutdown or not?</p><p>PACE: I think all signs point to, as Marc says, some kind of compromise. I think we'll have a tense couple of days. This is normally how the pattern of these shutdowns play out, but both Republicans and Democrats that I talked on Capitol Hill last week have very little interest in a shutdown. They have very little interest in staying in Washington for Christmas which is ultimately what this comes down to a lot of times.</p><p>I do think that the president might be itching for a shutdown. But I ultimately think he will sign on if there is some kind of compromise that gets some amount of wall funding and he can punt towards the military to see if that's another option for building the wall.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. Let me ask about another issue, which is the president on Friday afternoon named a acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and it's already come out that during the 2016 campaign, during a debate right after the \"Access Hollywood\" came out, a debate with his Democratic candidate, this is before he joined the Trump administration as OMB director, he said this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF: Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump, doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact I think he's a terrible human being. But the choice on the other side is just as bad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Well --</p><p>PACE: Here we are.</p><p>WALLACE: Do you think that creates problems for Mulvaney?</p><p>PACE: I think Mulvaney has been really strategic over the last couple of years. He has found a way to work with the president. He's been very loyal to the president since he's taken his job as OMB director. So much so that Trump keeps trying to give him other jobs in addition to chief of staff.</p><p>I do think that it's interesting that Mulvaney is leaving himself an out by taking on the acting chief of staff role and keeping his job as OMB director, if this doesn't work out for either side, he's got a fallback option within the administration. But Mulvaney kind of falls into a category like a Lindsey Graham, who was also critical of the president during the campaign, even after he became the nominee but has found a way to work with him in office.</p><p>WALLACE: Brit, after Nick Ayers turned the president down, the vice president's chief of staff, and then Chris Christie turned the president down, he almost had to name somebody, didn't he? This was getting a little embarrassing.</p><p>HUME: He was like the guy who couldn't get a date for the prom and he finally got Mulvaney, who was already on board to join in. But Mulvaney is a good choice. He's a very able guy, seasoned and experience, knows the issues, knows the policies, knows the government. So --</p><p>WALLACE: I'll say something else, he is a happy warrior. He's a guy who - - he's a positive guy. He is also a guy who might come on Sunday talk shows, which John Kelly treated us like the plague.</p><p>HUME: He wasn't interested.</p><p>I would add this. There's some talk that Trump doesn't need to chief of staff, he should be his own, that is really nonsense because Trump needs help from people who really know this town, know its ways, know the details, know the issues, and he has been at important time, willing to accept advice from those people to his benefit.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, panel, we have to take a break here. But stay right here.</p><p>When we come back, as new evidence implicates the president, what are the chances Democrats will move pursuing impeachment?</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Coming up, the president sounds off on the Mueller investigation, as his former fixer is sentenced to prison.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nobody, except for me, would be looked at like this. Nobody.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll get our Sunday panel's read on how serious the president's legal troubles really are, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What he did was all unrelated to me except for the two campaign finance charges that are not criminal and shouldn't have been on there. They put that on to embarrass me. They put those two charges on to embarrass me.</p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I told the truth. I took responsibility for my actions. And instead of him taking responsibility for his actions, what does he do? He attacks my family.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: President Trump and his former fixer, Michael Cohen, taking shots at each other after Cohen received a three-year prison sentence for a number of crimes, including making hush money payments during the 2016 campaign.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Julie, there are reports, and we hear these from time to time, the president is more and more consumed by the special counsel investigation, especially as former allies like Michael Cohen and the publisher of \"The National Enquirer\" are providing evidence against him.</p><p>What do you hear your sources?</p><p>JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": So I think it is indisputable that the president is consumed by these investigations. You really don't need any secret sources on this. You just need to look at his -- at his Twitter feed. He is following the twists and turns of this extremely closely. And as people who are close to him get caught up in this, he gets more agitated. And I think now we are seeing that almost every aspect of his life, over the last several years, is now under some level of investigation. His administration, his campaign, the inauguration, and his businesses.</p><p>And the business piece of this is, I think, the one that is getting to the president the most because, yes, being president is part of his identity, but actually being this successful businessman is almost more important to him in some ways. It's how he has defined himself for decades. And it's his children's legacy. They are at the top of this -- at this business. And any sign that his business could crumble, that past business dealings could be swept up in this investigation, is incredibly personal to him.</p><p>WALLACE: Marc.</p><p>MARC SHORT, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR: I agree 100 percent with Julie. I think that what's unfortunate here is that you have what begins as a special prosecutor focus on collusion in Russia. And as Julie just said, it's about every part of his life. We end up saying, instead of investigating a crime, we're investigating a person. And Republicans and civil libertarians used to oppose that motion after Iran Contra. Then they fell in love with it during the Whitewater years because they said it was a land deal but it became something about an affair with an intern.</p><p>And it's a problem. It's a problem where we have prosecutors going all over. And I think --</p><p>WALLACE: But how about -- how about the argument that is made, gee, we didn't hear Republicans complain about it when it happened to Bill Clinton?</p><p>SHORT: I agree 100 percent. I'm saying -- I'm saying Republicans as well have been hypocritical on this. There used to be a group of strong, civil libertarians who would recognize the problem of special prosecutors. And -- probably this is now the -- what's been born of that fruit.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, so far the only alleged crime that the president is specifically linked to is not collusion, is not obstruction of justice, it involves campaign finance violations, alleged campaign finance violations.</p><p>Here is how Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler, the incoming chair of the House Judiciary Committee, responded to that this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERRY NADLER (D-NY), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, RANKING MEMBER: Well, they would be impeachable offenses. Whether they are important enough to justify an impeachment is a different question.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Brit, how persuaded are you that if President Trump directed these payments, these hush money payments, as Michael Cohen says he did, that it was a campaign finance violation on his part, a criminal violation? And, two, what do you think of the likelihood that the House and the wisdom of the House proceeding to impeachment on campaign finance violation?</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it's a little hard to imagine a president being impeached for a campaign finance violation. Most of these violations are handled as civil matters and result in fines. And they are, you know, widespread, rampant. Obama had a -- the Obama campaign had to pay a big fine.</p><p>I don't -- I just don't think the House of Representatives, even such ardent Democrats as Jerry Nadler, will go there. The greater worry is that some other charge comes out when Mueller finally gets his ore in with his report and says whatever he says. And that, I think, Chris, raises an intriguing question, which is this, how far will these House investigations go if Mueller doesn't find something very serious about the president? My thought is, it probably takes the wind out of their sails, but we'll have to wait and see. But, on balance, I don't think campaign finance is going to dislodge him.</p><p>WALLACE: When you look at all of this and, you know, as we say, there is still no hard evidence of collusion, no hard evidence of obstruction of justice, but the wall do seem to be moving in on the president on a lot of fronts.</p><p>HUME: Well, I don't think the Mueller report is likely to be -- to sing the president's praises. But that's not what he needs. What he needs is kind of an -- of a -- of a report that says, you know does not outline some major crime. And if that happens, I mean I think it changes the atmosphere dramatically, both legally and politically, because I think it's -- and if he is vindicated on no collusion, which is what he's been saying, I don't think the -- I've never thought that collusion was the central point of this investigation.</p><p>Remember, when it started, Chris, it was a counterintelligence investigation with the FBI acting as an intelligence agency to determine what Russia actually did. And if you go back and look at the letter authorizing Mueller's appointment, it says -- it mentions that it picks up that investigation and then says, he's also authorized to find out if there was collaboration between the two. That was always a subset of the overall investigation. And if it turns out to be a subset with no crime alleged in the final report, I think it's a huge boost for the president.</p><p>WALLACE: Juan.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the Democratic base is so inflamed by Trump, by his behavior overall, I think they -- they would think that Democrats weren't, in fact, holding up to their constitutional responsivities if they did not consider impeachment. So you get the --</p><p>WALLACE: Even on campaign finance violations?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, what we -- what did we learn this week? He wants to say it's just Michael Cohen making these outrageous claims because Cohen wants a better deal from the prosecutors. But, in fat, we hear from David Packer at \"National Enquirer,\" same thing happened. We hear from \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the president was in the room. So if -- potentially he would be an unindicted coconspirator while his president because nobody thinks you can indict the president. But that doesn't mean that you can't go to the Congress and say, let's look at this and see --</p><p>WALLACE: Do you really think that would be wise for Democrats to do? And this -- this is speculative.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, that's a separate issue. That's a separate issue.</p><p>WALLACE: OK. Well, that's my question, though.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK. Well, if the question was --</p><p>WALLACE: Would it be wise for them to do it if that's all that there is?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think that's -- no. And I think that what you're going to see, and you already see this from, by the way, Jerry Nadler, but also from Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, as the say, they're not interested right now. But the base of the party, is what I was trying to say to you, Chris, is going to be putting pressure there because they think that, in fact, Democrats had been too docile in dealing with Trump and they want -- they want them to come and have the --</p><p>WALLACE: They want blood?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, because, guess what, you've saw a blue wave, 40 seats switch hands, and the number -- you know, health care was clearly important. But also a check on Trump was very important to voters.</p><p>WALLACE: And every indication is -- everybody keeps saying this investigation is going to be over the end of the year.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't see it.</p><p>WALLACE: I always say, pick the over, right?</p><p>PACE: Right. We -- we don't know what else Mueller has. I think this could go well into next year and really line up with some of these congressional investigation.</p><p>WALLACE: Thank you, panel.</p><p>Up next we sit down with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, head of the Gates Foundation. In the era of America first, he worries about a shrinking U.S. role in dealing with global poverty and public health.</p><p>WALLACE: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest private charitable fund, giving $46 billion in grants since its founding in 2000 and literally saving millions of lives. The Microsoft co-founder came to Washington this week to make the case for American leadership and the need for foreign aid in the era of America first. When we sat down at the Chamber of Commerce, that's where we began.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER AND PHILANTHROPIST: There was a recommendation by the executive branch to make fairly substantial cuts U.S. aid budget. And, fortunately, the Congress took that proposal, which would have meant cutting people off from those HIV medicines, and they decided to maintain the foreign aid levels.</p><p>WALLACE: Your wife Melinda recently talked about -- and I want to quote her directly -- how incredibly disappointing it is to see U.S. leadership deteriorating and the view of the U.S. deteriorating because of some of the egregious things that have been said by this current administration. What's she talking about?</p><p>GATES: I hope I know. The -- I think the particular episode there was talking about Africa and the conditions in Africa in a -- not in a positive way. Sort of characterizing the entire continent. But, in any case --</p><p>WALLACE: Your talk about the blank countries?</p><p>GATES: Exactly. In the U.S. engagement in Africa and around the world, there are many reasons we should maintain that. Just a pure security point of view alone would justify this level of expenditure.</p><p>Now, for many people, the humanitarian part of it is also there and that part is dramatic. And so it is disappointing when it feels like the U.S. is being short-term and the U.S. is only thinking about its interest in a very narrow way and not being the leader that says, now, we -- you know, we are going to help these countries get so that they can -- can take care of themselves.</p><p>WALLACE: The president's mantra is America first. You seem to be suggesting that in terms of America's interests you've got to look a long way beyond America first.</p><p>GATES: Well, I think that the broad definition of our interests, including investing in allies and not viewing every transaction as one that we have to maximize our benefit, taking, you know, world institutions and have them just focus on the United States. What we did, in terms of the post-World War II institutions has been a fantastic thing. That included having a common view of the future with our western allies.</p><p>If you really follow that line of thinking, the idea of helping Africa, of working on an HIV vaccine to stop the AIDS crisis, you just wouldn't do it. And -- and yet I feel, even in that narrow framework of, OK, I only care about what -- how U.S. citizens do, even in that framework, these institutions, these alliances, these investments in innovation are overwhelmingly smart things to do.</p><p>WALLACE: Since the year 2000, a billion people have lifted themselves from what you define as extreme poverty. And you say that the first wave was in China and the second wave was in India. Before we get to places where the wave hasn't hit yet, what happened in those places?</p><p>GATES: One of the first things you want to do in these countries is raise agricultural productivity. All of the Asian miracles, even going back to Taiwan and Japan, South Korea, involved more than tripling agricultural output per person so you could free up that labor and move it into the cities. And if you had the right infrastructure, educational investment, then you've got a manufacturing sector of the economy and slowly but surely you'd get a very large middle class.</p><p>WALLACE: You talk about the successes, the waves in China and India, and then there's Africa. You say that by 2050, 86 percent -- 86 percent of the extremely poor people in the world will live in Africa and, in fact, 40 percent will live in just two countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria.</p><p>What's holding them back?</p><p>GATES: They're starting at very low levels of infrastructure, very low level of property. And one of the things that drives those numbers you mentioned is the very high population growth. And so they account for double the portions of births you'd expect. By the end of the century, the majority of births in the world will take place in Africa.</p><p>Africa has to demand our attention. That's where extreme poverty is still tough. That's where stability is difficult to achieve. And, you know, we've got to go after things like these neglected diseases, malaria. We've got to help them with infrastructure. It's really, in terms of our humanity of helping the poorest, Africa's where we'll be most tested.</p><p>WALLACE: How do you even begin to address these concentrations of misery?</p><p>GATES: Well, one of the great achievements in development history was what was called the green revolution where new varieties of the cereal (ph) crops, corn, which everyone else calls maize, rice and wheat. In a period where people thought India would experience mass starvation because the agricultural output went up, they were actually able to improve the nutrition even when their population was growing. We need to do that same thing for Africa.</p><p>WALLACE: It seems that climate change could be the accelerant to all of the bad things in terms of agricultural productivity, global health, instability, extreme poverty. Talk about that.</p><p>GATES: Yes. For a country like the U.S., that's northern, you know, climate change will change things. We'll have more hot days, more forest fires. But it's not a threat to our survival.</p><p>In Africa, where you are completely dependent on the rain coming, whereas there been in the past about one out of 12 years you'll have a failed harvest, the prediction is that we be closer to one out of four years because of the higher temperature and the -- the -- unfortunately, with climate change, you -- not only is it hotter, but the rain comes all at once, or it doesn't come for long periods of time. So if you want to say, where are you going to get millions of deaths because of climate change between now and the end of the century, you don't look to the United States. Yes, you'll have some forest fires and there will be some deaths. But the -- the significant numbers are in these very, very poor countries because of the subsistence farming.</p><p>WALLACE: What do you say to those who say it's not climate change, it's weather, and that the -- the man -- the human component is questionable?</p><p>GATES: That's impressive if somebody can say that out loud. The --the amount of --</p><p>WALLACE: Have you been -- have you been to Washington?</p><p>GATES: The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is a super measurable thing. It's important not to over claim what we know because that undermines the whole discussion., But the general warming and the mechanism of that warming has to do with CO2 and methane emissions. That's -- that's really not a question.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to talk to you about toilets. Since 2011, the Gates Foundation has launched to reinvent the toilet challenge. Explain, one, why that's so important, and, two, again, dealing with the specifics, what have been some of your successes and failures along the way?</p><p>GATES: In many of these poor countries, the capital cost of building that sewer, it's just never going to happen. And so the solution would be to, instead of using that sewer, to have something in the toilet itself, which is essentially the processing facility. We have ten different universities whose designs we funded. So we put in several hundred million dollars. And now we've gotten it to the point where we have a lot of commercial companies who say, OK, that approach looks promising.</p><p>Now, the price of this toilet, that does the processing, is still ten times more expensive. It's about, you know, $10,000 per toilet right now. We need to get it into these tough parts, the slums of these African cities. We need it to be more like a thousand dollars.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to ask about your -- your old job. There's something of a backlash here in Washington against big tech. The growing feeling in Washington is that big tech does not do enough to protect users' privacy and that it shows political bias. Do you see merit in either of those arguments?</p><p>GATES: I went through an episode in the late '90s where Microsoft was subject to government investigation.</p><p>WALLACE: We remember.</p><p>GATES: And so in a way this is -- in a small way now it's less Microsoft now, but it's broad.</p><p>Yes, the government should be talking to these companies about what they do. There's nothing inappropriate.</p><p>I was naive. I didn't have an office in Washington, D.C. I thought that was a good thing and I even bragged about it. I later came to regret that.</p><p>So these -- I'm sure these guys are learning better than I did that they need to come back here and start a dialogue. And there will be new types of regulations for these companies.</p><p>WALLACE: And you don't have a problem with that? I mean you think that's appropriate?</p><p>GATES: Well, the notion that there will be privacy regulations, that makes a lot of sense. The notion that this ability to identify anyone that were going to think about how do businesses get to use that and how does the government use that, it makes a lot of sense.</p><p>WALLACE: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are right now jockeying for which is going to be the most highly valued company in the world in terms of market capitalization. At the close of the market on Friday, Microsoft was number one at over $800 billion, Apple, $799.5 billion. Does that give you any pleasure?</p><p>GATES: You know, when I was starting Microsoft in my 20s, the idea that we could create a company that was -- you know, would beat IBM, you know, because they were the big monolith and, you know, we understood software and they didn't. And we believed in these cute, small machines to empower individuals and they believed in these big machines. It was kind of mythic that we were going to beat IBM.</p><p>By the time Microsoft valuation passed IBM, which is now, you know, 15 years ago, it didn't feel like that big of a victory. And so you really -- it's really better to define yourself by an aspiration. You know, can software improve education? Can software help, you know, medical care costs in the U.S. just keep going up dramatically? Can software play a role there?.</p><p>So, yes, I'm very proud of Microsoft and the vision that software and technology would make a big thing. You know, it's led to the most valuable, the five most valuable companies being these tech companies. So I do think it's an vindication (ph) of the importance of technology, which now is coming with a lot of responsibilities as well.</p><p>WALLACE: Bill, it's an honor to talk to you again.</p><p>GATES: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: And if you want to learn more about the remarkable work Bill and Melinda Gates are doing, you can find their link at foxnewssunday.com.</p><p>Up next, a final word.</p><p>WALLACE: Stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel for the latest on a potential end of year government shutdown.</p><p>And that's it for today.

A federal judge has ruled the entire  Affordable Care Act invalid.  Obamacare will remain in place pending appeal  and both President Trump and Democrats are calling for Congress to pass new  legislation.  We'll get to all that a little later.  </p><p>But first, the president is already dealing with a possible government  shutdown that's now just five days away.  Meanwhile, prosecutors are  producing more of the evidence that led former members of Mr. Trump's inner  circle to plead guilty, evidence that implicates the president.  </p><p>Let's get the latest from Kevin Corke live at the White House -- Kevin.  </p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, even for an administration  accustomed to seismic shifts in the news cycle, it was without a doubt a  tumultuous week.  But few headlines could prove as potentially damaging to  the Trump White House than those involving former members of the  president's inner circle.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  Three of whom are facing time in prison for a variety of misdeeds,  but none involving so-called Russian collusion.  Former national security  adviser, General Michael Flynn, faces sentencing Tuesday for lying to  federal investigators.  The special counsel's office recommending he get no  jail time even as it has faced charges that the general was entrapped and  inappropriately questioned.  </p><p>Meanwhile, in his first televised interview since being sentenced to three  years behind bar, the president's former fixer, attorney Michael Cohen,  claimed he repeatedly lied for Mr. Trump over the years and he would set up  payments to women to help aid his 2016 campaign, a claim strongly denied by  the White House.  </p><p>TRUMP:  I will take the mantle of shutting down and I'm going to shut it  down for border security.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  But we believe you shouldn't shut it  down.</p><p>CORKE:  An Oval Office meeting with leading Democrats this week did little  to quell fears of a potential partial government shutdown over the  president's insistence that there would be funding for a border wall,  something Democrats say they won't pay for.  A work stoppage that could  come in a week in which backers of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare,  consider their next move in the wake of a federal judge's ruling that the  law is unconstitutional.  </p><p>TRUMP:  -- that the Supreme Court upholds, we'll be sitting down with the  Democrats and we will get great health care for our people.  Let's say  repeal and replace.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  That ruling by District Court Judge Reed O'Connor, Chris, does not  impact Obamacare recipients in the short term, but it does set up a  potential high court battle and that is a debate White House officials  would love to have -- Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thanks.  </p><p>WALLACE:  And joining me now from New York, the president's lead lawyer,  Rudy Giuliani.  </p><p>Mayor, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\".  </p><p>RUDY GUILIANI, LEAD LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you  -- thank you, Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's start with Michael Cohen's allegation that President Trump  directed him to commit a criminal campaign finance violation.  Here first  was the president and then Mr. Cohen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I never directed him to do anything wrong.  Whatever he did, he did  on his own.  He's a lawyer.  A lawyer who represents a client is supposed  to do the right thing.  </p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER LAWYER, DONALD TRUMP:  He directed me to make the  payments, he directed me to become involved in these matters.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  Question.  Did Mr. Trump direct Michael Cohen to pay off these  two women or not?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No, the truth is actually what Cohen testified to under oath  before Congress and what he repeated numerous times on surreptitious tape  recordings that he made, which is that the president didn't know about this  until some time into it, he did find out about it and eventually reimburse  him.  But, you know, this is a hard thing to do, but lawyers do this all  the time.  </p><p>But, Chris, even if it were true, it's not a crime.  The payment -- the  payment of money in a situation like this has been covered in the Edwards  case.  Not only the acquittal and hung jury in the Edwards case, but the  fact that the FEC looked at those Edwards violations and determined they  weren't violations --   </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>WALLACE:  I promise we're going to get to that in a minute, but let's get  to the simple fact, question of whether the president directed Cohen --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- to make these --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  No.  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- payments or not.  </p><p>Cohen says that the president is not to be believed.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>COHEN:  The man doesn't tell the truth.  And it's sad that I should take  responsibility for his dirty deeds.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Wow.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor -- Mayor --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  That's some lawyer.  That is some lawyer.  He was the lawyer in  that situation.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>WALLACE:  But does the president tell the truth or not?   </p><p>GIULIANI:  The president is telling the truth, yes.  This man is lying.  </p><p>Now, is that a big surprise to you, that Michael Cohen is lying?  The man  got up in front of the judge and said I was a fiercely loyal to Donald  Trump.  Nonsense he was fiercely loyal to him, he taped him, lied to him,  revealed the tape and did something a lawyer I've never heard ever did --  tape record his own client.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But -- but, sir --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  He sat there with Chris Cuomo, told him he wasn't being taped,  showed him a drawer (ph), and he lied to him and taped him for two hours.   The man is a complete pathological liar that cannot be believed.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But, sir, let's -- let's turn to --   </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GIULIANI:  And they'll never put him on a witness stand.  They will never - - Chris --   </p><p>WALLACE:  Yes, but let me ask you --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  -- they will never put him on a witness stand.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I understand.  But does the question -- the real question is the  credibility of the president, not the credibility of Michael Cohen --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  No, no --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let me just finish.  The president has changed his story  repeatedly about whether or not he knew about hush money.  Here is what he  said on Air Force One -- the president said on Air Force One this April,  eight months ago.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>REPORTER:  Mr. President, did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy  Daniels?</p><p>TRUMP:  No.  No.  What else?  </p><p>REPORTER:  Then why did Michael Cohen make those if there was no truth to  her allegations?  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.  Michael is my attorney and  you'll have to ask Michael Cohen.   </p><p>REPORTER:  Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?  </p><p>TRUMP:  No, I don't know.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  The president said he doesn't know anything about any payments,  but in one of those tapes that you're talking about where Cohen  surreptitiously taped the president -- this is back in September of 2016 --  here are the president and Cohen discussing a potential --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>WALLACE:  Let's listen to the tape first.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Sure, sure.  I remember it well.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>COHEN:  I'm all over that.  And I spoke to Allen about it.  When it comes  time for the financing, which will be --   </p><p>TRUMP:  Wait a sec, what financing?  </p><p>COHEN:  Well, I'll have to pay --  </p><p>TRUMP:  Pay with cash --  </p><p>COHEN:  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p>WALLACE:  So which is it?  Did the president know about the hush money  payments or not?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris, there's an intervening event that you're not talking  about.  I know this really well because I got criticized for revealing this  when I first came into the case.  Nobody really understood why I was doing  it.  </p><p>When I first came into the case, we went through the whole case.  The  president saw some notes and documents, thought about it, and I went out  and said, no, there was an intervening conversation after the payments took  place and before the revelations you're talking about on Air Force One.</p><p>The president did talk to Cohen or to people in between and they arranged  to reimburse Cohen.  This was after the payment was made, after it was  over, after the campaign was over.</p><p>WALLACE:  But -- but there's --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  They're talking about a conversation, sir, in September of 2016  during the campaign.  The president is clearly aware that David Pecker, the  head of \"National Enquirer\" had paid off Karen McDougal and they're talking  about reimbursing McDougal --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Well, you know, that's --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- or reimbursing Pecker for that payment.</p><p>GIULIANI:  But there's a -- there's a big difference here.  That was a -  that was a conversation he was asked, middle of the campaign, I was with  him back then in the middle of the campaign, he's working 18 hours a day.   I wasn't able to remember a lot of things that happened in September of  2016.  He was asked it one time.  </p><p>When he sat down with his lawyer and went through it in great detail and  saw things that could refresh his recollection, we immediately corrected  it.</p><p>Nobody pushed us, nobody found it, we found it.  And we corrected it and I  got criticized like crazy for doing it.</p><p>WALLACE:  So you're saying --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  By the time this came out, we all knew --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- the fact -- I mean, the -- according both to Cohen and to  Pecker, the -- again, he's the head of -- or was the head of National  Enquirer, they say they were in a meeting with Donald Trump --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris, Chris, Chris --  </p><p>WALLACE:   -- in the summer of 2016 in which --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- they discussed the payment to Karen McDougal.</p><p>GIULIANI:  We're talking about something that doesn't matter.  I mean,  whether - whether it happened or didn't happen, it's not illegal.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  You're moving shells around on me.  Either it happened or it  didn't happen.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But that's what lawyers do all the time.  You argue in the  alternative.  I'm telling it --  </p><p>WALLACE:  But I'm asking you for the truth, sir.</p><p>GIULIANI:  I'm telling you definitively -- well, I -- I want the truth too.   And the truth is, yes, the tape-recorded conversation did take place.  It  exonerates the president.  The president tells Cohen, do it by check.  </p><p>I'm sorry, I prosecuted thousands of crimes, never prosecuted one where  they wanted to hide something, they did it by check.  </p><p>Make sure we pay him back.  They paid him back.  That's what that  conversation's all about.  It exonerates him.</p><p>I'd play that conversation in front of any jury in America and I'd cross- examine Cohen in front of any jury in America.</p><p>WALLACE:  OK, here's what you're telling --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But I -- but very important; Cohen did not plead guilty to  conspiracy to violate the campaign finance laws.  If they were going to use  him as a witness against anybody, you always make them plea guilty to a  conspiracy so you can fill the conspiracy in.  </p><p>He pled guilty to a singular crime of violating the campaign finance laws.   Not a conspiracy.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yes, but the statement is full of references to individual one  who is Donald Trump.  Here's what you told the --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  It doesn't matter.</p><p>WALLACE:  Here's what you told \"The Daily Beast\" this week.  I want to put  it up on the screen.  </p><p>Nobody got killed.  Nobody got robbed.  This was not a big crime.</p><p>Mayor, what's the threshold between a crime and a big crime?</p><p>GIULIANI:  My statement there was about the prosecutor's view of it, not  mine.  Mr. Swinger (ph) who wrote that, actually corrected that, to say  that that was taken out of context.  My point was, there was no crime.  </p><p>But even if you take the prosecutor's viewpoint, this prosecutor was  appointed -- both of them, right, looking at collusion, no collusion.   Looking at obstruction --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Sir, this was the Southern  District of New York.  This is not -- has nothing to do with collusion --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  But now you're --  </p><p>WALLACE:  -- or obstruction of justice, there --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Now, you're - they're part of the Department of Justice -- he's  not being investigated --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I understand it's a separate prosecutor.  I'm sure -- I'm sure  when you were the --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, this guy -- this guy is going back --  </p><p>WALLACE:  I'm sure - I'm sure when you were the U.S. attorney for the  Southern District --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  And this guy is going back --  </p><p>WALLACE:  You didn't take orders from somebody in Washington who had  nothing to do with the attorney general.  You were your own -- they used to  call it a sovereign district of New York, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  The person -- the person in charge of this investigation, Chris,  is Rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.  He is  the boss of Mueller and he is the boss of the Southern District of New  York.  He's the one that determined, let's move it over here.  He put it  there in the Southern District of New York and keeps supervision of it.</p><p>WALLACE:  I know --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  So don't give me that.</p><p>WALLACE:  But they're not --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  But they're not -- they're not working for --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  There is one Justice Department --- yes they are.  They're  working for the same Rod -- Rod Rosenstein's going to make the decision,  not Mueller, about what to do with this case.</p><p>WALLACE:  Right, and not Mueller.</p><p>GIULIANI:  And this is a witch-hunt.  They are going back now -- they're  going back to 1982, 1983.  They're going through business records.  My  goodness, they went from collusion to obstruction, no evidence -- now  campaign finance, no violation of the law.  </p><p>No matter who's right about what they said, it's no violation of the law.   And now --  </p><p>WALLACE:  The president -- I -- I want to -- I want to move on.  You're --  you're very a effective lawyer, but I've got -- I've got to move on, sir.  </p><p>President Trump --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  You wanted the truth.  That's the truth.  The truth is it's not  a violation of the law.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I want -- I want the truth in a limited amount of time.  </p><p>President Trump talked this week about whether or not General Flynn lied to  the FBI.  Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  They took a general that they said didn't lie, and they convinced  him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal.  And now, they're  recommending no time.  You know why?  Because they're embarrassed that  they've got caught.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Does the president believe Michael Flynn lied or not?</p><p>GIULIANI:  I don't know if Michael Flynn lied or not.  You got two  contradictory things.  You've got the FBI saying at the time that he wasn't  lying.  And then we have no explanation and the guy pleads guilty to lying.  </p><p>So, I -- I mean, I don't know what happened in between.  I do know they  treated Flynn in a way that came very close to --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I'm asking a simple -- I'm asking a simple question.  And the  reason I ask is I want to put up a tweet from the president a year ago, in  December of 2017, when he says this: I had to fire General Flynn because he  lied to the vice president and the FBI.  He has pled guilty to those lies.</p><p>The president a year ago seemed to know that Flynn has lied.  Now, he's not  so sure.</p><p>GIULIANI:  The president doesn't know that he lied.  The president -- the  president --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  But he -- he knows what you knew at the time.  The man pled  guilty to lying.  He did --  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, he knows -- he knows what -- he knows what Flynn said to his  vice president.</p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, but that was a lie, but that's not a crime.</p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I understand but I didn't ask if it was a crime, I asked  whether it was a lie.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  Chris -- Chris, you're going all over the place and you're  really confusing people.  Look, first of all --  </p><p>WALLACE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>GIULIANI:  You are -- you are -- you are -- you are -- you are, really --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  I didn't ask if it was a crime.  I asked whether  it was a lie and he told the same lie to the FBI and to the vice president.   And you're quite right, lying to the vice president isn't a lie, it's not  very good -- but lying to the FBI --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  -- is a crime.</p><p>GIULIANI:  Right.  And the more important thing about what the president  knew or didn't know -- because this doesn't involve the president in terms  of him being involved in any kind of conspiracy or anything else -- it's  like if it's reported that one of my assistants when I was a U.S. attorney  lied to the court, how do I know if he did or he didn't?  He knows what he  reads.  The man pled guilty to lying --  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK.  I got -- I got one minute --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  -- so, yes.  He didn't know at the time -- I didn't know at the  time -- I didn't know at the time that the FBI had previously concluded he  was telling the truth.</p><p>WALLACE:  I got a --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  I didn't know he had been deprived of a lawyer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor, you're confusing people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GIULIANI:  I'm not confusing people.</p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask you --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  The man was railroaded.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- three last quick questions.</p><p>GIULIANI:  He was railroaded.</p><p>WALLACE:  There are -- there are reports now that the special counsel is  interested again in interviewing the president.  Has his office reached out  to you about sitting down for an in-person interview with the president?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes.  There are several unpaid parking tickets that night --  back in 1986, '87 that haven't been explained.  You know, we've got to --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Seriously?</p><p>GIULIANI:  Seriously, unpaid parking tickets --  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, no.</p><p>GIULIANI:  It was a movie theater.  He didn't pay the proper fee.</p><p>WALLACE:  Is the special counsel -- does he want to interview the  president?  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes, good luck.  Good luck.  After what they did to Flynn, the  way they trapped him into perjury and no sentence for him, 14 days for  Papadopoulos.  I did better on traffic violations than they did with  Papadopoulos.  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, when you say good luck, you're saying no way, no interview?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GIULIANI:  They're a joke.  Over my dead body, but you know, I could be  dead.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do they want to speak to the president?</p><p>GIULIANI:  I do have -- I do have other lawyer -- I am disgusted with the  tactics they have used in this case.  What they did to General Flynn should  result in discipline.  They're the ones who are violating the law.  </p><p>They're looking at a non-crime collusion, the other guys are looking at a  non-crime campaign violations, which are not violations.  And they are the  ones who are violating the law, the rules, the ethics and nobody wants to  look at them.  They destroyed Strzok and Page's texts, 19,000 texts.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor --   </p><p>GIULIANI:  If he had destroyed 19,000 texts, they'd put him in jail.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor --  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Even though they can't because he's the president.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Mayor Giuliani.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Yes.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Thank you.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  I got a little --   </p><p>WALLACE:  No, listen, I love it and please come back.  To be continued.  </p><p>Thank you for your time.  Always good to talk to you, sir.  </p><p>GIULIANI:  Thank you.  Thank you. </p><p>WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what a  judge's Obamacare ruling could mean for millions of Americans.  </p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump saying  he'd be proud to shut down the government over a border wall.  Just go to  Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  A big, big victory by a highly respected judge.  Highly, highly  respected in Texas and on the assumption that the Supreme Court upholds, we  will get great, great health care for our people.  We'll have to sit down  with the Democrats to do it but I'm sure they want to do it also.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  President Trump praising the ruling from the federal judge  striking down the entire Obamacare law.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group.  Fox News senior political analyst  Brit Hume, columnist for \"The Hill\", Juan Williams, Julie Pace, Washington  bureau chief for \"The Associated Press\" and Marc Short, former director of  legislative affairs for President Trump.  </p><p>Well, Brit, the federal judge said Obamacare is invalid because Congress  has taken out the tax penalty as part of the individual mandate, which is  the way that it passed through the Supreme Court in the first place.  But  we should point out the law stays in effect pending appeal.  </p><p>What do you think of the ruling and how do you think this plays  politically?  </p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, remember, this is a  trial court judge.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Right.</p><p>HUME:  So, this is subject to appeal to appellate court and perhaps on the  Supreme Court.  I think it's an interesting legal argument whether because  of the invalidation of the zeroing out of the penalty was the whole law  therefore is invalid.  I think you can hear good, legal arguments on both  sides of that issue but I think we're nowhere near the last of this and  because the judge did not issue an injunction that shuts it down.  As you  point out, Obamacare will remain in place -- what's left of Obamacare  remains in place for the foreseeable future.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But how does it play politically, given the fact there are  certain parts of Obamacare that people didn't like, like the individual  mandate.  On the other hand, there are lot of parts of it that people did  like pre-existing conditions --  </p><p>HUME:  Right. </p><p>WALLACE:  And that's according to the judge's ruling would be out, too.   </p><p>HUME:  It would be out but it won't be out now and it won't be out soon, in  my judgment.  So, I think the political effect will depend on the actual  practical effect and there is no practical effect for the time being.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Juan, the president and Republicans ran in 2016 on  the idea of repeal and replace Obamacare, which they thought was a good  issue for them.  Democrats won in 2018 on the argument the Republicans want  to take away your pre-existing conditions.  </p><p>So, how do you think this is going to cut, particularly given the fact as  Brit Hume says, it's not going to have a practical effect, it's not going  to take effect for some months, maybe a year as it goes to the courts.  </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, I think you can see  already this morning, Republicans are on their heels, not really saying  much about this while you have Nancy Pelosi and potentially incoming  speaker of the house saying Democrats will defend it.  Chris Murphy, the  senator from Connecticut, saying it's a five-alarm fire.  I think clearly  Democrats see themselves in a position where they are on the offensive with  the voters about this.  If you take away Obamacare, you know, after how  many -- 70 votes by Republicans to repeal it, didn't work even with the  Republican majority, Chris.</p><p>It's not only that you would do away with things like pre-existing  conditions, you would drive up premiums for everybody.  Our health care  system would be in chaos.  So, I think that what you get here is  Republicans right now including President Trump, who initially tweeted  great, great, are saying we need a bipartisan collaboration here to make  health care work.  </p><p>That's a different tone from Republicans and I think it's very telling  about who is politically at risk here.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Marc, you're wrinkling your brow.  </p><p>MARC SHORT, FORMER DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Well, I think, look, Republicans won in 2010 and 2014 and 2016 in large  part on a promise to repeal Obamacare and now somehow the media are saying  it's an albatross on Republicans.  It's been a political win for  Republicans.  </p><p>WALLACE:  If you look at the polls, Obamacare has become more popular.  </p><p>SHORT:  And you know why, Chris?  Because the last two years, from 2013 to  2017, premiums went up 105 percent across the country.  In the last year,  they've gone up 5 percent.  They used to be 50 percent of the counties in  the United States had one insurer, and that was it.  That's been fixed.   All counties now have more than one insurer.</p><p>Because this administration has provided more choice for people, they have  actually helped to stabilize the markets.  That doesn't mean forcing people  to buy a product they don't want is a good policy.  </p><p>JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:  But in terms of the fallout from this  ruling potentially, one thing you're definitely not hearing from the  Republicans after this judge's ruling is any interest in going back to the  drawing board and starting from scratch.  If -- ultimately, this move  through the court that Obamacare fully is repealed, you do not have a lot  of Republicans who want to spend 2019 deep in the weeds on health care.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Let me switch, I'll tell you what they're going to spend at the  end of 2018 on.  There is the real threat now of a partial government  shutdown that would start at midnight this Friday.  Here's how that played  out this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,  because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that  have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.  So I will take  the mantle.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA:  He is taking full responsibility for  the Trump shutdown.  Perhaps he doesn't understand people need their  paychecks.  Maybe that's not the life he leads.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  We asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the  president saying that he would be proud to shutdown the government, we got  this on Facebook from Linda Rector.  </p><p>Why is shutting down the government not something to be proud of if it  means protecting the country?  That's exactly what we elected the president  to do. </p><p>Marc, Juan, how do you answer Linda?  And two, as a person who until last  July used to deal with Congress for the White House, for President Trump,  what do you think is going to happen?  Will there be a shutdown?  Will they  kick it down the can into January?  </p><p>SHORT:  If there were a shutdown, it would be different the very previous  ones.  This government has already funded all the men and women serving in  uniform.  It has funded all the entitlement checks.  It will keep the parts  of (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>So, the average American wouldn't even recognize the shutdown other than  the fact that it would be a media story, Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait, there's about 30 percent of the government that gets shut  down and I think 30 to 40 percent of the employees.  </p><p>SHORT:  And every time there's been a shutdown, every employee has been  paid back in full.  So I think the average person is not going to feel it  in the immediate future.  </p><p>Having said that, I still think you're going to find a compromise that  comes together before the end of the week.  I think the president has got  to look to find ways to fund this out of military construction dollars.   They'll create a separate problem later, because Democrats object to that.  </p><p>But last year, we secured the first new funding, $1.6 billion for the wall  in ten years.  Democrats come on your show and say we oppose any funding  for the wall.  They've already agreed to it.  It's already 1.6 in this  year.  </p><p>All we're not arguing about is not what they are, it's how much it costs,  and it's a matter of whether they can notified (ph) being at 1.6. </p><p>WALLACE:  That's an old joke.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let's gather here, everybody.  </p><p>So, Julie, shutdown or not?  </p><p>PACE:  I think all signs point to, as Marc says, some kind of compromise.   I think we'll have a tense couple of days.  This is normally how the  pattern of these shutdowns play out, but both Republicans and Democrats  that I talked on Capitol Hill last week have very little interest in a  shutdown.  They have very little interest in staying in Washington for  Christmas which is ultimately what this comes down to a lot of times.  </p><p>I do think that the president might be itching for a shutdown.  But I  ultimately think he will sign on if there is some kind of compromise that  gets some amount of wall funding and he can punt towards the military to  see if that's another option for building the wall.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Let me ask about another issue, which is the  president on Friday afternoon named a acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney,  and it's already come out that during the 2016 campaign, during a debate  right after the \"Access Hollywood\" came out, a debate with his Democratic  candidate, this is before he joined the Trump administration as OMB  director, he said this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF:  Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump,  doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact I think he's a  terrible human being.  But the choice on the other side is just as bad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Well --  </p><p>PACE:  Here we are.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do you think that creates problems for Mulvaney?  </p><p>PACE:  I think Mulvaney has been really strategic over the last couple of  years.  He has found a way to work with the president.  He's been very  loyal to the president since he's taken his job as OMB director.  So much  so that Trump keeps trying to give him other jobs in addition to chief of  staff.  </p><p>I do think that it's interesting that Mulvaney is leaving himself an out by  taking on the acting chief of staff role and keeping his job as OMB  director, if this doesn't work out for either side, he's got a fallback  option within the administration.  But Mulvaney kind of falls into a  category like a Lindsey Graham, who was also critical of the president  during the campaign, even after he became the nominee but has found a way  to work with him in office.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Brit, after Nick Ayers turned the president down, the vice  president's chief of staff, and then Chris Christie turned the president  down, he almost had to name somebody, didn't he?  This was getting a little  embarrassing.  </p><p>HUME:  He was like the guy who couldn't get a date for the prom and he  finally got Mulvaney, who was already on board to join in.  But Mulvaney is  a good choice.  He's a very able guy, seasoned and experience, knows the  issues, knows the policies, knows the government.  So -- </p><p>WALLACE:  I'll say something else, he is a happy warrior.  He's a guy who - - he's a positive guy.  He is also a guy who might come on Sunday talk  shows, which John Kelly treated us like the plague.  </p><p>HUME:  He wasn't interested.  </p><p>I would add this.  There's some talk that Trump doesn't need to chief of  staff, he should be his own, that is really nonsense because Trump needs  help from people who really know this town, know its ways, know the  details, know the issues, and he has been at important time, willing to  accept advice from those people to his benefit.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right, panel, we have to take a break here.  But stay right  here.  </p><p>When we come back, as new evidence implicates the president, what are the  chances Democrats will move pursuing impeachment?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Coming up, the president sounds off on the  Mueller investigation, as his former fixer is sentenced to prison. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nobody, except for me, would  be looked at like this. Nobody. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll get our Sunday panel's read on how serious the president's  legal troubles really are, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What he did was all unrelated  to me except for the two campaign finance charges that are not criminal and  shouldn't have been on there. They put that on to embarrass me. They put  those two charges on to embarrass me. </p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I told the truth. I took  responsibility for my actions. And instead of him taking responsibility for  his actions, what does he do? He attacks my family. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: President Trump and his former fixer, Michael Cohen, taking shots  at each other after Cohen received a three-year prison sentence for a  number of crimes, including making hush money payments during the 2016  campaign.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel. </p><p>Julie, there are reports, and we hear these from time to time, the  president is more and more consumed by the special counsel investigation,  especially as former allies like Michael Cohen and the publisher of \"The  National Enquirer\" are providing evidence against him. </p><p>What do you hear your sources? </p><p>JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": So I think it is indisputable that the  president is consumed by these investigations. You really don't need any  secret sources on this. You just need to look at his -- at his Twitter  feed. He is following the twists and turns of this extremely closely. And  as people who are close to him get caught up in this, he gets more  agitated. And I think now we are seeing that almost every aspect of his  life, over the last several years, is now under some level of  investigation. His administration, his campaign, the inauguration, and his  businesses. </p><p>And the business piece of this is, I think, the one that is getting to the  president the most because, yes, being president is part of his identity,  but actually being this successful businessman is almost more important to  him in some ways. It's how he has defined himself for decades. And it's his  children's legacy. They are at the top of this -- at this business. And any  sign that his business could crumble, that past business dealings could be  swept up in this investigation, is incredibly personal to him. </p><p>WALLACE: Marc.</p><p>MARC SHORT, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR: I agree  100 percent with Julie. I think that what's unfortunate here is that you  have what begins as a special prosecutor focus on collusion in Russia. And  as Julie just said, it's about every part of his life. We end up saying,  instead of investigating a crime, we're investigating a person. And  Republicans and civil libertarians used to oppose that motion after Iran  Contra. Then they fell in love with it during the Whitewater years because  they said it was a land deal but it became something about an affair with  an intern. </p><p>And it's a problem. It's a problem where we have prosecutors going all  over. And I think -- </p><p>WALLACE: But how about -- how about the argument that is made, gee, we  didn't hear Republicans complain about it when it happened to Bill Clinton? </p><p>SHORT: I agree 100 percent. I'm saying -- I'm saying Republicans as well  have been hypocritical on this. There used to be a group of strong, civil  libertarians who would recognize the problem of special prosecutors. And --  probably this is now the -- what's been born of that fruit. </p><p>WALLACE: All right, so far the only alleged crime that the president is  specifically linked to is not collusion, is not obstruction of justice, it  involves campaign finance violations, alleged campaign finance violations. </p><p>Here is how Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler, the incoming chair of the  House Judiciary Committee, responded to that this week. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERRY NADLER (D-NY), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, RANKING MEMBER: Well, they  would be impeachable offenses. Whether they are important enough to justify  an impeachment is a different question. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Brit, how persuaded are you that if President Trump directed these  payments, these hush money payments, as Michael Cohen says he did, that it  was a campaign finance violation on his part, a criminal violation? And,  two, what do you think of the likelihood that the House and the wisdom of  the House proceeding to impeachment on campaign finance violation? </p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it's a little hard to  imagine a president being impeached for a campaign finance violation. Most  of these violations are handled as civil matters and result in fines. And  they are, you know, widespread, rampant. Obama had a -- the Obama campaign  had to pay a big fine.</p><p>I don't -- I just don't think the House of Representatives, even such  ardent Democrats as Jerry Nadler, will go there. The greater worry is that  some other charge comes out when Mueller finally gets his ore in with his  report and says whatever he says. And that, I think, Chris, raises an  intriguing question, which is this, how far will these House investigations  go if Mueller doesn't find something very serious about the president? My  thought is, it probably takes the wind out of their sails, but we'll have  to wait and see. But, on balance, I don't think campaign finance is going  to dislodge him. </p><p>WALLACE: When you look at all of this and, you know, as we say, there is  still no hard evidence of collusion, no hard evidence of obstruction of  justice, but the wall do seem to be moving in on the president on a lot of  fronts. </p><p>HUME: Well, I don't think the Mueller report is likely to be -- to sing the  president's praises. But that's not what he needs. What he needs is kind of  an -- of a -- of a report that says, you know does not outline some major  crime. And if that happens, I mean I think it changes the atmosphere  dramatically, both legally and politically, because I think it's -- and if  he is vindicated on no collusion, which is what he's been saying, I don't  think the -- I've never thought that collusion was the central point of  this investigation. </p><p>Remember, when it started, Chris, it was a counterintelligence  investigation with the FBI acting as an intelligence agency to determine  what Russia actually did. And if you go back and look at the letter  authorizing Mueller's appointment, it says -- it mentions that it picks up  that investigation and then says, he's also authorized to find out if there  was collaboration between the two. That was always a subset of the overall  investigation. And if it turns out to be a subset with no crime alleged in  the final report, I think it's a huge boost for the president. </p><p>WALLACE: Juan.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the Democratic  base is so inflamed by Trump, by his behavior overall, I think they -- they  would think that Democrats weren't, in fact, holding up to their  constitutional responsivities if they did not consider impeachment. So you  get the --</p><p>WALLACE: Even on campaign finance violations? </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, what we -- what did we learn this week? He wants to  say it's just Michael Cohen making these outrageous claims because Cohen  wants a better deal from the prosecutors. But, in fat, we hear from David  Packer at \"National Enquirer,\" same thing happened. We hear from \"The Wall  Street Journal,\" the president was in the room. So if -- potentially he  would be an unindicted coconspirator while his president because nobody  thinks you can indict the president. But that doesn't mean that you can't  go to the Congress and say, let's look at this and see -- </p><p>WALLACE: Do you really think that would be wise for Democrats to do? And  this -- this is speculative.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, that's a separate issue. That's a separate issue. </p><p>WALLACE: OK. Well, that's my question, though.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK. Well, if the question was --</p><p>WALLACE: Would it be wise for them to do it if that's all that there is? </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think that's -- no. And I think that what you're  going to see, and you already see this from, by the way, Jerry Nadler, but  also from Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, as the say, they're not interested  right now. But the base of the party, is what I was trying to say to you,  Chris, is going to be putting pressure there because they think that, in  fact, Democrats had been too docile in dealing with Trump and they want --  they want them to come and have the --</p><p>WALLACE: They want blood?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, because, guess what, you've saw a blue wave, 40 seats  switch hands, and the number -- you know, health care was clearly  important. But also a check on Trump was very important to voters. </p><p>WALLACE: And every indication is -- everybody keeps saying this  investigation is going to be over the end of the year. </p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't see it. </p><p>WALLACE: I always say, pick the over, right? </p><p>PACE: Right. We -- we don't know what else Mueller has. I think this could  go well into next year and really line up with some of these congressional  investigation. </p><p>WALLACE: Thank you, panel. </p><p>Up next we sit down with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, head of the Gates  Foundation. In the era of America first, he worries about a shrinking U.S.  role in dealing with global poverty and public health.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest  private charitable fund, giving $46 billion in grants since its founding in  2000 and literally saving millions of lives. The Microsoft co-founder came  to Washington this week to make the case for American leadership and the  need for foreign aid in the era of America first. When we sat down at the  Chamber of Commerce, that's where we began. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL GATES, MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER AND PHILANTHROPIST: There was a  recommendation by the executive branch to make fairly substantial cuts U.S.  aid budget. And, fortunately, the Congress took that proposal, which would  have meant cutting people off from those HIV medicines, and they decided to  maintain the foreign aid levels. </p><p>WALLACE: Your wife Melinda recently talked about -- and I want to quote her  directly -- how incredibly disappointing it is to see U.S. leadership  deteriorating and the view of the U.S. deteriorating because of some of the  egregious things that have been said by this current administration. What's  she talking about? </p><p>GATES: I hope I know. The -- I think the particular episode there was  talking about Africa and the conditions in Africa in a -- not in a positive  way. Sort of characterizing the entire continent. But, in any case --</p><p>WALLACE: Your talk about the blank countries? </p><p>GATES: Exactly. In the U.S. engagement in Africa and around the world,  there are many reasons we should maintain that. Just a pure security point  of view alone would justify this level of expenditure. </p><p>Now, for many people, the humanitarian part of it is also there and that  part is dramatic. And so it is disappointing when it feels like the U.S. is  being short-term and the U.S. is only thinking about its interest in a very  narrow way and not being the leader that says, now, we -- you know, we are  going to help these countries get so that they can -- can take care of  themselves. </p><p>WALLACE: The president's mantra is America first. You seem to be suggesting  that in terms of America's interests you've got to look a long way beyond  America first. </p><p>GATES: Well, I think that the broad definition of our interests, including  investing in allies and not viewing every transaction as one that we have  to maximize our benefit, taking, you know, world institutions and have them  just focus on the United States. What we did, in terms of the post-World  War II institutions has been a fantastic thing. That included having a  common view of the future with our western allies. </p><p>If you really follow that line of thinking, the idea of helping Africa, of  working on an HIV vaccine to stop the AIDS crisis, you just wouldn't do it.  And -- and yet I feel, even in that narrow framework of, OK, I only care  about what -- how U.S. citizens do, even in that framework, these  institutions, these alliances, these investments in innovation are  overwhelmingly smart things to do. </p><p>WALLACE: Since the year 2000, a billion people have lifted themselves from  what you define as extreme poverty. And you say that the first wave was in  China and the second wave was in India. Before we get to places where the  wave hasn't hit yet, what happened in those places? </p><p>GATES: One of the first things you want to do in these countries is raise  agricultural productivity. All of the Asian miracles, even going back to  Taiwan and Japan, South Korea, involved more than tripling agricultural  output per person so you could free up that labor and move it into the  cities. And if you had the right infrastructure, educational investment,  then you've got a manufacturing sector of the economy and slowly but surely  you'd get a very large middle class. </p><p>WALLACE: You talk about the successes, the waves in China and India, and  then there's Africa. You say that by 2050, 86 percent -- 86 percent of the  extremely poor people in the world will live in Africa and, in fact, 40  percent will live in just two countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo  and Nigeria. </p><p>What's holding them back? </p><p>GATES: They're starting at very low levels of infrastructure, very low  level of property. And one of the things that drives those numbers you  mentioned is the very high population growth. And so they account for  double the portions of births you'd expect. By the end of the century, the  majority of births in the world will take place in Africa. </p><p>Africa has to demand our attention. That's where extreme poverty is still  tough. That's where stability is difficult to achieve. And, you know, we've  got to go after things like these neglected diseases, malaria. We've got to  help them with infrastructure. It's really, in terms of our humanity of  helping the poorest, Africa's where we'll be most tested. </p><p>WALLACE: How do you even begin to address these concentrations of misery? </p><p>GATES: Well, one of the great achievements in development history was what  was called the green revolution where new varieties of the cereal (ph)  crops, corn, which everyone else calls maize, rice and wheat. In a period  where people thought India would experience mass starvation because the  agricultural output went up, they were actually able to improve the  nutrition even when their population was growing. We need to do that same  thing for Africa. </p><p>WALLACE: It seems that climate change could be the accelerant to all of the  bad things in terms of agricultural productivity, global health,  instability, extreme poverty. Talk about that. </p><p>GATES: Yes. For a country like the U.S., that's northern, you know, climate  change will change things. We'll have more hot days, more forest fires. But  it's not a threat to our survival. </p><p>In Africa, where you are completely dependent on the rain coming, whereas  there been in the past about one out of 12 years you'll have a failed  harvest, the prediction is that we be closer to one out of four years  because of the higher temperature and the -- the -- unfortunately, with  climate change, you -- not only is it hotter, but the rain comes all at  once, or it doesn't come for long periods of time. So if you want to say,  where are you going to get millions of deaths because of climate change  between now and the end of the century, you don't look to the United  States. Yes, you'll have some forest fires and there will be some deaths.  But the -- the significant numbers are in these very, very poor countries  because of the subsistence farming. </p><p>WALLACE: What do you say to those who say it's not climate change, it's  weather, and that the -- the man -- the human component is questionable? </p><p>GATES: That's impressive if somebody can say that out loud. The --the  amount of --</p><p>WALLACE: Have you been -- have you been to Washington? </p><p>GATES: The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is a super measurable thing.  It's important not to over claim what we know because that undermines the  whole discussion., But the general warming and the mechanism of that  warming has to do with CO2 and methane emissions. That's -- that's really  not a question. </p><p>WALLACE: I want to talk to you about toilets. Since 2011, the Gates  Foundation has launched to reinvent the toilet challenge. Explain, one, why  that's so important, and, two, again, dealing with the specifics, what have  been some of your successes and failures along the way? </p><p>GATES: In many of these poor countries, the capital cost of building that  sewer, it's just never going to happen. And so the solution would be to,  instead of using that sewer, to have something in the toilet itself, which  is essentially the processing facility. We have ten different universities  whose designs we funded. So we put in several hundred million dollars. And  now we've gotten it to the point where we have a lot of commercial  companies who say, OK, that approach looks promising. </p><p>Now, the price of this toilet, that does the processing, is still ten times  more expensive. It's about, you know, $10,000 per toilet right now. We need  to get it into these tough parts, the slums of these African cities. We  need it to be more like a thousand dollars. </p><p>WALLACE: I want to ask about your -- your old job. There's something of a  backlash here in Washington against big tech. The growing feeling in  Washington is that big tech does not do enough to protect users' privacy  and that it shows political bias. Do you see merit in either of those  arguments? </p><p>GATES: I went through an episode in the late '90s where Microsoft was  subject to government investigation. </p><p>WALLACE: We remember. </p><p>GATES: And so in a way this is -- in a small way now it's less Microsoft  now, but it's broad. </p><p>Yes, the government should be talking to these companies about what they  do. There's nothing inappropriate. </p><p>I was naive. I didn't have an office in Washington, D.C. I thought that was  a good thing and I even bragged about it. I later came to regret that. </p><p>So these -- I'm sure these guys are learning better than I did that they  need to come back here and start a dialogue. And there will be new types of  regulations for these companies. </p><p>WALLACE: And you don't have a problem with that? I mean you think that's  appropriate?</p><p>GATES: Well, the notion that there will be privacy regulations, that makes  a lot of sense. The notion that this ability to identify anyone that were  going to think about how do businesses get to use that and how does the  government use that, it makes a lot of sense. </p><p>WALLACE: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are right now jockeying for which is  going to be the most highly valued company in the world in terms of market  capitalization. At the close of the market on Friday, Microsoft was number  one at over $800 billion, Apple, $799.5 billion. Does that give you any  pleasure? </p><p>GATES: You know, when I was starting Microsoft in my 20s, the idea that we  could create a company that was -- you know, would beat IBM, you know,  because they were the big monolith and, you know, we understood software  and they didn't. And we believed in these cute, small machines to empower  individuals and they believed in these big machines. It was kind of mythic  that we were going to beat IBM.</p><p>By the time Microsoft valuation passed IBM, which is now, you know, 15  years ago, it didn't feel like that big of a victory. And so you really --  it's really better to define yourself by an aspiration. You know, can  software improve education? Can software help, you know, medical care costs  in the U.S. just keep going up dramatically? Can software play a role  there?.</p><p>So, yes, I'm very proud of Microsoft and the vision that software and  technology would make a big thing. You know, it's led to the most valuable,  the five most valuable companies being these tech companies. So I do think  it's an vindication (ph) of the importance of technology, which now is  coming with a lot of responsibilities as well. </p><p>WALLACE: Bill, it's an honor to talk to you again. </p><p>GATES: Thank you. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: And if you want to learn more about the remarkable work Bill and  Melinda Gates are doing, you can find their link at foxnewssunday.com. </p><p>Up next, a final word. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel for the latest on  a potential end of year government shutdown. </p><p>And that's it for today.
